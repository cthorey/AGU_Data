            "abstract": "A strong positive correlation between the concentration of silver (Ag) and Ba/Al ratios in continental slope surface sediments from Eastern Pacific Ocean led to the hypothesis that Ag, like Ba, accumulates in settling organic-rich particles, and that Ag might be useful as a paleoproductivity proxy (McKay and Pedersen, 2008). To test this hypothesis Ag concentrations were measured for sediment trap and surface sediment samples from the Equatorial Pacific, Western Arabian Sea, and Oregon Margin. These data were then compared to the concentrations and fluxes of various productivity proxies (organic carbon, biogenic opal, Ba/Al). Sediment trap data show that in highly productive regions, both coastal and open ocean, the flux of Ag increases with water depth down to ~3000 m; however, the trend reverses itself below this. These results suggest scavenging of Ag down to intermediate water depths and remineralization of this scavenged Ag in the deep ocean. Where scavenging of Ag is observed, there is a positive correlation between Ag flux and the fluxes of both organic carbon and biogenic opal. It is therefore no surprise that the concentration of Ag in surface sediments generally reproduce the trends observed for marine productivity in the surface ocean, just as the traditional productivity proxies do. While more work is required to understand exactly how Ag is scavenged and why remineralization occurs, these results clearly show that Ag flux to the seafloor is linked to marine productivity. Thus, Ag should be useful as a paleoproductivity proxy, at least in continental margin locations.",

            "abstract": "Industrial agriculture systems, mostly in developed and some emerging economies, are far different from the small holder farms that dot the landscapes in Asia and Africa. At Environmental Defense Fund, along with our partners from non-governmental, corporate, academic and government sectors and farmers, we have worked actively in India and Vietnam for the last four years to better understand how small scale farmers working on rice paddy (and other upland crops) cultivation can best deal with climate change. Some of the questions we have tried to answer are:\nWhat types of implementable best practices, both old and new, on small farm systems lend themselves to improved yields, farm incomes, climate resilience and mitigation?\n Can these practices be replicated everywhere or is the change more landscape and people driven?\nWhat are the institutional, cultural, financial and risk-perception related barriers that prevent scaling up of these practices? How do we innovate and overcome these barriers?\nThe research community needs to work more closely together and leverage multiple scientific, economic and policy disciplines to fully answer these questions. In the case of small farm systems, we find that it helps to follow certain steps if the climate-smart (or low carbon) farming programs are to succeed and the greenhouse credits generated are to be marketed:\nDemographic data collection and plot demarcation \nFarmer networks and diaries \nRigorous baseline determination via surveys\nAlternative practice determination via consultation with local universities/experts\nMeasurements on representative plots for 3-4 years (including GHG emissions, yields, inputs, economic and environmental savings) to help calibrate biogeochemical models and/or calculate regional emission factors.\nPropagation of alternative practices across the landscape via local NGOs/governments\nRecording of parameters necessary to extrapolate representative plot GHG emission reductions to all farmers in a given landscape under several existing and new carbon offset methodologies.\nIn this presentation, we will discuss our initial encouraging results on the basis of which our wider team now seeks to identify and recommend policies that the local governments to be able to scale up climate smart agriculture to larger jurisdictional levels.",

            "abstract": "Igneous activity in tectonically complex areas can be interpreted in many different ways, producing completely different petrogenetic models. Processes such as oceanic and continental subduction, lithospheric delamination, changes in subduction polarity, slab break-off and mantle plumes have all been advocated as causes for changes in plate boundaries and magma production, including rate and temporal distribution, in the circum-Mediterranean area. This region thus provides a natural laboratory to investigate a range of geodynamic and magmatic processes. Although many petrologic and tectonic models have been proposed, a number of highly controversial questions still remain. No consensus has yet been reached about the capacity of plate-tectonic processes to explain the origin and style of the magmatism. Similarly, there is still not consensus on the ability of geochemical and petrological arguments to reveal the geodynamic evolution of the area. The wide range of chemical and mineralogical magma compositions produced within and around the Mediterranean, from carbonatites to strongly silica-undersaturated silico-carbonatites and melilitites to strongly silica-oversaturated rhyolites, complicate models and usually require a large number of unconstrained assumptions.\nCan the calcalkaline-sodic alkaline transition be related to any common petrogenetic point? Is igneous activity plate-tectonic- (top-down) or deep-mantle-controlled (bottom-up)? Do the rare carbonatites and carbonate-rich igneous rocks derive from the deep mantle or a normal, CO2-bearing upper mantle? Do ultrapotassic compositions require continental subduction?\nUnderstanding chemically complex magmas emplaced in tectonically complex areas require open minds, and avoiding dogma and assumptions. Studying the geology and shallow dynamics, not speculating about the deep lower mantle, is the key to understanding the igneous activity.",

            "abstract": "Cold fronts affect the weather over South America throughout the year. The south-central region of South America has been identified as highly favorable to the formation and intensification of frontal systems.\nThe fronts usually move from southwest to northeast over the continent and the Atlantic Ocean. During their passage important changes in weather conditions are observed: spinning wind, rainfall, decreasing on atmospheric pressure and temperature. After the passage of a cold front it is usually observed a sharp drop of temperature, pressure increase and wind gusts.\nThere are several studies in the literature about South America cold fronts climatology. However, none of them were performed in pre-defined regions over South America and that have defined the pass interval in each region, which is the goal of the present research.\nDaily data of temperature on 925hPa, meridional wind in 925hPa and sea level pressure from the ERA Interim reanalysis from ECMWF, with spatial resolution of 1.5 ° x 1.5 ° for the period 1982-2009 were used. The criteria to identify the each cold front were: a drop in temperature, change in wind direction (north to south) and an increase in pressure from day 0 to day +1 for an average of four points for each of the 19 regions of South America.\nDuring the year, about 40 frontal systems pass in southern South America and this average is reduced to 10 to the northern regions of the continent. Winter is the season with the highest number of passage of frontal systems, summer is the season that presents lower number and spring and autumn have an intermediate number of fronts of the summer and winter.\nAnalyzing the time interval of cold fronts passage, it was found an average of 8 days in the length of a passage between two fronts in southern Brazil. For the regions further north the interval can reach 26 days during the year. Summer is the season with the longer interval between the passage of fronts and winter and spring shows the smaller intervals.",

            "abstract": "Scaled laboratory experiments provide insight into structure, entrainment and liftoff in pyroclastic density currents (PDCs). Experiments are conducted in a 8.5×6.1×2.6 m air-filled tank and comprise turbulently suspended mixtures of heated 20-μm talc particles introduced to the tank at steady and sustained rates; the tank is large enough that the currents are effectively unconfined. Experiments are scaled with bulk (densimetric and thermal Richardson numbers, Froude number) and turbulent (Stokes and settling numbers) parameters dynamically similar to natural currents. The Reynolds numbers of experiments are smaller than those of natural PDCs, but analysis of the experiments demonstrates that they are fully turbulent. Red, green, and blue laser sheets illuminate orthogonal planes within the currents for imaging and recording with HD video cameras; those data are reprojected into cross-sectional and map-view planes for analysis of turbulent velocity fields and fluctuations in particle concentration. A green laser sheet can be swept through the tank at 60 Hz and imaged with a high-speed CCD camera at up to 3000 fps; sequences of 60-300 images are used to make 3D volumetric reconstructions of the currents at up to 10 Hz. Currents typically comprise a lower “bypass” region and an upper entraining region that turbulently mixes with the ambient air. The bypass region is generally about half of the total current thickness and moves faster than the overlying, entraining region. The bypass region controls runout distance and steadiness of currents. If turbulent structures in the entraining region penetrate through the bypass region, the trailing portion of the current can stall before resuming forward progress; thus a single, “steady” current can generate multiple currents. When a current lifts off, it focuses along a narrow axis beneath the rising (coignimbrite) plume. At that time, ambient air entrainment occurs primarily through the lateral margins of the narrow bypass region. Eddies that entrain air through the lateral margins grow in size with transport distance such that at the maximum runout distance, eddies have lengthscales comparable to the current width. The largest structures within the rising plumes have lengthscales comparable to the cross-stream plume width.",

            "abstract": "The topography of an orogen reflects the complex interplay between processes that occur at depth in the crust and processes such as erosion and weathering that shape the surface landscape. Reconstructions of paleotopography are critical for evaluating geodynamic models and separating effects of climatic and tectonic change in terrestrial records. Stable isotope paleoaltimetry has proved to be an important tool for understanding changes in topography through time, however this approach is complicated by factors such as mixing of moisture sources, uncertainty over how uplift impacts air mass transport and resultant isotope hydrology, and debate over what some proxies actually record. Hydrogen isotopes of organic molecules provide a means of reconstructing isotopes of ambient water, but these data are also impacted by factors that affect biological processes and stomatal regulation. Despite the myriad factors that can impact isotope fractionation in plant waxes, a growing body of data show these molecules to be an important record of precipitation isotopes when coupled with data that relates to ecosystem type. This study will examine the distribution of hydrogen isotopes of higher plant waxes across the western U.S. at key intervals of the Cenozoic to provide a snapshot of long-wavelength changes to topography and moisture sources from the Eocene to recent. These data demonstrate the utility of biomarker isotopes as a paleohydrologic/paleotopographic proxy and point to long-standing high topography over much of western U.S. throughout the Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "The San Lorenzo Tezonco deep well stratigraphy records intense episodic volcanic activity in the Mexico Basin and surroundings during the past 20 Ma. The 2008-m deep lithological column is dominated by volcanic material, either as lava flows or pyroclastic deposits (97%), and only the upper most 70 m are composed of lacustrine deposits (3%). Based on geochronology and geochemistry, the lower part of the drill core is represented by rocks correlating to the Tepoztlán Formation (876-2008 m deep) that vary in composition from basaltic-andesite to rhyolite, and ages ranging from 13 to 21.2 Ma. On the surface this formation outcrops near the towns of Malinalco and Tepoztlán, ~43 km south of the deep well. Between depths of 581 and 875 m, volcanic rocks were recovered and are interpreted as lavas from the Sierra de las Cruces that vary in composition from andesite to dacite and range in age from 0.9 Ma to 5 Ma. Additionally, we documented rocks belonging to the Xochitepec Formation, outcropping around Xochimilco, in the Mexico City, with ages ranging from 1.2 and 1.7 Ma, in contrast with the Oligocene age proposed in previous works for these rocks. These new ages plus the chemical composition data, allow us to correlate the Xochitepec rocks with Sierra de las Cruces. Upward in the drill core (510-580 m) there are andesitic rocks that correlate with the 0.25 Ma Cerro de la Estrella volcanic center. The last volcanic package found in the well is correlated to the Santa Catarina basaltic andesites (70-120 m) that are younger than 0.25 Ma, and probably Holocene. Lacustrine deposits crown the stratigraphic column of the drill core with ages probably younger than 34 ka. The San Lorenzo Tezonco well is in a graben-like structure that was filled with more than 1900 m of volcanic products, suggesting that volcanism were intense in the Miocene to the Recent, and the south drainage of the Mexico Basin was closed probably in the early Pleistocene.",

In this work, we address the problem of filament channel formation and show how they acquire their shear and magnetic helicity. Results of 3D MHD simulations using the Adaptively Refined MHD Solver (ARMS) are presented that support the magnetic helicity-condensation model of filament-channel formation described by Antiochos, 2013. We consider the supergranular twisting of a quasi-potential flux system that is bounded by a PIL and contains a coronal hole (CH). The magnetic helicity injected by the small-scale photospheric motions is shown to inverse-cascade up to the largest allowable scales that define the closed flux system: the PIL and the CH boundary. This process produces field lines that are both sheared and smooth, and are sheared in opposite senses at the PIL and the CH. The accumulated helicity and shear flux are shown to be in excellent quantitative agreement with the helicity-condensation model. We present a detailed analysis of the simulation, including comparisons of our analytical and numerical results, and discuss their implications for observations.",

            "abstract": "Hydrodynamic models are widely applied to coastal areas in order to predict water levels and flood inundation and typically involve solving a form of the Shallow Water Equations (SWE). The SWE are routinely discretized by applying numerical methods, such as the finite element method.\nLike other numerical models, hydrodynamic models include uncertainty. Uncertainties are generated due to errors in the discrete approximation of coastal geometry, bathymetry, bottom friction and forcing functions such as tides and wind fields. Methods to counteract these uncertainties should always begin with improvements to physical characterization of: the geometric description through increased resolution, parameters that describe land cover variations in the natural and urban environment, parameters that enhance transfer of surface forcings to the water surface, open boundary forcings, and the wetting/drying brought upon by flood and ebb cycles. When the best possible physical representation is achieved, we are left with calibration and data assimilation to reduce model uncertainty.\nData assimilation has been applied to coastal hydrodynamic models to better estimate system states and/or system parameters by incorporating observed data into the model. Kalman Filter is one of the most studied data assimilation methods that minimizes the mean square errors between model state estimations and the observed data in linear systems (Kalman , 1960). For nonlinear systems, as with hydrodynamic models, a variation of Kalman filter called Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), is applied to update the system state according to error statistics in the context of Monte Carlo simulations (Evensen , 2003) & (Hitoshi et. al, 2014).\nIn this research, Kalman Filter is incorporated to simultaneously estimate an influential parameter used in the shallow water equations, bottom roughness, and to adjust the physical feature of bathymetry. Starting from an initial estimate of bottom roughness and bathymetry, and applying EnKF, more accurate bottom roughness and bathymetry are obtained by utilizing measurements available in a limited number of gages. The procedure is examined along five typical near shore transects located in Gulf of Mexico.",

            "abstract": "Coastal barrier systems naturally protect the mainland and may be among the most sensitive of all ecosystems to the effects of global climate change as ecological processes are closely coupled to both atmospheric and oceanic drivers. Large scale land cover change from grassland to woody vegetation has been documented at an unprecedented rate on Virginia barrier islands that have lost upland area to sea-level rise. In a new conceptual framework, feedbacks between vegetation and sediment result in cross-scale interactions in which vegetation cover influences broad scale island geomorphology. We quantified transitions between ecosystem states (bare, grass, woody) at the local scale to predict alternate states in broad scale geomorphology (stability domains) on seven Virginia barrier islands using Landsat imagery at ~ 10 year intervals. Over the study period (1984 – 2011), sea level rise ranged between 10.3 and 10.8 cm. Total terrestrial upland area of the seven islands was substantially reduced by 29% from 1984 to 2011, but varied from 3 to 62% for individual islands. Despite this rise in sea level and loss of upland area, we found a 40% increase in woody cover. At the same time, grassland declined by 30%. While island area was reduced in all islands, changes in woody cover and grassland were non-linear and variable with each island. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used to determine island level stability domains. Based on change vectors, three groups of islands emerged. “Low” islands exhibited directional change and were characterized by low levels of woody vegetation and active migration. “Transitional” islands were non-directional and had frequent ecosystem state transitions. “High” islands showed the opposite directional change with extensive woody expansion and relatively little change in upland area. These multi-scaled patterns affect the manner in which barrier islands respond to disturbance over different spatial scales and can inform us of the resiliency of an individual island and island chain to climate change effects as well as provide estimates of carbon and other nutrient fluxes through the system.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, NASA has been committed to making our Earth Science data more useable and accessible, not only to the community of NASA science researchers, but also to the world-wide public research community. The data collected by NASA’s remote sensing instruments represent a significant public investment in research. NASA holds these data in a public trust to promote comprehensive, long-term Earth science research. The Earth Observing System Data & Information System (EOSDIS) was established to meet this goal. From the beginning, NASA employed a free, open and non-discriminatory data policy to maximize the global utilization of the products derived from NASA’s observational data and related analyses. EOSDIS is designed to ingest, process, archive, and distribute data in a multi-mission environment. The system supports a wide variety of Earth science disciplines, including cryosphere, land cover change, radiation budget, atmosphere dynamics and composition, as well as inter-disciplinary research, including global climate change.  A distributed architecture was adopted to ensure discipline-specific support for the science data, while also leveraging standards and establishing policies and tools to enable interdisciplinary research, and analysis across multiple instruments. Over the past 2 decades the EOSDIS has evolved substantially. Today’s EOSDIS is a tightly coupled, yet heterogeneous system designed to meet the requirements of a diverse user community. The system was scaled to expand to meet the ever-growing volume of data (currently ~10 petabytes), and the exponential increase in user demand that has occurred over the past 15 years. We will present how the EOSDIS has evolved to support the variety and volume of NASA’s Earth Science data.",

            "abstract": "The Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP1) identified the need to reduce uncertainty in both model boundary conditions and proxy based paleoenvironmental estimates. In addition, a number of regions and processes were identified where model-data discord was highest (e.g. tropical and mid-to-high latitude North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, and the model representation of polar amplification in general). One potential reason for data-model discrepancies may come from the inability of fixed boundary condition, equilibrium type climate model simulations to predict the full potential of climate variability expressed in the proxy records (e.g. due to changing orbital forcing). Therefore, transient models will be used to understand temporal and spatial variability between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2 and KM5 (~3.3 Ma to 3.2 Ma), a key interval within the Pliocene. The Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping Project (PRISM4) has begun generation of high resolution multiple proxy time series to be used to verify simulated conditions in selected areas between MIS M2 and MIS KM5, including the PlioMIP2 KM5C time slice (3.205 Ma).\nWe use the full-complexity intermediate-resolution FAMOUS climate model driven by PRISM3 boundary conditions and run experiments with time varying orbital forcing, but without dynamic vegetation initially. We perform a preliminary data-model comparison by point-wise assessing the FAMOUS simulations against the new PRISM4 SST data focusing on the North Atlantic, a region where PlioMIP1 GCM simulations and paleoenvironmental estimates exhibited the greatest amount of discord.",

            "abstract": "The complexity of the modelling of the rotational motion of the Earth in space has produced that no single theory has been adopted to describe it in full. Hence, it is customary using at least a theory for precession and another one for nutation. The classic approach proceeds by deriving some of the fundamentals parameters from the precession theory at hand, like, e.g. the dynamical ellipticity H, and then using that valuesin the nutation theory. The former IAU1976 precession and IAU1980 nutation theories followed that scheme. Along with the improvement of the accuracy of the determination of EOP (Earth orientation parameters), IAU1980 was superseded by IAU2000, based on the application of the MHB2000 (Mathews et al 2002) transfer function to the previous rigid earth analytical theory REN2000 (Souchay et al 1999). The latter was derived while the precession model IAU1976 was still in force therefore it used the corresponding values for some of the fundamental parameters, as the precession rate, associated to the dynamical ellipticity, and the obliquity of the ecliptic at the reference epoch.\nThe new precession model P03 was adopted as IAU2006. That change introduced some inconsistency since P03 used different values for some of the fundamental parameters that MHB2000 inherited from REN2000. Besides, the derivation of the basic earth parameters of MHB2000 itself comprised a fitted variation of the dynamical ellipticity adopted in the background rigid theory. Due to the strict requirements of accuracy of the present and coming times, the magnitude of the inconsistencies originated by this two-fold approach is no longer negligible as earlier. Some corrections have been proposed by Capitaine et al (2005) and Escapa et al (2014) in order to reach a better level of consistency between precession and nutation theories and parameters.\nIn this presentation we revisit the problem taking into account some of the advances in precession theory not accounted for yet, stemming from the non-rigid nature of the Earth. Special attention is paid to the assessment of the level of consistency between the current IAU precession and nutation models and its impact on the adopted reference values. We suggest potential corrections and possibilities to incorporate theoretical advances and improve accuracy while being compliant with IAU resolutions.",

The recently launched Landsat 8 satellite has improved calibration, radiometric resolution, geometry and global data acquisition frequency over previous Landsat sensors. Pansharpening is an established technique to integrate higher spatial resolution panchromatic information with lower spatial resolution multi-spectral information. A new pansharpening algorithm is presented that is specific to Landsat 8 and that models the sensor spectral response functions to provide a universal algorithm that is computationally efficient and applicable to large volume data. Experiments conducted using Landsat 8 data acquired over agricultural regions with markedly different field dimensions in South Dakota, China, and India, are presented to demonstrate and quantify the utility of the 15m pansharpened Landsat 8 data over conventional 30m data.",

Alterations of the water quality linked to the river morphology can affect the ecosystems and human development in the long-term.\nThe future construction of a reservoir in the Lluta river, located in northern Chile, will change the spatial distribution of arsenic-rich sediments, which can have significant effects on the lower parts of the watershed.\nIn this investigation we develop a coupled numerical model to predict and evaluate the interactions between morphodynamic changes in the Lluta reservoir, and conditions that can potentially desorb arsenic from the sediments. Assuming that contaminants are mobilized under anaerobic conditions, we calculate the oxygen concentration within the sediments to study the interactions of the delta progradation with the potential arsenic release.\nThis work provides a framework for future studies aimed to analyze the complex connections between morphodynamics and water quality, when contaminant-rich sediments accumulate in a reservoir. The tool can also help to design effective risk management and remediation strategies in these extreme environments.\nResearch has been supported by Fondecyt grant 1130940 and CONICYT/FONDAP Grant 15110017",

            "abstract": "Frictional stick-slip is considered to be the mechanism of shallow earthquakes, in which elastic energy slowly accumulates and is released during dynamic failure. Frictional materials can fail via stick-slip or stable sliding. In the context of rate-and-state friction, the transition between these behaviors is a Hopf bifurcation. However, laboratory and field observations suggest that more complicated behavior occurs, manifested by a range of slip modes that include slow earthquakes and slow slip transients. In the laboratory, these behaviors arise in materials exhibiting two-state variable friction behavior, or in systems with more complex elastic coupling than 1D interactions for a spring and rigid slider.\nTo explore this problem, we conducted shearing tests on layers of quartz powder with a mean grain size of 10 µm in a double-direct-shear geometry. Elastic stiffness of the loading system was varied by changing the central forcing block and the applied normal stress. Experiments were run at room temperature under a controlled relative humidity of 100%. Shear loading velocity was fixed at 10 µm/s. We unloaded and reloaded the shear stress at fixed intervals during experiments to measure the aggregate system stiffness at multiple strains.\nFor more compliant systems we observe slow stick-slip behavior, with slip durations on the order of seconds. Stiffer loading systems exhibit linearly stable behavior, even to velocity perturbations of an order of magnitude. The critical stiffness boundary suggested by rate-and-state friction appears to be a good first order predictor of the system, but does not capture its behavior completely. Our observations suggest that the interplay between loading stiffness and friction constitutive properties can in some cases produce an extended transition between stable and unstable sliding as a function of net slip in a given experiment, including a regime of complex slip behavior with slow stick-slip. This transition is caused by systematic changes in both gouge layer stiffness and friction as a function of accumulated strain, possibly related to shear localization. Our results suggest that the behavior of tectonic faults may evolve with accumulated slip that drives changes in stiffness, its spatial distribution along the fault, and frictional parameters.",

            "abstract": "Strangeway et al. [2005] and other authors have concluded that the establishment of the ambipolar field by the deposition of energy from soft electron precipitation is a significant driver of type-2 ion upflows. Likewise, Clemmons et al. [2008] and Zhang et al. [2012] proposed processes by which soft electron precipitation may play a role in heating neutrals and contribute to neutral upwelling. In both situations the thermal ionospheric electron population plays a crucial role in both generation of the ambipolar field and in collisional energy exchange with the atmosphere through a variety of processes. In this study we examine the dynamics of the electron population, specifically the temperature, in a slightly different context - focusing on the auroral downward current region (DCR). In many cases auroral DCRs may be depleted of plasma, which sets up interesting conditions involving thermoelectric heat fluxes (which flow upward - in the opposite direction from the current), adiabatic expansion due to the high (upward) speed of the electrons carrying the downward current, heat exchange from ions which have elevated temperatures due to frictional heating, and direct frictional heating of the electrons. A detailed understanding of the electron temperature in auroral DCRs is necessary to make quantitative statements about recombination, upflow, cavitation and a host of other processes relevant to ion outflow. In this study, we compare in situ rocket observations of electron temperature, density, and current densities with predictions from the Zettergren and Semeter [2012] model in an attempt to better understand the dynamics and relationships between these parameters in DCRs.",

            "abstract": "Western Anatolia is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, undergoing broad N-S extension associated with the rollback of the Aegean slab in the south. This region is characterized by high heat-flow, recent volcanism, and core-complex formation. We use >3500 receiver functions from a dense array of 47 stations located in western Turkey and dispersion data from a recent regional-scale, ambient noise tomography study to invert for shear-wave velocity as a function of depth. Using this technique, we obtain an unprecedented three-dimensional shear-wave velocity model that characterizes the crust of western Turkey.\nWe find a sharp Moho transition beneath much of western Anatolia, with crustal thickness varying from ~25 km near the Aegean Sea to ~35 km beneath the Fethiye Lobe correlating with the topography in western Turkey. The lower crust exhibits a relatively continuous ~10-15 km thick low shear-wave velocity layer (LVL) beneath most of western Anatolia, reaching velocities below 3.0 km/s in some places. The top of this LVL marks the lower boundary of crustal seismicity. These characteristics suggest that the lower crust in western Anatolia is behaving as a ductile solid, as seismic velocities in this range at lower crustal depths are indicative of the presence of fluids (possibly partial melts when considering the high heat-flow in the region). We propose that the lower crust in this region may be undergoing local crustal flow due to the N-S dominated stress regime, which led to the formation of the sharp, low-relief Moho observed in western Turkey.\nAcross the Fethiye-Burdur Fault Zone, we see the slowest S-wave velocities in the lower crust, reaching ~2.8 km/s. Unlike elsewhere in western Turkey, this region has relatively low surficial heat-flow and no recent volcanism. Therefore, the anomaly in the Fethiye Lobe is likely due to a different mechanism than western Turkey. We also observe a very slow uppermost mantle beneath this region, with shear-wave speeds < 4.2 km/s. We attribute this anomaly to subduction related processes, such as the introduction of aqueous fluids from the underthrusting of thick, hydrated sediments or alternatively, to possible serpentinization of the upper-mantle. Mantle wavespeeds transition to more typical velocities across the Fethiye-Burdur Fault Zone.",

In the northern Great Plains, threshold-like activation of infiltration-excess overland flow during spring snowmelt is common. However, the multiple controls on, and their hierarchy in determining, hydrological connectivity are poorly understood in space and time. Here we present analysis of a 52-year data set from three 5 ha runoff plots in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. We found that the key controls on the activation of snowmelt runoff are firstly snow water equivalent, followed by soil moisture in the preceding fall, and finally maximum depth of the surface thawed layer during snowmelt. Building on this analysis, we conducted a field experiment during the spring 2014 snowmelt period to assess these controls in high spatial and temporal detail. We found that soil moisture and thawed layer depth show little spatial variability during snowmelt, while the spatial patterns of snow water equivalent and snow cover ablation show time-varying hot spots of snowmelt. Catchment connectivity is determined by the topography of the soil surface, specifically the local micro-scale depressional area, volume and slope. Finally, we analyzed the stable isotope composition of soil water, snowmelt water from the base of the snowpack (both exhibiting high spatial variability) and hillslope runoff (with high temporal variability). This further illustrates how these time-varying controls on runoff generation are sequenced in an individual melt season, where filling and spilling of surface depressions over frozen ground dominates.",

            "abstract": "We present an improved data analysis for the Mini-LHR column measurements of CO2 and CH4 that includes corrections for refraction through the atmosphere and meteorological conditions. Multi-scan averaging has also been added to compensate for current shot noise limitations and improve instrument sensitivity. Data with the improved analysis will be shown for field measurements at the TCCON site at CalTech (March 2014), Calpoly during COW-Gas (March 2014), at Mauna Loa Observatory (May 2013), and Atwater, CA (February 2013).\nThe Mini-LHR is a miniaturized version of a laser heterodyne radiometer that implements telecommunications lasers and components to produce a significantly reduced size, low-cost instrument. Laser heterodyne radiometry has been used since the 1970s to measure atmospheric gases such as ozone, water vapor, methane, ammonia, chlorine monoxide, and nitrous oxide. The Mini-LHR is passive and uses sunlight as the primary light source to measure absorption of CO2 and CH4 in the infrared. Sunlight is collected with collimation optics mounted to the AERONET sun tracker and superimposed with laser light in a single mode fiber coupler. The signals are mixed in a fast photoreceiver (InGaAs detector), and the RF (radio frequency) beat signal is extracted. Changes in concentration of the trace gas are realized through analyzing changes in the beat frequency amplitude.\nIn addition to the complementary aerosol optical depth measurement, tandem operation with AERONET provides a clear pathway for the mini-LHR to be expanded into a global monitoring network. AERONET has more than 450 instruments worldwide and offers coverage in key arctic regions (not covered by OCO-2) where accelerated warming due to the release of CO2 and CH4 from thawing tundra and permafrost is a concern. A mini-LHR global ground network can also provide an uninterrupted data record that will both bridge gaps in data sets and offer validation for key flight missions such as OCO-2, OCO-3, and ASCENDS. Currently, the only ground global network that routinely measures multiple greenhouse gases in the atmospheric column is TCCON with 18 operational sites worldwide and two in the US. Cost and size of TCCON installations will limit the potential for expansion. We offer a low-cost (<$30K/unit) solution to supplement these measurements.",

            "abstract": "Mineral-stabilized organic matter (OM) is the largest and oldest pool of soil carbon and nitrogen. Mineral stabilization limits OM availability to soil microbes, preventing its decomposition and prolonging its turnover. Thus, understanding controls on the decomposition of mineral-stabilized OM is key to understanding soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The very slow turnover of mineral-stabilized OM makes it challenging to study in a typical incubation, and as a result, many potential controls (temperature, OM chemistry, and mineralogy) on its turnover remain unclear. We aimed to better understand controls on decomposition of mineral-stabilized OM by employing a slurry incubation technique, which speeds up microbial processing of OM by maximizing OM accessibility to microbes. In a slurry incubation, we expect that any OM that is not stabilized on mineral surfaces will be available for decomposition and will be converted to CO2. Using this technique, we studied the interactive effects of incubation temperature, plant material type (aboveground vs. belowground), and soil fraction (silt vs. clay) on CO2 efflux and OM stabilization. We separated silt-sized and clay-sized fractions from an agricultural soil, added aboveground or belowground plant material to each, and incubated them at 15°C, 25°C and 35°C. The added plant material was isotopically labeled (13C and 15N), which allowed us to trace it through the system and distinguish between the responses of the new (derived from the plant material) and old (derived from what was already present in the silt and clay) OM to warming. We measured CO2 efflux and 13CO2 efflux throughout the incubation. We performed one short-term harvest at day 6 and one final harvest at day 60. Initial results show higher cumulative CO2 efflux at warmer temperatures regardless of plant material type or soil fraction. A larger fraction of that CO2 came from OM that was initially present in the silt and clay, rather than from the plant material that we added, which suggests faster turnover of that “old” OM at warmer temperatures. We will present CO2 efflux data in addition to total [C] and [N] and the isotopic ratios of 13C and 15N in the silt and clay at each harvest to explain how the interactions between warming, plant material type and soil fraction affect turnover of mineral stabilized OM.",

The 2010 Mw 7.1 Darfield event and its associated aftershock sequence caused numerous occurrences of liquefaction in the Canterbury region of New Zealand, providing an excellent opportunity to study the occurrence of liquefaction in coastal plains near an active mountain belt. In this study we utilize strong motion data from over 100 stations in the New Zealand region and examine a number of major liquefaction events associated with the Canterbury earthquake sequence. These data are used to construct empirical attenuation relationships of ground motion as functions of hypocentral distance. The attenuation relationships so derived for the Canterbury region are similar to those developed for Southern California. This similarity suggests some generality of ground motion attenuation in sedimentary basins, even between geographically disparate regions. These relationships are used to estimate the seismic energy density at each liquefaction site in the Canterbury region, which is compared with a global database of liquefaction occurrences. Some liquefaction sites in the Canterbury region experienced seismic energy densities near the lower threshold for liquefaction established for the global dataset, suggesting high sensitivity to liquefaction.",

Such information is usually expressed as a relationship between Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) of extreme rainfall. The general IDF curve approach assumes a stationary climate and typically is regionalized based on small number of gauges. However, with the ongoing accumulation of weather radar records, radar-rainfall data represent an alternative to gauging data providing much needed spatial resolution. A clear understanding of the space-time rainfall patterns for events or for a season will enable in assessing the spatial distribution of areas likely to have a high/low inundation potential for each type of rainfall forcing. The Next Generation Weather Radar system (NEXRAD) comprises of 160 Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) sites throughout the United States and at selected overseas locations. Stage IV is a national multi-sensor radar product from NCEP, mosaicked from the regional multi-sensor analyses with 4km×4km and 1h resolution of space and time respectively. In the current study, 11 years of HRAP (Hydrologic Rainfall Analysis Project) gridded Stage IV radar data is employed to generate a relationship between intensity, duration, frequency and the storm exposed area of New York Metropolitan area covering almost 30,000 km2 of the most populous cities at the east part of United States. We investigate the statistical properties of the spatial manifestation of the rainfall exceedances and present the scaling phenomena of contiguous flooded areas as a result of large scale organization of storms. This can be used for spatially distributed flood risk assessment conditional on a particular rainfall scenario. Statistical models for spatio-temporal loss simulation including model uncertainty to support regional analysis can be developed. In this project, we explore a non-parametric multivariate approach and a parametric Bayesian approach to develop stochastic scenarios of spatial extreme rainfall fields for regional risk assessment.",

            "abstract": "The Early to Middle Holocene retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet has scarcely been explored in the attribution of climate dynamics to explain Eurasian paleoclimate records, despite that areal ice extent remained significant until after ~7 ka. Climate models that incorporate these ice-sheet dynamics predict relatively cold winters in the continental interior of Eurasia prior to 6 ka, in contrast to much warmer summers, which are paced directly by solar insolation and paleoecological feedbacks. With respect to sea-level pressure, these models also predict a weakening of subpolar lows and reduced zonal wind transport in the Subarctic region during winter, characteristic of enhanced meridional circulation and Rossby-wave amplification over the midlatitudes. Utilizing a high-resolution record of winter climate (11.9 ka–Present) from the southern Ural mountains, we test the hypothesis that retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet paced Eurasian winter climate into the Middle Holocene. Stable-isotope analysis of two U-Th-dated speleothems from Kinderlinskaya Cave, Russia revealed a long-term increase in δ18O that cannot be explained by direct orbital forcing, solar irradiance, or North Atlantic temperature and circulation dynamics. Instead, we interpret the trend in δ18O to reflect a poleward shift in climate zones and a transition from predominantly meridional to zonal circulation over the continental interior, associated with the downstream impact of continental ice sheets in North America. This interpretation is supported by quantitative comparison of our record to western Eurasian proxies of winter climate and δ18O in precipitation, through which we attempt to describe synoptic-scale shifts in dominant modes of atmospheric circulation. These findings confirm that the climatic impact of continental ice sheets, especially during winter, may persist several millennia into interglacial periods on a hemispheric scale.",

However, the application of this technology to address regional water quality challenges across different types of land-use/cover is just being explored. Here we present the development of new regional water quality monitoring network in the northeastern United States (DE, RI,VT) - the North East Water Resources Network (NEWRnet). NEWRnet is used as a case study in the process associated with development and implementation of a regional, cross-state collaborative network for monitoring water quality; one of the first, we believe, of its kind. . Two fundamental questions that we address are: 1) What is the impact of climate variability and other disturbances on water quality for watersheds with different land uses extending across the north-south gradient (VT to DE)? 2) Do high-frequency water quality data provide valuable information and insights to stakeholders and thus lead to better and time efficient decision making? Our network consists of a suite of sites across each state with similar basic land covers (forested, agricultural and urban). Each site within the network is currently equipped with an s::can spectrolyser and YSI EXO2 sonde, as well as pressure transducers for estimating discharge and ISCO automated sampling systems. All sensor data is telemetered on an hourly basis from the monitoring site to a regional database housed at the University of Delaware, which is accessible to the entire research team In addition to university scientists and researchers, we also partner with local/state drinking water utilities (DWUs) to assess how this real-time water quality data can assist with their day-to-day operations and planning. We will present initial data from the network highlighting regional water quality responses to episodic events or “hot moments”. We also discuss challenges regarding regional data management, quality assurance and control, which are likely applicable to other similar networks under development.",

            "abstract": "Forest disturbances that cause plant mortality alter the net carbon (C) balance by increasing heterotrophic respiration associated with coarse woody debris (CWD) decomposition. Whether a forest transitions from a C sink to source following disturbance is largely a function of the quantity of additional CWD produced and the rate of woody debris decomposition. Coarse woody debris temperature, moisture, and microbial community composition are known to drive rates of heterotrophic respiration, but rarely have these factors been studied together across a gradient of wood decay and over time following disturbance. We used a large-scale experimental disturbance, in which early successional aspen (Populus spp.) and birch (Betula papyrifera) were killed via stem girdling within a 39 ha area, to study the effects of moderate disturbance on the forest C cycle. We quantified changes over time in CWD mass for a decade, before and after disturbance. We then conducted point measurements of CWD respiration, temperature and moisture, and quantified extracellular enzyme activity of enzymes associated with wood decomposition for five classes varying in extent of decay and standing woody debris. Process and inventory data are being used to estimate ecosystem CO2 efflux from CWD, which we will contrast with net ecosystem production (NEP) determined from long-term eddy covariance measurements of net CO2 exchange between the forest and atmosphere at the University of Michigan Biological Station (US-UMd) Ameriflux site. Our results will improve ecosystem model predictions of CWD respiration by incorporating both physical factors, such as temperature and wood moisture content, and biological factors, such as extracellular enzymatic activity of different functional types of decomposers.",

            "abstract": "With hypothesized liquid water ocean beneath its crust and observed large amount of oxygen in its exosphere, Europa is one of the potentially habitable locations of Solar system. This made the satellite the object of high scientific interest, the primary goal of Clipper mission drafted by NASA in particular. As of today, certain amount of data is already available (e.g. from Galileo spacecraft), yet more is awaited from Juno spacecraft, which is on its way to Jupiter.\nEuropa’s exosphere should be studied with connection with Jovian magnetosphere, as the two form together a complex system. They are tightly coupled through the processes of the magnetospheric ion sputtering, photolytic and electron reactions. Successful investigation of coupled system requires a simultaneous simulation of both its components.\nPrevious approaches studied this system in a piece-wise manner. Our efforts presented here are aimed at developing of a more global approach that would combine the exosphere and magnetosphere into a single model. This approach is more complete as it accounts for mutual influence of Jovian magnetosphere and Europa’s exosphere and allows us to study their time dependent interaction. We employed coupled MHD (Block-Adaptive Tree Solarwind Roe-type Upwind Scheme) and Monte-Carlo (Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator) codes. Among the properties studied are distributions of pick-up ions (spatial, energy, pitch angle) and mass-loading of the magnetosphere in the vicinity of the satellite. A brief comparison of these properties with those resulted from previous works on the problem (Lipatov et al., 2010; Ip et al., 1998) and analysis of how introduced interaction of the satellite’s atmosphere with Jovian magnitosphere changes the results are provided.",

            "abstract": "Over the last 2000 years, the climate of the North Atlantic region was punctuated by centennial oscillations, which despite their small magnitude had important societal impacts, particularly in NW Europe. The most favoured explanations for this climate variability invoke changes in external forcings (such as solar activity and explosive volcanism) amplified by ocean and atmosphere feedbacks, mainly involving the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the North Atlantic Oscillation. However, the scarcity of highly resolved archives has hampered our understanding of the involvement of the ocean-atmosphere interactions in these climatic oscillations.\nWe present a subdecadally resolved temperature and salinity record derived from paired Mg/Ca-δ18O measurements on planktonic foraminifera from a marine sediment core located in the pathway of the North Atlantic Current. Our findings show a strong centennial co-variability of the temperature and salinity of the surface limb of the AMOC with solar irradiance (Moffa-Sánchez et al. 2014- NGS). Climate model results from this study show a similar correlation over the last millennium and we infer that the hydrographic changes were linked to the strength of the subpolar gyre associated with changes in atmospheric circulation. Specifically, in the simulation, low solar irradiance promotes the development of frequent and persistent atmospheric blocking events, in which a quasi-stationary high-pressure system in the eastern North Atlantic, also known as blocking event, modifies the flow of the westerly winds. To further explore the response of the upper limb of the AMOC to solar forcing found in Moffa-Sánchez et al. 14, we synthesize new and available proxy-data from the North Atlantic Current in combination with analysis from CMIP5 simulations of the last millennium.",

Coupled with the current knowledge of these volcanic areas (tomography, tectonics and K/Ar dating), our fluid mechanics experiments suggest that:\n(1) The Azores, as Canary, Cape Verde, Madeira Islands and Great Meteor seamounts might be the surface expression of a cluster of mantle instabilities rising from the top of a large thermochemical dome located in the lower mantle.

            "abstract": "Granitoid lithic clasts from the 0.7 ka Kaharoa eruption at the Tarawera volcano (Okataina Volcanic Complex, Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand) – the world’s most productive region where rhyolite volcanism is currently active – give insight into the processes of rhyolite formation. The plutonic lithic clasts of the Kaharoa eruption consist of (1) quartz phenocrysts, which are often grouped into clusters of two to eight quartz grains, (2) plagioclase phenocrysts with anorthitic cores and albitic rims, and (3) interstitial potassium feldspar. Quartz orientations obtained through electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) methods show that 78% of the 82 analyzed clusters have at least one pair of quartz grains with matched dipyramidal faces that are in either parallel or Esterel twin orientation. Variations in cathodoluminescence (CL) zoning patterns of the quartz suggest that quartz clusters in the plutonic lithics formed after initial crystal growth and that many quartz crystals were subject to one or more resorption events. Thus, individual quartz crystals with different magmatic histories came together into preferred orientations to form clusters; this process is indicative of oriented quartz synneusis and suggests a history of crystal accumulation. The quartz clusters are interpreted to have formed as part of a crystal cumulate mush within a shallow magma chamber where quartz crystals rotated into contact along their dipyramidal faces during hindered settling and/or compaction. Therefore, the preservation of oriented quartz clusters from the Kaharoa plutonic lithics provides direct evidence for synchronous, shallow pluton formation from a cumulate mush during active volcanism. This result is consistent with a model whereby melt-rich, high-silica rhyolite formation occurs via interstitial melt extraction from a low-silica rhyolite mush in the shallow crust.",

            "abstract": "Attention to conservation laws gives a comprehensive picture of the structure and dynamics of gas giants: Atmospheric differential rotation is generated by tidal torques (dependent on tropospheric static stability) and is dragged into the interior by turbulent viscosity. The consequent heat dissipation generates baroclinicity and approximate thermal wind balance, not Taylor-Proudman conditions. Magnetic Lorentz forces have no effect on the zonal wind, but generate a meridional wind approximately parallel to field lines. Thus, magnetic field generation in the interior is dominated by the ω-effect (zonal field wound up by differential rotation), with the α-effect (meridional field generated by turbulence) severely limited by the β-effect (turbulence-enhanced resistivity). The meridional circulation quenches the ω-effect so that a steady state is reached and also limits the magnitude of the non-axisymmetric field under certain circumstances. The stability of the steady state requires further study. The magnetic field travels with the E X B drift, rather than the fluid velocity. Work by the fluid on the magnetic field balances work by the magnetic field on the fluid, so the global heat flux is little changed. In conducting regions the meridional density distribution (and gravity field) is most sensitive to the total pressure (gas + magnetic) and the ω-effect. In nonconducting regions, the gas pressure, centrifugal force, and differential rotation dominate. The differential rotation varies at least as fast as r³, so the gravitational signal is small compared to that for differential rotation on cylinders. The entropy minimum near the tropopause allows meteorology to be dominated by (relatively) long-lived, closed potential temperature surfaces, usually called spots, which conserve potential vorticity. All of the above must be taken into account to properly assimilate any available observational data to further specify the interior properties of fluid planets.",

We present results from experiments in which a high concentration (50% by volume) of granular solids suspended in a non-Newtonian carrier fluid (0.75% guar gum in water) flowed through a transparent parallel-plate fracture. Digital particle-image-velocimetry analysis demonstrates the development of a strongly heterogeneous velocity field within the fracture that persists for the length of the fracture. The highest velocities were observed along the no-flow boundaries and the lowest velocities along the centerline; we carried out numerical simulations and additional experiments to elucidate this surprising result. Depth-averaged (2D) simulations using a rheological model of concentrated suspensions of mono-disperse solids in Newtonian fluids reproduced experimental observations of the velocity field when small (3%) variations in solid concentration were introduced. Such concentration variability led to significant (factor of two) velocity variations within the fracture yet negligible changes in observed pressure gradients. Two plausible explanations for solid-concentration variability are: (i) shearing of the fluid at the no-flow boundaries induced these concentration variations or (ii) they were induced by upstream boundary conditions. A second set of experiments was performed to identify which of the two phenomena caused the observed velocity variations. A narrow obstruction was placed along the centerline of the same cell; reduced velocities along the obstruction were observed, indicating that the observed velocity variations are the result of solid concentration heterogeneities that occurred in the upstream boundary and not from concentration heterogeneities developing inside the fracture. Our results suggest that small variations in solid concentration can lead to significant velocity variations such that a simple fracture-averaged conductivity may not reliably predict transport of suspended solids within fractures.",

            "abstract": "According to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) growth rate mathematical expression, the vertical drift is supposed to be the primary component that controls the RTI growth rate. However, in the African sector that does not seem to be the case. In this paper we present independent ground- and space-based observations that consistently show weaker vertical drift (both dayside and evening sector) in the African sector compared with the American sector. On the other hand, observations from both satellite and recently deployed ground-based instruments have shown that the African sector is home to stronger and year-round ionospheric bubbles/irregularities and scintillations compared to the American and Asian sectors. The question is if the drift is weaker in the African sector, what causes these strong bubbles that have been observed in the African sector almost throughout the night and during all seasons? Are there other mechanisms that initiate RTI growth other than vertical drift? Would it be the neutral winds that cause the long lasting bubbles in Africa? If it is the neutral wind, why are the winds unique in terms of orientation and magnitude in the African sector compared to other longitudinal sectors?",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) present a challenge to modeling using general circulation models (GCMs) because they involve processes and structures that are too fine for GCMs to resolve. TCs have fine structures – e.g. the eye, eyewall, and rain bands – with length scales on the order of 10 km, while GCMs have typical resolutions on the order of 50-100 km. High resolution GCM runs that are sufficiently long to exhibit multiple TCs can be prohibitively computationally expensive. Thus, while GCMs exhibit TC-like vortices with similar spatial and temporal frequencies to observed TCs, the ability of GCMs to reproduce fine TC structures remains largely untested. In this study, we use recently developed rare event analysis and simulation methods to selectively simulate TCs under GCMs at very high resolution. These rare event simulation methods have been developed mostly in the context of computational chemistry, but are broadly applicable. They allow (either by careful manipulation of the model or by selection of trajectories) direct and detailed interrogation of the event of interest without introducing error and without the need to simulated for long periods of time to see the event. By creating targeted, high resolution GCM simulations with many TCs, we hope to determine whether or not GCMs can capture fine TC structures such as eyewalls and individual rain bands.",

We study trajectories of relativistic electrons drifting eastwards interacting with longitudinally distributed EMIC triggered emissions. Relativistic radiation belt electrons interact with EMIC triggered emissions, some are trapped by wave potentials and efficiently guided down to lower pitch angles. Repeated interactions occur due to the mirror motion, and result in the scattering of particles into the loss cone. We use two EMIC wave models for the test particle simulations.

In this work an analytical model for the hydrodynamic interaction between incoming waves and a turbulent expanding jet is developed and tested with the numerical model Delft3D coupled to the wave model SWAN. Both the analytical model and Delft3D predict that incoming surface gravity waves increase the spreading of the jet and the interaction between wave and current boundary layers causes an increase in bottom friction. Our numerical results show that in the presence of waves, mouth bars form up to 35% closer to the river mouth and 40% faster when compared to cases without waves. From a morphodynamic point of view, we show that wave characteristics (height, period and direction) play an important role in the formation of mouth bars. In our numerical experiments waves affect bar development in three ways: by modifying the direction of the river jet, by increasing bottom shear stresses at the river mouth, and by changing bottom friction and hence increasing jet spreading. In addition, we show that high waves with long period prevent the formation of mouth bars and therefore should be considered in the design of restoration schemes for deltaic land.",

            "abstract": "Global changes such as biological invasions and sea level rise can significantly affect GHG emissions from coastal wetlands by changing plant community composition and/or environmental conditions. To first characterize GHG fluxes across major plant-defined marsh zones, CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes were compared between S. patens- dominated high marsh and S. alterniflora low marsh during 2012 and 2013 growing seasons in 3 New England marshes. To test how these fluxes may change in response to biological invasions and sea level rise, GHG fluxes were then compared between native, P.australis- invaded, and permanently inundated marsh zones at these sites in 2013 and 2014. GHG emissions were analyzed simultaneously from marsh ecosystems using infrared-based spectrometers connected to static flux chambers. Daytime CO2 uptake rates (ranging on average between -2 and -21 μmol CO2 m-2s-1) were generally greater in S. alterniflora low marsh zones than in S. patens high marsh among all 3 sites. Methane fluxes were generally low in both native marsh zones (< 50 μmol CH4 m-2 h-1) and N2O emissions were rare. However, CO2 uptake and CH4 emissions from P. australis zones were typically more than an order of magnitude greater than those of either native marsh zone. In contrast, permanently inundated marsh soils had similar GHG emissions to native marsh zones. . Though large, the P. australis CH4 emissions are estimated to offset less than 5% of observed CO2 uptake rates based on a global warming potential of 25 (100 years). These results suggest that two alternative fates for coastal marshes in the future- conversion to P. australis marshes or to standing water with sea level rise- will substantially affect CO2 and CH4 emissions. Net impacts on climatic forcing of these ecosystems will depend on how long term C sequestration is affected as these emissions shift.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the nature of marine stratocumulus clouds (MSCs) have been recognize as crucially important in climate change prediction due to their important roles in modulating radiation budget on a very wide spatial scale. However, despite the seemingly simple shape of MSCs, microphysical and dynamical characteristics of these clouds are very complex. MSCs are usually topped by much warmer and drier air and entrainment and mixing at the top of these clouds modulate the cloud microphysics and dynamics. The important point is that depending on how entrained air mixes with the cloudy air, further development of the cloud can turn out to be different. Here we examine this problem for the MSCs observed over the Southeastern Pacific. The airborne data we used were obtained from the G-1 aircraft during Vamos Ocean Cloud Atmosphere Land Study-Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx). The data were recorded at various rates but the ones presented in this study are the 1Hz and 40Hz data. Cloud microphysics data obtained from horizontal penetrations through the clouds are analyzed to find the evidence for the dominant mixing mechanism of the entrained dry air from above the cloud top. We find that the dominant feature is the positive relationship between cloud droplet mean volume (V) and liquid water content (L). Despite this apparent trait of homogeneous mixing, relevant scale parameters (i.e., transition length scale and transition scale number) consistently suggest that inhomogeneous mixing would be dominant for the VOCALS MSCs. Here we propose that this clear discrepancy can be explained by vertical circulation mixing that can modulate the V-L relationship to suggest homogeneous mixing at the measurement altitudes, which was on average 10.2 mb down from the cloud top where actual mixing may have occurred inhomogeneously.",

Interaction of CO2 with water and rock plays important role in geochemical cycle of carbon and among potential ways of reducing atmospheric CO2 by sequestration into carbonates. Olivine, among the main constituents of mafic and ultramafic rocks, is rich in Mg and Fe that can react with CO2 to form Mg-Fe carbonates like siderite and magnesite.\nLaboratory experiments were performed in batch-type titanium reactors to study the interaction between CO2-rich water and olivine under hydrothermal conditions. The experimental were conducted at 150°C, for 1 to 4 weeks, the CO2 concentration was 5 to 30 mmol/kg and the initial pH was around neutral. The olivine used was forsterite 93% from Åheim Olivine Pit-Norway. The alteration products and fluid chemistry were monitored as a function of time. Moreover, the results were supported with reaction path modeling to further constrain the olivine alteration and carbonate mineral formation mechanism.\nInitially forsterite dissolved releasing elements into solution. During this stage limited alteration products were formed and the solution pH was buffered by H+ uptake by olivine dissolution and CO2 concentration. Upon further reactions secondary phases started to form including chrysotile, brusite and mainly solid solution of iron-containing magnesite. This resulted in decrease of CO2 concentrations and eventually increased solution pH. Experiments with higher initial CO2 concentrations required longer period until CO2was consumed. Furthermore experiments with longer duration had quantitatively larger amount of precipitated minerals.\nFindings of this research represent platform for kinetic numerical simulations of olivine alteration and therefore provide insight into carbon storage in mafic rocks under in-situ conditions.",

This allows for (1) characterization of the mantle source(s) at Hess Deep, (2) insight into the extent of isotopic homogeneity or heterogeneity in the area, and (3) constrain the relative contributions from the intruding Cocos–Nazca spreading center.\nThe observed Pb–isotopic variation at Hess Deep covers almost the entire range of EPR MORB (10°N to –5°S). Hess Deep samples range from 208Pb (37.3–38.25), 207Pb (15.47–15.58), 206Pb (17.69–18.91). These compositions suggest that this part of Hess Deep mantle is no more isotopically homogeneous than EPR mantle. Two distinct arrays are also observed: 208Pb–enriched (r2=0.985; n=30) and 208Pb–depleted (r2=0.988; n=6). The 208Pb/204Pb isotopes indicates that the Pb–source for some of the samples at Hess Deep had very low Th/U ratios, whereas other areas around the Galapagos microplate seem to have more “normal” ratios. These trends are less apparent when viewed with 207Pb–isotopes. Instead, the majority of basalts and gabbros follow the NHRL, however, at the depleted–end of this array a negative excursion to more enriched compositions is observed. This negative but linear trend could signify an alteration trend or mixing with an EMI–type mantle source, yet this mixing is not observed with 208Pb. This trend is also observed at Pito Deep, which has similar origins to Hess Deep (Barker et al., 2008; Pollack et al., 2009).\nThe Galapagos region has been considered a testing ground for mixing of HIMU, Enriched Mantle, and Depleted Mantle reservoirs (e.g., Schilling et al., 2002). According to our data, however, an EPR–component must also be considered. We model Hess Deep Pb–isotopes as a 4–component system. EPR–DM–EM comprise a ‘local’ reservoir, but the majority of samples contain a mixture of modified-HIMU–EM–EPR, a product of incoming plume material entrained within the Galapagos Spreading Center.",

The origin of plasmaspheric hiss has been a topic of intense study and some controversy ever since its discovery in the late 1960’s. A recent set of modeling studies has shown that a different plasma wave, namely whistler-mode chorus, could be responsible for creating plasmaspheric hiss by propagating from its source region in the equatorial plasmatrough, and into the plasmasphere. Early coordinated observations made simultaneously on multiple THEMIS probes have shown excellent consistency between models and data, but later results concerning the nature of chorus waves and its relation to pulsating aurora, the discovery of low-frequency hiss, and coincident observations between high L-shell chorus and hiss have shown that there are facets of the chorus-hiss connection that are still a puzzle. In this talk, we briefly review the chorus-hiss connection mechanism and focus on recent results and open questions.",

We found a mesoscale anticyclone eddy at the San Quintin Basin oxygen minimum zone. The diameter of the core of the eddy was 64 km. The core of the eddy was warm (11 °C), salty and with low-oxygen concentration (1 ml/l): water properties, which were similar to those of the California Undercurrent off northern Baja California. The eddy showed a swirl velocity of 22 cm/s, a rotational period of 11 days and a Rossby number of 0.14. A discussion about the oceanographic settings and about the generation process of the eddy is presented. Numerical modeling studies of the mesoscale dynamics of the southern region of the California Current revealed that the California Undercurrent induce anticyclone eddies at the San Quintin Basin.

            "abstract": "While plate tectonic motions and dynamic topography of continents each reflect an active mantle convective regime, excursions of the Earth’s rotation axis relative to a fixed hotspot reference frame are remarkably muted. Early studies of paleomagnetically inferred pole positions suggested excursions of less than a few degrees [Jurdy and Van Der Voo, 1975]. For this reason, long-term changes in Earth’s rotation, or true polar wander (TPW), were thought to have a negligible role in the observed long-term secular cooling of Earth’s climate through the Tertiary [Donn and Shaw, 1977]. This gradual cooling over the past 65 million years began at a time when much of Earth’s climate was relatively warm and quiescent and culminated in dramatic glacial cycles of the Pleistocene. In contrast to earlier studies, recent reanalyses of paleomagnetic pole positions suggest a secular drift in Earth’s rotation axis of greater than ten degrees in the last 40 million years [Torsvik et al., 2012; Doubrovine et al., 2012]. The direction of this drift brings North America, a site of advancing and retreating ice sheets throughout the Pleistocene, to increasingly higher latitudes. Using an orbital solution valid for the last 50 million years [Laskar et al., 2004], we compute the effect of TPW on insolation quantities for sites in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Our results indicate that a three degree shift in latitude driven by TPW is comparable to a two degree change in obliquity in terms of its impact on summer energy (i.e. the total energy for the year on days surpassing a given insolation threshold; Huybers, 2006). In addition, we explore climatological gradients using modern climatological data and employ simple climate models to characterize reductions in positive degree days for the North American Arctic over the last 40 million years. We find that TPW and continental drift that moved arctic North America poleward could have driven cooling that contributed to glacial inception ~3 Ma.",

The first “ideation” challenge, closed on July 31st attracted over 450 participants consisting of climate scientists, hobbyists, citizen scientists, IT experts and App developers. Winning ideas from the first challenge will be incorporated into the second “builder” challenge currently targeted to launch mid-August and close by mid-November. The winner(s) will be formally announced at AGU in December of 2014.

Here we present initial results of a new sea ice ridge detection approach that utilizes high resolution, three-dimensional ice/snow surface elevation data from the NASA Operation IceBridge Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) laser altimeter merged with coincident high-resolution imagery from the Digital Mapping System (DMS).\nWe derive novel information regarding sea ice deformation across a variety of ice types and regimes. Statistical information regarding sea ice ridges (height/frequency/orientation) and floe edges (freeboard height) are presented for several IceBridge flight lines. These novel characterizations of sea ice surface morphology will be used to validate and inform drag parameterizations in state-of-the-art sea ice models. Furthermore, they will advance our ability to quantify uncertainties introduced by pressure ridges in the estimation of sea ice freeboard/thickness from airborne and satellite altimeters.",

            "abstract": "The Gulf of Tehuanetpec (GoT) (14°-16°N and 92°-96°W) is located in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific, a region that is sensitive to changes in both Atlantic-Pacific water vapor transport as well as changes in ENSO. Within the ETNP, the GoT is unique in that it experiences significant changes in temperature (ΔT = 8-10°C) and salinity (ΔS = 3) associated with seasonal variations in precipitation and wind-driven upwelling. Establishing robust relationships between δ18O and Mg/Ca of foraminiferal calcite to sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) in this region can then be used to study past changes in Atl-Pac water vapor transport and ENSO and how these relate to regional and global climate change. We present here a six year (2006-2012), weekly to biweekly resolved record of paired δ18O-Mg/Ca analyses of the planktonic foraminfer Globigerina bulloides, collected from a sediment trap mooring in the GoT (15° 38.826N, 95° 16.905 W).\nThe G. bulloides δ18O values ranges from -0.14‰ to – 3.98‰, equivalent to ~16°C temperature, or nearly twice the observed instrumental change in SST. To help constrain the temperature influence on the δ18Ocalcite signal, Mg/Ca values were converted to temperature using previously published equations for G. bulloides. In addition, we calculated new equations using the Mg/Ca and satellite SST data. Depending on the calibration equation used, G. bulloides from the GoT show a ~5-8% change in Mg/Ca with temperature, and show generally good agreement with SST, particularly in winter upwelling months. The agreement between SST and Mg/Ca-based temperatures is less robust during the winter months of 2009, when a moderate El Niño year resulted in warmer and fresher surface conditions in the GoT than pervious and following years, indicating a deeper habitat depth for G. bulloides and perhaps reduced upwelling during El Niño conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Laguna del Maule Volcanic Field, Chile, includes an unusually large and recent concentration of silicic eruptions. Since 2007 the crust here has been inflating at an astonishing rate of 25 cm/yr. Findings thus far lead to the hypothesis that the silicic vents have tapped an extensive layer of crystal-poor, rhyolitic melt that began to form atop a magmatic mush zone that was established by ~20 ka with a renewed phase of rhyolite eruptions during the Holocene. Modeling of surface deformation, magnetotelluric data, and gravity changes suggest that magma is currently intruding at a depth of ~5 km. Swarms of volcano-tectonic and long period earthquakes, mostly of M < 2, have occurred beneath the most recent rhyolite coulees on the southwestern and southern margins of the 20 km diameter ring of silicic vents.\nWith support from the US NSF and the Chilean government (SERNAGEOMIN and OVDAS) we are seizing the unique opportunity to investigate, over the next 5 years, the dynamics of this large rhyolitic system while magma migration, reservoir growth, and crustal deformation are actively underway. This collaboration involves scientists and students at: University of Wisconsin-Madison, Georgia Tech, Cornell, University of Alberta, Simon Fraser University, University of Chile-Santiago, CONICET/University of San Juan-Argentina, Nanyang Technological University-Singapore, SERNAGEOMIN, OVDAS, USGS, and SEGEMAR-Argentina. Team members will be introduced in this presentation.\nOur approach includes augmenting the OVDAS array of 6 permanent seisic stations with 40 additional instruments to conduct tomographic, receiver function and ambient noise studies. We continue to collect 4-D gravity data from 37 stations. Surface deformation is monitored via cGPS at 5 permanent receivers and InSAR data. A magnetotelluric survey across the Andes at 36o S is planned. Geochemical studies include mineral zoning and U-Th disequilibrium of zircons to constrain the timing of magma intrusion and mixing events prior to the current unrest. The overall aim is to integrate these observations and to construct numerical models of system dynamics. We are developing communications protocols and a web site to facilitate sharing of findings among the team members and with the public.",

            "abstract": "Deriving flood vulnerability maps at basin scale typically requires simulating a long record of annual maximum discharges. To improve this approach, long precipitation records from global reanalysis systems must be downscaled to a spatio-temporal resolution applicable for flood modeling. This study evaluates a combined spatial downscaling and error correction technique based on high-resolution satellite precipitation products applied on NASA’s Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) reanalysis precipitation dataset. The TRMM 3B42 25-km and 3-hourly blended satellite precipitation product is used for driving the GLDAS reanalysis downscaling. The study focuses on 437 flood-inducing storm events that occurred over a period of ten years (2002-2011) in the Susquehanna River basin located in the northeast United States. A validation strategy was devised for assessing error metrics in rainfall and simulated runoff as function of basin area, storm severity and season. The WSR-88D gauge-adjusted radar-rainfall (stage IV) product was used as the reference rainfall dataset, while runoff simulations forced with the stage IV precipitation dataset were considered as the runoff reference. Results show that the generated rainfall ensembles from the downscaled reanalysis products encapsulate the reference rainfall. Frequency analysis of rainfall and runoff and mean relative error and root mean square error statistics exhibited improvements in the precipitation and runoff simulation error statistics of the 3B42-driven downscaled GLDAS reanalysis dataset compared to the original reanalysis precipitation product. Results vary by season and less by basin scale. The proposed downscaling scheme is modular in design and can be applied on different satellite and reanalysis dataset over different regions.",

            "abstract": "Circum-Antarctic Ridges (CARs) comprise almost one-third of the global Mid-Ocean Ridge, yet remain terra incognita for hydrothermal activity and chemosynthetic ecosystems. The InterRidge Vents Database lists only 3 confirmed (visualized) and 35 inferred (plume evidence) active sites along the ~21,000 km of CARs. Here, we report on a multi-year effort to locate and characterize hydrothermal activity on two 1st-order segments of the Australian-Antarctic Ridge that are perhaps more isolated from other known vent fields than any other vent site on the Mid-Ocean Ridge. KR1 is a 300-km-long segment near 62°S/159°E, and KR2 a 90-km-long segment near 60°S/152.5°E. We used profiles collected by Miniature Autonomous Plume Recorders (MAPRs) on rock corers in March and December of 2011 to survey each segment, and an intensive CTD survey in Jan/Feb 2013 to pinpoint sites and sample plumes on KR1. Optical and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP, aka Eh) anomalies indicate multiple active sites on both segments. Seven profiles on KR2 found 3 sites, each separated by ~25 km. Forty profiles on KR1 identified 13 sites, some within a few km of each other. The densest site concentration on KR1 occurred along a relatively inflated, 90-km-long section near the segment center. CTD tows covered 20 km of the eastern, most inflated portion of this area, finding two 6-km-long zones centered near 158.6°E and 158.8°E with multiple plume anomalies. Three ORP anomalies within 50 m of the seafloor indicate precise venting locations. We call this area the Mujin “Misty Harbor” vent field. Vent frequency sharply decreases away from Mujin. 3He/heat ratios determined from 20 plume samples in the Mujin field were mostly <0.015 fM/J, indicative of chronic venting, but 3 samples, 0.021-0.034 fM/J, are ratios typical of a recent eruption. The spatial density of hydrothermal activity along KR1 and KR2 is similar to other intermediate-rate spreading ridges. We calculate the plume incidence (ph) along KR1 and KR2 as the mean of the fraction of MAPR casts detecting a plume in each 2nd-order segment. For all 6 segments, ph=0.37±0.25, consistent with the prediction of 0.33 from the global trend of ph for a spreading rate of 68 mm/yr.",

            "abstract": "Three reverse faults in northwestern Washington – the Seattle, Tacoma, and Birch Bay faults – experienced late Holocene earthquakes. Warped intertidal platforms in the hanging wall of each fault formed broad anticlines as a result of deformation during these three earthquakes. Estimates of past deformation rely on differencing raised shoreline features and corresponding modern features. I utilized profiles of LiDAR digital elevation models to calculate prehistoric (647 profiles) and modern shoreline angles (507 profiles) and used these angles to quantify the shape and amount of deformation of each anticline. I calculated shoreline angle elevations by visually fitting lines to modern and uplifted intertidal surfaces and adjacent shoreline cliffs. The intersection of the two fitted lines is the shoreline angle. Mean elevations of modern shoreline angles for 6 shoreline areas in northern Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia (n=507) lie within 2-46 cm of mean tide level. Three additional shoreline areas in southern Puget Sound have modern shoreline angles closer to mean higher high water (within 22-88 cm) and lie in areas with less fetch and greater tidal range than sites in northern Puget Sound and the Straits of Georgia.\nA M>7 earthquake ~1.1 ka on the Seattle fault lifted a broad platform cut on sedimentary rocks out of the intertidal zone. Profiles of the platform at three locations along the western end of the Seattle fault zone define an anticline 8-10 km wide (orthogonal to the fault) with a maximum uplift during the earthquake of ~5–8 m. Another large earthquake ~1.1 ka uplifted an intertidal platform along the western part of the Tacoma fault. The raised platform formed an anticline ~10 km wide (orthogonal to the fault) with a maximum uplift of ~5 m. An earthquake ~1.2 ka raised shorelines in the hanging wall of the Birch Bay fault above an anticline observed on seismic reflection profiles near Bellingham, WA. Only part of the anticline is expressed in raised shorelines because shoreline angles are not preserved in the northern limb of the anticline. Estimated width of the anticline is ~8 km with a maximum uplift of 2.5 m. Ongoing elastic half-space modeling is intended to match profiles of each raised shoreline in order to estimate fault geometries and earthquake magnitudes required to produce the observed uplift profiles.",

            "abstract": "Percolation of CO2-rich fluids in limestones causes the dissolution (and eventual reprecipitation) of calcium carbonate minerals, which affects the rock microstructure and changes the rock petrophysical properties (i.e. hydraulic, electrical and elastic properties). In addition, microstructural changes further feedback to affect flow paths as well as the location and magnitude of fluid-rock interactions. To better understand this complex coupled problem and to assess the possibility of geophysical monitoring in chemically reactive geosystems, we performed percolation laboratory experiments on two well-characterized carbonate samples (99% calcite), from Estaillades and St Maximin (France), 10 cm in diameter and 35 and 16 cm in length, respectively. We monitored aqueous chemistry parameters (pH, calcium concentration and total alkalinity) and petrophysical properties (permeability, electrical formation factor and acoustic velocities). X-ray tomography imaging of the rock samples were also performed before and after the flow experiments. The measured chemical and electrical parameters allowed rapid detection of the dissolution of calcite in the downstream fluid. After circulating fluids of various salinities at 5mL·min-1 for 32 days (about 290 pore sample volumes) at a pCO2 of 1 atm (pH = 4) in the Estaillades sample, porosity increased by 7%, permeability increased by one order of magnitude, electrical formation factor decreased by 15% and P- and S-wave velocities, measured every cm along the sample main axis, decreased non-uniformly by less than 1% to up to 14%. X-ray microtomography revealed the creation of a ramified wormhole; these, along with the convex curvature of the permeability-porosity relationship, are consistent with a transport-controlled dissolution regime for which advection processes are greater than diffusion processes. Similar results were obtained for the St Maximin sample, except that the wormhole is more compact, which is most likely due to a more homogeneous initial microstructure. This study shows that both seismic and non-seismic geophysical techniques (i.e. electrical measurements) are promising for monitoring geochemical changes within the subsurface due to fluid-rock interactions.",

In the end, there is a deceptively strong full-ensemble agreement for a decrease in precipitation during the monsoon season. Bias is considerably affecting many of the model projections, and we find that the simulations that are the most biased, in varying ways, in the baseline/current climate, produce the greatest decreases.

            "abstract": "The existence of stable, super-liquidus silicate liquid immiscibility at temperatures up to 1200 °C has been proposed for some multicomponent ferrobasaltic-ferroandesitic compositions on the basis of centrifuge experiments (Veksler et al., 2007) but the evidence and interpretation of experimental results were challenged by Philpotts (2008) who argued that the products of centrifuge experiments were metastable phases formed during quenching. Here we report the results of static reverse experiments, which were aimed at resolving the debate.\nThe idea of the reverse experiments was to test miscibility between pre-synthesized pairs of silica-rich and Fe-rich immiscible melts at static conditions and long exposure times. Three pairs of the potentially immiscible compositions were taken from the original study by Veksler et al. (2007) and one more pair was taken from a recent report of liquid immiscibility in the Panzhihua intrusion in China. Experiments were carried out in one-atmosphere gas-mixing furnace (Ar-H2-CO2 gas mixture) at 1150 and 1200 °C and oxygen fugacity corresponding to that of the QFM buffer. Pairs of the silica-rich and Fe-rich starting compositions were loaded in Pt wire loops, fused separately at 1200 °C, and then brought in contact and kept at constant experimental temperature for more than 24 hours. Three pairs of compositions out of four used in this study did not mix. Some temperature-dependent chemical re-equilibration was observed in the Fe-rich melts but, in the cases of immiscibility, two liquids remained compositionally distinct and showed sharp compositional gradients at contacts. One pair of liquids crystallized some tridymite, whereas the other compositions were clearly above liquidus. Overall, the results of the reverse experiments are in good agreement with the earlier centrifugation study and confirm the existence of stable, super-liquids immiscibility in some Fe-rich basaltic-andesitic compositions at temperatures up to 1200 °C.\n",

            "abstract": "The oceans have absorbed approximately one-third of the anthropogenic CO2 released to the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Consequently, over the last century, the pH of the ocean surface has decreased by an estimated 0.1 units. If atmospheric CO2 emissions continue unabated, it is estimated that the pH of the surface ocean will decrease by an additional 0.3-0.4 pH units by the end of this century, increasing the ocean’s hydrogen ion (H+) concentration by about 150% relative to beginning of the industrial era.\nThe dissolution of CaCO3-rich sediments (> 30% w/w) serves as the ultimate sink of the anthropogenic CO2 delivered to the deep ocean. Nevertheless, factors that control the kinetics of the CaCO3 dissolution reaction under conditions encountered at the sediment-water interface have not been properly parameterized. We investigated the dissolution kinetics of a simulated, organic-free, calcite-rich sediment in seawater at 25°C and one atmosphere total pressure under hydrodynamic conditions that might be representative of those at the seafloor. Dissolution rates were measured in a flow-through system at various undersaturations (1-Ω; where Ω = [Ca2+][CO32-]/K*cand K*c is the stoichiometric solubility constant of calcite) under well-controlled hydrodynamic conditions.\nPreliminary results reveal that interface area-normalized CaCO3 dissolution rates of pure calcite powder and the simulated sediment in quiescent seawater are identical within our experimental uncertainties (15%), and are a non-linear function of the overlying seawater undersaturation (1-Ω). These results will be compared with those obtained when the simulated-sediment interface is subjected to increasing but uniform shear stresses.",

            "abstract": "Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a key tool for analyzing spatially dependent processes including snow accumulation on slopes or glacier mass balance. Acquiring DEM within short time intervals provides new opportunities to evaluate such phenomena at the daily to seasonal rates.\nDEMs are usually generated from satellite imagery, aerial photography, airborne and ground-based LiDAR, and GPS surveys. In addition to these classical methods, we consider another alternative for periodic DEM acquisition with lower logistics requirements: digital processing of ground based, oblique view digital photography. Such a dataset, acquired using commercial off the shelf cameras, provides the source for generating elevation models using Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms. Sets of pictures of a same structure but taken from various points of view are acquired. Selected features are identified on the images and allow for the reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) point cloud after computing the camera positions and optical properties. This cloud point, generated in an arbitrary coordinate system, is converted to an absolute coordinate system either by adding constraints of Ground Control Points (GCP), or including the (GPS) position of the cameras in the processing chain. We selected the opensource digital signal processing library provided by the French Geographic Institute (IGN) called Micmac for its fine processing granularity and the ability to assess the quality of each processing step.\nAlthough operating in snow covered environments appears challenging due to the lack of relevant features, we observed that enough reference points could be identified for 3D reconstruction. Despite poor climatic environment of the Arctic region considered (Ny Alesund area, 79oN) is not a problem for SfM, the\nlow lying spring sun and the cast shadows appear as a limitation because of the lack of color dynamics in the digital cameras we used. A detailed understanding of the processing steps is mandatory during the image acquisition phase: compliance with acquisition rules reducing digital processing errors helps minimizing the uncertainty on the point cloud absolute position in its coordinate system. 3D models from SfM are compared with terrestrial LiDAR acquisitions for resolution assesment.",

            "abstract": "There have been a number of multiple GCM-RCM programs, covering Europe, North America, and now, through CORDEX, most regions of the world. Standard metrics of success for these programs include number of publications, number of users of the data, and number of citations to the program. However, these metrics do not necessarily reflect the scientific value of the program, for example, what new scientific knowledge has been developed. We began to carefully consider how one does establish the scientific value of such programs. We thought that establishing the scientific value of the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) would be a good way to examine this issue. We present in this paper our thinking so far on this issue and demonstrate how we are proceeding. We hope that our analysis will prove useful for explicitly establishing the value of such programs throughout the world. Perhaps the most direct indication of a program’s value is whether the goals set out for the program have been met. In the case of NARCCAP, this is relatively straightforward. We can point to the research papers published that quantify the uncertainty based on the global and regional climate simulations (e.g., Mearns et al., 2013), and we can point to the number of data users and the number of papers published by the impacts community using the NARCCAP data. Of particular interest, however, is determining what we have learned about future climate projections and their impacts based on the use of higher resolution dynamically generated future climate information. We evaluated all research articles and major reports that used the NARCCAP database, and we report in this talk the major research advances indicated in this literature.",

The work presented here is focused on the quasi-permanent marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds over the southeastern Atlantic Ocean, which underlie a near-persistent smoke layer produced from extensive biomass burning throughout the southern African savanna during austral winter. The absorption of the above-cloud smoke layer, which increases with decreasing wavelength, can introduce biases into imager-based cloud optical and microphysical property retrievals of the underlying MBL clouds. This effect is more pronounced for cloud optical thickness retrievals, which are typically derived from the visible or near-IR wavelength channels (effective particle size retrievals are derived from short and mid-wave IR channels that are less affected by aerosol absorption). Here, a new method is introduced to simultaneously retrieve the above-cloud smoke aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the unbiased cloud optical thickness (COT) and effective radius (CER) using multiple spectral channels in the visible and near- and shortwave-IR. The technique has been applied to MODIS, and retrieval results and statistics, as well as comparisons with other A-Train sensors, are shown.",

Stable isotope analysis of carbon reservoirs provides information about carbon cycling, allowing carbon to be tracked along groundwater flow paths from the surface atmosphere, through the soil and epikarst, and into caves and karst aquifers. In the Ozarks of northwestern Arkansas, karstified carbonates are covered with a mantle of cherty regolith, which can serve as either a sink or source of carbon. Samples for δ13C analysis of gaseous CO2 and aqueous DIC were collected from two soil lysimeters installed in the soil zone above a cave, a drip-water pool in a side-passage of the cave, and three locations along the cave stream and spring outlet. A two-component, concentration-dependent mixing model of δ13C-CO2 was used to calculate the proportions of cave-air CO2 sourced from the surface atmosphere versus the soil zone. Median CO2 concentrations were 2,578 ±1,504 ppm in the soil and 1,026 ±939 ppm in the cave, and CO2 concentration increased with outside surface temperature. Median δ13C-CO2 was -21.5 ±2.1 ‰ in the soil and -17.5 ±4.3 ‰ in the cave. Median DIC concentrations were 1.7 ±1.0 mg/L in the soil and 23.3 ±6.6 mg/L in the cave, and as discharge increased, DIC concentration decreased in the cave. Median δ13C-DIC was -19.5 ±2.5 ‰ in the soil and -14.3 ±1.6 ‰ in the cave. The concentration and isotopic composition of carbon species varied seasonally; for example, in the soil and cave, CO2 was greatest in the summer and lowest in the winter. Additionally, the proportion of soil CO2 contributing to the cave air was lowest during fall (8 %) and greatest during summer (71 %). At the spring outlet during storm events, DIC and calcite saturation decreased and δ13C-DIC became lighter, likely as pre-event water stored in the soil zone was displaced by storm-event water. Data indicate that, depending on the time of year, cave carbon species were sourced from the surface atmosphere, soil, and deeper groundwater flow paths.",

Size-resolved growth factor (GF ≡ Dp,wet/Dp,dry) measurements by the DASH-SP are compared to bulk scattering measurements (f(RH) ≡ σscat,wet/σscat,dry) by the LARGE instrument. Spatial location and volatile organic compound tracers such as isoprene and acetonitrile are used to classify the origin of distinct air masses, including: forest fires, biogenic-emitting forests, agricultural use lands, marine boundary layer, urban, and rural background.

These approaches are based on different philosophies and theoretical definitions of sensitivity, and range from simple local derivatives and one-factor-at-a-time procedures to rigorous variance-based (Sobol-type) approaches. In general, each approach focuses on, and identifies, different features and properties of the model response and may therefore lead to different (even conflicting) conclusions about the underlying sensitivity.\nThis presentation revisits the theoretical basis for sensitivity analysis, and critically evaluates existing approaches so as to demonstrate their flaws and shortcomings. With this background, we discuss several important properties of response surfaces that are associated with the understanding and interpretation of sensitivity. Finally, a new approach towards global sensitivity assessment is developed that is consistent with important properties of Earth System model response surfaces.",

The enhancements appear as single or multiple peaks and in some cases as bright and dark bands of airglow intensity modulation. Though the peaks mostly appear near the equatorial region, in some cases they are seen at mid-latitudes as well. Detailed simulations are carried out using SAMI2 (SAMI2 is Another Model of the Ionosphere) model parameters to understand such intense emission in the near midnight period. The simulations reproduced the measured airglow intensity pattern quite remarkably and suggest that plasma density distribution by meridional neutral wind could play a major role in producing the brightness, while the intensity bands could be caused by Medium Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forests are important regulators of atmospheric CO2 concentration and any change in tropical forest C balance will directly affect global climate. Long term studies from undisturbed old-growth forest monitoring sites distributed across Amazonia have presented an overall increase in aboveground biomass in the last decades, and the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations is considered the main driver for this observed carbon sink.\nThe main goal of this work was to use simulations from dynamic global vegetation models (DGVM) to explore how much of the observed historical (1970-2008) increase in biomass in undisturbed tropical forest in Amazonia could be attributed to the CO2 fertilization effect or associated to climate change. We compared simulated biomass and productivity from three DGVMs (IBIS, ED2 and JULES) with observations from forest plots (RAINFOR). The analyses helped clarify the variability of historical and potential future simulations.\nThe analyses showed that models shared similar results and deficiencies. The three models represented the two major model types: conventional dynamic global vegetation models that simulate community dynamics and competition between plant functional types (PFTs) using an aggregated ‘big-leaf’ representation (IBIS and Jules), and a size-and-age structured terrestrial ecosystem model that captures individual scale dynamics and competition (ED2). In general, the ED2 model results were more sensitive to climate, but all models greatly underestimate the impact of extreme climatic events (e.g. drought) compared to field data.\nAll the DGVM’s studied tend to simulate the average biomass well and to overestimate productivity of vegetation under current conditions. All the models presented very low spatial variability compared to field observation. The lack of spatial variability of biomass and productivity is attributed to the lack of nutrient and residence time spatial heterogeneity. All of the DGVMs results suggest that forests have gained AGB in the last decades, consistent with the observations. The CO2 fertilization effect is the strongest factor contributing to the increase in biomass followed by climate. However, models failed to simulate observed biomass dynamics at individual sites when compared to individual field sites.",

The pressure of the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition remains controversial and its effect on equation of state (EoS) is unclear, thus introducing uncertainties in estimating the density of Fe7C3 under inner core pressures.\nHere we report the lattice parameters and unit cell volume of hexagonal Fe7C3 at 300 K and up to 70 GPa, obtained through synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements using a diamond anvil cell. The experiments used fine powder of Fe7C3 that was synthesized in the multi-anvil apparatus at the University of Michigan. The sample was embedded in neon pressure medium together with Au powder and ruby spheres as additional pressure markers. We observed significant softening at 5~8 GPa, similar to the reported \"invar\"-like behavior in Fe-Ni alloy (Dubrovinsky et al., 2001). For comparison, the compression curve of iron in the same loading turned out to be smooth as expected, which confirms that the abnormal behavior in Fe7C3 compression curve is due to its own property change and not an artifact.\nThe new data allow us to establish the equation-of-state (EoS) of Fe7C3 and then estimate the density of Fe7C3 at inner core conditions.\n",

            "abstract": "Iron (Fe) is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth’s crust and plays a significant role controlling the geochemistry in soils, sediments, and aquatic systems. As part of a study to understand microbially-catalysed iron biogeochemical cycling in tropical soils, an iron reducing isolate, strain FeAm09, was obtained. Strain FeAm09 was isolated from acidic, Fe-rich soils collected from a tropical forest (Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico). Strain FeAm09 is a rod-shaped, motile, Gram-negative bacterium. Taxonomic analysis of the near complete 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain FeAm09 is 94.7% similar to Geobacter lovleyi, placing it in the genus Geobacter within the Family Geobacteraceae in the Deltaproteobacteria. Characterization of the optimal growth conditions revealed that strain FeAm09 is a moderate acidophile with an optimal growth pH of 5.0. The optimal growth temperature was 37°C. Growth of FeAm09 was coupled to the reduction of soluble Fe(III), Fe(III)-NTA, with H2, fumarate, ethanol, and various organic acids and sugars serving as the electron donor. Insoluble Fe(III), in the form of synthetic ferrihydrite, was reduced by strain FeAm09 using acetate or H2 as the electron donor. The use of H2 as an electron donor in the presence of CO2 and absence of organic carbon and assimilation of 14C-labelled CO2 into biomass indicate that strain FeAm09 is an autotrophic Fe(III)-reducing bacterium. Together, these data describe the first acidophilic, autotrophic Geobacter species. Iron reducing bacteria were previously shown to be as abundant in tropical soils as in saturated sediments (lake-bottoms) and saturated soils (wetlands) where Fe(III) reduction is more commonly recognized as a dominant mode of microbial respiration. Furthermore, Fe(III) reduction was identified as a primary driver of carbon mineralization in these tropical soils (Dubinsky et al. 2010). In addition to mineralizing organic carbon, Geobacter sp. FeAm09 is likely to also play an indirect role in carbon cycling by consuming H2 promoting microbial carbon fermentation in iron-rich tropical soils.",

Two intervals are well established, The Cretacious Quiet Zone and the Kiaman and others may exist. Irving and Parry named the Kiaman from exposures at Kiama point in Sew South Wales where Mercanton had first observed reversely magnetized lavas of Permian age. Irving’s naming this Superchron was a large leap of faith. Recently published studies on Cape Breton island places the beginning of the Kiaman in the Arnsbergian substage of Pennsylvanian time and younger rocks are all of reverse polarity within the Maritime Basin. Studies in western US show uniformly magnetized sediments with reverse polarity of Pennsylvanian and lower Permian age. The contact of the Kiaman reversed polarity interval with sediments of both polarities in the late Kiaman takes place at the base of the Kazanian. The presence of short normal polarity within the Kiaman have been postulated but are hard to confirm.",

            "abstract": "Large earthquakes in active mountain belts can trigger landslides which mobilize large volumes of clastic sediment. Delivery of this material to river channels may result in aggradation and flooding, while sediment residing on hillslopes may increase the likelihood of subsequent landslides and debris flows. Despite this recognition, the controls on the residence time of coseismic landslide sediment in river catchments remain poorly understood. Here we assess the residence time of fine-grained (<0.25 mm) landslide sediment mobilized by the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China, using suspended sediment fluxes measured in 16 river catchments from 2006-2012. Following the earthquake, suspended sediment flux was elevated 3 to 7 times, consistent with observations of dilution of 10Be concentrations in detrital quartz (West et al., 2014). However, the total 2008-2012 export was much less than input of fine-grained sediment by coseismic landslides determined by area-volume scaling and deposit grain-size distributions. Estimates of the residence time of fine-grained sediment in the affected river catchments range from <1 to >100 years at the present export rate. We show that the residence time is proportional to the extent of coseismic landsliding, and inversely proportional to the frequency of intense runoff events. Together with previously reported observations from the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, our results demonstrate the importance of climate in setting the length of time that river systems are impacted by large earthquakes.\n",

            "abstract": "Integrating accelerometer and radio frequency identification (RFID) embedded tracers with in-stream RFID antennas can provide unique field-based relations for grain size and slope dependent thresholds of motion. We recorded bedload activity at a reach and across individual particles paths during a weeks-spanning snowmelt period in Reynolds Creek, Idaho. Deployed accelerometer tracers logged unique clast mobility, while stationary antennas captured the times when RFID and accelerometer tracers passed through a given reach. We analyze the temporal motion dataset from the stationary antennas along with the reach’s shear stress conditions over the season. The antenna records quantify a grain-size dependent lower envelope for the threshold of motion that is fit with a hiding function. The accelerometer tracers were transported downstream as little as 10 m to more than 2 km, and were deposited in reaches with slopes ranging from 0.5 to 7 percent. The integration of the antenna-based hiding function along with flow modeling, grain size distributions and the accelerometer tracers’ mobility data constrain the dependence of critical shear stress on reach slope. Both the grain-size and slope dependent threshold results gleaned from these novel field methods are then utilized to evaluate how transport capacities fluctuate along the channel during a snowmelt flood. The hiding function results from the stationary antennas also demonstrate promising potential for bedload monitoring programs to include continuous threshold data by deploying multiple antenna stations across watershed scales. This multi-antenna watershed application could provide spatiotemporal comparisons of transport thresholds between reaches of interest. Such an effort could also be used to quantify changes in transport thresholds due to natural perturbations or restoration/management modifications within a watershed.",

            "abstract": "The presence of nitrate in groundwater is often associated with agricultural activity. Leaching below the root zone to aquifers from agricultural areas is a critical problem in many jurisdictions where concentrations are above drinking water guidelines. Traditionally, nitrate and other water quality parameters are collected using purge and sample techniques. Often this “snapshot” data both disrupts the natural subsurface flow system and is not detailed enough to determine critical water quality or quantity conditions. In this study, depth-discrete, continuous and in situ monitoring techniques are developed. While nitrate is the focus, parameters including temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, redox potential (ORP) and electrical conductivity (EC), are also monitored. Research sites examine a range of hydrogeological conditions from supply wells located in shallow, unconfined sandy aquifers (Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada) to fractured sedimentary bedrock aquifers (Guelph, Ontario) impacted by agricultural activity. The innovative groundwater quality sampling method uses the Submersible Ultraviolet Nitrate Analyzer (SUNATM) as well as the robust YSI EXO2 Water Quality SondeTM. Depth-discrete well profiling is used to evaluate vertical stratification of nitrate and field parameters along the entire borehole with a focus on the screened interval. The high resolution datasets show zones of changing water quality corresponding to different formations. In open bedrock boreholes in Guelph, distinct intervals were identified at different depths for pH, EC, DO and ORP. In the shallower wells in Norfolk County, increases in DO and EC along the screened interval suggest the presence of fresh groundwater representative of the aquifer, with potential implications for in situ long-term monitoring of groundwater parameters. Detailed profiles of DO and ORP at both sites can be combined with nitrate profile data to determine potential zones of denitrification. Water quality monitoring costs are reduced relative to traditional purge and sample methods using this new technique. The developed in situ monitoring method and equipment configurations can be applied by water managers in agricultural regions to gain better insight into subsurface flow and contaminant transport processes.",

            "abstract": "The area and volume of a shallow landslide are fundamental controls on both its hazard and its geomorphic importance. Observed shallow landslides from a range of environments are similar in size and geometry. They generally: 1) have depths of 0.1-3 m and areas of 101-104 m2; 2) are longer than they are wide, and wider than they are deep; and 3) have depths that scale as approximately the square root of area. Here we derive a simple model that includes the forces acting on each margin of a potential landslide to explain each of these observed landslide characteristics. The model extends existing methods based on earth pressure theory to make them more appropriate for natural slopes, and represents root reinforcement as an exponential function of soil depth. We find that the model predicts a critical depth in both cohesive and cohesionless soils, resulting in a minimum size for failure which is consistent with observed area-frequency distributions. Furthermore, the differential resistance on the boundaries of a potential landslide is responsible for a critical landslide shape which is longer than it is wide. Finally, our results show that minimum area increases as approximately the square of failure surface depth, consistent with observed landslide depth-area data.",

            "abstract": "For years, many studies have attempted to detect linkages between seasonal precipitation and remote ocean temperatures (called \"teleconnections\"). For example, the most widely studied climate phenomenon is the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Although ENSO generation primarily occurs in the west-central Pacific it causes short-term climate fluctuations in regions far from there. For instance, a variety of local studies have linked ENSO and Middle Eastern precipitation, although none specifically investigated the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In this study we investigate the role of Equatorial Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) on the winter time precipitation variability over the UAE and adjoining Middle East regions. The UAE is located in the eastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, dominated by arid to desert climates with low mean precipitation rates ranging from 40 mm/yr in the southern desert region to 160 mm/yr in the northeastern mountainous region with mean spatial annual rainfalls of about 78 mm/yr. Precipitation over the UAE are characterized by high spatial and temporal variability, with standard deviation occasionally exceeding the mean annual precipitation amounts. However, it is observed that statistically significant correlations exist between precipitation over the UAE and the Equatorial Pacific SSTs. The moisture budget analysis reveals the distinct change in the anomalous circulation (cyclonic and anti-cyclonic) associated with strong convergence and divergence of the moisture flux during warm and cold phases of ENSO respectively. Further, the composite analysis of upper troposheric zonal wind shows the equatorward shift (~2º latitude) of subtropical jet stream (STJ) over the Middle East during the warm phase of ENSO affecting the weather in the UAE. The findings suggest that the teleconnection linking ENSO and the precipitation over UAE and adjoining regions is mediated by the response of STJ to Rossby waves.",

            "abstract": "The variability in wind-generated electricity complicates its integration into the electrical grid at higher penetrations. This variability can be reduced by interconnecting wind farms across large regions. We investigate the effectiveness of this aggregation with two extensive data sets. The first consists of 44 years of hourly 10-m wind speeds from 117 stations spanning distances of 5000 km across Canada from the National Climate Data Archive of Environment Canada. The second dataset consists of four years of 5-minute averaged wind speeds from stations across 350 km of the northwestern US from the Bonneville Power Administration. This study seeks to quantify how time scale affects the drop-off of correlation with distance, and hence statistical independence and the degree of geographic diversity needed to provide smoothing on various time scales.\nTo eliminate non-stationarities, we filter both datasets to remove diurnal cycles and seasonal trends, after which we digitally high-pass filter the data on 0.25-2000 hour timescales relevant to power grid management. The wind speed data are then correlated between stations for each high-pass filter cut-off. In both datasets, the correlations between stations fall to zero with increasing station separation distance. Differences in inter-station azimuthal bearing account for a small but distinct fraction of the wide scatter in correlation vs. distance for the Canadian data set, with stations separated along a line 10° North of East-West being systematically less correlated than those perpendicular to that line.\nSimilarities between these two datasets reveal behavior that, if universal, could be particularly useful for grid management. Both datasets exhibit a correlation length that varies as l = l0(1+25/T)-2, where l0 is the correlation length without high-pass filtering and T is the high-pass cut-off (in hours). Since the inter-site separation needed for statistical independence falls for time scales shorter than 25 hours, faster fluctuations can be effectively smoothed by aggregating wind plants over smaller areas.",

We estimate a probability distribution for the predicted impact of changes in global surface air temperatures on future storm damages, using an ensemble of 296 estimates of the temperature-damage relationship from twenty studies. Our analysis produces three main empirical results. First, we find strong but not conclusive support for the hypothesis that climate change will cause damages from tropical cyclones and wind storms to increase, with most models (84 and 92 percent, respectively) predicting higher future storm damages due to climate change. Second, there is substantial variation in projected changes in losses across regions. Potential changes in damages are greatest in the North Atlantic basin, where the multi-model average predicts that a 2.5°C increase in global surface air temperature would cause hurricane damages to increase by 62 percent. The ensemble predictions for Western North Pacific tropical cyclones and European wind storms (extratropical cyclones) are approximately one third of that magnitude. Finally, our analysis shows that existing models of storm damages under climate change generate a wide range of predictions, ranging from moderate decreases to very large increases in losses.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate platform margins provide a rare insight into the chemistry of the ancient oceans. As subduction destroys most pelagic sediments, periplatform sediments, mixtures of platform and oceanic derived carbonates, often are the only extant records of ancient ocean conditions.\nDuring times when the Mg/Ca ratio of the oceans is elevated, such as during the present day, metastable aragonite is the favored form of calcium carbonate produced on the platform top. Consequently periplatform sediments formed during these times initially possess high amounts of aragonite and as such have a significantly higher diagenetic potential than periplatform sediments formed during calcite seas.\nThe rate and extent of diagenesis can be ascertained by petrographic, chemical and isotopic examination of the sediments. Numerous models can be employed to interpret the porewater and sediment chemistry. One such model involves the modeled loss of strontium over time compared to the amount available from sediment recrystallization. The degree of equilibration between sediments and their corresponding porewaters can also provide an estimate for recrystallization. Reactive transport models examine changes in the concentration of elements such as Sr and its isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) or calcium (44Ca/40Ca) in the pore fluids and the sediments.\nThe d18O of the sediments and pore water provides an additional mechanism with which to understand diagenesis as during burial the temperatures increases while the pore waters become evolved in response to the higher temperatures and mineral-water reactions. For example, in the case of the Bahamas, the pore waters from sites drilled during ODP 166 show a dramatic increase in the d18O with depth below the sea floor. This has been interpreted as being a result of carbonate dissolution and precipitation and increasingly higher temperatures. The d18O of the carbonates decrease over the same interval, presumably as a result of higher formation temperatures at depth. In this presentation we present D47 data from the ODP 166 sediment cores to test his interpretation. We have combined these results with estimates of sediment recrystallization based on Sr flux and d18O.",

Our previous study (Ma et al., 2014) demonstrated a three-regime relation of the variance of bedload transport flux across a wide range of sampling time scales. This study further explored the fluctuation spectrum of at-a-point bedload transport flux with different sampling times. We derived out analytical solutions of the third- and fourth-order moments of bedload transport flux, based on a physically-based formulation (Ancey et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2014). A formulation of the probability density function of bedload transport flux was constructed based on the 1st through 4th order moments. Experimental data were used to test against the solutions of both the moments and PDF. Interestingly, the higher order statistical moments were found to exhibit the three-regime pattern as well. This study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of bedload transport flux fluctuation and emphasizes its timescale-dependent features resulting from the discrete nature and correlated motion of bedload material. The correlated structures of bedload transport, such as bed forms and particle clusters, deserve to be further exploration in future studies.\nKeywords: bedload transport; stochastic theory; high order moment; fluctuation; time scale; PDF.\nAncey, C., Davison, A.

            "abstract": "Deforestation resulting from tree mortality by insects and disease may reduce transpiration demand and increase available water in mountain environments throughout. We tested this hypothesis using three large catchments (97-407 km2) located in the Snowy Mountains of Wyoming where hydrology is snowmelt dominated. An epidemic of spruce bark beetle and associated tree mortality emerged in 2006 and has since impacted 60 to 80% of basal area of the spruce-fir and mixed conifer forests. A 25-year continuous record (1998-2013) of daily snowfall, temperature, and stream discharge data between 1 April and 30 September of each year were available for each catchment. We used quantile regression and multivariate time series analysis first to control for the effects of temperature and snow water equivalent on the timing and magnitude of discharge and then to test for changes in discharge trends since 2006. We found no compelling evidence of changes in discharge trends associated with the onset of the beetle epidemic independent of snowmelt trends. Several factors could explain this apparent lack of “excess water” following tree mortality by insects and disease. Any increases in water may be scale dependent, a local phenomenon that does not transfer through large catchments. Other vegetation including young cohorts of affected tree species, shrubs, and herbaceous cover may respond robustly to the open canopy and utilize soil water previously consumed by the infected trees.",

            "abstract": "Detrital minerals within the stratigraphic record provide key constraints for a range of geologic problems, including the first order tectonic setting of basins, structural histories within orogens, changes in climate, and major drainage network reorganizations. Numerous provenance techniques exist for linking detrital minerals to their source areas, but the majority of these methods share an underlying assumption that sediment delivered to a basin is a representative sample of the bedrock geology of the source area. Satisfying this assumption requires that sediment production rates, i.e. erosion rates, of a source area are uniform throughout. In detail, erosion rates within a source area vary as a function of patterns of landscape evolution dictated by rock erodibility, climate, and relative uplift rate, thus long-term and transient biasing of sediment provenance records is expected. Biases associated with landscape evolution in response to changes in climate, tectonics, or strength of exposed rock can last 10s Myr. Previous work recognized a potential influence of differential erosion on provenance records, but the relative importance of this effect has proven difficult to quantify with field data. To address this, we are using a modified version of the CHILD landscape evolution model (LEM), which supports numerous lithologies with different erodibilities within a landscape. We perform a sensitivity analysis on the relative influence of rock strength and changes in climate or uplift rate on provenance records. We focus on U-Pb detrital zircon records because these data have seen wide adoption as a provenance tool and the refractory nature of zircon makes them less likely to be influenced by chemical weathering effects that are beyond the scope of this work. We plan to test several scenarios including variations in rock erodibility and temporal changes in climate or uplift rate. We will then use results from the LEM to calculate erosion rates from different lithologies within the landscape and generate synthetic detrital zircon age spectra. We will quantify the potential strength of any biasing effects by comparing the results of models with differing erodibilities or transient changes in climate and uplift to steady-state cases with uniform erodibilities.",

            "abstract": "Localized fast flows that impinge on the inner magnetosphere from the plasma sheet are observed to oscillate on time scales of minutes. The compression ahead of these flows will launch fast mode waves, while the velocity shears at the edges of these flows directly excite shear Alfvén waves. These waves, which are coupled by gradients in the Alfvén speed, have been suggested as a source for the Pi1 and Pi2 waves that are observed at both high and low latitudes in the ionosphere. A new three-dimensional model for the propagation of ULF waves in the dipolar region of the magnetosphere has been developed to model these coupled wave modes. This model includes a height-distributed ionospheric conductivity so that ionospheric fields can be realistically modeled, as well as a direct calculation of ground magnetic fields that can be compared with ground magnetometers. Results from this model show that a plasmaspheric resonance can be set up by waves with periods about 1 minute, and that field line resonances can be excited both inside and outside the plasmasphere. Waves from a source at 10 Earth radii reach the ionosphere with time delays between high and low latitudes of tens of seconds, with implications for the timing of substorm phenomena observed by spacecraft and by ground magnetometers and radars.",

            "abstract": "Carbon and oxygen isotopes measured on natural calcite crystals provide a record of paleo-environment conditions. Despite the importance of measuring stable isotopes in calcite for paleo-environment reconstructions, there is neither a general theory nor an experimental data set that fully separates the effects of pH, temperature, and precipitation rate on isotope discrimination during calcite growth. Many stable isotope studies of calcite have focused on either carbon or oxygen isotope compositions individually, but few have measured both carbon and oxygen isotope uptake in the same set of crystals. We are precipitating inorganic calcite across a range in temperature, pH, and precipitation rate to guide the development of a general theory for combined carbon and oxygen isotope uptake into calcite crystals grown on laboratory timescales.\nIn our experiments, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is added to an aqueous solution (15 mM CaCl2 + 5 mM NH4Cl) by CO2 bubbling. Once a critical supersaturation is reached, calcite crystals nucleate spontaneously and grow on the beaker walls. A key aspect of this experimental approach is that the δ13C of DIC is relatively constant throughout the crystal growth period, because there is a continuous supply of DIC from the CO2-bearing bubbles. Carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme promoting rapid equilibration of isotopes between DIC and water, was added to ensure that the solution remained isotopically equilibrated during calcite growth.\nWe have conducted experiments at T = 25°C and pH = 8.3 - 9.0. We observe that the fractionation of oxygen isotopes between calcite and water decreases with increasing pH, consistent with available data from experiments in which the enzyme carbonic anhydrase was used. Our results for carbon isotopes extend the available data set, which previously ranged from pH 6.62 to 7.75, to higher pH. At pH 8.3, we observe that calcite is isotopically heavier than DIC with respect to carbon isotopes by about 0.25‰. At pH 9.0, calcite is isotopically indistinguishable from, or perhaps slightly lighter than, DIC. We will present data from additional high-pH experiments and discuss the results in the context of recently developed ion-by-ion growth models for calcite.",

            "abstract": "The effects of velocity distribution functions (VDF) that exhibit\na power-law dependence on the high-energy tail have been the subject\nof intense research by the space plasma community. Such functions,\nknown as superthermal or kappa distributions, have been\nfound to provide a better fitting to the VDF measured by several spacecraft\nin the plasma environment of the solar wind. One of the problems that\nis being addressed on this new light is the temperature anisotropy\ndisplayed by solar wind protons and electrons on the vicinity of Earth's\nforeshock. The proton VDF show nonthermal features such as a very\nanisotropic core, an extended high-energy tail and a beam population,\naligned to the local magnetic field and separated from the core by\nspeeds on the order of the Alfvén speed. The existence of these nonthermal\ncharacteristics implies that the VDF contains a large amount of free\nenergy that can be used to excite the Alfvén waves present in the\nsolar wind. Conversely, the wave-particle interaction is important\nto determine the shape of the VDF, as in the case of obliquely-propagating\ndispersive Alfvén waves (DAW), which are relevant for the particle\nacceleration processes in the Earth's magnetosphere. In the literature,\nthe general treatment for waves excited by (bi-)Maxwellian plasmas\nis well-established. However, for kappa distributions, either isotropic\nor anisotropic, the wave characteristics have been studied mostly\nfor the limiting cases of purely parallel or perpendicular propagation.\nContributions for the general case of obliquely-propagating waves\nhave been scarcely reported so far. The absence of a general treatment\nprevents a complete analysis of the wave-particle interaction in superthermal\nplasmas, since some instabilities, such as the firehose instability,\ncan operate simultaneously both in the parallel and oblique directions.\nIn this work we obtain expressions for the dielectric tensor components\nand subsequent dispersion relations for oblique DAW resulting from\na kappa VDF. We employ an isotropic distribution, but the methods\nused here can be easily applied to more general anisotropic distributions,\nsuch as the bi-kappa or product-bi-kappa. The effect of the kappa\nindex and thermal corrections on the dispersion relations of the obliquely-propagating\nDAW is discussed.",

            "abstract": "The salinization of freshwater in the Northeastern United States from road salt application is well documented by the observed long-term increases in chloride concentrations in groundwater over the last fifty years. However, the processes controlling exchange of chloride between surface water and groundwater have not been fully investigated, particularly in urban streams where stream-groundwater interactions can be reduced due to bank armoring and channelization. Our research builds on previous findings that showed the potential for an urban riparian floodplain to buffer seasonal changes in chloride concentrations in an urban stream, resulting in smaller annual ranges of chloride in areas with intact riparian floodplains. A reach of Meadowbrook Creek, in Syracuse, New York, that is disconnected from the groundwater had large seasonal shifts in chloride concentration, varying from 2173 mg/L Cl- in the winter to 161.2 mg/L Cl- in the summer. This is in contrast to a downstream reach of the stream that receives groundwater discharge from a riparian floodplain, where chloride concentrations ranged from 657.0 mg/L in the winter to 252.0 mg/L in the summer. We originally hypothesized that winter snowmelt events caused overbank flooding of saline surface water, which recharged the floodplain groundwater, causing salinization. This saline water was then slowly discharged as baseflow throughout the year and was replaced with freshwater overbank events in the summer. However, a three dimensional model of the floodplain created using Visual MODFLOW indicates that surface water-groundwater interactions, such as hyporheic exchange, may have a greater control on winter salt input than overbank events, while summer flooding recharges the aquifer with freshwater. The model was compared to riparian aquifer samples collected from May 2013 until June 2014 to qualitatively study the impact of different types of surface water-groundwater interactions (e.g. groundwater recharge and discharge, hyporheic interaction) on salt storage and to identify the mechanisms by which urban riparian floodplains buffer seasonal variability of stream chloride concentrations in urban systems impacted by road salt.",

            "abstract": "In order for Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) to be effective, the rapid determination of magnitude (M) is important. At present, there are no methods which can accurately determine M even for extremely large events (ELE) for EEW, although a number of the methods have been suggested. In order to solve the problem, we use a simple approach derived from the fact that the time difference (Top) from the onset of the body wave to the arrival time of the peak acceleration amplitude of the body wave scales with M.\nTo test this approach, we use 15,172 accelerograms of regional earthquakes (most of them are M4-7 events) from the K-NET, as the first step. Top is defined by analyzing the S-wave in this step. The S-onsets are calculated by adding the theoretical S-P times to the P-onsets which are manually picked. As the result, it is confirmed that logTop has high correlation with Mw, especially for the higher frequency band (> 2Hz). The RMS of residuals between Mw and M estimated in this step is less than 0.5. In case of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, M is estimated to be 9.01 at 150 seconds after the initiation of the event.\nTo increase the number of the ELE data, we add the teleseismic high frequency P-wave records to the analysis, as the second step. According to the result of various back-projection analyses, we consider the teleseismic P-waves to contain information on the entire rupture process. The BHZ channel data of the Global Seismographic Network for 24 events are used in this step. 2-4Hz data from the stations in the epicentral distance range of 30-85 degrees are used following the method of Hara [2007]. All P-onsets are manually picked. Top obtained from the teleseimic data show good correlation with Mw, complementing the one obtained from the regional data.\nWe conclude that the proposed approach is quite useful for estimating reliable M for EEW, even for the ELE.",

            "abstract": "The Cassini Mission plans to execute a series of 22 high-inclination orbits close to Saturn's surface during its final 'Proximal Orbit' phase. This mission phase will begin in early 2016 and end in September of that year when the spacecraft makes its final plunge into Saturn's atmosphere. On these orbits, as the spacecraft flies through the gap between the planet and the inner edge of Saturn's closest ring, the D ring, continuous magnetic field measurements will be made. This unique orbit geometry will bring Cassini closer than ever to the planet and has the potential of substantially improving our knowledge of Saturn's internal planetary magnetic field. Cassini measurements over the course of the ten year mission have shown that the intrinsic field is very axisymmetric (Dougherty et al., 2005; Burton et al., 2009; Hao et al., 2011) yet planetary period oscillations are observed throughout the magnetosphere (Andrews et al., 2010, Southwood, 2011, Provan et al., 2013). In this talk we review our present understanding of Saturn's internal field and what we expect to learn based on measurements made during this unique mission phase.",

            "abstract": "Land cover changes can have a substantive effect on hydrologic response. Although land cover can change over time, parameter values that describe aspects of land cover are typically held constant in hydrologic modeling applications. This is often not realistic for periods of simulation that exceed even a relatively short time span of a decade. To address this shortcoming during the development of the US Geological Survey (USGS) National Hydrologic Model (NHM), simulations of historical land cover conditions are used to derive annually-varying sequences of hydrologic modeling parameters to describe the USGS Geospatial Fabric (GF) Feature Set (\nhttps://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/535eda80e4b08e65d60fc834\n). The GF is used by the NHM as the delineation of the modeling response units and routing network. The presentation will describe spatial and temporal trends in historical land cover and their impact on simulations of streamflow for the conterminous United States. It will also describe the prototype NHM workflow that is used to examine potential improvements in representation of non-stationarity in hydrologically important characteristics, which the authors seek to apply for both historical and future periods of simulation.",

            "abstract": "Newly acquired lidar digital topographic data acquired early 2014 from the four major faults of the Marlborough Fault System in northern South Island New Zealand allow measurement of fault offsets ~1 m to 100s of meters in unprecedented detail. The lidar dataset, acquired for us by the US National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) and New Zealand Aerial Mapping (NZAM), comprises 254 km of fault-parallel imagery in 1.2-to-1.5-km-wide swaths. These high-resolution data have an average shot density of ≥12 shots/m2, and encompass the central Wairau, central and eastern Awatere, western and eastern Clarence, and eastern Hope fault segments. In this study, we focus on detailed measurements of small (3-25 m) and large (10s-100s of meters) geomorphic offsets at multiple sites along the central Wairau and eastern Hope faults. In addition to showing compilations of these offset observations, we present examples of the lidar data at several key study sites where offsets at multiple scales are discernable. The precise fault offsets we measure at these sites, combined with post-IR IRSL (225°C) single-grain K-feldspar dating of fluvial terrace sediments, will provide the basis for determining incremental slip rates on these faults at a range of latest Pleistocene to late Holocene timescales. This project is part of a broader effort to generate incremental slip rates and paleoearthquake ages from all four of the main faults that comprise the Marlborough Fault System with the goal of further understanding how mechanically complementary faults work together to accommodate relative plate motions.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the mechanical and physical properties of fractured shales is of major importance in many fields such as the study of cap rock integrity or targets for radioactive waste disposal. In particular, relationships between fluid transport properties and textural anisotropy are critical. Therefore, these relations need to be investigated on real fault samples.\nThis study in collaboration with IRSN and Total deals with the mechanical and petrophysical characterization of core samples from the Tournemire Underground Research Laboratory in Southern France. Three boreholes crossing a major fault at different angles have been investigated. The cores retrieved were carefully sampled and give access to the three major areas defining the fault zone: 1) the intact zone, 2) the damaged zone and 3) the fault core.\nThe goal of the study is to perform several petrophysical measurements on the same specimens sampled at different distances from the fault core. These include multidirectional measurements of P and S waves under preserved humidity conditions, magnetic susceptibility measurements and pore size distribution characterization through the BET gas adsorption method. Some preliminary results show an evolution of the anisotropy with the distance to the fault core (anisotropy reversal).\nThe boreholes that were sampled were drilled to perform hydromechanical in situ testing, therefore one of our objectives is also to compare the hydromechanical properties obtained in the mesoscale experiments in situ to the petrophysical measurements in the lab.\nMechanical tests were also performed on intact samples in order to understand the mechanisms of deformation of the studied shale, depending on the orientation of the maximal applied stress with respect to bedding.",

            "abstract": "The design of seismic networks for the monitoring of induced seismicity is of critical importance. The recent introduction of regulations in various locations around the world (with more upcoming) has created a need for a priori confirmation that certain performance standards are met. We develop a tool to assess two key measures of network performance without an earthquake catalogue: magnitude of completeness and location accuracy. Site noise measurements are taken at existing seismic stations or as part of a noise survey. We then interpolate between measured values to determine a noise map for the entire region. The site noise is then summed with the instrument noise to determine the effective station noise at each of the proposed station locations. Location accuracy is evaluated by generating a covariance matrix that represents the error ellipsoid from the travel time derivatives (Peters and Crosson, 1972). To determine the magnitude of completeness we assume isotropic radiation and mandate a minimum signal to noise ratio for detection. For every gridpoint, we compute the Brune spectra for synthetic events and iterate to determine the smallest magnitude event that can be detected by at least four stations. We apply this methodology to an example network. We predict the magnitude of completeness and the location accuracy and compare the predicted values to observed values generated from the existing earthquake catalogue for the network. We discuss the effects of hypothetical station additions and removals on network performance to simulate network expansions and station failures. The ability to predict hypothetical station performance allows for the optimization of seismic network design and enables prediction of network performance even for a purely hypothetical seismic network. This allows the operators of networks for induced seismicity monitoring to be confident that performance criteria are met from day one of operations.",

            "abstract": "Recently there is much interest in bridging the gap between daily weather forecasts out to two weeks lead-time and seasonal climate forecasts and prediction of extremes or rare events such as for heat and precipitation at longer lead times. While predictability, defined as the magnitude of the climate signal relative to the magnitude of noise is small for subseasonal forecasts, climate extremes result from both an increase in the magnitude of the forced climate signal and chance occurrence from random noise. Although the skill of subseasonal forecasts is limited, the greater magnitude of the signal of climate extremes may result in increased predictability, if uncertainty due to noise increases more slowly than the signal magnitude. Using subseasonal ensemble model forecasts (CFSv2 and ECMWF for weeks 2 through 4, or NMME models for months 1 and 2), this study will examine the strength of the signal in subseasonal MME forecasts for extreme events relative to the strength of the signal for non-extreme events. Variations in ensemble spread or model-predicted uncertainty, as well as correlation and mean square error between extreme event and non-extreme event forecasts will be examined. MME forecasts will be partitioned by both observed and predicted extremes.\nWhile the skill of weather forecasts rely to a great extent on the initial state of the atmosphere, seasonal forecasts derive signals from the evolution of slowly varying boundary conditions, such as sea surface temperatures, and processes of climate variability. Climate change on multi-decadal timescales provides an additional source of predictability, as prediction of subseasonal climate variability will depend on signals due to any climate process with a subseasonal timescale or longer. Subseasonal predictability has been shown to arise from MJO and ENSO (Johnson et al., 2014). Differences in MME spread, correlation, and mean square error will be used to examine changes in predictability related to ENSO and climate change, while assessing the ability of models to reproduce observed signals related to climate processes.\nJohnson, N.

However, in order to deploy and test prototypes, and commercial installations, marine hydrokinetic (MHK) devices must meet strict regulatory guidelines that determine the maximum amount of noise that can be generated and sets particular thresholds for determining disturbance and injury caused by noise. An accurate model for predicting the propagation of a MHK source in a real-life hydro-acoustic environment has been established. This model will help promote the growth and viability of marine, water, and hydrokinetic energy by confidently assuring federal regulations are meet and harmful impacts to marine fish and wildlife are minimal. Paracousti, a finite difference solution to the acoustic equations, was originally developed for sound propagation in atmospheric environments and has been successfully validated for a number of different geophysical activities. The three-dimensional numerical implementation is advantageous over other acoustic propagation techniques for a MHK application where the domains of interest have complex 3D interactions from the seabed, banks, and other shallow water effects. A number of different cases for hydro-acoustic environments have been validated by both analytical and numerical results from canonical and benchmark problems. This includes a variety of hydrodynamic and physical environments that may be present in a potential MHK application including shallow and deep water, sloping, and canyon type bottoms, with varying sound speed and density profiles. With the model successfully validated for hydro-acoustic environments more complex and realistic MHK sources from turbines and/or arrays can be modeled.",

However, slope failure initiation, acceleration of motion and mass-transport dynamics of submarine landslides, which are all key to assess their tsunamigenic potential or impact on offshore infrastructure, cannot be conclusively deduced from geometric expression and acoustic characteristics of geophysical data sets alone, but cores and in situ data from the subsurface are needed to complement our understanding of submarine landslide dynamics. Here we present data and results from drilling, logging and coring thick mass-transport deposits (MTDs) in the Nankai Trough accretionary prism during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expeditions 333 and 338. We integrate analysis on 3D seismic and Logging While Drilling (LWD) data sets, with data from laboratory analysis on core samples (geotechnical shear experiments, X-ray Computed Tomography (X-CT), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of deformation indicators, and magnetic fabric analysis) to study nature and mode of deformation and dynamics of mass transport in this active tectonic setting. In particular, we show that Fe-S filaments commonly observed on X-ray CT data of marine sediments, likely resulting from early diagenesis of worm burrows, are folded in large MTDs and display preferential orientation at their base. The observed lineation has low dip and is interpreted as the consequence of shear along the basal surface, revealing a new proxy for strain in soft sediments that can be applied to cores that reach through the entire depth of MTDs. Shear deformation in the lower part of thick MTDs is also revealed from AMS data, which – in combination with other paleo-magnetic data - is used to reconstruct strain and transport direction of the landslides.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic and seismic studies over the past decade have revealed a wide range of slow earthquake phenomena including long- and short-term slow slip events (SSEs), non-volcanic tremor, low and very-low frequency earthquakes (LFEs, V-LFEs) in major subduction zones. Despite much progress, the physical mechanisms of SSEs and seismic slow earthquakes and how these phenomena relate to each other are still not clear. The Japanese GPS network (GEONET) with ~1450 stations provide a unique opportunity to study subduction zone dynamics and to understand these different faulting behaviors at various spatiotemporal scales. We extended our reanalysis of GPS position time series for the entire GEONET from 1996 to 2014 using JPL GIPSY/OASIS-II based GPS Network Processor and raw data provided by Geospatial Information Authority of Japan and Caltech. The reestimated JPL precise GPS orbits, GMF troposphere model, and single receiver phase ambiguity resolution strategy were used in the analysis. The resultant ~18 years position estimates show good consistency and reduced scattering over the entire time period compared to prior analysis. We perform a systematic time series analysis to identify and correct the offsets caused by earthquakes, instrument and other unknown sources. We image the spatiotemporal variation of slip transients and investigate how they interact with seismic slow earthquakes. Our application to recurrent long-term SSEs in Bungo Channel region shows these events share the similar spatial distribution with regard to interplate coupling model, consistent with their recurrent nature. The universal modulation of transient slip rate on downdip LFEs/tremors and their different spatial patterns and moment release suggest that they are not different manifestations of the same physical process. There is considerable difference in space-time details of these slip transients, indicating that these recurrent events are not identical. We find a clear difference in temporal correspondence between transient slip rate and up-dip V-LFEs, possibly reflecting different triggering mode from that of LFEs/tremors. The high quality of GPS position time series also help reveal much smaller events over the “quiet” inter-SSE period, showing that not all SSEs are accompanied by LFE/tremors.",

These were clearest in a layer extending from ~300 to 600 m depth and had periods near 3 weeks. Phase propagation was upward.\nMeasurements from a time series at the equator, four meridional transects and one zonal transect are used to identify the oscillation as a Yanai wave packet and to establish its dominant frequency and vertical wavelength. The Doppler shift is accounted for, so that measured wave properties are translated into the reference frame of the mean zonal flow. We take advantage of the fact that, in the depth range where the wave signal was clearest, the time-averaged current and buoyancy frequency were nearly uniform with depth, allowing application of the classical theoretical representation of vertically propagating waves.\nUsing the theory, we estimate wave properties that are not directly measured, such as the group velocity and the zonal wavelength and phase speed. The theory predicts a vertical energy flux that is comparable to that carried by midlatitude near-inertial waves. Also predicted is an equatorward heat flux that is balanced, in the limit of a linear plane wave, by a wave-driven Eulerian mean flow. The volume transport carried by this mean flow is in turn balanced by the Stokes drift.",

            "abstract": "Sprites are large, luminous electrical discharges in the upper atmosphere caused by intense cloud-to-ground lightning flashes. They manifest a possible, impulsive coupling mechanism between low atmospheric regions and the upper atmosphere. Their dynamics are governed by filamentary plasma discharges, of tens to hundreds of meter wide, known as streamers. The propagation properties of sprite streamers have been well studied by past work [e.g., Liu, et al., JGR, 114, A00E02, 2009; Liu et al, JGR, 114, A00E03, 2009; Luque and Ebert, Nat. Geosci., 2, 757, 2009; Liu, GRL, 37, L04102, 2010; Luque and Ebert, GRL, 37, L06806, 2010]. However, how sprite streamers are initiated is not well understood. Recent high-speed images show that mesospheric/lower ionospheric structures are frequently involved in initiation of sprite streamers [e.g., Stenbaek-Nielsen et al., Surv. Geophys., 34, 769, 2013; Qin et al., Nat. Comm., 5, 2014]. Although earlier theoretical and numerical studies routinely used strong plasma inhomogeneities to initiate streamers, it is only recently that inhomogeneities are concluded to be required for sprite streamer initiation [e.g., Qin et al., JGR, 116, A06305, 2011; Liu et al., PRL, 109, 025002, 2012; Kosar et al., JGR, 117, A08328, 2012; Kosar et al, GRL, 40, 6282, 2013]. However, the inhomogeneities used in various models are rather ad hoc and often unrealistic.\nIn this talk, we present numerical simulations to show naturally-existing mesospheric structures, such as those produced by gravity waves via instability and breaking [e.g., Fritts and Alexander, Rev. Geophys., 41, 1003, 2003], can initiate sprite streamers under the influence of the measurement-inferred lightning field. Evidence from high-speed video observations supporting this theory is discussed. This mechanism naturally explains many aspects of observed sprite streamer initiation including variability in the delay of sprite initiation, sprites caused by weak lightning, optical signatures of streamer initiation, initiation of isolated streamers from different sites, etc. In addition, the dependence of the initiation process on the mesospheric structures can potentially be utilized to study those structures at sprite initiation altitudes, which at present are nearly impossible to be observed by other means.",

            "abstract": "Radars that transmit and receive signals in polarizations aligned both horizontal and vertical to the horizon collect a number of measurements. The relation both between these measurements and between measurements and desired microphysical quantities (such as rainfall rate) is complicated due to a number of scattering mechanisms. The result is that there ends up being an intractable number of often incompatible techniques for extracting geophysical insight. This presentation will discuss methods developed by the Atmospheric Measurement Climate (ARM) Research Facility to streamline the creation of application chains for retrieving rainfall properties for the purposes of fine scale model evaluation. By using a Common Data Model (CDM) approach and working in the popular open source Python scientific environment analysis techniques such as Linear Programming (LP) can be bought to bear on the task of retrieving insight from radar signals. This presentation will outline how we have used these techniques to detangle polarimetric phase signals, estimate a three-dimensional precipitation field and then objectively compare to cloud resolving model derived rainfall fields from the NASA/DoE Mid-Latitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E). All techniques show will be available, open source, in the Python-ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART).",

            "abstract": "The Sesan, Srepok and Sekong (3S) rivers are the farthest downstream tributaries to the Mekong, and contribute nearly one quarter of the river’s annual water discharge. Very limited sediment monitoring has been carried out in the region, but aggressive plans for hydropower development in the 3S are likely to affect sediment loads and compromise their crucial role in the geomorphology, ecology, and agriculture of the Mekong floodplain. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to estimate the uncertainty and variability in the sediment contribution from the 3S. We used a multiyear dataset of water discharge and suspended solids to estimate monthly sediment loads at four key locations around the 3S. Surface runoff, erosion, and sediment transport were computed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in an area covering 101,400 km2. The model was calibrated and subject to a global sensitivity analysis. Overall, the model was able to adequately characterize interannual and monthly patterns in suspended sediment loads. We estimated that 61% percent of mean monthly sediment loads from the 3S are discharged in the early rainy season months of July and August. Subbasins in the upper Sekong were shown to be particularly prone to erosion. The Sekong and Sesan were found to contribute similar sediment loads (4.5 ± 2.0 and 4.8 ± 4.2 Mt yr-1, respectively), which are considerably larger than contribution from the Srepok (1.2 ± 0.5 Mt yr-1). The model revealed the important the role of sediment deposition in the lower sections of the 3S, as 46-78% of the annual sediment eroded is not discharged through the 3S outlet. Annual sediment load from the 3S into the Mekong River varied from 2.2 to 18.5 Mt yr-1. This study would facilitate the assessment of uncertainty and variability of ongoing monitoring and modeling studies in this important tributary where sediment transport is rapidly changing as a result of deforestation, hydropower development, and the changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Advances in process technology have drastically reduced the cost of manufacturing almost every type of sensor and micro-controller, putting low-to-mid grade sensor technology in the reach of educators and hobbyists. We demonstrate how a low cost magnetometer and an Arduino micro-controller can be used in education. Students can easily connect the sensor to the Arduino and collect three-component magnetic field data. Experiments can easily be turned into long-term monitoring projects by connecting sensors to the internet and providing an Internet-of-Things interface to store and to display the data in near-real time. Low-cost sensors are generally much noisier than their research grade counterparts, but can still provide an opportunity for students to learn about fundamental concepts such as signal quality, sampling, averaging, and filtering and to gain hands-on, concrete experience with observations. Sensors can be placed at different locations and compared both qualitatively and quantitatively. For example, with an inexpensive magnetometer, students can examine diurnal magnetic field variations and look for magnetic storms. Magnetic field orientation can be calculated and compared to the predicted geomagnetic field orientation at a given location. Data can be stored in simple text files to facilitate analysis with any convenient package. We illustrate the idea using Python notebooks, allowing students to explore the data interactively and to learn the basic principles of programming and reproducible research. Using an Arduino encourages students to interact with open-source data collection hardware and to experiment with ways to quickly, cheaply, and effectively measure the environment. Analysis of these data can lead to a deeper understanding of both geoscience and data processing.",

            "abstract": "In contrast with the western United States (US), the eastern US has been less a focus for detailed passive seismological imaging of the crust and upper mantle. However, in the last few years, the EarthScope-USArray Transportable Array has substantially increased the available high-quality observations that sample the “stable” regions of North America with a roughly uniform ~70km spacing. The result is an unprecedented opportunity to illuminate the subsurface and to explore how upper crustal phenomena relate to deeper crustal and upper mantle structure and processes, which likely exert some control on the regional tectonics. But even with such a fine network, tightly constraining the subsurface 3D geologic variations is a challenge. We combine the complementary sensitivities P-wave receiver functions, surface-wave dispersion, and wavenumber-filtered gravity variations to constrain lateral variations in shear-wave speed beneath the eastern US and southeastern Canada. The receiver-function wavefield is interpolated and smoothed to equalize the lateral sensitivity of the receiver functions and the surface-wave dispersion and to simplify the receiver functions. Combining information from adjacent stations through interpolation suppresses poorly sampled and difficult to interpret back-azimuthal variations and allows the stable extraction of the key features in the receiver-function wavefield. We use a hybrid 3D, multi-objective inversion that provides more constraints than individual inversions, and generally produces a more robust estimate of the subsurface structure. The subsurface model is parameterized with shear-wave speed (the primary sensitivity of the surface-wave dispersion and P-wave receiver functions) within one-degree cells that are modeled using 1D seismic calculations. We relate P-wave speed and density variations to shear-speed using velocity ratios and density-velocity relations and we constrain the 3D variations to be laterally and vertically smooth. Preliminary results are dominated by thick sedimentary accumulations along the Mississippi Embayment. Within the continental interior and the ancient Appalachians the crust is thicker and faster. We present more details on the inversion approach and discuss our 3D model in light of the tectonic history of the study area.",

            "abstract": "Basin-scale estimates of the water budget of the North American Great Lakes are based on a geographically broad (and, in some areas, relatively sparse) monitoring network that spans the United States-Canadian international border, and a limited ensemble of models. Of the various components of the Great Lakes water budget, snow water equivalent (and its contribution to runoff) represents one that is estimated by a regional rainfall-runoff simulation model (the NOAA large basin runoff model, or LBRM) and by a data assimilation model (via the NOAA National Operational Hydrological Remote Sensing Center Snow Data Assimilation System). Importantly, both products are employed in regional operational water budget and water level forecasts, including those developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers, the New York Power Authority, and Ontario Power Generation.\nWhile these forecasts are periodically evaluated for skill based on a comparison between water level projections and observations, we know of no study that has either compared LBRM simulations of SWE to corresponding NOHRSC estimates, or explored the potential benefits of assimilating NOHRSC estimates into the LBRM and propagating those benefits into water level-based management decisions. To address this gap in research and operational knowledge, we compare simulated and \"observed\" SWE for select sub-basins in the Great Lakes region. We refer to the NOHRSC-SNODAS product as an \"observed\" estimate of SWE because it combines airborne and surface measurements with satellite derived snow information and model simulations.\nOur findings indicate general agreement between LBRM-simulated and observation-based estimates of SWE, particularly with respect to the timing of most individual events and the timing of peak SWE. However, we find discontinuities in the timing and duration of snowmelt, the magnitude of the peak runoff, and the overall cumulative seasonal total runoff. Finally, we propagate these estimates of SWE into runoff simulations, and compare those to observed runoff to assess the relative benefits of alternatives for assimilating SWE observations into operational hydrological forecasting.",

            "abstract": "Networks for measuring ambient fine particle (PM2.5) mass concentrations in California have undergone major changes between 1988 and 2013, transitioning from 24-hour average filter-based sampling to beta attenuation monitors (BAM) that provide hourly measurements on a continuous basis. Over the last decade, between 2003 and 2013, the number of routine PM2.5 measurement sites increased from 10 to 19 in the San Francisco Bay area, from 15 to 27 in the San Joaquin Valley, and from 17 to 22 in the Los Angeles area. The fraction of days with PM2.5 data in each air basin also increased substantially, from 44-50% to 74-89% of site-days per year, due mainly to increased reliance on BAM in place of filter-based sampling.\nThis research explores variations of PM2.5 on various time scales, using PM mass measurements from three major California air basins mentioned above. Regression analysis of collocated BAM and filter-based measurements of PM2.5, shows BAM reads higher than the filter data by 3-6 µg/m3. Most monitoring sites show clear downward trends in PM2.5 concentrations over time, especially in the Los Angeles area where concentrations have decreased by more than 50% since the 1990s. In most cases, PM2.5 concentrations are elevated in winter compared to summer, with basin-wide average increases of about a factor of two for both the San Francisco Bay area and the San Joaquin Valley. Winter season increases are prominent at night due to wood-burning and stagnant atmospheric conditions. The reverse is true at inland sites in southern California, which see reductions in PM2.5 during the in winter. Weekend concentrations are slightly lower than on weekdays. Reductions of ~10% in weekend PM2.5 relative to mid-week values are observed in the San Francisco Bay area and the San Joaquin Valley. Larger reductions of ~25% in PM2.5 are observed on weekends at traffic-dominated sites such as West Oakland. Weekday-weekend differences in PM2.5 mass have been difficult to observe in past studies because the changes are often relatively small, and because much of the filter-based sampling has been done on a once every third or sixth day schedule. In contrast, BAM provides daily data and therefore increased statistical power in detecting subtle effects such as weekday-weekend differences.",

            "abstract": "We describe a comprehensive project for developing climate information and decision support / climate risk management tools in Lao PDR, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Mechanisms are developed for bringing the benefits of these tools to both policy makers and poor rural farmers, with the goal of enabling better management, at the farm level, of the risks associated with climate variability and change. The project comprises several interwoven threads, differentially applied in the different study regions. These include data management and quality control, development of seasonal forecast capabilities, use of dynamic cropping calendars and climate advisories, the development of longer-term climate information for both past and future and a weather index insurance component. Stakeholder engagement and capacity building served as reinforcing and complementary elements to all components. In this talk we will provide a project overview, show how the various components fit together and describe some lessons learned in this attempt to promote the uptake of actionable climate information from farmer to policy level.\nThe applied research project was led by the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) at Columbia University with funding from the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and in close collaboration with our regional partners at the Centre for Climate Risk and Opportunity Management in Southeast Asia Pacific (at Bogor Agricultural University in Indonesia), Indonesia’s National Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG), Lao PDR's National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI), Laotian Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH), WorldFish Center, Bangladesh Meteorology Department (BMD), and CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).",

            "abstract": "We propose a new Receiver Function migration method to image the subducting plate in the western US that utilizes the US array and regional network data. While the well-developed CCP (common conversion point) poststack migration is commonly used for such imaging; our method applies a 3D prestack depth migration approach. The traditional CCP and post-stack depth mapping approaches implement the ray tracing and moveout correction for the incoming teleseismic plane wave based on a 1D earth reference model and the assumption of horizontal discontinuities. Although this works well in mapping the reflection position of relatively flat discontinuities (such as the Moho or the LAB), CCP is known to give poor results in the presence of lateral volumetric velocity variations and dipping layers. Instead of making the flat layer assumption and 1D moveout correction, seismic rays are traced in a 3D tomographic model with the Fast Marching Method. With travel time information stored, our Kirchoff migration is done where the amplitude of the receiver function at a given time is distributed over all possible conversion points (i.e. along a semi-elipse) on the output migrated depth section. The migrated reflectors will appear where the semicircles constructively interfere, whereas destructive interference will cancel out noise. Synthetic tests show that in the case of a horizontal discontinuity, the prestack Kirchoff migration gives similar results to CCP, but without spurious multiples as this energy is stacked destructively and cancels out. For 45 degree and 60 degree dipping discontinuities, it also performs better in terms of imaging at the right boundary and dip angle. This is especially useful in the Western US case, beneath which the Juan de Fuca plate subducted to ~450km with a dipping angle that may exceed 50 degree. While the traditional CCP method will underestimate the dipping angle, our proposed imaging method will provide an accurate 3D subducting plate image without heavy computation. This will provide further thoughts for geodynamic research on the evolution of western US.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of long-term present-day melting rate of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is important towards understanding anthropogenic climate change. However, ice-sheet mass change at spatial scales longer than 350 km has been monitored only since 2002 by the GRACE twin-satellites, whose current data span of ~10 years are insufficient to infer the long-term melting rate with significant interannual or longer variations. Continuous polar observing satellite radar altimeter data became available since the 1990s, and have more than an order of magnitude (~50 km) better in spatial resolutions than GRACE. However, radar or laser altimetry measures ice-sheet elevation or volume changes and has no knowledge of the firn or ice column density of the measured ice-sheets. Here we estimate the firn density by combining GRACE and Envisat data—GRACE data provide mass changes, while Envisat data provide volume changes—with the objective of estimating higher resolution mass changes using altimeter data at the interannual scale. We use the interannual variation in both data sets, which is based on the assumption that the influence of the top snow layer is most likely in seasonal or shorter period band, primarily because the published contemporary density estimates via linear trends are unreasonably large. GRACE and Envisat data from January 2003 through December 2009 are used. We find high correlation on the order of 0.7 over 60% of the GrIS, in particular over western Greenland. Significant and anomalous negative correlations are found in regions in northeast and southeast regions. Similar negative or small interannual variation correlations in these regions are found between GRACE and snow depth from ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) model or from the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO2/GR). For the positively correlated interannual variation regions which cover over 60% of Greenland, the estimated composite firn/ice density values have a range of 383.7±50.9 to 567.9±42.0 kg m–3. The definitive explanation of these negatively correlated regions in interannual variations at present remains elusive. After ignoring the GRACE-density estimates in these anomalous regions, we present our estimate of the high-resolution interannual mass balance of the GrIS based on density-corrected Envisat altimetry, 2003–2010.",

            "abstract": "Little of our understanding of crystallization kinetics has been directly derived from studies of natural samples. We examine crystallization of rhyolitic melts by quantifying spherulite sizes and number densities in obsidian collected from Yellowstone caldera using high-resolution x-ray computed tomography (CT) imagery. Spherulites are spherical to ellipsoidal masses of intergrown alkali feldspar and quartz in a radiating, fibrous structure. They are thought to form in response to relatively rapid crystallization of melt in response to large amounts of undercooling. Recent research using compositional gradients that form outside of spherulites has suggested that they nucleate at 700 to 500 ˚C and their growth slows exponentially until it eventually ceases at ~400 ˚C. By quantifying spherulite textures, and using those temperature constraints, we derive new kinetic information regarding crystallization in natural rhyolitic systems. We find that spherulites range from 0.2 to 12.3 mm in diameter, and are 0.004 to 49.5 mm3 in volume. Such values generate number densities of 70 to 185 spherulites cm-3. Histograms of size display positively skewed distributions indicating small spherulites are far more abundant than larger ones. Those distributions imply nucleation rates change as a function of temperature. At higher temperatures where the melt is undercooled by 400-500 ˚C, nucleation is rare and growth is favored. With decreasing temperature, nucleation rates increase rapidly until cold enough temperatures are reached that diffusion limits crystallization and causes it to cease (undercoolings of ~650 ˚C). Assuming a cooling rate for the host obsidian of 10-5 ˚C s-1, then overall spherulite nucleation rates are 0.01 to 0.03 spherulites cm-3 hour-1.",

            "abstract": "Water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) is important both radiatively and chemically. However, the processes that control the distribution and phase of water in this region of the atmosphere are not well understood. This is especially true at mid-latitudes where several different dynamical mechanisms are capable of influencing UTLS water vapor concentrations. Identifying and quantifying these mechanisms and understanding how these processes will change in response to anthropogenic climate forcing is a critical challenge facing the atmospheric chemistry and climate community.\nThe Harvard Water Vapor (HWV) instrument has repeatedly observed moist layers in the summertime extra-tropical lower stratosphere, with some present well into the stratospheric overworld (potential temperature >380 K) over the continental U.S. Water vapor mixing ratios in these layers are elevated by several ppmv above the nominal background, with the magnitude of the enhancement diminishing with altitude. The present analysis utilizes high resolution in situ data acquired during the SEAC4RS mission in August of 2013, to describe encounters with elevated concentrations of water vapor in the overworld stratosphere over North America that show evidence of deep convection as their source. The plume observed over the Great Lakes on August 27, 2013, represents the largest enhancement (~10 ppmv) observed in situ between 400 K and 420 K. Trajectory calculations link these plumes to specific convective storms identified in NEXRAD radar data and in GOES satellite infrared imagery. It is theorized that ice lofted in summertime deep convective storm systems rapidly evaporates in the under-saturated stratosphere and provides a means of significantly elevating water vapor, with a minimal perturbation to other trace species.\nThe in situ and remote data sets, in combination with trajectory analyses, are then used to describe in greater detail the spatial extent, water vapor content and lifetime of these events. Through this strategic combination of data products, we address questions regarding the frequency and distribution of these convective penetrations, and discuss the potential for deep convective storms to contribute to the water vapor budget, and more generally impact the chemical composition of this region.",

            "abstract": "Borecores collected from the east-central region of Alberta, Canada have recently been sub-sampled and studied for paleomagnetic remanence characteristics. A preliminary magnetostratigraphy has been established for sediments previously assumed to represent multiple continental (Laurentide) glaciations, but for which no geochronology was available for the pre-late Wisconsin units. Comprised primarily of tills and lesser thicknesses of interbedded glacio-lacustrine and outwash sediments, the record is extensive, reaching to thicknesses of 300 metres within buried valleys. Most of the sampled units are not accessible from outcrop, and their sedimentology and stratigraphy is derived from core data only. The lowermost tills are reversely magnetized in the majority of borecores sampled to date. These tills are underlain by Empress Formation sediments and/or Colorado Group shales, and overlain by normally magnetized sediments. Both tills contain substantial weathering horizons at their surface, suggesting that interglacial or nonglacial conditions persisted for some time after each period of till deposition. Whether these tills represent a single Early Pleistocene glaciation, or perhaps two, will require additional borecore measurements. This new record of Early Pleistocene glaciation(s) in east-central Alberta places the westernmost extent of earliest Laurentide ice some 300 km farther westward from its previously established limit in the Saskatoon to Regina region of the western Canadian prairies, but still well short of the all-time limit and elevation reached during the Late Wisconsin (Late Pleistocene) in the foothills of the Alberta and Montana Rocky Mountains.\nKey Words: East-Central Alberta glacial history, Early Pleistocene (Laurentide) glaciation, till magnetostratigraphy, Quaternary history of Western Canadian Prairies, continental glaciations of North America.",

While pollution remediation efforts are continuously improving, the most effective treatment remains to limit the source.

In an effort to determine appropriate remediation measures and as little is currently known about the pollutants cycling through the lake, the NYS DEC is conducting a large scale investigation to fully understand how Cayuga Lake is impacted by sediment and nutrient pollution.\nThis study, as part of the greater effort, explores the contribution of phosphorous and sediment from the surrounding tributaries of Cayuga Lake. The evaluation will include an analysis of the sources and transport pathways of these pollutants in the Cayuga Lake watershed using ArcSWAT. Preliminary execution of the model was carried out on two large watersheds thought to be major contributors of phosphorous to the lake. Data from a number of sources are being used to ensure that model outputs provide an accurate understanding of the watersheds. The calibrated model, combined with information from other sources, will help the NYS DEC determine if a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) is an appropriate remediation tool for the south end of Cayuga Lake.",

            "abstract": "Characterizing subsurface hydraulic properties is essential for predicting flow and transport, and thus, for making informed decisions, such as selection and execution of a groundwater remediation strategy; however, obtaining accurate estimates at the necessary resolution with quantified uncertainty is an ongoing challenge. For over a decade, the development of hydraulic tomography (HT) – i.e., conducting a series of discrete interval hydraulic tests, observing distributed pressure signals, and analyzing the data through inversion of all tests together – has shown promise as a subsurface imaging method. Numerical and laboratory 3-D HT studies have enhanced and validated such methodologies, but there have been far fewer 3-D field characterization studies.\nWe use 3-D transient hydraulic tomography (3-D THT) to characterize a highly heterogeneous unconfined alluvial aquifer at an active industrial site near Assemini, Italy. With 26 pumping tests conducted from 13 isolated vertical locations, and pressure responses measured at 63 spatial locations through five clusters of continuous multichannel tubing, we recorded over 800 drawdown curves during the field testing. Selected measurements from each curve were inverted in order to obtain an estimate of the distributed hydraulic conductivity field K(x) as well as uniform (“effective”) values of specific storage Ss and specific yield Sy. The estimated K values varied across seven orders of magnitude, suggesting that this is one of the most heterogeneous sites at which HT has ever been conducted. Furthermore, these results are validated using drawdown observations from seven independent tests with pumping performed at multiple locations other than the main pumping well. The validation results are encouraging, especially given the uncertain nature of the problem. Overall, this research demonstrates the ability of 3-D THT to provide high-resolution of structure and local K at a non-research site at the scale of a contaminant source zone.\nWe would like to especially thank Michael Cardiff, Carsten Leven, Francesco Chidichimo, and Riccardo Borella for their insightful and tireless efforts as part of the field campaign for this research.",

            "abstract": "Alluvial basins in Phoenix experience surface deformation due to large volumes of fluid withdrawn and added to aquifers. The spatiotemporal pattern of deformation is controlled by pumping and recharge rates, hydraulic boundaries, and properties such as diffusivity, transmissivity, and hydraulic conductivity. Land subsidence can cause damages to structures, earth fissures, and a permanent loss of aquifer storage; effects are often apparent after the onset of sustained events. Improving our understanding of the source and mechanisms of deformation is important for risk management and future planning. Monitoring subsidence and uplift using InSAR allows for detailed, dense spatial coverage with less than one cm measurement precision. Envisat data acquired from 2003-11 includes 38 ascending and 53 descending SAR images forming 239 and 423 coherent interferograms respectively. Displacement is separated into vertical and horizontal components by accounting for the satellite look angle and combining ascending and descending line of sight (LOS) data. Vertical velocity from Envisat reveals subsidence reaching -1.84 cm/yr and 0.60 cm/yr uplift. ERS 1&2 satellites delivered useful data from 1992-97, comprised of 6 ascending and 12 descending SAR images. Ascending images form 7 interferograms with LOS velocity from -1.23 to 1.65 cm/yr; descending images produce 25 interferograms with LOS velocity rates from -1.40 to 0.75 cm/yr. InSAR time series are compared with hydraulic head levels from 33 observation wells. Wavelet decomposition is used to separate the long-term, inelastic components from cyclic, elastic signals in InSAR and well level data. The specific storage coefficient, a parameter used in poroelastic models, is estimated as the ratio of cyclic vertical deformation to the equivalent component of the well level time series. Poroelastic theory assumes that pore pressure and fluid mass within the aquifer change during fluid withdrawal, while the relatively impermeable aquifer boundaries remain unchanged; thus, long-term aquifer compaction varies linearly with the decline in pore pressure. Performing inversion analysis, subsurface pressure changes are decoupled and calculated from deformation and well level data. The pressure front can then be used in forward modeling to project future patterns.",

            "abstract": "In the spring of 2014, a pulse of high flow was released from Morelos Dam into the dry streambed of the Colorado River in its former delta. Although tiny in relation to typical delta floods of a century ago, this was the first flow to reach the sea since the 1998. Because much of the modern delta channel is now usually dry, this pulse flow was significant in its intention to benefit the riparian ecosystem. Mobilization of sediment in the typically dry sand bed and reworking of the channel bed and banks may provide opportunities for native plant establishment. Significant sediment transport also has the potential to affect infrastructure. Quantification of these geomorphic processes is thus critical in the planning of future pulse flows, should they occur. We used repeat measurements of channel geometry and bed sediment grain size, LiDAR, and measurements of suspended sediment transport to characterize geomorphic change and constrain the sediment mass balance during the pulse flow. We focused on the Limitrophe reach of the river, which represents the international border for 30 km downstream from Morelos Dam. The river corridor in the Limitrophe consists of an upstream segment in which nearby levees and irrigation return flow results in a narrow, wetted channel (active width ~25 m) with dense bank vegetation; and a downstream segment with an open sandy channel (active width ~85 m) less confined by levees or vegetated banks. Peak discharge reached 112 m3/s downstream from Morelos Dam, but decreased to 70 m3/s at the downstream end of the Limitrophe because of infiltration losses to the dry streambed. Measurable suspended-sand transport occurred throughout the Limitrophe, with export of sand out of the reach. Most geomorphic change was confined to the pre-pulse active channel, which is inset within higher geomorphic surfaces that formed during larger floods in the 1980s and 1990s. Sites immediately downstream from the dam did not degrade, despite active sediment transport, but the streambed coarsened. Farther downstream, localized bed scour and deposition ranged from 10s of centimeters to more than a meter, and fluvial dunes aggraded the bed in several locations. The pulse flow was small compared to historic floods, and larger floods would be necessary to significantly rework stable geomorphic surfaces or induce channel widening.",

            "abstract": "The presence of elevated stratospheric water vapor concentrations poses significant consequences for stratospheric ozone. With high concentrations of water vapor at low temperatures, inorganic chlorine can enter a heterogeneous chemical regime in which it becomes processed into the chlorine radical. The chlorine radical drives the catalytic destruction of ozone in the stratosphere. Historically the intersection of low temperatures and high water vapor concentrations has been isolated to the polar vortexes. However, convection over the mid-latitude United States has been observed in isotopic data to inject water vapor from the troposphere into the stratosphere (Hanisco et al. 2007). The consequent elevated levels of stratospheric water vapor may lead to catalytic destruction of stratospheric ozone in the mid-latitudes thereupon resulting in increased UV exposure at the Earth’s surface and increased risk to public health (Anderson et al. 2012). It is therefore critical to identify the climatology of the stratosphere that may exacerbate or mitigate the elevated water vapor conditions. Specifically we investigate the North American monsoon and its effect on perpetuating conditions of high water vapor concentrations. An analysis of relative vorticity from the ERA-interim and MERRA reanalyses over the United States from 2000 to 2013 reveal the consistent formation of the monsoon during the months of July and August and frequently June. An examination of circulation during the same time period allows us to estimate the monsoon’s stability. Furthermore, using potential vorticity as a tracer we see further evidence of the monsoon’s effect on keeping moist air masses over the United States. Finally, the analyzed dynamics of the North American Monsoon may explain the fact that NEXRAD observations of convective injection of water occur most strongly in the Spring months while the EOS MLS instrument detects the majority of high water vapor observations during the Summer months.",

            "abstract": "Subsidence from longwall coal mining impacts the surface and sub-surface hydrology in overlying areas. During longwall mining, coal is completely removed in large rectangular panels and the overlying rock collapses into the void. Though the hydrologic effects of longwall mining subsidence have been studied in arid systems, in humid-temperate regions these effects are not well understood. In particular, it is not clear how longwall mining will impact soil moisture patterns. Utilizing simple soil water modeling frameworks (ArcGIS-based Water Balance Toolbox) and the locations of recent long wall mining, potential impacts on soil water availability were predicted at the landscape scale. For example, in areas overlying panel edges, soil available water capacities (AWC) were altered based on several scenarios of AWC change and interactions between aspect driven soil moisture regimes and the mining perturbation were explored over a five year period (2008-2013). The regular patterns of soil moisture arising from insolation contrasts, when interacting with broad-scale longwall mining impacts, are predicted to cause complicated patterns of soil moisture change. These predictions serve as a means to guide field campaigns necessary to understand longwall mining’s hydrologic impacts in wetter climates",

            "abstract": "One proposed climate feedback mechanism is that, in a warming climate, wind speeds might change, altering emission rates of natural marine aerosols. This would affect the albedo of marine clouds, which have a strong cooling effect on a global scale.\nTo investigate the sign and extent of this proposed feedback mechanism, we performed a fifteen-year simulation using the global aerosol microphysics model GLOMAP-mode. We then analysed wind speed values and CCN concentrations from GLOMAP using a dynamic linear model to find non-linear trends in the data.\nWe compared trends in wind speed and CCN concentrations in three marine regions: the Northern Equatorial Pacific, the North Atlantic, and the Southern Ocean. No correlation was evident between wind speed and CCN concentrations in the NEP and the NA, indicating that a wind-based feedback is unlikely to have much effect in these regions. In the Southern Ocean, there is a stronger link between wind speed and CCN, suggesting a greater importance of natural, wind-driven aerosols. \nTo determine which processes overwhelmed the influence of emissions to control CCN concentrations, we ran a set of six two-month simulations with high temporal resolution output: one control simulation, and five simulations with one aerosol microphysical process switched off (new particle formation, primary sea spray emissions, dimethyl sulphide emissions, nucleation scavenging, and impaction scavenging). We found that in-cloud scavenging determines the base level of CCN concentration, with a large contribution from new particle formation and marine emissions in two of the regions. However, we also found that day-to-day fluctuations in CCN concentrations were more closely linked to transport of continental emissions in the Northern Equatorial Pacific and the North Atlantic.\nGiven the low sensitivity of CCN to changes in emissions, and the importance of transported continental aerosol, we expect that the proposed feedback mechanism is unlikely to have a strong effect except in pristine marine environments. However, based on our finding that nucleation scavenging determines the overall level of CCN concentrations, we propose that a precipitation-based feedback mechanism is more likely to have an effect throughout the oceans.",

            "abstract": "Soluble salt assemblages formed through aqueous processes are widespread on Mars. These minerals are important for understanding the past aqueous history of Mars and indicate critical habitability parameters such as pH, temperature, water activity, and salinity. Equilibrium models have been used to determine solution chemistry and salt precipitation sequences from aqueous chemical data; however, current models are limited by a lack of experimental data for low-temperature perchlorates, and some model predictions are clearly anomalous. To address the need for accurate equilibrium models, we have developed a comprehensive model for low-temperature perchlorate-rich brines using (1) previously neglected literature data, (2) experimental solubilities determined in low-temperature perchlorate solutions, and (3) solubility and heat capacity results determined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Our resulting model is a significant improvement over existing models, such as FREZCHEM, particularly for perchlorate mixtures. We have applied our model to evaporation and freezing of a nominal Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) solution measured at the Phoenix site. For a freezing WCL solution, our model indicates that ice, KClO4, hydromagnesite (3MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·3H2O), calcite (CaCO3), meridianiite (MgSO4·11H2O), MgCl2·12H2O, NaClO4·2H2O, and Mg(ClO4)2·6H2O form at the eutectic (209 K); whereas, KClO4, hydromagnesite, kieserite (MgSO4·H2O), anhydrite (CaSO4), halite (NaCl), NaClO4·H2O, and Mg(ClO4)2·6H2O form upon complete evaporation at 298 K. In general, evaporation yields more dehydrated mineral assemblages than salts produced by freezing. Hydrated phases that form during evaporation contain 0.3 wt. % water, which compares with 1.2 wt. % during freezing. Given independent evidence for the presence of calcite and minimum water contents in Martian soils of ~1.5 wt. %, salts at the Phoenix site, and possibly elsewhere, appear more likely to have formed during freezing. Furthermore, our model indicates that some minerals, such as halite, kieserite, epsomite, and mirabilite (Na2SO4·10H2O) form only under limited temperature and water activity conditions, and could be used to constrain the past aqueous history of Mars.",

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon analyses are a key tool for quantifying the dynamics of carbon cycling and storage in both modern soils and Quaternary paleosols. Frequently, bulk 14C dates of paleosol organic carbon provide ages older than the time of soil burial, and 14C dates of geochemical fractions such as alkali and acid extracts (operationally defined as humic acids) can provide anomalously old ages when compared to coeval plant macrofossil dates. Ramped pyrolysis radiocarbon analysis of sedimentary organic material has been employed as a tool for investigating 14C age spectra in sediments with multiple organic carbon sources. Here we combine ramped pyrolysis 14C analysis and biomarker analysis (lignin-phenols and other cupric oxide products) to provide information on the source and diagenetic state of the paleosol organic carbon. We apply these techniques to immature early Holocene brackish wetland entisols from three sediment cores in southeastern Louisiana, along with overlying basal peats. Surprisingly, we find narrow 14C age spectra across all thermal aliquots from both paleosols and peats. The weighted bulk 14C ages from paleosols and overlying peats are within analytical error, and are comparable to independently analyzed 14C AMS dates from charcoal fragments and other plant macrofossils from each peat bed.\nOur results suggest high turnover rates of carbon in soils relative to input of exogenous carbon sources. These data raise broader questions about processes within the active soil and during pedogenesis and burial of paleosols that can effectively homogenize radiocarbon content in soils across the thermochemical spectrum. The concurrence of paleosol and peat 14C ages also suggests that, in the absence of peats with identifiable plant macrofossils, ramped pyrolysis 14C analyses of paleosols may be used to provide ages for sea-level indicators.",

            "abstract": "Within tropical storm systems, reliable measurements are often prohibitively difficult to obtain, which leads to a continued uncertainty about near-surface turbulent processes in the high-wind, tropical cyclone boundary layer. One such source of uncertainty is the feedback effect of sea spray, whose suspension above the water surface has been postulated to be a significant source of additional latent and sensible heat flux, beyond what can be achieved by turbulent exchange alone. This spray-mediated thermodynamic exchange has significant implications for tropical cyclone development and prediction. To estimate surface enthalpy fluxes from within tropical cyclones, we analyze data from over 2000 dropsonde profiles taken from 37 different storms. Mean thermodynamic profiles are constructed and binned according to wind speed and sea surface temperature, and Monin-Obukhov similarity theory is invoked to estimate surface fluxes based on average profiles. In agreement with the few existing measurements at high winds, we find no statistical dependence of the bulk enthalpy coefficient with 10-meter wind speed. More importantly, however, by computing the power-law scaling of enthalpy flux versus of wind speed, it is found that in extreme conditions (wind speeds from 20 - 50 m/s), a significantly stronger scaling dependence is found when compared to cases where no spray effects would be expected. This stronger scaling agrees with spray-mediated flux models and suggests an additional route of thermodynamic exchange within the high-wind boundary layer.",

            "abstract": "FWI is slowly becoming the mainstream method to estimate velocity models of the subsurface from seismic data. Typically it makes use of a gradient descent approach in which a model update is computed by back propagating the residual seismograms and cross correlating with the forward propagating wavefields at each grid point in the subsurface model. FWI is a local optimization technique, which requires the starting model to be very close to the true model. Because the objective function is multimodal with many local minima, the requirement of good starting model becomes essential. A starting model is generated using travel time tomography. We propose two hybrid FWI algorithms one of which generates a very good starting model for a conventional FWI and the other, which works with a population of models uses gradient information from multiple starting locations in guiding the search.\nThe first approach uses a sparse parameterization of model space using non-oscillatory splines, whose coeffiencts are estimated using an optimization algorithm like very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) by minimizing the misfit between the observed and synthetic data. The estimated velocity model is then used as a starting model for gradient-based FWI. This is done in the shot domain by converting the end-on marine geometry to a split spread geometry using the principle of reciprocity. The second approach is to uses an alternate global optimization algorithm called particle swarm optimization (PSO) where PSO update rules are applied. However, we employ a new gradient guided PSO that exploits the gradient information as well. This approach avoids the local minima and converges faster than a conventional PSO.\nWe demonstrate our methods with application to 2D marine data sets from offshore India. Each line comprises over 1000 shots; our hybrid methods produce geologically meaningful velocity models fairly rapidly on a GPU cluster. We show that starting with the hybrid model gives a much better velocity model than starting with a simple smooth model.",

            "abstract": "Fracture intersections play a crucial role in the hydraulic connectivity of flow paths in rock, yet no current techniques exist for characterizing the conditions of an intersection. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that elastic waves propagated along fracture intersections are affected by the amount of contact among the blocks forming an intersection.\nSurface fractures and fracture intersections can be viewed as wedges (corners) coupled through the points of contact along the intersection. An eigenvalue secular equation was derived using displacement discontinuity theory along with the solution for a wedge wave. The velocity and motion of intersection waves are a function of the frequency, material impedance, and specific stiffness of the intersection. For an intersection, several modes are present that represent the coupling between different sets of the wedges and exhibit wave speeds between a single wedge mode and the bulk S wave. A surface fracture supports only one mode of propagation with speeds that range from the single wedge wave to that of the Rayleigh wave.\nExperiments were performed on intersections made from two or four aluminum samples (0.29 x 0.076 x 0.076 m) to detect intersection waves. Measurements were made under uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions to change the contact area along an intersection. At low loads both the surface fracture and intersection excite wedge waves because the stress between the wedges was not sufficiently high to couple the wedges. As the external load was increased, the wave coupled the wedges and propagated as a Rayleigh wave for the surface fracture, or as a bulk S wave for the intersection. These results indicate that the specific stiffness of the fracture intersection can be estimated based upon the velocity of the wave propagating along the intersection or surface fracture. Using this estimation the flow path(s) along or through the fracture intersection or surface fracture can be characterized and used as a tool to determine which flow path is most likely for a given sample.\nAcknowledgments: This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Geo-sciences Research Program under Award Number (DE-FG02-09ER16022) and by the Geo-Mathematical Imaging Group at Purdue",

            "abstract": "Large-scale simulation of CO2 storage operations can be expensive computationally, particularly when the effects of fine-scale capillary pressure heterogeneity are included. These effects, which are often ignored in traditional reservoir simulation, can significantly impact the movement of CO2 and should therefore be included in carbon storage simulations. The application of upscaling techniques that handle capillary heterogeneity could lead to reductions in computational cost, though general and robust procedures for this problem have yet to be presented. In this work, we develop and apply a new upscaling technique for two-phase flow in heterogeneous porous media with capillary heterogeneity effects. Fine-scale capillary pressure is modeled using the Leverett J-function and varies with permeability. We show that accurate upscaled models can be constructed by first upscaling capillary pressure under the assumption of capillary equilibrium, and then computing coarse-scale relative permeability functions using a global dynamic upscaling procedure. Some of the key numerical treatments associated with the overall procedure, such as near-well upscaling and the use of global coarse-scale iteration to improve model accuracy, will be described.\nThe new upscaling approach is applied to synthetic heterogeneous two-dimensional aquifer models with flow driven by CO2 injection. Injection via both vertical and horizontal wells is considered. Fine-scale reference results are compared with coarse-scale results generated using both the new upscaling approach and alternative (simpler) methods. In general, of the techniques considered, our new approach is shown to provide the best overall accuracy. Different CO2 injection rates and well locations are considered, which allows us to explore the robustness of the upscaled model. Various strategies for enhancing model robustness will also be applied and assessed.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) has been active for the past several years in preserving data and documentation from the heritage Nimbus data sets. There were seven NASA Nimbus satellites launched from 1964 through 1978 providing some of the earliest measurements of atmospheric and meteorological data. In this presentation we describe the process, implementation and issues encountered while preserving these important heritage data sets for use by future researchers.\nThe first data set that was recovered was the Nimbus-2 High-Resolution Infrared Radiometer (HRIR). These data were processed on archaic IBM 7094 computers, which used 36-bit encoded bytes, and were copied and stored on 7-track magnetic tapes at NASA's National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC). NSSDC transferred custody of these tapes to the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project who enlisted the GES DISC to recover the data. Since NASA no longer has machines for reading these old tapes, an outside contractor was used to retrieve the binary information. Digital images of the tapes were sent back to the GES DISC where we then extracted the data files and metadata. The old HRIR data were also processed and saved as images on 70 mm film strips which we had scanned as JPEG-2000 files. Old documentation describing the HRIR mission were located, and hardcopies were scanned and saved as PDF files.\nSince successfully preserving the Nimbus-2 HRIR, we have also completed the preservation of data from the rest of HRIR on Nimbus-1 and 3, as well as MRIR on Nimbus-2 and 3, THIR on Nimbus-4 through 7, and Nimbus-6 HIRS and SCAMS. Each of these data sets had its own unique file format and set of challenges. Up next we will recover data from the SIRS, SCR, ESMR, ITPR, NEMS, ERB, SAM2, SAMS, and SMMR missions. Nimbus data previously archived from an earlier NSSDC transfer to the GES DISC include TOMS, BUV and SBUV, LIMS and IRIS. In the future, we also have plans to preserve data from the even earlier TIROS missions.",

            "abstract": "The long-term Paleogene global cooling trend and eventual glaciation of Antarctica has been attributed to a reduction in greenhouse gas levels as well as changes in the configuration of high-latitude oceanic gateways. This major trend in climate and forcing is known to have initiated in the early middle Eocene, between 44-49 Mya, yet our understanding of the detailed evolution of climate and oceanic circulation and carbon chemistry of this critical interval has been limited for lack of high-resolution proxy climate records. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 342, designed in part to address this deficiency, successfully recovered highly expanded sequences of middle Eocene sediment from multiple sites in the western North Atlantic, with several sites characterized by high sedimentation rates (>2.8 cm/kyr) and pronounced lithologic cycles. Using samples from cores recovered at one of these sites, 1408, located on Southeast Newfoundland Ridge, we are reconstructing the first orbital-scale deep sea δ18O and δ13C records spanning a ~1.6 million year interval (~Chron 20r) of the middle Eocene. Based on analyses of benthic foraminifer N. truempyi, our preliminary data reveal distinct high-frequency cycles with periods matching those of the orbital cycles, particularly precession and obliquity. Cross spectral analysis of δ18O, δ13C and lithologic records reveal a high degree of coherency, implying a high sensitivity in local sediment fluxes and bottom water chemistry (and circulation) to orbital forcing. Also, given the location and depth (~2600 m at 50 Ma), Site 1408 constrains the end-member composition of northern component bathyal bottom waters so that comparison with benthic isotope records from the south Atlantic and other basins can be used to assess ocean circulation patterns in the mid-Eocene. In general, bottom water temperatures appear to have been warmer, and DIC δ13C lower than observed elsewhere. Thus, our preliminary results are consistent with the absence of significant bottom water production in the North Atlantic at this time. This record will eventually be part of a longer Eocene record being assembled by a consortium of Expedition 342 Scientists.",

            "abstract": "The burial and exhumation of oceanic sediments in orogenic wedges is one of the most important processes that occur during continental collisions. During progressive burial, pelites lose porosity and permeability, and eventually pass into the lithostatic pressure regime where the porosity and permeability are thought to be very small. However, prograde metamorphic reactions produce fluids that must ascent though the pore space or fractures. The hydrologic characteristics of schists undergoing burial were modeled using the program SUTRAMET, which is a modified version of the program SUTRA (Voss & Provost, 2002) that allows modeling of metamorphic reactions at high pressures and temperatures and incorporates transient porosity and permeability changes due to overpressure and changing volume of the metamorphic assemblage.\nThe initial model crustal section includes a hydrostatic pressure regime to the depth of 5 km with φ ≥ 0.007 and k ≥ 10-17 m2. Within the lithostatic pressure domain, schists have φ ≤ 0.003 and k ≤ 10-18 m2. Below the schists that are undergoing burial (3 or 6 mm/y) is an impermeable substrate with φ = 0. P and T are maintained at the top and the bottom boundaries and P is also maintained at the top of the lithostatic domain. T-dependent thermal diffusivity and heat capacity were applied. The initial T gradient is ~30°/km. The only heat sink is endothermic metamorphic reactions and the only heat source is a small amount of radioactivity. The initial schist was assumed to have 17.9 wt.% qtz, 13.2% ab, 28.7% ksp, 9.0% ms, 22.8% chl, and 8.5% law. By the time it reaches the bottom of the crustal section, metamorphic reactions produce the anhydrous assemblage 14.5% qtz, 7.8% an, 13.7% ab, 36% ksp, 0.2% sil, and 27.5% grt.\nResults show that fluid pressure remains slightly above lithostatic within the initially lithostatic pressure regime as metamorphic fluids are released, even at the slow burial rate of 3 mm/y, because the fluids pass to the hydrostatic regime very slowly. Fracturing and enhancement of permeability due to shrinking of the mineral assemblage moderate the amount of excess pressure within the crustal column. The results also show that very large amounts of water are released at discrete horizons within the crust due to discontinuous metamorphic reactions as schists pass through the horizons during burial.",

However, along flow paths on the order of 10 – 103 km long, groundwater velocities may be low enough to allow diffusion of 2H and 18O between a confined aquifer and bounding aquitards, which could alter isotope concentrations and the inferred temperature of recharge. While the need to account for 14C diffusion between aquifer waters and confining layers has been suggested by a prior model (Sudicky and Frind, 1981), a literature review revealed no similar study of stable water isotopes. Based on the geologic and hydraulic properties of the confined Wilcox aquifer in the middle Mississippi Valley, we are constructing a numerical model to determine whether, and to what degree, diffusion can influence 2H and 18O concentrations in regional aquifers with residence times on the order of 104 – 105 y.

            "abstract": "Globally, soil organic matter (SOM) contains approximately three times more carbon than the atmosphere and terrestrial vegetation contain combined. However, it is not well understood why some SOM persists for a long time while other SOM decomposes quickly. For future climate predictions, representing soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics accurately in Earth system models is essential. Soil minerals stabilize organic carbon in soil; however, there are gaps in our understanding of how soil mineralogy controls the quantity and turnover of long-residence-time organic carbon. To investigate the impact of soil mineralogy on SOM dynamics, we used a new model (Biotic and Abiotic Model of SOM—BAMS1 [Riley et al., 2014]) integrated with a three-dimensional, multiphase reactive transport solver (TOUGHREACT). The model represents bacterial and fungal activity, archetypal polymer and monomer carbon substrate groups, aqueous chemistry, gaseous diffusion, aqueous advection and diffusion, and adsorption and desorption processes. BAMS1 can predict bulk SOM and radiocarbon signatures without resorting to an arbitrary depth-dependent decline in SOM turnover rates. Results show a reasonable match between observed and simulated depth-resolved SOM and ∆14C in grassland ecosystems (soils formed on terraces south of Eureka, California, and the Central Chernozem Region of Russia) and were consistent with expectations of depth-resolved profiles of lignin content and fungi:aerobic bacteria ratios. Results also suggest that clay-mineral surface area and soil sorption coefficients constitute dominant controls over organic carbon stocks and residence times, respectively.\nBibliography:\n Riley, W.J., F.M.

            "abstract": "While subduction recycling of oceanic lithosphere is one of the central themes of plate tectonics, recycling continental lithosphere appears far more complicated and is less well understood. Delamination and convective downwelling are two widely recognized processes invoked to explain the removal of lithospheric mantle under or adjacent to orogenic belts. Here we describe another process that can lead to the loss of continental lithosphere adjacent to a subduction zone: Subducting oceanic plates can entrain and recycle lithospheric mantle from an adjacent continent and disrupt the continental lithosphere far inland from the subduction zone.\nSeismic images from recent dense broadband arrays on opposite sides of the Atlantic show higher than expected volumes of positive anomalies identified as the subducted Atlantic (ATL) slab under northeastern South America (SA), and the Alboran slab beneath the Gibraltar arc region (GA). The positive anomalies lie under and are aligned with the continental margins at depths greater than 200 km. Closer to the surface we find that the continental margin lithospheric mantle is significantly thinner than expected beneath the orogens adjacent to the subduction zones. Thinner than expected lithosphere extends inland as far as the edges of nearby cratonic cores. These observations suggest that subducting oceanic plates viscously entrain and remove continental mantle lithosphere from beneath adjacent continental margins, modulating the surface tectonics and pre-conditioning the margins for further deformation. The latter can include delamination of the entire lithospheric mantle, as around GA, inferred by results from active and passive seismic experiments. Secondary downwellings develop under the continental interior inland from the subduction zone: We image one under SA and one or more in the past were likely under GA. The process of subduction-driven continental margin lithosphere removal reconciles numerous, sometimes mutually exclusive, geodynamic models proposed to explain the complex oceanic-continental tectonics of these two subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "Water productivity is an area of growing interest in assessing the impact of human economic activities on water resources, especially in arid regions. Indicators of water productivity can assist water users in evaluating sectoral water use efficiency, identifying sources of pressure on water resources, and in supporting water allocation rationale under scarcity conditions.\nThis case study for the water-scarce Middle Rio Grande River Basin aims to develop an environmental-economic accounting approach for water use in arid river basins through a methodological framework that relates water use to human economic activities impacting regional water resources. Water uses are coupled to economic transactions, and the complex but mutual relations between various water using sectors estimated. A comparison is made between the calculated water productivity indicators and representative cost/price per unit volume of water for the main water use sectors.\nAlthough it contributes very little to regional economic output, preliminary results confirm that Irrigation is among the sectors with the largest direct water use intensities. High economic value and low water use intensity economic sectors in the study region include Manufacturing, Mining, and Steam Electric Power. Water accounting challenges revealed by the study include differences in water management regimes between jurisdictions, and little understanding of the impact of major economic activities on the interaction between surface and groundwater systems in this region. A more comprehensive assessment would require the incorporation of environmental and social sustainability indicators to the calculated water productivity indicators.",

            "abstract": "Climate model simulations can show large departures from observations. These biases are often subtracted and then forgotten, or post-processed for impact modeling using pragmatic methods that typically do not account for the origins of the biases. Yet, enhancing our understanding of the reasons behind these biases is essential for the improvement of climate models and for the design of more robust bias-correction techniques. We pursue these objectives by exploring the links between biases at different spatial scales. We quantify biases at the regional scale in an alpine area (Switzerland) and explore whether they are influenced by the misrepresentation of the frequency, temperature and precipitation of circulation types (CTs) at the synoptic scale. Our analysis relies on simulations from 14 regional climate models (RCMs) forced by general circulation models and produced for the ENSEMBLES project. For each model, we characterized the daily synoptic situation over 1960-2099 by using a CT classification based on a hierarchical cluster analysis of principal components. The classification relies on sea level pressure fields within an area representative of the European Alps. We find significant biases in the CT frequency for 1980-2001 and that some of them lead to biases in temperature and precipitation reported in RCM comparison studies. For instance, in winter, models overestimate both the frequency and precipitation intensity of westerly situations, which carry moist air from the Atlantic Ocean and are responsible for most of the rainfall. We propose this as a main driver for the generalized overestimation of precipitation in winter, which is one of the most concerning biases affecting simulations in our area, as it leads to unrealistic estimates of snow accumulation. A general consequence is that CT-based downscaling methods that do not account for biases in CT frequency will generate biased outputs. Overall, we show that decomposing RCM time series using CTs enables to relate biases to atmospheric processes, flow directions and topographic features and thus to reveal connections normally missed by analyses relying on monthly or seasonal values. We also show that exploring future changes in CTs provides new insights into the robustness of projected changes in precipitation and temperature by the end of the century.",

            "abstract": "The magmatic history of the flatslab region between the Central and Southern Andean volcanic zones reflects shallowing of the slab, lithospheric thinning, narrowing of the asthenospheric wedge, crustal thickening and forearc removal by subduction erosion. Newly revised contours on the northern margin of the modern flatslab (Mulcahy et al. 2014) show the flattest part extends from ~28° to 33°S and is bounded by Pleistocene volcanic activity. An eastward broadening of the magmatic arc began after 18 Ma as westward drift of South America accelerated, but the most distinctive retroarc magmatism occurred after near normal subduction of the southward drifting Juan Fernandez Ridge began at ~11 Ma and ended as magmatism ceased in the Pampean ranges, ~ 700 km east of the trench at ~4.7 Ma.\nRecent seismic work in the retroarc area indicate a ~60 km thick crust under the Precordillera fold-thrust belt with transitions at ~20 and ~40 km that are considered to be the top of crystalline basement and an eclogitic facies transition. Chemical constraints from ~15-7 Ma magmatic rocks suggest eclogization is related to crustal thickening over the shallowing slab in accord with field relations for major thrusting in the region by ~8-7 Ma. High Ba/Th ratios in <9 Ma volcanic rocks are interpreted to reflect phengite breakdown in the mantle wedge with the fluids facilitating eclogization of the lower crust. Evidence for mantle melt contributions in the magmas up until ~7 Ma comes from more primitive isotopic values in 1088-1251 Ma amphibolite and granulite facies xenoliths (eNd = 0 to -3; 87Sr/86Sr =704-0.710) than in Miocene volcanic rocks (eNd = 0-1.7; 0.70325-0.70345; zircon eHf ~ 0).\nFrom ~8 to 3 Ma, the active volcanic arc front near 28°S and 33°S was translated ~ 40-50 km eastward in a suspected response to forearc removal by subduction erosion. Given the position of the arc and distance to the trench, the same amount of forearc was likely removed in the intervening flatslab region. Trapping of subducted forearc material in the mantle wedge could help to explain a low Vp/Vs ratios (1.65-1.72, Wagner et al. 2008 ) in the mantle wedge above the flat-slab as a low Vp could result from orthopyroxene formation by reaction of silicic material with the mantle wedge and a high Vs can be explained by the current slab being too cool to hydrate the mantle wedge.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, capillary pressure is determined by increasing or decreasing external fluid pressures to change the immiscible fluid saturation in a porous medium. The resulting saturation and interfacial area are then linked to the capillary pressure through constitutive equations. A key question is whether externally measured pressures are sensitive to changes in distributions that arise from internal changes in contact angles. As a first step in addressing this question, we investigated the effect of electro-kinetic manipulation on interfacial area and contact angles for a fixed saturation.\nAn EWOD (electro-wetting on dielectric) technique was used to alter the contact angle of single 10 µL droplets of a 1M KCl-H2O solution. A liquid droplet was placed on a glass cover slip (18 mm x 18 mm) coated with a layer of silver (100 nm in thickness) to act as an electrode and then spin-coated with polyimide (a dielectric). A platinum wire was inserted into the droplet and connected to an AC voltage source. The glass plate electrode was connected to ground. Measurements were made for Vrms voltages between 0 to 300 V at a frequency of 50 Hz. Two CCD cameras were used to image changes in the shape of a droplet. One camera was placed on a microscope to capture a top view of a drop in order to measure changes in areal extent and the perimeter of the drop. The second camera imaged a drop from the side to measure contact angles and side-view areal extent and perimeter.\nAt low voltages, the cosine of the contact angle, θ, after applying voltage was linearly dependent on Vrms2. Several experiments showed that the slope of the low-voltage relationship of cos θ vs Vrms2 remained constant for all trials. As the voltage increased, the contact angle saturated. From the side-view images, the contact angle and interfacial length decreased with increasing voltage. From the top-view images, the drop shape changed from circular to elliptical-to irregular as the voltage increased, yielding an increase in interfacial length as the contact angle decreased. These experiments demonstrate that EWOD techniques can be used to alter contact areas and interfacial area without the need for an external pressure source.\nAcknowledgment: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (1314663-EAR).",

            "abstract": "In mountainous regions across the western USA, the composition of aspen (Populus tremuloides) and sagebrush steppe plant communities is often closely related to heterogeneous soil moisture subsidies resulting from redistributed snow. With decades of climate and precipitation data across elevational and precipitation gradients, the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) and critical zone observatory (CZO) in southwest Idaho provides a unique opportunity to study the relationship between vegetation types and redistributed snow. Within the RCEW, the total amount of precipitation has remained unchanged over the past 50 years, however the percentage of the precipitation falling as snow has declined by approximately 4% per decade at mid-elevation sites. As shifts in precipitation phase continue, future trends in vegetation composition and net primary productivity (NPP) of different plant functional types remains a critical question. We hypothesize that redistribution of snow may supplement drought sensitive species like aspen more so than drought tolerant species like mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. vaseyana). To assess the importance of snowdrift subsidies on sagebrush steppe vegetation, NPP of aspen, shrub, and grass species was simulated at three sites using the biogeochemical process model BIOME-BGC. Each site is located directly downslope from snowdrifts providing soil moisture inputs to aspen stands and neighboring vegetation. Drifts vary in size with the largest containing up to four times the snow water equivalent (SWE) of a uniform precipitation layer. Precipitation inputs used by BIOME-BGC were modified to represent the redistribution of snow and simulations were run using daily climate data from 1985-2013. Simulated NPP of annual grasses at each site was not responsive to subsidies from drifting snow. However, at the driest site, aspen and shrub annual NPP was increased by as much as 44 and 30%, respectively, with the redistribution of snow. These results indicate that as snow water subsidies decrease, ecosystems may shift from tree and shrub dominated to grassland dominated. As climate change progresses, shifts in the precipitation regimes in semi-arid environments may lead to changes in species composition and carbon stores throughout the intermountain west.",

This extension adds closed fields from below the source surface to the CSSS model values, and when traced outward from the sub-Earth point, three magnetic field components are present. These are compared to in-situ magnetic fields measured near Earth for several periods throughout the current solar cycle from the minimum between Solar Cycle 23 and 24 up until the present.

            "abstract": "Reactive infiltration instabilities occur in a wide range of geophysical and geotechnical systems. The simplest such instability occurs when fluid flows between two soluble plates, which is an idealized model of fractured limestone. Even when the initial aperture is uniform at the nanoscale, an instability in the reaction front develops leading to the formation of pronounced solutional channels or \"wormholes\". We have previously suggested that this instability may help explain the onset of large underground caves systems, by allowing a much deeper penetration of reactant than is possible by uniform opening of the fracture. Numerical simulations suggest that dissolution may be a form of self-organization where patterns seem to develop in similar ways over a wide range of porosity distribution. If so, this offers the possibility of developing a theoretical understanding of the geomorphologies formed by dissolution-precipitation reactions independent (to some extent) of the initial conditions. We present numerical simulations of the dissolution of a porous matrix to indicate the insensitivity of key statistical markers to the initial distribution of porosity. Theory and simulations predict that a planar dissolution front breaks up into a number of competing fingers. Predictions from a linear stability analysis in porous and fractured rocks vary considerably depending on the underlying assumptions about flow rates and reaction rates. Once fingers develop, the nature of the competition is different in fractured and porous rocks. We are presently trying to understand the growth of individual fingers (see attached image), which numerical simulations show to be steadily propagating in time, much like the better-known phenomena of viscous fingering. We will indicate the difficulties that have so far prevented us from finding an explicit solution to the finger size, shape and velocity.

            "abstract": "Accurate prediction of conductivity in partially-saturated porous media has broad applications in various phenomena in porous media, and has been studied intensively since the 1940s by petroleum, chemical and civil engineers, and hydrologists. Many of the models developed in the past are based on the bundle of capillary tubes. In addition, pore network models have also been developed for simulating multiphase fluid flow in porous media and computing the conductivity in unsaturated porous media. In this study, we propose a novel approach using concepts from the effective-medium approximation (EMA) and percolation theory to model hydraulic and electrical conductivity in fractal porous media whose pore-size distributions exhibit power-law scaling. In our approach, the EMA, originally developed for predicting electrical conductivity of composite materials, is used to predict the effective conductivity, from complete saturation to some intermediate water content that represents a crossover point. Below the crossover water content, but still above a critical saturation (percolation threshold), a universal scaling predicted by percolation theory, a power law that expresses the dependence of the conductivity on the water content (less a critical water saturation) with an exponent of 2, is invoked to describe the effective conductivity. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the approach, experimental data were used from the literature. The predicted hydraulic conductivities for most cases are in excellent agreement with the data. In a few cases the theory underestimates the hydraulic conductivities, which correspond to porous media with very broad pore-size distribution in which the largest pore radius is more than 7 orders of magnitude greater than the smallest one. The approach is also used to predict the saturation dependence of the electrical conductivity for experiments in which capillary pressure data are available. The results indicate that the universal scaling of the electrical conductivity is valid from the percolation threshold all the way up to the complete saturation point. Our results confirm those reported previously by Ewing and Hunt (2006) who argued that the electrical conductivity should follow universal scaling over the entire range of saturation.",

Foreshock occurrence appears correlated with mainshock faulting type and depth. Foreshock area is correlated with the magnitude of the largest foreshock but only weakly correlated with mainshock magnitude. We also examine small seismicity clusters that have at least 10 events within 2 days and 5 km, resembling swarm-like foreshock sequences. Only a small fraction of the small clusters lead to a larger cluster. About 70% of the large clusters don't start with their largest event, and the spatial distribution pattern is similar to M ≥ 5 mainshocks, with lower occurrence rates in the Transverse Range and central California and higher occurrence rates in the eastern California Shear Zone and the Hayward fault zone. These results suggest that foreshock occurrence is largely controlled by the regional tectonic stress field and fault zone properties. Foreshocks properties do not seem useful in predicting the magnitude of the eventual \"mainshock\".",

            "abstract": "Dry lightning often results in a significant amount of fire starts in areas where the vegetation is dry and continuous. Meteorologists from the USDA Forest Service Predictive Services’ program in Riverside, California are tasked to provide southern and central California’s fire agencies with fire potential outlooks. Logistic regression equations were developed by these meteorologists several years ago, which forecast probabilities of lightning as well as lightning amounts, out to seven days across southern California. These regression equations were developed using ten years of historical gridded data from the Global Forecast System (GFS) model on a coarse scale (0.5 degree resolution), correlated with historical lightning strike data. These equations do a reasonably good job of capturing a lightning episode (3-5 consecutive days or greater of lightning), but perform poorly regarding more detailed information such as exact location and amounts. It is postulated that the inadequacies in resolving the finer details of episodic lightning events is due to the coarse resolution of the GFS data, along with limited predictors. Stability parameters, such as the Lifted Index (LI), the Total Totals index (TT), Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), along with Precipitable Water (PW) are the only parameters being considered as predictors. It is hypothesized that the statistical forecasts will benefit from higher resolution data both in training and implementing the statistical model. We have dynamically downscaled NCEP FNL (Final) reanalysis data using the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) to 3km spatial and hourly temporal resolution across a decade. This dataset will be used to evaluate the contribution to the success of the statistical model of additional predictors in higher vertical, spatial and temporal resolution. If successful, we will implement an operational dynamically downscaled GFS forecast product to generate predictors for the resulting statistical lightning model. This data will help fire agencies be better prepared to pre-deploy resources in advance of these events. Specific information regarding duration, amount, and location will be especially valuable.",

            "abstract": "Elevated anthropogenic nitrogen (N) emissions result in higher rates of atmospheric N deposition (Ndep) that can saturate sensitive ecosystems. Consequences of increased Ndep include higher emissions of greenhouse gases, eutrophication of watersheds, and deterioration of vegetation communities. Most of the annual N deposition at higher elevations in the Cascades is stored in snowpack until spring snowmelt when it is released as a pulse that can be assimilated by plant and microbial communities, or lost as gaseous emissions or leachate. The relative magnitude of these fluxes is unknown, particularly with accelerated rates of snowpack loss due to climate change. We quantified storage of Ndep in winter snowpack and determined impacts of Ndep on biogeochemical processes in a lush‑herbaceous community characterized by Valeriana sitchensis and Lupinus latifolius, a heath‑shrub community characterized by Phyllodoce empetriformis and Cassiope mertensiana, and a wet‑sedge community dominated by Carex nigricans. These communities were selected to represent early, mid, and late snowmelt vegetation regimes prevalent throughout the Cascades. Ammonium (NH4+) was the dominant form of Ndep in winter snowpack and Ndep rates were higher than anticipated based on nearby National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) measurements. Vegetation N uptake was the dominant N sink in the ecosystem, with the highest growing season uptake occurring in the lush‑herbaceous community, while soil N leaching was the dominant N loss, with the lush‑herbaceous also having the highest rates. Microbial biomass N fluctuated substantially across the growing season, with high biomass N immediately after snowmelt and again 30 days following snow release. Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions peaked 30 days following snowmelt for all three communities and were greatest in the wet sedge community. These results indicate that subalpine communities have unique responses to Ndep that vary throughout the growing season. Thus, biogeochemical modeling efforts to simulate ecosystem responses to Ndep should be parameterized at a community‑specific level to fully capture this variability. Ultimately, this study will provide insight to land managers on the fate of N emissions and how Ndep affects ecosystem services in high‑elevation ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The splitting of SKS waves is widely used to study mantle anisotropy and to get insight on Earth's dynamic interior. However, while SKS splitting is an unambiguous signature of anisotropy, it cannot be used directly to infer the depth distribution of the anisotropy because the dealy times between the two polarization directions result from integrated measurements along quasi-vertical paths between the core-mantle boundary and the surface. SKS splitting data are generally interpreted in terms of olivine lattice preferred orientation in the uppermost 250 km of the mantle. There is, nevertheless, growing evidence from regional studies that the splitting may contain significant contributions from greater depths.\nIn addition, SKS delay times are strongly under predicted by tomographic models of azimuthal anisotropy derived from fundamentqal mode surface waves. These models typically display anisotropy only in the 250 km of the mantle because fundamental mode surface wave data have little sensitivity to structure below that depth. For example, we calculated predictions of SKS splitting using the global azimuthal anisotropy model of Debayle et al. (2005), and found a global delay times distributon with a median of 0.4 s, compared to 1.1 s for the global station-averaged SKS splitting database compiled by Becker et al. (2012). This discrepancy may indicate that seismic anisotropy is present at greater depths.\nIn this work, we analyzed a new global 3-D model of azimuthal anisotropy (Yuan and Beghein, 2013) that was obtained from the inversion of higher modes surface wave phase velocity data with unprecedented sensitivity to the top 1000 km of the mantle. While this model is comparable to previous models in the uppermost mantle, it also displays anisotropy amplitudes of about 1% below 250 km depth and a complex 3-D pattern of fast axes directions down to 800 km depth. The predicted SKS delay times calculated using this new model have a median of 0.75 s, which is in much closer agreement with SKS measurements than other tomographic models.\nThis result shows that seismic anisotropy below 250 km contributes significantly to SKS delay times, and future geodynamics interpretation.",

For India, there are 3 gridded rainfall data products available from India Meteorological Department (IMD), Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and Asian Precipitation - Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE), these compile precipitation information obtained through satellite based measurement and ground station based data. The gridded rainfall data from IMD is available at spatial resolution of 1°, 0.5° and 0.25° where as TRMM and APHRODITE is available at 0.25°. Here, we employ 7 years (1998-2004) of common time period amongst the 3 data products for the south-west monsoon season, i.e., the months June to September. We examine temporal mean and standard deviation of these 3 products to observe substantial variation amongst them at 1° resolution whereas for 0.25° resolution, all the data types are nearly identical. We determine the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the 3 products at 1° and 0.25° resolution based on noise separation technique adopting horizontal separation of the power spectrum generated with the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). A methodology is developed for threshold based separation of signal and noise from the power spectrum, treating the noise as white. The variance of signal to that of noise is computed to obtain SNR. Determination of SNR for different regions over the country shows the highest SNR with APHRODITE at 0.25° resolution. It is observed that the eastern part of India has the highest SNR in all cases considered whereas the northern and southern most Indian regions have lowest SNR. An incremental linear trend is observed among the SNR values and the spatial variance of corresponding region. Relationship between the computed SNR values and the interpolation method used with the dataset is analyzed. The SNR analysis provides an effective tool to evaluate the gridded precipitation data products. However detailed analysis is needed to determine the processes that lead to these SNR distributions so that the quality of the gridded rainfall data products can be further improved and transferability of the gridding algorithms can be explored to produce a unified high-quality rainfall dataset.",

The record of Rcloud derived from CERES is used to scale the UV reflectivity to TOA cloud forcing. The estimated linear trend for the shortwave TOA radiative forcing due to clouds from 60S to 60N is +1.1 Watts m-2 over the 32 year period.\nShortwave (SW) cloud feedback parameters are estimated using anomalies of local observed surface temperatures (Ts.) from NASA GISS. Zonal mean values of our cloud feedback parameter are similar to those derived from other data sets such as CERES, FD-ISCCP and MERRA. Over land our SW cloud feedback parameter is positive and SW Rcloud is highly correlated with Ts . However, over ocean the sign of the feedback parameters are controlled by strong negative values over equatorial latitudes balanced by positive values over subtropical and midlatitude oceans. Over ocean, the SW Rcloud response to Ts perturbations is about one month, but over land the cloud response time is less than one month.\nSW cloud feedbacks estimated from all (n=384) monthly anomalies over the 32 year period are driven by ENSO variability as well as long-term warming from CO2. In an attempt to isolate the cloud feedback due to long-term global warming, we re-derive maps of the feedback but only use those months where the absolute value of the ENSO index is less than 0.5 (n=116). We compare maps of these results with SW cloud feedback estimates from CMIP5 multi-model runs that simulate an abrupt 4x increase in CO2 concentrations. Global fields from these CMIP5 model runs have many of same spatial features seen in our estimates of SW cloud feedback from long-term warming. Both show negative feedback over equatorial oceans and positive feedback over land masses.",

Its eruptive history during late Pleistocene has been intense with six explosive eruptions that consists of: 1) A southwards sector collapse of the volcano that generated a debris avalanche deposit with megablocks of heterogenous composition; 2) A plinian-type eruption that generated a pumice fall deposit and pyroclastic density currents by column collapse at 30.6 ka; 3) A plinian-type eruption “White Pumice Sequence” (29 ka) that developed a 22-km-high eruptive column, with a MDR of 7.0 x 107 kg/s (vol. = 0.53 km3); 4) A dome-destruction event, “Agua Blanca Pyroclastic Sequence” at 26.7 ka, that deposited a block-and-ash flow deposit; 5) A subplinian-plinian type eruption “Ochre Pyroclastic Sequence” (<26 ka) with an important initial phreatomagmatic phase, that generated pyroclastic density currents and pumice fallouts. The subplinian-plinian event generated a 16-km-high eruptive column, with a MDR of 1.9 x 107 kg/s, and magma volume of 0.38 km3; 6) The eruptive history ended with a subplinian eruption (<<26 ka), that generated a multilayered fall deposit, that developed a 11-km-high eruptive column, with a MDR of 2.9 x 106 kg/s and a magma volume of 0.26 km3.

Soft X-rays are emitted when highly charged solar wind ions, such as C6+, O7+, and Fe13+, interact with Hydrogen and Helium atoms. Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENAs) are produced when solar wind protons encounter neutral atoms. Consequently ENA and soft x-ray images can be a powerful technique to probe remotely the plasma and neutral density structures created when the solar wind interacts with planetary exospheres, such as those at the Earth, Moon, Mars, Venus, and comets. Here, we use the OpenGGCM global magnetosphere-ionosphere MHD model and the Hodges model for the Earth’s exosphere to simulate both soft X-ray and ENA images of Earth's dayside cusps and magnetosheath in preparation for future mission planning. We consider several solar wind and IMF scenarios, such as a sudden increase in the solar wind dynamic pressure and southward IMF turning. We then predict the time-dependent variations in X-Ray and ENA images that would be observed by spacecraft far outside the magnetosphere. As expected, strong signals appear near to and define the positions of the bow shock, magnetopause, and cusps. The soft X-ray imager observes changes in the dayside system nearly instantaneously, while the ENA imager measures the changes later due to the finite travel time of ENAs from the dayside systems to the spacecraft location.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow channels of enhanced meridional water vapor transport between the tropics and extratropics that drive precipitation extremes in the west coast areas of North America and other continents. The influence of large-scale climate modes on ARs is analyzed in terms of modulation on AR frequency and AR-related snow water equivalent (SWE) anomalies, with a focus on understanding the causes of the anomalously snowy winter season of 2010/2011 in California's Sierra Nevada. Mean SWE on 1 April 2011 was ~70% above normal averaged over 100 snow sensors. AR occurrence was anomalously high during the season, with 20 AR dates from November to March and 14 dates in the month of December 2010, compared to the mean occurrence of 9 dates per season. Most of the season's ARs occurred during negative phases of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the Pacific-North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern. Analysis of all winter ARs in California during water years 1998–2011 indicates more ARs occur during the negative phase of AO and PNA, with the increase between positive and negative phases being ~90% for AO, and ~50% for PNA. The circulation pattern associated with concurrent negative phases of AO and PNA, characterized by cyclonic anomalies centered northwest of California, provides a favorable dynamical condition for ARs. The analysis suggests that the massive Sierra Nevada snowpack during the 2010/2011 winter season is primarily related to anomalously high frequency of ARs favored by the joint phasing of −AO and −PNA, and that a secondary contribution is from increased snow accumulation during these ARs favored by colder air temperatures associated with −AO, −PNA and La Niña. The results have implications for subseasonal-to-seasonal predictability of AR activities and related weather and water extremes.",

            "abstract": "The receiver function (RF) technique is a widely used tool for investigating the crust and upper mantle structure beneath a seismic station. Constrains on the local 1D S-wave velocity profile can be obtained from the analysis of the arrival times and the amplitudes of P-to-s waves. In recent years, stochastic approaches have been successfully applied to solve the RF inverse problem in a Bayesian framework, which reconstructs the posterior probability distribution of the investigated parameters. To this broad class of algorithms belongs trans-dimensional (Trans-D) Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, where the number of unknowns is an unknown itself. The main advantages of such approach are that (1) the resolution in the final results does not depend on subjective choices; and (2) the uncertainties of the inverted parameters can be robustly estimated. Trans-D algorithms have been applied to the RF inverse problem, giving excellent results in reconstructing the entire crustal structure. However, the relative low frequency used (1Hz) prevented resolving small-scale details (<1km). Here, we present a new implementation of a Trans-D algorithm for the solution of the RF inverse problem, which allows for an improved reconstruction of the shallow crust (0-5km depth), with a resolution as high as 0.25km. Two key features have been introduced. First, we adopt a Hierarchical Bayes approach to determine the level of the noise in the observed data. This update addresses our poor knowledge of the data uncertainties, which can bias the final solution of the inverse problem. Second, we jointly invert different RFs computed with different corner frequencies, from about 0.5 to 4 Hz. This approach allows to better constrain the absolute S-wave velocity within the shallow crust. We tested our algorithm using teleseismic data recorded near a 7km-deep borehole, and, thus, our results are directly comparable with lithostratigraphy and sonic log data. Preliminary results show that our algorithm is able to retrieve the depths of the main positive and negative seismic velocity discontinuities. The 1D S-wave velocity model obtained from the posterior probability distribution displays a good match with the P-wave velocity profile measured by the sonic log.",

            "abstract": "We report results from a nearly two-year record of pressure data from three CORK hydrogeological observatories in the ~8x15 km “North Pond” sedimented basin in ~7 Ma crust west of the mid‐Atlantic Ridge at 23°N. The new data were recovered during operations with the ROV Jason from the German R/V Maria S. Merian in April of 2014. Two of the CORKs (in Holes U1382A and U1383C) had been installed during IODP Expedition 336 in fall of 2011, with an initial installment of 6-7 months data recovered in spring 2012, also by Jason from R/V Merian. The third hole, U1383B, was instrumented during the 2012 cruise with a “CORK-Lite” deployed by the ROV. All three installations monitor formation pressures in basement beneath the sediment pond. The new data confirm results of the first half-year of data, which suggested a slight formation overpressure (~10 kPa) relative to hydrostatic in the two full CORK installations. This was somewhat surprising given (a) the long history of downhole flow in DSDP Hole 395A that also penetrated basement beneath the sediment pond, and (b) prior observations at more thickly-sedimented eastern Pacific ridge flanks of formation underpressures in sites drilled into basement lows. The new results show a small phase lag and attenuation of formation tidal signals relative to seafloor tides that is the same in all three holes, which confirms that the CORKs are properly sealed at the seafloor. The phase lag and attenuation are also the same among three separate basement intervals in Hole U1383C, which suggests either that the entire drilled section is hydrogeologically well connected or that downhole packers between the intervals do not seal completely. We explore potential models to explain the slight observed overpressures. One possibility is that the geometry of the isolated sediment pond results in higher formation temperatures and less dense formation fluids immediately below the relatively impermeable sediment pond, such that surrounding cooler, denser formation fluids in effect “squeeze” the formation fluids beneath the sediment pond from all sides. While this can produce a slight overpressure beneath the sediment pond, it is not clear if the temperature contrast at North Pond is sufficient to match the magnitude of the observed formation pressure.",

            "abstract": "Most landscapes have some degree of human-induced alteration, including roadways, water diversions, and impacts from historical land use (e.g., grazing, mining). These changes in a landscape can magnify impacts of cascading disasters such as fires and subsequent storm events. The population of the Colorado Front Range is growing rapidly, putting increased pressure on the wildland-urban interface. Many historical (mid 19th to mid 20th century) mining districts have since developed into substantial exurban communities. Historical mining activity generated numerous waste rock and tailings piles of various magnitudes, from small areas of trace-metal bearing deposits to the underpinnings of entire towns. Recent natural disasters have exposed this material, enhancing mobilization by wind and water. The Fourmile Canyon Fire burned nearly 2600 hectares and over 160 homes in September 2010. Overland flow during storms in the first year post-fire mobilized mine tailings along denuded slopes, resulting in an increased flux of sediment bearing Hg, As, Cu, and other trace metals to the stream. Record-breaking amounts of rainfall across Boulder and Larimer Counties in September 2013 resulted in flooding that triggered landslides at road cuts, undercut roads at bridges, and displaced structures built directly on mine tailings, notably in Jamestown, north of Fourmile Canyon. Additional tailings mobilized by overland flow and high peak flows contributed to elevated trace metal concentrations in stream sediments downstream from legacy mining activity. Understanding the collective impact of historical and modern changes to a landscape will lead to a more holistic approach to disaster preparedness and post-disaster recovery, particularly community planning. An awareness of the geomorphic, hydrologic, ecologic and geochemical changes resulting from historical land use will enable better assessments of the resiliency of ecosystems and communities during and following disasters.",

            "abstract": "When a levee breach occurs a remarkable volume of water is released causing the inundation of an extended area. To accurately reproduce the flooding resulting from the failure, the discharge over time leaving the river must be known. This flow rate is conditioned by many factors such as: 1. the river water levels in proximity of the failure; 2. the geometry of the breach and its evolution in time; 3. the water level of the flooded area that can produce backwater effects and thus reduce the leaving flow rate or in some case reverse the flow; and 4. the provisional works aimed at fixing the failure. However, from a practical point of view, many of the previous data are hardly known and usually the only available information is the position and the finally geometry of the breach and sometimes its opening time.\nBut, if gauging stations are located in proximity of the failure, the water levels observed upstream and mainly downstream the levee breach are affected by the discharge leaving or eventually re-entering the river.\nIn this work, a Bayesian inverse methodology to estimate the discharge time series leaving a levee breach based on the water levels recorded downstream and/or upstream the failure site is proposed. Prior information, in forms of geostatistical functions, regularizes the solution. The required simulation of the forward problem, able to reproduce the river flow routing and the discharge leaving the breach, has been accomplished by means of the 1D HEC-RAS model. The Uniform Later Flow boundary condition of HEC-RAS has been used to simulate the flow leaving/entering the river across the breach. Synthetic examples with and without the above mentioned back water effects and provisional works has been used to test the procedure. Different levee breaches modeled by means of a lateral weir with movable gates has been simulated to collect the synthetic level data then used in the inverse procedure. The methodology was able to accurately reproduce the flow released by the levee breaches in all cases. The procedure has been also tested on a real case study of the tragically famous inundation of the Polesine Region (Italy) occurred in 1951 and caused by three contiguous levee breaches of the Po river. The estimated discharge leaving the breaches and consequently the total volume of water released is in accordance with other literature studies.",

Thus AIRS data have been widely used, among other things, for short-term climate research and observational component for model evaluation. One instance is the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) which uses AIRS version 5 data (Tian et al. 2013) in the climate model evaluation. The NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) is the home of processing, archiving, and distribution services for data from the AIRS mission. The GES DISC, in collaboration with the AIRS Project, released data from the version 6 algorithm in early 2013. The new algorithm represents a significant improvement over previous versions in terms of greater stability, yield, and quality of products.\nThe ongoing Earth System Grid for next generation climate model research project, a collaborative effort of GES DISC and NASA JPL, will bring temperature and humidity profiles from AIRS version 6. The AIRS version 6 product adds a new “TqJoint” data group, which contains data for a common set of observations across water vapor and temperature at all atmospheric levels and is suitable for climate process studies. How different may the monthly temperature and humidity profiles in “TqJoint” group be from the standard group where temperature and water vapor are not always valid at the same time? This study aims to answer the question by comprehensively comparing the temperature and humidity profiles from the TqJoint group and the standard group. The comparison includes absolute and relative differences, systematic trends at different levels, over land/sea and different latitude regions. We will also use MERRA data to examine the sampling differences between the “TqJoint” and standard group. The detail statistical numbers and plots will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Enceladus is observed to emit several GW of heat from the south polar terrain, as well as plumes of vapor and ice. This activity, along with recent gravity measurements imply the presence of a subsurface ocean or south polar sea. However, models of the internal dynamics suggest that heat is removed from the interior faster than it can be produced, resulting in the geologically rapid freezing of any global subsurface ocean, although a regional sea may be longer-lived. Tidal dissipation in the ice shell is severely restricted if it is mechanically coupled to the rigid silicate core. Here, we consider mechanisms that may keep the interior of Enceladus warm at the present day and produce a geologically recent liquid ocean or sea: sustained tidal heating within a completely frozen Enceladus, and impact heating of the ice shell.\nThe low central pressure on Enceladus suggests that rock fragments are not easily compressed, and that the core may be a rubble pile with pore space filled by ice or water. If the core has 20-30% ice-filled porosity, ice rheology dominates the deformation. If the core is thus disaggregated, the tidal heating can be significant even when completely frozen (as long as the ice is relatively warm), up to a factor of ~20 higher than if the core were monolithic. The heating rates obtained for the more unconsolidated cases are broadly consistent with the long-term sustainable level of tidal dissipation. While a subsurface ocean is thus not required for continued tidal dissipation, the ability of a frozen Enceladus to dissipate heat may permit late formation of such an ocean.\nLarge impacts may also provide an external source of heat to regionally melt the ice shell. The denser meltwater may percolate to the base of the ice shell, forming a south polar sea. We use the CTH hydrocode to simulate an impact by either an icy or a rocky projectile into a 40-km thick ice shell, and track the resulting temperature increase. For example, an impact by an icy impactor with a diameter of 4 km and a velocity of 20 km/s increases the temperature of the ice shell by 100-400K down to a depth of ~12 km, and laterally ~7 km; the highest temperatures are a few km below the surface. Melting 12 km of ice corresponds to a reduction in elevation of ~1 km. Larger projectiles will produce greater melting, more consistent with the observed depression of the south polar terrain.",

The Framework provides a structured approach to help managers integrate climate considerations into forest management plans and then implement adaptation actions on the ground. A planning tool, the Adaptation Workbook, is used in conjunction with vulnerability assessments and a diverse “menu” of adaptation approaches to generate site-specific adaptation actions that meet explicit management objectives. Additionally, a training course, designed around the Adaptation Workbook, leads management organizations through this process of designing on-the-ground adaptation tactics for their management projects.\nThe Framework is now being actively pursued in 20 states in the Northwoods, Central Hardwoods, Central Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and New England. The Framework community includes over 100 science and management groups, dozens of whom have worked together to complete six ecoregional vulnerability assessments covering nearly 135 million acres. More than 75 forest and urban forest adaptation strategies and approaches were synthesized from peer-reviewed and gray literature, expert solicitation, and on-the-ground adaptation projects. These are being linked through the Adaptation Workbook process to on-the-ground adaptation tactics being planned and employed in more than 50 adaptation “demonstrations”. This presentation will touch on the scientific and professional basis of the vulnerability assessments, and showcase efforts where adaptation actions are currently being implemented in forests.",

            "abstract": "The release of Samarium vapor into the upper atmosphere was studied using during the Air Force Research Laboratory sponsored Metal Oxide Space Cloud (MOSC) rocket launches in May 2009. The Naval Research Laboratory supported these experiments with 3-D photochemical modeling of the artificial plasma cloud including (1) reactions with atomic oxygen, (2) photo excitation, (3) photoionization, (4) dissociative recombination, and (5) ion and neutral diffusion.  NRL provided the experimental diagnostic instrument on the rocket which was a dual frequency radio beacon on the rocket to measure changes in total electron content. The AFRL provided ground based diagnostics of incoherent scatter radar and optical spectroscopy and imagery. The NRL Chemical Release Model (CRM) has over 600 excited states of atomic Samarium neutrals, atomic ions, along with Samarium Oxide Ions and electrons. Diffusive transport of neutrals in cylindrical geometry and ions along magnetic field lines is computed along with the reactive flow to predict the concentrations of Sm, Sm-Ion, Sm0, and SmO Ion. Comparison of the CRM with observations demonstrates that Sm release into the upper atmosphere initially produces enhanced electron densities and SmO-Ions. The diatomic ions recombine with electrons to yield neutral Sm and O. Only the photo ionization of Sm yields a stable atomic ion that does not substantially recombine. The MOSC releases in sunlight yielded long duration ion clouds that can be replicated with the CRM. The CRM predicts that Sm releases in darkness would not produce long duration plasma clouds because of the lack of photo excitation and photoionization.",

            "abstract": "The climate sensitivity of the terrestrial carbon budget will substantially affect the sign and strength of the land-climate feedbacks and the future climate trajectories. Current trends in the inter-annual variability of terrestrial carbon fluxes (IAV) may contribute to clarify the relative role of physical and biological controls of ecosystem responses to climate change. For this purpose we investigated how recent climate variability has impacted the carbon fluxes at long-term FLUXNET sites. Using a novel method, the IAV has been factored out in climate induced variability (physical control), variability due to changes in ecosystem functioning (biological control) and the interaction of the two terms.\nThe relative control of the main climatic drivers (temperature, water availability) on the physical and biological sources of IAV has been investigated using both site level fluxes and global gridded products generated from the up-scaling of flux data. Results of this analysis highlight the fundamental role of precipitation trends on the pattern of IAV in the last 30 years. Our findings on the spatial/temporal trends of IAV have been finally confirmed using the signal derived from the global network of atmospheric CO2 concentrations measurements.",

            "abstract": "We characterize a plateau and proximal eastern regions, consisting of Thaumasia, Solis, and Syria Planae, in terms of chemistry, mineralogy, and mapped geology. We determine how such independent and complementary data bear upon the evolution of this region for mantle evolution models[1]. Three chemical provinces make up the Greater Thaumasia (GT) and are less obscured by unconsolidated layers of globally-derived < 40 μm-size sediments [Fig. 5][2]. This enables complementary insight from Visible/Near/Thermal-Infrared data[3]. Depleted H and enriched Si relative to their respective global averages[4] define region 70 to the East, with the southeastern parts of GT exposing many non-volcanic rocks dating to middle-late Noachian[5]. On the West, region 90 marks K and Th depletion. Region 75 is an overlap of regions 70 and 90. GT exposes Hesperian-aged units of mostly volcanic origin in the NW, with region 90 localized in Syria Planum and 75 in Solis Planum. Comparing elemental mass fractions derived from Mars Odyssey GRS of GT sub-regions to the rest of Mars (ROM), confirms Ca depletion in region 70. H2O depletion relative to ROM gets enhanced eastward to 70. Intriguingly, the intra-regional variation in Ca, as observed by the comparison with ROM, highlights its enrichment in 90 and 75. This may present an elemental signature supporting the detection of High-Ca Pyroxene (HCP) rocks by Rogers et al. [2014]. In detail, this convergence between regions 75 and 90, with the TES compositional class 8[3], indicate a possibility of HCP-rich volcanism. The enrichment of Si accompanied by H and Th depletion, across the Noachian-Hesperian transition in GT, diverges from mantle evolution models[1].\n",

            "abstract": "Improving modeling predictions of atmospheric particulate matter and deposition of reactive nitrogen requires representative emission inventories of precursor species, such as ammonia (NH3). Anthropogenic NH3 is primarily emitted to the atmosphere from agricultural sources (80-90%) with dominant contributions (56%) from chemical fertilizer usage (CFU) in regions like Midwest USA. Local crop management practices vary spatially and temporally, which influence regional air quality. To model the impact of CFU, NH3 emission inputs to chemical transport models are obtained from the National Emission Inventory (NEI). NH3 emissions from CFU are typically estimated by combining annual fertilizer sales data with emission factors. The Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) model is used to disaggregate annual emissions to hourly scale using temporal factors. These factors are estimated by apportioning emissions within each crop season in proportion to the nitrogen applied and time-averaged to the hourly scale. Such approach does not reflect influence of CFU for different crops and local weather and soil conditions.\nThis study provides an alternate approach for estimating temporal factors for NH3 emissions. The DeNitrification DeComposition (DNDC) model was used to estimate daily variations in NH3 emissions from CFU at 14 Central Illinois locations for 2002-2011. Weather, crop and soil data were provided as inputs. A method was developed to estimate site level CFU by combining planting and harvesting dates, nitrogen management and fertilizer sales data. DNDC results indicated that annual NH3 emissions were within ±15% of SMOKE estimates. Daily modeled emissions across 10 years followed similar distributions but varied in magnitudes within ±20%. Individual emission peaks on days after CFU were 2.5-8 times greater as compared to existing estimates from SMOKE. By identifying the episodic nature of NH3 emissions from CFU, this study is expected to provide improvements in predicting atmospheric particulate matter concentrations and deposition of reactive nitrogen.",

            "abstract": "Several different classes of organic nitrogen compounds are produced when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are oxidized in the presence of nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx). The peroxyacyl nitrates and organic nitrates are particularly important as they serve as temporary or permanent sinks for NOx. PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate, CH3C(O)O2NO2) is the most important NOx reservoir, and its eventual decomposition acts as a pathway by which NOx reaches the remote troposphere. The emissions from oil and gas extraction represent a new VOC regime that could change the local fate of NOx because the particular mix of VOCs emitted from oil and gas operations should favor PAN formation.\nWe present new PAN observations from Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO) for the period 11 July to 15 August. The observations were collected during the Colorado Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Éxperiment (FRAPPÉ). PAN was measured at ROMO with a custom built gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD). At the time of submission, preliminary campaign mean and maximum PAN mixing ratios were 170 pptv and 1345 pptv respectively. Initial analyses of the data collected to date suggest that the maximum PAN mixing ratios at ROMO occurred on the afternoons of 22 and 23 July. Co-located measurements of VOCs on 22 July indicate that the elevated PAN coincided with elevated abundances light alkanes and other secondary species (O3 and alkyl nitrates). The ratio of i-pentane to n- pentane (≤1) indicates that this air mass was strongly impacted by oil and gas production operations.",

            "abstract": "The maximum force from ridge push available is about 5 TN/m, lower than that required by 2D and 3D numerical experiments to rift the lithosphere in the absence of magmatic input. We carry out 2D numerical experiments without any magmatic input to study the extensional force necessary to start a rift basin and to breakup a continent. We assume a range of initial temperature structure, crust and mantle initial thicknesses and composition. In a first step, we use velocity boundary conditions (1cm/yr) and we monitor the force necessary to breakup the continent. Results can be classified in two groups according to the amount of force needed to rift through time: (1) The initial force builds up rapidly to 12-20 TN/m within 0.4-1.0 Myr. This is followed by an exponential decrease due to early strain localization and lithospheric weakening. The force is < 5TN/m after 4.4-7.0 Myr of extension. Continental breakup occurs approximately 10 Myr after the onset of extension forming narrow conjugate margins. This group encompasses experiments with initial Tmoho < 650oC and crustal thicknesses ≤ 35 km, where crust and mantle deformation are coupled from the early stages of rifting. (2) The initial build-up is more discrete, from < 3 TN/m to 4-6.5 TN/m in the first 0.1 Myr, followed by a decrease to a nearly constant value of 3-5 TN/m from 0.4 Myr to 10 Myr, when strain starts localizing. The constant force through time reflects lithosphere strengthening and migration of the deformation. This rift migration forms a wide basin (> 250 km wide) that may evolve to form very asymmetric conjugate margins. Breakup occurs 18 Myr after the onset of rifting or later. This second group corresponds to experiments with initial Tmoho > 650 km and crustal thicknesses ≥ 35 km. High bending stresses result in upper crust brittle failure and on enhancement of lower crust lateral flow. Interaction between ductile failure in the lower crust and brittle failure in the upper crust controls the migration of the deformation. In a second step, we repeat the same experiments applying a constant extensional force ≤ 5 TN/m to test whether and how the limited ridge push force naturally available can rift and breakup a continent. We then compare our results to the evolution of aborted rifts and to along strike variations in rifted magins such as the South Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "We report the initial paleomagnetic results from a new core from Clear Lake, California. Drilling progressed to 160 meters sediment depth at a site close to the location of Core 4 collected by John Sims and his USGS colleagues in 1973. Throughout the core, the NRM has only moderate intensity but directions appear to be stable after demagnetization to 20 mT. A relatively large fluctuation of the geomagnetic field is observed at a depth of about 48.5 meters. The pattern of changes in inclination and declination can be interpreted as a subdued version of the Mono Lake excursion, whose age is between 32,000 and 35,000 years BP. A chronology for the upper third of the Clear Lake core derived from 20 radiocarbon determinations on fossil pollen samples gives an age of about 34,000 years BP for the feature, consistent with the age of the Mono Lake excursion. The observation of the Mono Lake excursion in the Clear Lake core implies that the paleomagnetic directions provide a reliable record of geomagnetic field behavior and that it should be possible to correlate the secular variation record from Clear Lake with secular variation curves from western North America spanning the last hundred thousand years or more. In the lower portion of the Clear Lake core are several 10-20 cm intervals where the NRM intensity increases about an order of magnitude. In some cases, these intervals are associated with rather anomalous directions. Investigations are underway to determine if these high-intensity intervals arise from coring disturbances, large-scale variations in lithology and/or magnetic mineral concentration, or unusual geomagnetic field behavior. These features do not correspond to tephra layers observed in the core.",

In this study, we use the atmospheric general circulation model LMDZ-iso to simulate changes in isotopic composition of precipitation due to uplift of the Himalayas and Tibetan plateau. Various scenarios of TP growth have been applied together with Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene boundary conditions. Our simulations allow us to estimate the magnitude of precipitation, temperature and wind field changes related to the spatial and temporal evolution of the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayas.

The Dust Bowl in the 1930s was the largest natural catastrophe in the North America history, caused by extended drought and poor land management. Although the severity and duration of the 1930s drought was exceptional, reconstructed paleo-climatic records show that the central U.S. plains have experienced severe droughts about once or twice a century over the past 400 years. Dust record is hence an integral component of the national climate assessment (NCA). This work presents our recent efforts to develop a climate-quality indicator of local windblown dust storms in the U.S. For the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States, we have developed a novel approach to identify local windblown dust events through routine ambient aerosol monitoring (Tong et al., 2012). This work uses the dust identification algorithm to develop a dust storm dataset (dust indicator), and rely on satellite dust detection and model dust prediction as independent data sources to test, cross-check and validate the dust indicator. This work will extend our research capabilities to contribute developing new climate indicators that are especially aimed at needs of local environmental managers in the Southwestern communities.",

            "abstract": "For interpretation and inversion of microseismic data it is important to understand, which properties of the reservoir rock control the occurrence probability of brittle rock failure and associated seismicity during hydraulic stimulation. This is especially important, when inverting for key properties like permeability and fracture conductivity. Although it became accepted that seismic events are triggered by fluid flow and the resulting perturbation of the stress field in the reservoir rock, the magnitude of stress perturbations, capable of triggering failure in rocks, can be highly variable. The controlling physical mechanism of this variability is still under discussion.\nWe compare the occurrence of microseismic events at the Cotton Valley gas field to elastic rock heterogeneity, obtained from measurements along the treatment wells. The heterogeneity is characterized by scale invariant fluctuations of elastic properties. We observe that the elastic heterogeneity of the rock formation controls the occurrence of brittle failure. In particular, we find that the density of events is increasing with the Brittleness Index (BI) of the rock, which is defined as a combination of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. We evaluate the physical meaning of the BI. By applying geomechanical investigations we characterize the influence of fluctuating elastic properties in rocks on the probability of brittle rock failure. Our analysis is based on the computation of stress fluctuations caused by elastic heterogeneity of rocks. We find that elastic rock heterogeneity causes stress fluctuations of significant magnitude. Moreover, the stress changes necessary to open and reactivate fractures in rocks are strongly related to fluctuations of elastic moduli. Our analysis gives a physical explanation to the observed relation between elastic heterogeneity of the rock formation and the occurrence of brittle failure during hydraulic reservoir stimulations.\nA crucial factor for understanding seismicity in unconventional reservoirs is the role of anisotropy of rocks. We evaluate an elastic VTI rock model corresponding to a shale gas reservoir in the Horn River Basin to understand the relation between stress, event occurrence and elastic heterogeneity in anisotropic rocks.",

This product continues the EOS ozone records from the Aura platform that is based on the combination of the ozone profile product from Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES). The unprecedented horizontal and vertical resolution and coverage of this product will enable new much-needed studies such as stratospheric chemistry and ozone loss, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone exchange, ozone climate forcing as well as long range transport of air pollution. The proposed joint CrIS/OMPS-TC/OMPS-NP global ozone record will have spatial sampling equivalent to OMPS Nadir Profiler measurements and similar to that of TES global survey record. The retrievals of using OMPS/CrIS radiances, TES/OMI and MLS/AIRS/OMI retrievals are presented. The comparisons among the multi-spectral retrievals, Aura operation ozone products, and in-situ measurements are shown.",

The lidar uses a doubled Erbium Doped Fiber amplifier and single photon counting detector to measure oxygen absorption at 765 nm. Our approach uses a sequence of laser pulses at increasing wavelengths that sample a pair of absorption lines in the Oxygen A-band at 764.7 nm. The O2 lines were selected after careful spectroscopic analysis to minimize the O2 line temperature dependence and the availability of the transmitter and receiver technology to maximize transmitter power, doubling efficiency, and detector sensitivity.

            "abstract": "Oxygen isotopes (δ18O) from speleothems in monsoon regions such as NE India have provided important records of monsoon strength on decadal to multi-millennial timescales. However, recent precipitation and cave drip water studies suggest that regional rain and drip water δ18O variability may be driven by changes in moisture sources and transport pathways rather than mainly reflecting changes in rainfall amount. Hence, we compare a modern δ18O speleothem time-series with historical meteorological records and global climate indices to identify dominant influences on speleothem δ18O.We have constructed a high resolution (7-8 samples per year) δ18O time-series using a stalagmite (MAW 02-01) from Mawmluh Cave in NE India that grew during the ~50 years preceding collection in 2013. U-series dates (±1-2 years) provide an age model and confirm that visible stalagmite laminations are approximately annual. We compared the stalagmite time-series with local meteorologic records and indices of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (Niño3, Niño4) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Our record shows no significant correlation with rainfall amount and reveals the same seasonal signal observed in local rain and drip water δ18O. We observe significant positive correlations, with a 6 month lag, between our dataset and the Niño4 Sea Surface Temperature (SST) index (r = 0.49, p < 0.001) and the IOD (r = 0.41, p < 0.001). A cross-wavelet analysis between MAW 02-01 δ18O and Niño4 highlights a shared 4-6 year frequency throughout and a strong in-phase 8-12 year frequency beginning in 1990 and persisting for the duration of the record. The latter may reflect an increase in strength and frequency of central Pacific (CP) El Niño events since 1990. Such events, with stronger SST anomalies in the central Pacific, are more likely to restrict Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) strength through enhanced westward migration of the descending arm of the Walker Cell. HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis suggests that moisture transport distance is reduced during years with CP-El Niño events compared to traditional El Niño and non-El Niño years. Our proposed interpretation of the Mawmluh stalagmite record aids interpretation of longer-term speleothem records, including their relationship to ISM variability, and supports refined predictions of future ISM behavior.",

            "abstract": "Reports of ever new record lows of Arctic sea ice extent are making headlines almost continually in recent years. The change in albedo when sea ice is replaced by open water introduces an important nonlinearity to the system. It is this nonlinearity that has sparked an ongoing debate regarding the stability of the Arctic ice cover and the possibility of an Arctic `tipping point’. In previous studies, instabilities for a shrinking ice cover linked to the ice-albedo feedback have been identified in two different types of idealized models: (i) annual-mean diffusive energy balance models (EBMs) and (ii) seasonally-varying single-column models (SCMs). The incidence of instabilities in these low-order models stands in contrast with results from comprehensive climate models which have been found not to simulate any such instability. In the present study we investigate the stability of the sea ice cover from a theoretical perspective, developing a model that includes both seasonal and latitudinal variability. The model reduces to a standard EBM or SCM as limiting cases in the parameter regime, thus reconciling the two previous lines of research. The simple formulation of this model allows us to investigate the key physical processes that govern the stability of the system. Our results show that the stability of the ice cover vastly increases with the inclusion of additional degrees of freedom associated with a seasonal cycle or horizontal heat transport. The results suggest that the sea ice cover is substantially more stable than has been suggested by previous idealized modeling studies.",

            "abstract": "High latitude drilling during IODP expedition 323 in the Bering Sea provides a unique opportunity to study in detail the evolution of Quaternary paleoceanography, climate and glacial history of the Bering Sea gateway to the Arctic Ocean. Our study focuses on a 400 ky interval of Quaternary marine sediments cored along the Bering Slope.\nSamples for magnetic analysis were obtained from sites U1339, U1343, U1344, U1345, at depths of 1008-3484 m. Sediments in these cores are a mixture of siliclastic material, derived primarily from terrigeneous sources, and biogenic material. Detailed measurements of the variation in bulk magnetic properties including natural remanent magnetization (NRM), susceptibility, ARM, and IRM, have been used to monitor changes in concentration, composition and grainsize of the magnetic components. In addition, sediment grain size analysis was preformed on biogenic free aliquots at selected intervals.\nOur results indicate that the dramatic bimodal magnetic intensity signal that alternates between a strong and weak NRM and magnetic susceptibility is associated with relatively course and fine grain sizes repectively. This is the opposite to the pattern estimated by our initial IODP Ex. 323 reports. Current models propose that, as has been observed in the North Atlantic, high intensities are likely to be related to high contributions of terrigenous and glaciomarine sediments deposited during glacial periods and low intensities are likely to occur during interglacials when continental sediments become trapped on the on the shelf. Contrary to this hypothesis, however, we find compelling evidence for a substantial increase in terrigenous input during the interglacial periods and what appears to be a predominantly pelagic signal during the glacial periods. Comparison of our data with other proxy data including oxygen isotopes, NGR, GRA allows us to investigate the possible causal links between these changes and the environmental history of the North Pacific.",

While these technologies have been used in the past to support education and communication endeavors, we have developed a novel, web-based, interactive planning tool that involves the community in using science-based methods for the design of potential runoff management strategies on their landscape. The tool, Watershed REstoration using Spatio-Temporal Optimization of Resources (WRESTORE), uses a democratic voting process coupled with visualization interfaces, computational simulation and optimization models, and user modeling techniques to support a human-centered design approach. The tool can be used to engage diverse watershed stakeholders and landowners via the internet, thereby improving opportunities for outreach and collaborations. Users are able to (a) design multiple types of conservation practices at their field-scale catchment and at the entire watershed scale, (b) examine impacts and limitations of their decisions on their neighboring catchments and on the entire watershed, (c) compare alternatives via a cost-benefit analysis, (d) vote on their “favorite” designs based on their preferences and constraints, and (e) propose their “favorite” alternatives to policy makers and other stakeholders. In this presentation, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of WRESTORE for designing alternatives of conservation practices to reduce peak flows in a Midwestern watershed, present results on multiple approaches for engaging with larger communities, and discuss potential for future developments.",

The effects of bed configuration on incipient motion were investigated by comparing the hydrodynamics associated with one exposed grain, two exposed grains, and a packed bed at the onset of sediment motion under similar free-stream forcing conditions. Direct numerical simulations were also performed for the acetate bead experimental trials. As more grains were exposed to the flow, the critical Shields parameter for sediment motion increased by as much as a factor of three but decreased with separation distance as sheltering effects decreased. A combined incipient motion criterion, accounting for the effects of the fluid shear stresses, pressure gradients and bed configuration was also evaluated. The critical threshold of the combined parameter was dependent on the static coefficient of friction and the packing concentration of the mobile bed layer. The turbulence field was intensified when more grains were added and turbulent vortices shed by nearby sediments may have induced sediment motion for some trials.",

Identifying solutions to enhance water security in such systems calls for analysis that can adequately account for this level of complexity and interaction. Our work focuses on the development of a hierarchical, multi-agent, hydroeconomic model that attempts to realistically represent complex interactions between hydrologic and multi-faceted human systems. The model is applied to Jordan, one of the most water-poor countries in the world. In recent years, the water crisis in Jordan has escalated due to an ongoing drought and influx of refugees from regional conflicts. We adopt a modular approach in which biophysical modules simulate natural and engineering phenomena, and human modules represent behavior at multiple scales of decision making. The human modules employ agent-based modeling, in which agents act as autonomous decision makers at the transboundary, state, organizational, and user levels. A systematic nomenclature and conceptual framework is used to characterize model agents and modules. Concepts from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) are adopted to promote clear conceptualization of model classes and process sequencing, establishing a foundation for full deployment of the integrated model in a scalable object-oriented programming environment. Although the framework is applied to the Jordanian water context, it is generalizable to other regional human-natural freshwater supply systems.",

The mechanisms are for earthquakes with magnitudes 2.5 and greater occurring after 1999. The ETSZ is the second largest seismic zone in the central and eastern US and the seismicity is attributed to reactivation of a major Grenville-age shear zone. P- and S- wave velocity models, the distribution of hypocenters, focal mechanisms, and potential field anomalies suggest the presence of a basement shear zone. The new focal mechanism solutions supplement and are consistent with a previously calculated set of 26 focal mechanisms for the period 1983-1993. Focal mechanisms fall into two groups. The first group shows strike-slip motion on steeply dipping nodal planes striking N-S/E-W and NE-SW/NW-SE. Mechanisms in the second group display primarily dip-slip motion and are constrained geographically to the southern portion of the seismic zone. Events in the second group are among the shallowest in the dataset (8-12 km). We are developing a geodynamic model of the regional structure to examine the stress regime, which may be changing with depth. This model will be used to determine a possible relationship between the localized normal faulting and previously established recent regional uplift.",

            "abstract": "Soil respiration rate is affected by seasonal changes in temperature and moisture, but is this a direct effect on soil metabolism or an indirect effect caused by changes in microbial biomass, bacterial community composition and substrate availability? In order to address this question, we compared continuous measurements of soil and plant CO2 exchange made with an automatic chamber system to analyses conducted on replicate soil samples collected on four dates during June-August. Microbial biomass was estimated from substrate-induced respiration rate, bacterial community composition was determined by 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing, and β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGase) and phenol oxidase enzyme activities were assayed fluorometrically or by absorbance measurements, respectively. Soil microbial biomass declined from June to August in strong correlation with a progressive decline in soil moisture during this time period. Soil bacterial species richness and alpha diversity showed no significant seasonal change. However, bacterial community composition showed a progressive shift over time as measured by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. In particular, the change in community composition was associated with increasing relative abundance in the alpha and delta classes, and declining abundance of the beta and gamma classes of the Proteobacteria phylum during June-August. NAGase showed a progressive seasonal decline in potential activity that was correlated with microbial biomass and seasonal changes in soil moisture. In contrast, phenol oxidase showed highest potential activity in mid-July near the time of peak soil respiration and ecosystem photosynthesis, which may represent a time of high input of carbon exudates into the soil from plant roots. This input of exudates may stimulate the activity of phenol oxidase, a lignolytic enzyme involved in the breakdown of soil organic matter. These analyses indicated that seasonal change in soil respiration is a complex interaction between temporal changes in soil environmental factors and biological changes in the plant and microbial community that affect soil respiratory metabolism.",

Despite management interventions to mitigate runoff, there has been no significant trend in P loading to the lakes since 1975. Increases in manure production and heavy rainfall events over this time period may have offset any effects of management. We developed a comprehensive, integrated modeling framework that can simulate the effects of multiple drivers on ecosystem services, including surface water quality. The framework includes process-based representation of terrestrial ecosystems (Agro-IBIS) and groundwater flow (MODFLOW), hydrologic routing of water and nutrients across the landscape (THMB), and assessment of lake water quality (YWQM). Biogeochemical cycling and hydrologic transport of P have been added to the framework to enable detailed simulation of P dynamics within the watershed, including interactions with climate and management. The P module features in-soil cycling of organic, inorganic, and labile forms of P; manure application, decomposition, and subsequent loss of dissolved P in runoff; loss of particulate-bound P with erosion; and transport of dissolved and particulate P within waterways. Model results will compare the effects of increased heavy rainfall events, increased manure production, and implementation of best management practices on P loads to the Yahara lakes.",

            "abstract": "SourceURL:file://localhost/Users/joycehamilton/Desktop/Hamilton%20AGU%20abstractREV8-2-14.doc\nA recent issue of EOS featured the article “Active Faults and Nuclear Power Plants” (Chapman et.al., 2014). Although this article mainly reports on evaluations of fault hazard issues at Japan’s Tsuruga NPP, it also includes a section on how the owner of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant (DCNPP) in California, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), is successfully responding to the evolving needs of seismic hazard assessment for that project. However, a review of the history of such assessment for the DCNPP project reveals a less benign situation, of which there is no hint in the EOS article. This history shows a long term pattern of collaborative efforts by PG&E and its operations and safety regulator, the US NRC, to maintain the operation of DCNPP using stratagems of non-recognition or non-acknowledgment of hazardous conditions, or of minimizing the postulated effects of such conditions by combinations of discovering new means of estimating ever lower levels of potential vibratory ground motions, and feeding the results into logic trees for a PRA which calculates the hazard down to levels acceptable to the NRC for the plant’s continued operation.\nSuch a result, however, can be made only if the geologic and seismologic reality of a very high level of seismic hazard to the facility is side stepped, down played, or dismissed. The actual pattern of late Quaternary—including contemporary—tectonism beneath and surrounding the DCNPP site, as shown on a realistic portrayal of geologic structures and active seismicity, is clearly at odds with such a conclusion, and with the statement in the EOS article that PG&E’s Long Term Seismic Program “…has provided increased confidence that earthquakes occurring in central California are not likely to produce surprising or conflicting data.”",

            "abstract": "MHD simulations of the solar corona rely on maps of the solar magnetic field for input as boundary conditions. These \"synoptic\" maps (available from a number of ground-based and space-based solar observatories) are built up over a solar rotation. A well-known problem with this approach is that the maps contain data that is as much as 27 days old. The Sun's magnetic flux is always evolving, and these changes in the flux affect coronal and heliospheric structure. Flux evolution models can in principle provide a more accurate specification, by estimating the likely state of the photospheric magnetic field on unobserved portions of the Sun. The Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric flux Transport (ADAPT) model (Arge et al. 2010) is especially well suited for this purpose. ADAPT can also incorporate information from helioseismic acoustic images to estimate the emergence of new active regions on the Sun's far side.\nIn this presentation we describe MHD models with boundary conditions derived from ADAPT maps. We investigate the June-August 2010 time period, when there was significant coronal hole evolution observed by the STEREO and SDO spacecraft. We compare model results using ADAPT maps, including those with far side data, as well as models using traditional synoptic maps, to STEREO EUVI and SDO AIA data.\nResearch supported by AFOSR & NASA.",

            "abstract": "Polar snow surfaces are rough, composed of multiple forms shaped by the interaction of snow grains and the wind. Based on the literature and new three-dimensional laser scanning data acquired in the Alaskan Arctic, we revisited the existing classifications of snow forms, and suggest a new genetic classification. Next we compared the morphology of aeolian snow features to analogous sand features, and then investigated the processes responsible for the differences. Although previous studies have suggested close similitudes between sand and snow features (barchan dunes, transverse dunes, etc.), we find significant differences, including:\n1) snow features are smaller by a factor of a 100, 2) snow dunes are flatter, 3) snow dunes move four orders of magnitude faster than sand dunes, and 4) sand dunes last millennia, while snow dunes are by and large ephemeral. Coupling equations for dune age, propagation speed, snow flux, and wind speed, we find that the lower density of snow grains vs. sand (which should produce a higher flux) is balanced by sintering, which serves as a countdown timer, eventually bonding grains together, reducing material fluxes, and thereby limiting the growth and age of snow dunes.",

            "abstract": "The manner in which small scale structure affects the large scale reconnection process in realistic 3D geometries is still an unsolved problem. With the increase in computational resources and improvements in satellite instrumentation, signatures of flux ropes or “plasmoids” are now observed with increasing regularity, yet their formation and dynamics are poorly understood. It has been demonstrated that even at MHD scales, in 2D rapid non-linear tearing of Sweet-Parker-like layers forms multiple magnetic islands (“plasmoids”) and allows the reconnection rate to become almost independent of the Lundquist number (the “plasmoid instability”). This work presents some of our recent theoretical work focussing on an analogous instability in a fully 3D geometry. Using results from a series of 3D high resolution MHD simulations, the formation and evolution of fully three dimensional “flux rope” structures following the 3D plasmoid instability will be presented, and their effects on the manner of the reconnection process as a whole discussed.",

            "abstract": "This study uses detailed geological mapping and various geophysical methods (anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), rock magnetic, and paleomagnetic data) to understand the emplacement mechanism of the Puy de Dôme located in south-central Auvergne, France. Geologic mapping shows that the Puy de Dôme has a smooth NE-SSW facing side with the opposite side being a steeper ridged area separated by a major ridge orientated NNE-SSW on the south side and a fault on the north side. The western side is bounded by two ridges that are strongly foliated and have an approximate 270° bearing in the basal sections and rotates towards 290° towards the summit. The remaining ridges are massive and unfoliated, yet often humpback in shape. Eleven paleomangetic/AMS/rock magnetic sampling sites were collected via standard acquisition methods during summer of 2013 while an additional eight sites were drilled during summer of 2014. For the preliminary sites, AMS data shows strong oblate fabrics for all eleven sites, Curie point data suggests that all magnetic carrier for all sites are dominated by titanomagnetite. Preliminary paleomagnetic data reveal two possible remanence directions. We argue either a hiatus in the eruption highlighted by slight rotation or, alternatively, the variation in site mean data may reflect secular variation or a tectonic disturbance. We propose that these These data indicate an original dome being deformed and pushed upwards and outwards as magma filled in major faults. This deformation resulted in two “hinges” on either side forming strong foliations along the hinge line while the rest of the ridged area remained unfoliated to the west and smooth to the east. We argue that the Puy de Dôme was erupted from a NE-SW oriented fissure that pierced the surface. The dome was buttressed on the NE and E side by the Peitit-Puy de Dôme Bulge, but free to extend SE to form the elongated ridge. The dome reached a height sufficient to flow laterally to the west and developed a bulge to this side as the flow initiated, but never managed to flow more than a few tens of meters.",

            "abstract": "Karst is defined as a landscape that contains especially soluble rocks such as limestone, gypsum, and marble in which caves, underground water systems, over-time sinkholes, vertical shafts, and subterranean river systems form. The cavities and voids within a karst system affect the hydrology of the region and, consequently, can affect the moisture and energy budget at surface, the planetary boundary layer development, convection, and precipitation. Carbonate karst landscapes comprise about 40% of land areas over the continental U.S east of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Currently, due to the lack of knowledge of the effects karst has on the atmosphere, no existing weather model has the capability to represent karst landscapes and to simulate its impact. One way to check the impact of a karst region on the atmosphere is to check the performance of existing weather models over karst and non-karst regions. The North American Mesoscale (NAM) operational forecast is the best example, of which historical forecasts were archived. Variables such as precipitation, maximum/minimum temperature, dew point, evapotranspiration, and surface winds were taken into account when checking the model performance over karst versus non-karst regions.\nThe forecast verification focused on a five-year period from 2007–2011. Surface station observations, gridded observational dataset, and North American Regional Reanalysis (for certain variables with insufficient observations) were used. Thirteen regions of differing climate, size, and landscape compositions were chosen across the Contiguous United States (CONUS) for the investigation. Equitable threat score (ETS), frequency bias (fBias), and root-mean-square error (RMSE) scores were calculated and analyzed for precipitation. RMSE and mean bias (Bias) were analyzed for other variables.\nETS, fBias, and RMSE scores show generally a pattern of lower forecast skills, a greater magnitude of error, and a greater under prediction of precipitation over karst than non-karst regions. In addition, standardized data was used to eliminate differences from varying climates across CONUS. The metrics derived from the standardized data shows further evidence that the NAM forecast had lower forecast skills and an overall higher magnitude of error over karst than non-karst regions.",

            "abstract": "The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission was successfully launched in February 2014. It is the next satellite mission to obtain global precipitation measurements following success of TRMM. The GPM core satellite is equipped with a dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) operating at Ku and Ka band. DPR is expected to improve our knowledge of precipitation. Profile classification module of GPM-DPR is a critical module in the retrieval system for space borne radar. It involves two aspects: 1) precipitation type classification;and 2) melting region detection. Dual-frequency classification method that has been implemented into DPR algorithm relies on the microphysical properties using the difference in measured radar reflectivities at two frequencies, a quantity often called the measured dual-frequency ratio (DFRm). There are two aspects that control DFRm vertical profile: a) the non-Rayleigh scattering; b) the path- integrated attenuation. The DFRm is determined by the forward and backscattering properties of the mixed phase and rain and the backscattering properties of the ice. It holds rich information to assist in precipitation type classification and melting layer detection. In order to quantify DFRm features, a set of indices are defined. V1=(DFRm_max-DFRm_min)/(DFRm_max+DFRm_min). Where DFRm_max and DFRm_min are DFRm local max and min values. V2 is the absolute value of the mean slope for DFRm below the DFRm local min point. To further enlarge the difference between rain types, a third DFRm index V3 is defined V3=V1/V2. V3 is an effective parameter and provides a separable threshold for different rain types. The criteria for the melting layer top is defined as the height at which the slope of the DFRm profile hits a peak value. Similarly, the melting layer bottom is defined as the height the DFRm profile has a local minimum value. These criteria show good comparisons with other existing criteria. Dual-frequency classification method has been evaluated using GPM DPR real data since it is available. Initial evaluation shows good comparison on rain type classification from both dual-frequency classification method and Ku only method at a statistical point of view. Reasonable comparison can also be seen from melting region detection.",

The FAST, Polar, and Cluster missions, as well as others, all made key observations during this period, creating a prime event for data-model comparisons. The GEM community has come together to simulate this period using many different methods in order to evaluate models, compare results, and expand our knowledge of ionospheric outflow and its effects on global dynamics.\nThis paper presents Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) simulations of this important period compared against observations from the Polar TIDE, Cluster CODIF and EFW instruments. Density and velocity of oxygen and hydrogen throughout the lobes, plasmasheet, and inner magnetosphere will be the focus of these comparisons. For these simulations, the SWMF couples the multifluid version of BATS-R-US MHD to a variety of ionospheric outflow models of varying complexity. The simplest is outflow arising from constant MHD inner boundary conditions. Two first-principles-based models are also leveraged: the Polar Wind Outflow Model (PWOM), a fluid treatment of outflow dynamics, and the Generalized Polar Wind (GPW) model, which combines fluid and particle-in-cell approaches. Each model is capable of capturing a different set of energization mechanisms, yielding different outflow results. The data-model comparisons will illustrate how well each approach captures reality and which energization mechanisms are most important. This work will also assess our current capability to reproduce ionosphere-magnetosphere mass coupling.",

            "abstract": "Most of the non-point source Nitrogen (N) load in rural areas is attributed to onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS). Nitrogen compounds are considered environmental pollutants because they deplete the oxygen availability in water bodies and produce eutrophication. The objective of this study was to simulate the fate and transport of Nitrogen in OWTS. The commercially-available 2D/3D HYDRUS software was used to develop a transport and fate model. Experimental data from a laboratory meso-cosm study included the soil moisture content, NH4 and NO3- data. That data set was used to calibrate the model. Three types of OWTS were simulated: (1) pipe-and-stone (P&S), (2) advanced soil drainfields, pressurized shallow narrow drainfield (SND) and (3) Geomat (GEO), a variation of SND. To better understand the nitrogen removal mechanism and the performance of OWTS technologies, replicate (n = 3) intact soil mesocosms were used with 15N-labelled nitrogen inputs. As a result, it was estimated that N removal by denitrification was predominant in P&S. However, it is suggested that N was removed by nitrification in SND and GEO. The calibrated model was used to estimate Nitrogen fluxes for both conventional and advanced OWTS. Also, the model predicted the N losses from nitrification and denitrification in all OWTS. These findings help to provide practitioners with guidelines to estimate N removal efficiencies for OWTS, and predict N loads and spatial distribution for identifying non-point sources.",

            "abstract": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is acquiring the next-generation weather and environmental satellite system, named the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). NOAA has overall responsibility for the system including funding and requirements while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) serves as the acquisition and development agent.\nThe Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite was launched on 28 October, 2011, and is a pathfinder for JPSS and provides continuity for the NASA Earth Observation System and the NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) system. S-NPP and the follow-on JPSS satellites will operate in the 1330 LTAN orbit. JPSS-1 is scheduled to launch in early 2017. NASA is developing the Common Ground System which will process JPSS data and has the flexibility to process data from other satellites.\nThis poster will provide a top level status update of the program, as well as an overview of the JPSS system architecture. The space segment carries a suite of sensors that collect meteorological, oceanographic, and climatological observations of the earth and atmosphere. The system design allows centralized mission management and delivers high quality environmental products to military, civil and scientific users through a Command, Control, and Communication Segment (C3S). The data processing for S-NPP/JPSS is accomplished through an Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS)/Field Terminal Segment (FTS) that processes S-NPP/JPSS satellite data to provide environmental data products to U.S. and international partners as well as remote terminal users throughout the world.",

            "abstract": "Human land use has transformed the landscapes, ecosystems and hydrology of the North American Midcontinent. One widespread impact of this transformation is increased runoff and accelerated soil erosion, which, along with direct human channel modifications and artificial drainage, have dramatically altered hydrologic and ecological conditions in streams and rivers with far-reaching results. A legacy of this change in streams and rivers is preserved on floodplains throughout the region in sediment known as post-settlement alluvium (PSA). Documenting the spatial and temporal pattern of historic floodplain sedimentation in the drainage network is part of a larger effort to understand decadal and century-scale sediment routing through the drainage system and the role of floodplain sedimentation in carbon sequestration. Fly ash, a product of high-temperature coal combustion, began to accumulate on the landscape in the early historic period (c.a.1840-1850 in Iowa and Illinois) as coal-burning technology such as steam engines came into use after 1850; prior to which no source of fly ash was present. Release of fly ash from coal burning in power plants and steam locomotives likely peaked in the early-mid 20th century. Fly ash particles (~ 1 to 10 % magnetic) are identified by their spheroidal shape and range in size from coarse clay to silt (~1-63µ). By identifying the percentage of fly ash spheroids in the magnetic separate (10 – 60µ size range) of a soil or sediment profile, the pre-fly ash Historic surface could be discerned. Application of this technique in selected localities in eastern Iowa (Clear Creek drainage) and central Illinois (Sangamon River drainage) resulted in successful demarcation of the PSA contact in areas where the boundary was physically evident. Bolstered by this success we were able to confidently demark the PSA contact in other settings where the boundary was not as physically evident. This relatively easy to implement, inexpensive tool will provide us with critical ground truth data for understanding long-term sediment movement through drainage basins and for modelling landscape evolution during the Anthropocene.

            "abstract": "The bulk of our knowledge about causes of 20th century climate change comes from simulations using numerical models. In particular, these models seemingly reproduce the observed nonuniform global warming, with periods of faster warming in 1910–1940 and 1970–2000, and a pause in between. However, closer inspection reveals some differences between the observations and model simulations. Here we show that observed multidecadal variations of surface climate exhibited a coherent global-scale signal characterized by a pair of patterns, one of which evolved in sync with multidecadal swings of the global temperature, and the other in quadrature with them. In contrast, model simulations are dominated by the stationary — single pattern — forced signal somewhat reminiscent of the observed “in-sync” pattern most pronounced in the Pacific. While simulating well the amplitude of the largest-scale — Pacific and hemispheric — multidecadal variability in surface temperature, the model underestimates variability in the North Atlantic and atmospheric indices.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric seismology is a new branch of geophysics aiming to study ionospheric response to such natural hazards as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcano eruptions. One of the very modern and exciting applications of the ionospheric seismology is the use of ionospheric measurements to determine parameters of seismic source and tsunamis, in addition to the “traditional” seismological measurements.\nIt is now experimentally proved that earthquakes with moment magnitudes Mw>6.8 are very much probable to cause ionospheric perturbations, referred to as co-seismic ionospheric disturbances (CID). The CID are usually N-shaped, in response to propagation of compression-rarefaction wave launched from the ground. Besides the primary waves generated directly by the co-seismic crustal displacements, it is possible to observe multi-mode CID propagation, especially in places with good instrumental coverage. These multiple modes are triggered and correspond to the surface Rayleigh waves (3.0-3.5 km/s), free gravity waves, tsunami propagation, etc. When the observations take place directly over the seismic fault regions, ionospheric measurements can help to obtain information on the dimensions on seismic fault and its location, as it was shown on the example of the Tohoku-oki earthquake (Astafyeva et al., JGR, DOI: 10.1002/jgra50556, 2013).\nThe next step toward the use of the ionospheric measurements for seismological purposes is to analyze resemblance in generation of tsunamis and CID. For this purpose, we analyze ionospheric response to strike-slip earthquakes that occurred in 2001-2013. We show that, unlike tsunamis, earthquakes with small vertical component of the co-seismic ground motion, can generate sufficiently large ionospheric perturbations. Therefore, independently on a focal mechanism, larger earthquakes generate larger ionospheric perturbations.",

We present a new Teflon-membrane based Gas Tension Device (GTD) for measuring the excess N2 signal generated by denitrification and anammox in OMZs, with a hydrostatic pressure-independent response and a depth range from 0 – 550 m, a significant advancement from previous GTD models. The GTD consists of a 4/1000” thick by 2” diameter Teflon-membrane with a water-side plenum connected to SeaBird 5T pump. Dissolved gases in the water equilibrate across the membrane with a low-dead-volume housing connected to a high-precision quart pressure sensor. Laboratory data characterizing the GTD will be presented. The e-folding (response) time ranges from 14 min at continuous (100%) pumping to 28 min at pulse (10%) pumping. We also demonstrate the pressure dependence of the partial pressures from Henry’s Law in the laboratory for pure nitrogen, pure oxygen, and standard atmospheric ratios of gases. GTD’s were field tested on two floats deployed in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) OMZ for 15 days that targeted a productive mesoscale surface eddy originating from the Mexican coast. We anticipated that high organic carbon export should stimulate denitrification within the OMZ below. The floats profiled between the surface and 400 m depth and concurrently measured T, S, PAR, O2 (SBE 43 and Optode), and nitrate (SUNA). The N2-profiles from the GTDs are validated against independently measured N2/Ar ratio data collected during the deployment.",

The lag time between the peak of these lightcurves was then computed and plotted as a function of loop length.

            "abstract": "Core-diffracted waves are body waves that dive deep enough to sense the core, and by interaction with this wave guide become dispersive. They sample the core-mantle boundary and the lower third of the mantle extensively. In ray theoretical modeling, the deepest part of the ray starts to graze the core at around 97 degrees distance, but ray theory is a very poor approximation to propagation of core-diffracted waves. In reality, finite-frequency waves with their spatially extend sensitivity regions start to sense the core at significantly smaller distances already.\nThe actual, non-ray-like sensitivities have been difficult to model, as have been the associated synthetic seismograms. Core-diffracted waves have therefore not been used in tomography, despite abundant observations of these phases on modern broadband seismograms. Hence current global body-wave tomographies illuminate the lower third of the mantle much less well than the upper and especially the middle third.\nThis study aims for broadband, global waveform tomography that seamlessly incorporates core-diffracted phases alongside conventional, teleseismic waves as well as regional body-waves. Here, we investigate the properties of P-diffracted waves in terms of waveform characteristics and travel-time measurements as compared to teleseismic P-wave measured by the same methods.\nTravel time anomalies, the primary data for tomography, are measured by waveform cross-correlation of data with synthetics, where the synthetics are calculated from fully numerical wave propagation in a spherically symmetric background model. These same numerical tools will be used to calculate the associated sensitivity kernels for tomography (figure, top).\nDemonstrating the extent to which waveform modeling can fit real data, we assemble and discuss a global data set of 851,905 Pdiff and 2,368,452 P-wave multi-frequency cross-correlation travel times. Findings are summarized in the Pdiff travel time map (figure, bottom) in which most major structures found in previous studies are detectable, plus several new velocity anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Seawater Nd isotopes from fossil fish teeth in Campanian to Paleogene calcareous claystone on Demerara Rise in the tropical North Atlantic record a change from epsilon Nd values of -17 to -11 during the late Maastrichtian. This shift has been identified in three different Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites that span from 600 to 1500 m paleodepths (ODP sites 1259, 1260 and 1261) and has been interpreted as a transition from a warm saline intermediate water mass formed on the South American margin, referred to as Demerara Bottom Water, to a source from the North Atlantic. A study of corresponding detrital Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes was undertaken to confirm the isotopic values derived from fish teeth record water mass compositions rather than diagenesis or boundary exchange.\nSeveral leaching procedures designed to remove Fe-Mn oxide coatings and the seawater signature they carry from the detrital fractions were tested. Sr isotopic data indicate a 0.02 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HH) leach was ineffective at removing the Fe-Mn oxides whereas a 1.0 M HH leach produced detrital Sr isotopic values that were consistent for all three sites and plotted farther from the seawater value. Detrital isotopic results can be divided into three intervals: 1) 73 – 66 Ma, when DBW is present, 2) 66 – 61 Ma, during the transition to North Atlantic sources, and 3) <61 Ma, when North Atlantic sources appear to dominate. During interval 1, detrital Nd isotopes increase gradually, while Sr and Pb isotopic ratios are relatively constant. Leading into interval 2, detrital Nd isotopes are fairly constant while there is a stepwise increase in Sr and Pb isotopes. Leading into interval 3, there is a large increase in Nd and decrease in Sr isotopes and a slight decrease in Pb isotopes.\nThe subtle differences in the timing of changes in fish teeth and detrital Nd isotopes suggest the seawater signal is responding to changes in water mass rather than changes in sediment composition (boundary exchange). The timing of the changes in detrital inputs indicates changes in provenance may correlate with the rearrangement of the currents transporting sediment to the region associated with the transition from a water mass sourced from the tropics to a more northern source.",

Gas hydrates are generally present in oil-producing areas and in permafrost regions. Methane hydrate deposits can lead to large-scale submarine slope failures, blowouts, platform foundation failures, and borehole instability. Gas hydrates constitute also an attractive source of energy as they are estimated to contain very large reserves of methane. Hydrate formation, dissociation and methane production from hydrate bearing sediments are coupled Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) processes that involve, amongst other, exothermic formation and endothermic dissociation of hydrate and ice phases, mixed fluid flow and large changes in fluid pressure. A comprehensive THM formulation is briefly presented here. Momentum balance, mass balance and energy balance equations take into consideration the interaction among all phases (i.e. solid, liquid, gas, hydrates and ice) and mechanical equilibrium. Constitutive equations describe the intrinsic THM behavior of the sediment. Simulation results conducted for hydrate bearing sediments subjected to boundary conditions highlight the complex interaction among THM processes in hydrate bearing sediments.",

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon is becoming a more commonly utilized tool for C cycling studies, as it helps constrain biotic ecosystem processes such as C turnover times and sources of production. However, for studies that focus on CO2, the sampling methods for Δ14CO2 (surface chambers and subsurface gas wells) can be affected by abiotic processes, which may bias results as a function of gas transport regime (diffusion and advection). The radiocarbon community currently uses a δ13C correction to account for mass-dependent fractionation, but to date this correction has not been validated for the soil gas environment, where atmospheric invasion and gas transport are important. This study used an analytical soil gas transport model across a range of soil diffusivities and production rates, in which we could control Δ14CO2 and δ13CO2 signatures of production and atmosphere. This synthetic situation allowed us to assess the bias that results from using the conventional correction method for estimating Δ14CO2 of soil production. We found that the conventional correction is not strictly valid in this setting for interpreting the signature of production and does not account for diffusion and atmospheric invasion. The resultant Δ14CO2 bias scales with soil diffusivity and production rates. We propose a new two-step correction for Δ14CO2 work in the soil environment that accounts for atmospheric invasion and the δ13CO2 correction, and is able to reproduce a true value of Δ14CO2 of production. This work not only assists in data interpretation, but also helps clarify a methodological window of opportunity for accurately measuring the Δ14CO2 of soil production using subsurface sampling.",

            "abstract": "Integrating geodetic data into seismic earthquake early warning (EEW) is critical for accurately resolving magnitude and finite fault dimensions in the very largest earthquakes (M>7). We have developed G-larmS, the Geodetic alarm System, as part of our efforts to incorporate geodetic data into EEW for Northern California. G-larmS is an extensible geodetic EEW infrastructure that analyzes positioning time series from real-time GPS processors, such as TrackRT or RTNET. It is currently running in an operational mode at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (BSL) where we use TrackRT to produce high sample rate displacement time series for 62 GPS stations in the greater San Francisco Bay Area with 3-4 second latency. We employ a fully triangulated network scheme, which provides resiliency against an outage or telemetry loss at any individual station, for a total of 165 basestation-rover pairs.\nG-larmS is tightly integrated into seismic alarm systems (CISN ShakeAlert, ElarmS) as it uses their P-wave detection alarms to trigger its own processing and sends warning messages back to the ShakeAlert decision module. Once triggered, G-larmS estimates the static offset at each station pair and inputs these into an inversion for fault slip, which is updated once per second. The software architecture and clear interface definitions of this Python implementation enable straightforward extensibility and exchange of specific algorithms that operate in the individual modules. For example, multiple modeling instances can be called in parallel, each of which applying a different strategy to infer fault and magnitude information (e.g., pre-defined fault planes, full grid search, least squares inversion, etc.). This design enables, for example, quick tests, expansion and algorithm comparisons.\nHere, we present the setup and report results of the first months of operation in Northern California.

We also test how differential positions over relatively short baselines (like those produced at the BSL) compare to absolute positions in the case of a very large earthquake. We perform this analysis using data from the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake, add randomly selected real-time noise, and invert for slip along the subduction zone interface.",

            "abstract": "Corotating interaction regions (CIRs) or more generally solar wind compression regions are believed to draw their source material from persistent but highly dynamic population of suprathermal (ST) particles with energies from a few keV up to 100’s of keV. Additionally, the suprathermal particle population is observed as an inverse power-law “tail” that smoothly connects to the thermal solar wind. Despite the prevalence of ST ions in interplanetary space, their origin is highly controversial primarily because many local and remote sources can contribute and cause large variations in tail properties such as intensity, density, spectral indices, and ion composition. Using solar wind, magnetic field, and suprathermal ion data (.02 -2 MeV/nuc) obtained by the Wind spacecraft, we perform a comprehensive study of the properties of ST ion populations associated with compression regions observed near Earth orbit from 1994 to 2014. This continuous, multi-year dataset has provided us with measurements over nearly two solar cycles (23 and 24) through differing solar wind and sunspot activity conditions. Our preliminary survey shows that the heavy ion spectral indices exhibit large variations on short (<1 year) and long (>1 year) timescales. We also investigate the relationships between the spectral indices, peak intensities, maximum energies, and various plasma properties such as compression ratios and solar wind speed changes, and use these statistical correlations to determine a set of new observational constraints for current acceleration models of suprathermal ions.",

            "abstract": "Metamorphic core complexes in the North American Cordillera are interpreted as sites of large–magnitude crustal extension, yet many aspects of their development remain controversial. Most core complexes in the central and southern Basin and Range are thought to have been exhumed by a single fault that evolved from ductile to brittle during the Miocene. However, new field relationships and U-Pb zircon geochronology from the lower plate of the Harcuvar core complex in western Arizona raise questions about the age and tectonic significance of mylonites in the evolution of this core complex.\nVariably mylonitic plutonic rocks dominate the lower plate. Plutonic units yield three major age populations. A foliated biotite granite yielded a U–Pb zircon age of 152 ± 3 Ma, and a gneiss with an E–W lineation yielded a similar 152 ± 4 Ma age, with some 179 ± 9 Ma cores. Leucogranite plutons and sills dominate much of the footwall and yield 71–72 Ma ages, with some inherited ~152 and ~180 Ma cores. A migmatitic biotite gneiss yielded younger U–Pb zircon ages of ~55 Ma and ~61 Ma with some ca. 1.4–1.5 Ga cores. Pegmatite dikes that cross–cut top-NE-directed mylonitic shear zones at high angles and are only weakly deformed also yield 55–64 Ma ages.\nThese results indicate that a phase of Middle to Late Jurassic magmatism was followed by a major magmatic event at ~72 Ma that emplaced large volumes of leucogranite. Minor melting (mainly pegmatites) continued until ca. 55 Ma. The pegmatites are likely late to post–tectonic and suggest that much of the lower plate mylonitization, including shearing related to top–NE extension, occurred during the Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary (Laramide) rather than the Miocene. Laramide extension may have been driven by Late Cretaceous crustal thickening and partial melting that weakened the crust and caused gravitational collapse. Thus, Miocene extension mainly occurred by brittle fault slip rather than widespread ductile shearing. These results raise questions about the time scales of core complex development and the role of tectonic inheritance in Miocene extension. U–Pb zircon and monazite geochronology currently in progress will further refine the timing of plutonic and metamorphic events and their role in the development of this core complex.",

            "abstract": "Kerogen—the organic matter that is solid and insoluble in organic solvents—is a key component of organic-rich mudstones. The composition of kerogen affects the storage and transport of hydrocarbons in these unconventional resources and is known to change with thermal maturity. We report here using FTIR spectroscopy, the compositional characteristics of kerogen as a function of thermal maturity, together with the compositional characteristics of the organic phase, bitumen—the organic matter that is solid, but soluble in organic solvents.\nKerogen is consumed during thermal maturation, whereas bitumen is an intermediary formed at low maturity from kerogen and consumed at higher maturities in formation of oil and gas. Bitumen relative to kerogen has higher aliphatic content, lower aromatic content, and lower abundance of oxygenated functions. At low maturity (vitrinite reflectance equivalent VRe ~ 0.5–0.9 %), the average length of aliphatic chains in bitumen increases during bitumen formation. At higher thermal maturities (VRe > 1.0–1.3 %), average aliphatic chain length decreases as bitumen is consumed. This evolution contrasts to that in kerogen, where aliphatic chain lengths shorten during all stages of maturation. Breakdown of kerogen appears to be driven by cleavage of oxygen functions at low maturity and removal of aliphatic carbons at higher maturities. These aliphatic-rich fragments may comprise the bitumen, and may in part explain the solubility of bitumen in organic solvents. Bitumen shows evidence of oxidation at low thermal maturity, a phenonemom not documented for kerogen. Bitumen maturation and degradation at higher thermal maturity is driven by cleavage and loss of aliphatic carbons, and is coincident with the maximum generation of oil and gas. The aromatic content of bitumen and of kerogen both increase during maturation as a consequence of the loss of aliphatic carbon. The oil and gas generation potential of the residual organic matter thus decreases during maturation. These results enhance our knowledge of the molecular-level evolution of kerogen and bitumen under thermal stress and of oil and gas generation in organic-rich mudstones.",

            "abstract": "The need to explore sustainable approaches to maintain coastal ecological systems has been widely recognized for decades and is increasingly important due to global climate change and patterns in coastal population growth. Submerged aquatic vegetation and emergent vegetation in estuaries and shorelines can provide ecosystem services, including wave-energy reduction and erosion control. Idealized models of wave-vegetation interaction often assume rigid, vertically uniform vegetation under the action of waves described by linear wave theory. A physical model experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of wave nonlinearity on the attenuation of random waves propagating through a stand of uniform, emergent vegetation in constant water depth. The experimental conditions spanned a relative water depth from near shallow to near deep water waves (0.45 < kh <1.49) and wave steepness from linear to nonlinear conditions (0.03 < ak < 0.18). The wave height to water depth ratios were in the range 0.12 < Hs/h < 0.34, and the Ursell parameter was in the range 2 < Ur < 68. Frictional losses from the side wall and friction were measured and removed from the wave attenuation in the vegetated cases to isolate the impact of vegetation. The normalized wave height attenuation decay for each case was fit to the decay equation of Dalrymple et al. (1984) to determine the damping factor, which was then used to calculate the bulk drag coefficients CD. This paper shows that the damping factor is dependent on the wave steepness ak across the range of relative water depths from shallow to deep water and that the damping factor can increase by a factor of two when the value of ak approximately doubles. In turn, this causes the drag coefficient CD to decrease on average by 23%. The drag coefficient can be modeled using the Keulegan-Carpenter number using the horizontal orbital wave velocity estimate from linear wave theory as the characteristic velocity scale. Alternatively, the Ursell parameter can be used to parameterize CD to account for the effect of wave nonlinearity, particularly in shallow water, for vegetation of single stem diameter.",

            "abstract": "From 2009-2014, NASA’s Mars Public Engagement (MPE) Program developed and implemented project-level logic models and associated impacts and indicators tables using the NSF’s “Framework for Evaluating Impacts of Informal Science Education Projects” (Friedman, 2008) as a key guiding document. This Framework was selected given the national-expert-level evaluation committee who synthesized evaluation in a way that allows project-to-project comparisons in key areas of measurable change, while also allowing variation for appropriate project-specific measures and outcomes. These logic models, revisited and refined annually, provide guidance for all measures developed, tested, and implemented with MPE projects, including the Mars Student Imaging Project (MSIP), the Imagine Mars Project, and Mars Educator Professional Development. Project questionnaires were developed, tested, refined, retested, and finalized following standard procedures outlined in Converse & Presser (1986), Dillman, Smyth, & Christian (2009), Krosnick & Presser (2010), and Presser, et al. (2004). Interview questions were drafted, reviewed by project staff, and revised following established interview question development guidelines (e.g., Kvale, 1996; Maxwell, 2005; Maykut & Morehouse, 1994; Strauss & Corbin, 1998). For MSIP final projects, a rubric guided by Lantz (2004) was developed to evaluate systematically the quality and completeness of the final projects.\nWe will discuss our instruments as well as the important issue of nonresponse error, which is relevant to a wide range of NASA programs because most data is collected from customers who are voluntary participants, as opposed to grantees who must report as a condition of their grant. NASA programs that consider data and report results from voluntary samples must be cautious about claims or decisions based on those data. We will discuss the ways in which we consider and address this challenge.",

            "abstract": "The role of ambient stratification, the vertical distribution of heat, and fiord circulation on submarine melt rates in glacial fiords in the Canadian Arctic are largely unknown despite recent widespread collapse of ice shelves in this region. A 3-year field study was conducted to investigate ocean influence on ice loss from an ice shelf and glacier tongue in Milne Fiord (82oN), Ellesmere Island. Direct ocean observations of the sub-ice cavities from through-ice profiles showed a vertically stratified water column consisting of a perennial fresh ice-dammed epishelf lake at the surface, above cold relatively fresh Polar Water, and warm saline waters from the upper halocline of the Atlantic layer at depth. The broad continental shelf and a topographic sill prevented the warmest waters of the Atlantic layer from entering the 450 m deep fiord. Meltwater concentrations were highest near the glacier grounding line, with meltwater exported at depth due to the strong ambient stratification. There was little evidence of increased buoyancy-driven melt in summer from subglacial discharge as observed in sub-Arctic fiords (e.g. southern Greenland), suggesting that circulation in high-latitude fiords is largely melt-driven convection with less pronounced seasonality. Basal melt rates estimated using three methods, meltwater flux, divergence of ice flux, and an ocean thermodynamic model, were broadly consistent. Average melt rates of 0.75 ± 0.46 m a-1 and 1.14 ± 0.83 m a-1 were found for the Milne Ice Shelf and Milne Glacier Tongue, respectively, although showed high spatial variability. The highest melt rates (~4 m a-1) were found near the glacier grounding line and were driven by warm upper halocline waters. Similar melt rates occurred in near-surface waters driven by solar heating of the epishelf lake, enhancing melt along the margins of the glacier tongue and the landward edge of the ice shelf. The Milne Ice Shelf and Milne Glacier Tongue are in a state of negative mass balance; with submarine ice melt accounting for the majority of mass loss over the duration of the study. Submarine melt rates in this region are influenced by the thickness (and presence) of the epishelf lake, and are sensitive to external changes in the Arctic Ocean, including variations in the depth of the upper halocline and the heat content of polar surface waters.",

            "abstract": "Data gathered with the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) instrument onboard Curiosity rover during active neutron spectroscopy observations presents variations of induced subsurface neutron flux due to regional variability of bulk water distribution and elemental composition in martian soil. The duration, shape and amplitude of post pulse neutron emission measured by DAN primarily depend on the subsurface structure and distribution of hydrogen (the most efficient moderation element) but abundance of other elements is also important. In particular, the presence of elements with high thermal neutron absorption cross sections can depress the population of thermal neutrons that leak out of the surface. Several elements such as for example Cl, Fe, Ti, Mn, Gd have large cross-section for thermal neutron absorption. In our analysis we have derived water depth distribution and have also estimated a bulk content of chlorine. It is considered as “chlorine-equivalent” parameter for accounting of all absorbers of thermal neutrons. We have compared our estimations with other instrument observations performed onboard Curiosity in order to test observed variability on different horizontal and vertical scales. First of all, we have tried to correlate our estimations of chlorine-equivalent abundance with elemental composition provided by APXS at several contact science locations along Curiosity path where such a comparison was supported by observable geological context. DAN instrument has a large footprint area with a radius of about 1.5 m under the aft end of the rover. It is significantly larger than the footprint of contact and remote measurements of elemental composition provided by the other science instruments onboard Curiosity. But DAN provides a unique capability to look below the surface as deep as 60 cm and study the depth distribution of water and neutron-absorbing elements. DAN measurements are complementary to other Curiosity observations and could combined with them to provide joint study of subsurface water and chlorine distribution and test compositional heterogeneity in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that coupling exists between ocean tsunamis and the upper atmosphere, opening up the possibility of tsunami monitoring through observing the ionosphere. Several measurement techniques have demonstrated the effects of this coupling in the ionosphere. Here, we present data from two techniques that allow for deducing properties of a tsunami from the ionosphere (e.g., wavelength, orientation, and velocity), namely total electron content (TEC) measurements from dual-frequency GPS receivers and ionospheric imaging through monitoring the airglow layers surrounding the earth. However, a quantitative relationship between the wave amplitudes observed in the ionosphere and the height of the tsunami remains elusive. Ionospheric signatures from two tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean, caused by the 2011 Tohoku and 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquakes, have been observed in airglow imaging systems and a network of dual-frequency GPS receivers located in Hawaii. These two events provide excellent test cases for the study of tsunami-ionospheric coupling efficiency, most notably the effects of the relative orientation between the tsunami-induced gravity waves and the Earth’s magnetic field. We present a quantitative comparison of the TEC and airglow intensity variation from these events, including results from tsunami normal mode summation modeling.",

            "abstract": "Despite the emergence of modern techniques for long distance communication, Ionospheric communication in the high frequency (HF) band (3-30 MHz) remains significant to both civilian and military users. However, the efficient use of the ever-varying ionosphere as a propagation medium is dependent on the reliability of ionospheric and HF propagation prediction models. Most available models are empirical implying that data collection has to be sufficiently large to provide good intended results. The models we present were developed with little data from the high latitudes which necessitates their validation.\nThis paper presents the validation of three long term High Frequency (HF) propagation prediction models over a path within the Arctic region. Measurements of the Maximum Usable Frequency for a 3000 km range (MUF (3000) F2) for Resolute, Canada (74.75° N, 265.00° E), are obtained from hand-scaled ionograms generated by the Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosonde (CADI). The observations have been compared with predictions obtained from the Ionospheric Communication Enhanced Profile Analysis Program (ICEPAC), Voice of America Coverage Analysis Program (VOACAP) and International Telecommunication Union Recommendation 533 (ITU-REC533) for 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013.\nA statistical analysis shows that the monthly predictions seem to reproduce the general features of the observations throughout the year though it is more evident in the winter and equinox months. Both predictions and observations show a diurnal and seasonal variation. The analysed models did not show large differences in their performances. However, there are noticeable differences across seasons for the entire period analysed: REC533 gives a better performance in winter months while VOACAP has a better performance for both equinox and summer months. VOACAP gives a better performance in the daily predictions compared to ICEPAC though, in general, the monthly predictions seem to agree more with the observations compared to the daily predictions.",

            "abstract": "The bonobo (Pan paniscus), a great ape that is endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2007. Hunting and habitat loss are primary threats. Two recent wars and ongoing conflicts in the DRC have resulted in political and economic instability that hampers on-the-ground work, thereby accentuating the importance of spatial data and maps as tools for monitoring threats remotely and prioritizing locations for safeguarding bonobo habitat. Several regional and rangewide efforts have leveraged the utility of existing spatial data to help focus limited resources for effective broad-scale conservation of these great apes. At local scales, we developed spatial models to identify locations of highest hunting pressure, predict future human settlement and agricultural expansion, map areas of highest conservation value to bonobos, and identify the connective corridors linking them. We identified 42 least-disturbed wildland blocks meeting the minimum home range size needed for bonobos, and 32 potential corridors. At the range-wide scale, we developed a first range-wide spatial model of suitable conditions for the bonobo; this was a major contribution to the development of a Bonobo Conservation Strategy for 2012-2022, recently published by IUCN. The model used a forest edge density metric and other biotic and abiotic variables in conjunction with bonobo nest data collected during 2003-2010 by over 40 bonobo researchers. Approximately 28% of the range was predicted suitable; of that, about 27.5% was located in official protected areas. Highlighting these examples, this presentation will discuss the conservation status of bonobos and how spatial data and models are being utilized for the formation of strategic conservation plans.",

            "abstract": "We simulate whistler mode chorus waves using a hybrid code with a dipole field in both one and two dimensions. Simulations in two dimensional Cartesian coordinates are also performed and compared with full particle simulations. There are four species in the simulations, hot ring current electrons initialized with a bi-Maxwellian distribution with Ahot=T&perp,hot/T||,hot-1>0, warm electrons, cold inertialess fluid electrons and parotons as an immobile background. The density of the hot population is a small fraction of the total plasma density. The warm electrons are used to make the dispersion relation of whistler waves in our model more accurate. Comparison between the dispersion relation of our model and other dispersion relations shows that our model is more accurate for lower frequency whistlers than for higher frequency whistlers. Simulations in 2-D Cartesian coordinates agree very well with a full particle code. In the one dimensional simulations along the dipole magnetic field, the predicted frequency and wave number are observed. Rising tones are observed in the 1/14 scale simulations that have larger than realistic inhomogeneity. However, in the full scale 1-D simulation in a dipole field, the waves are more broad-band and do not exhibit rising tones. In the 2-D simulations, the waves are generated with propagation approximately parallel to the background magnetic field. However, the wave fronts become oblique as they propagate to higher latitudes. Simulations with different plasma density profiles across L-shell are performed to study the effect of the background density on whistler propagation. With constant total density ne or total density that decreased moderately with respect to L, the waves refract toward larger L. With a steeper gradient of total density in L, the refraction is inward toward smeller L.",

            "abstract": "The use of geological standard reference materials (SRMs) to assess both the accuracy and the reproducibility of geochemical data is a vital consideration in determining the major and trace element abundances of geologic, oceanographic, and environmental samples. Calibration curves commonly are generated that are predicated on accurate analyses of these SRMs. As a means to verify the robustness of these calibration curves, a SRM can also be run as an unknown item (i.e., not included as a data point in the calibration). The experimentally derived composition of the SRM can thus be compared to the certified (or otherwise accepted) value. This comparison gives a direct measure of the accuracy of the method used. Similarly, if the same SRM is analyzed as an unknown over multiple analytical sessions, the external reproducibility of the method can be evaluated.\nTwo common bulk digestion methods used in geochemical analysis are flux fusion and acid digestion. The flux fusion technique is excellent at ensuring complete digestion of a variety of sample types, is quick, and does not involve much use of hazardous acids. However, this technique is hampered by a high amount of total dissolved solids and may be accompanied by an increased analytical blank for certain trace elements. On the other hand, acid digestion (using a cocktail of concentrated nitric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids) provides an exceptionally clean digestion with very low analytical blanks. However, this technique results in a loss of Si from the system and may compromise results for a few other elements (e.g., Ge). Our lab uses flux fusion for the determination of major elements and a few key trace elements by ICP-ES, while acid digestion is used for Ti and trace element analyses by ICP-MS.\nHere we present major and trace element data for BHVO-2, a frequently used SRM derived from a Hawaiian basalt, gathered over a period of over two years (30+ analyses by each technique). We show that both digestion techniques are well suited to our applications and that it is possible to achieve a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility using a combination of these methods. For elements analyzed by both digestions and instruments, agreement is strong. Lastly, we recommend new and improved elemental concentrations for BHVO-2 based on our analyses and literature/database values.",

            "abstract": "Biomass and fossil fuel combustion emits black (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) aerosols that absorb sunlight to warm climate and organic carbon (OC) aerosols that scatter sunlight to cool climate. The net forcing depends strongly on the composition, mixing state and transformations of these carbonaceous aerosols. Complexities from large variability of fuel types, combustion conditions and aging processes have confounded their treatment in models. We analyse recent laboratory and field measurements to uncover fundamental mechanism that control the chemical, optical and microphysical properties of carbonaceous aerosols that are elaborated below:\nWavelength dependence of absorption and the single scattering albedo (ω) of fresh biomass burning aerosols produced from many fuels during FLAME-4 was analysed to determine the factors that control the variability in ω. Results show that ω varies strongly with fire-integrated modified combustion efficiency (MCEFI)—higher MCEFI results in lower ω values and greater spectral dependence of ω (Liu et al GRL 2014). A parameterization of ω as a function of MCEFI for fresh BB aerosols is derived from the laboratory data and is evaluated by field data, including BBOP. Our laboratory studies also demonstrate that BrC production correlates with BC indicating that that they are produced by a common mechanism that is driven by MCEFI (Saleh et al NGeo 2014).  We show that BrC absorption is concentrated in the extremely low volatility component that favours long-range transport. \nWe observe substantial absorption enhancement for internally mixed BC from diesel and wood combustion near London during ClearFlo. While the absorption enhancement is due to BC particles coated by co-emitted OC in urban regions, it increases with photochemical age in rural areas and is simulated by core-shell models. We measure BrC absorption that is concentrated in the extremely low volatility components and attribute it to wood burning. Our results support enhanced light absorption by internally mixed BC parameterizations in models and identify mixed biomass and fossil combustion regions where this effect is large.\nWe unify the treatment of carbonaceous aerosol components and their interactions to simplify and verify their representation in climate models, and re-evaluate their direct radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "Changes in bottom temperature, salinity and density in the global ocean by 2100 for 24 CMIP5 climate models are investigated for the climate change scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The multimodel mean shows a decrease in density in all deep basins except for the North Atlantic which becomes denser. The individual model responses to climate change forcing are more complex: regarding temperature, only one model predicts a cooling of the bottom waters while the 23 others predict a warming; in salinity, there is less agreement regarding the sign of the change, especially in the Southern Ocean. The magnitude and equatorward extent of these changes also vary strongly among models. The changes in properties can be linked with the changes in transport of key water masses. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation weakens in most models and is directly linked to changes in bottom density in the North Atlantic. These changes are due to the intrusion of modified Antarctic Bottom Water, made possible by the decrease in North Atlantic Deep Water formation. In the Indian, Pacific and South Atlantic basins, changes in bottom density are congruent with the weakening in Antarctic Bottom Water transport through these basins. We argue that the greater the meridional transport, the more the change is propagated towards the equator. Then strong decreases in density over 100 years of climate change cause a weakening of the transports. The speed at which these property changes reach the deep basins is critical for a correct assessment of the heat storage capacity of the oceans as well as for predictions of future sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "An important innovation in understanding the interactions among physical of forests and measurement of forest state is the potential deployment of active (RADAR and LiDAR) satellite reconnaissance systems. We investigate the potential gain in predictive capability of structural measures determined by these instruments. Observations and model results have identified climate change as a driver of structural and compositional change in forest of Russia, which may affect climate patterns beyond the region. Using an individual-tree-based model (UVAFME) for forests at 31,000+ grid points of a 22 km×22 km grid across Russia, we inspected the relationships between above-ground biomass and structural measures including maximum tree height and Lorey’s height (average height for each tree weighted by basal area).  At each of the grid points 200 independent 0.1hectare plots were simulated for 100 years using two climate change scenarios following a 500-year spin-up to produce a mature forest. Other simulations project the change of a forest-landscape mosaic with equal proportions of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 year-old stands to mimic a heterogeneous landscape mosaic typical of reoccurring wildfires. Qualitatively, maximum height and Lorey’s height seem particularly useful in detecting forest change in the vicinity of forest transitions with other ecosystems. Quantitatively, maximum height and Lorey’s height account for a large component of the variability in forest biomass. Results of exponential regression between height measurements and biomass show that r2 values can exceed 0.75. Lorey’s height is more capable in this regard. The relationship between these measures of height and biomass can be improved with classification of forests into types. For example, Russian forest dominated by the tall, large diameter pines (Pinus koraiensis, P. sibirica, P. sylvestris) can have exceptional biomass compared to other forests across Russia, and produced biomass and height values higher relative to the other forests. Patterns of change in biomass in response to climate change across the region complement the response of height, but highlight the need to look at multiple structural measurements. These results demonstrate the utility of linking predictive modelling with this innovative technology.",

The plasma dynamic and thermal pressure varies by ~2 orders of magnitude during the magnetotail observations. In many subintervals, the non-tailward component of the flow direction is the major component. In some other cases, there is a clear tailward and very fast (~800 kms-1) flow of cold (~10eV) plasma.

These space plasma disturbances occurred at the beginning of geomagnetic storms, immediately after the storm's suddent commencement (SSC) and prior to the appearance of large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (LSTIDs) from the auroral regions. More specifically, these supersize TEC perturbations were observed when the IMF Bz was oscillating between northward and southward directions. They were found to propagate zonally westward with a propagation speed of 2-3 km/s, if projected onto an ionospheric-equivalent altitude of 350 km. Based on their general characteristics and comparison with ground-based ionosonde data, we interpret these TEC pulsations as ion drift waves in the magnetosphere/plasmasphere that propagate azimuthally inside the GPS orbit.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles are nearly ubiquitous in the atmosphere and yet there remains large uncertainties in their formation processes and ambient properties. These particles are complex microenvironments, which can contain multiple interfaces due to internal aqueous–organic phase partitioning and to the external liquid–vapor surface. These aerosol interfaces can profoundly affect the fate of condensable organic compounds emitted into the atmosphere by altering the way in which organic vapors interact with the ambient aerosol. Aerosol interfaces affect particle internal structure, species uptake, equilibrium partitioning, activation to cloud condensation or ice nuclei, and optical properties. For example, organic thin films can shield the core of the aerosol from the ambient environment, which may disrupt equilibrium partitioning and mass transfer. To improve our ability to accurately predict the fate of SOA in the atmosphere, we must improve our knowledge of aerosol interfaces and their interactions with the ambient environment. Few technologies exist to accurately probe aerosol interfaces at atmospherically-relevant conditions.\nIn this talk, a novel method using biphasic microscale flows will be introduced for generating, trapping, and perturbing complex interfaces at atmospherically relevant conditions. These microfluidic experiments utilize high-speed imaging to monitor interfacial phenomena at the microscale and are performed with phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy on a temperature-controlled inverted microscope stage. From these experiments, interfacial thermodynamic properties such as surface tension, rheological properties such as interfacial moduli, and kinetic properties such as mass transfer coefficients can be measured or inferred. Chemical compositions of the liquid phases studied here span a range of viscosities and include electrolyte and water soluble organic acid species often observed in the atmosphere, such as mixtures containing ammonium salts (e.g., (NH4)2SO4, NH4NO3) and dicarboxylic acids (e.g., malonic, glutaric, and maleic acid) as well as important mimic compounds such as sucrose – water systems.",

            "abstract": "Coseismic surface deformation is typically measured in the field by geologists and with a range of geophysical methods such as InSAR, LiDAR and GPS. Current methods, however, either fail to capture the near-field coseismic surface deformation pattern where vital information is needed, or lack pre-event data. We develop a standardized and reproducible methodology to fully constrain the surface, near-field, coseismic deformation pattern in high resolution using aerial photography.\nWe apply our methodology using the program COSI-corr to successfully cross-correlate pairs of aerial, optical imagery before and after the 1992, Mw 7.3 Landers and 1999, Mw 7.1 Hector Mine earthquakes. This technique allows measurement of the coseismic slip distribution and magnitude and width of off-fault deformation with sub-pixel precision. This technique can be applied in a cost effective manner for recent and historic earthquakes using archive aerial imagery.\nWe also use synthetic tests to constrain and correct for the bias imposed on the result due to use of a sliding window during correlation. Correcting for artificial smearing of the tectonic signal allows us to robustly measure the fault zone width along a surface rupture. Furthermore, the synthetic tests have constrained for the first time the measurement precision and accuracy of estimated fault displacements and fault-zone width. Our methodology provides the unique ability to robustly understand the kinematics of surface faulting while at the same time accounting for both off-fault deformation and measurement biases that typically complicates such data. For both earthquakes we find that our displacement measurements derived from cross-correlation are systematically larger than the field displacement measurements, indicating the presence of off-fault deformation. We show that the Landers and Hector Mine earthquake accommodated 46% and 38% of displacement away from the main primary rupture as off-fault deformation, over a mean deformation width of 183 m and 133 m, respectively. We envisage that correlation results derived from our methodology will provide vital data for near-field deformation patterns and will be of significant use for constraining inversion solutions for fault slip at depth.",

            "abstract": "The long-term impacts of climate conditions on soil ecosystems are difficult to discern with sufficient resolution to underpin a predictive understanding of ecosystem response to global climate change. The structure and function of the microbial community is intimately linked to soil organic carbon (SOC) by both the deposition of new carbon, and metabolism and respiration of existing SOC. We are studying the resilience of the microbial community, and the vulnerability of the soil carbon reservoirs, to changing climate conditions using a reciprocal soil transplant experiment initiated in 1994 in eastern Washington. Soil cores were reciprocally transplanted between two elevations (310 m and 844 m); the lower site is warmer and drier with 0.8% soil carbon, and the upper site is cooler and wetter with 1.8% soil carbon. We resampled these cores in 2012-13 to analyze the structure of the microbial community, biochemical activities of carbohydrate-active enzymes, and the soil carbon and nitrogen content. We hypothesized that microbial and biochemical dynamics developed under cool, moist conditions would destabilize under hot, dry conditions, such that carbon and nitrogen losses would be faster in warmer climate soils than the accruals in cooler climate soils. Metagenomics data analyses show that the microbial communities below 5 cm depth in the transplanted soils are most similar to those in the native and control soils from their original (pre-1994) location, whereas the surface microbial community has been influenced by their new (post-1994) location. Enzyme activities are highest in soils from the cooler, moister location, and the activities of the reciprocally transplanted soils are shifting toward the activities typical of their new location. Integration of these results with high-resolution mass spectrometry data of the soil carbon moieties will contribute to our fundamental understanding of climate change effects on the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "The Alaskan northern Cordillera is situated at the nexus of a major Pacific-North America plate boundary transition, characterized by the geometric complexity of a highly curved strike-slip fault system and ongoing shallow angle subduction. Existing seismic data from stations throughout southern Alaska and northward across the Dalton Highway are analyzed. Preliminary P wave receiver functions are presented to identify lateral variations in crustal thickness. S wave receiver functions reveal velocity discontinuities within the upper mantle, and we identify novel lithospheric structures. In the northern interior below the Brooks Range, 130 km thick lithosphere contrasts with the interior region that has shallow negative conversions (80 km), marking thinner lithosphere in the greater backarc region where heat flow is observed to be high. In the southeast Coastal Ranges, we interpret a thinner (80-90 km) North American lithosphere above a deeper interface that represents the base of the colliding Yakutat microplate. These imaging results provide context for the distribution of strain throughout the Alaskan Orocline. The presence of thick lithosphere below the Brooks Range may indicate strong lithosphere that deflects strain into central and southwestern Alaska. Thin lithosphere in east Alaska and adjacent Yukon Territory coincides with the occurrence of inboard crustal seismicity, and may be indicative of transmitted compression caused by the collision of the Yakutat microplate. The spatial distribution of the subducted portion of the Yakutat is found to lie below the Wrangell Volcanic Field and St. Elias Mountains. We establish new tectonic elements within a complex lithospheric system, and produce hypotheses that will be suitable for testing with upcoming seismic installations.",

            "abstract": "A key assumption in virtually all modeling studies in surface hydrology is that the watershed properties (dominant flow-paths, soil and vegetation properties, etc.) are time-invariant, and hence can be estimated from a sufficiently long rainfall-discharge data record. However, this “stationarity” assumption has been criticized in the recent literature. Human interference and climate change substantially affect land-use type and distribution, vegetation and soil properties (among others), and thus render the runoff response to rainfall non-stationary. In this presentation I will introduce a statistical methodology that will help to assess catchment non-stationarity. Our approach has its roots in diagnostic model evaluation, and uses approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with DREAM(ABC) to detect gradual/abrupt changes in the watersheds response to rainfall. Non-stationarity of catchment behavior is not easily visible in the rainfall-runoff response, yet manifests itself if summary metrics of the discharge data are computed for different time periods. Models that assume stationarity are unable to accurately simulate these gradual/abrupt shifts in catchment behavior, and consequently, diagnostic inference with ABC cannot produce a “behavioral” (posterior) model space. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that the presented methodology is able to successfully differentiate between watersheds that are classified as stationary and those that have undergone significant changes in land-use and urbanization and thus are deemed non-stationary.\n \n   ",

The experiment involves active- and passive-source seismology, magnetotellurics, and geochemistry/petrology. Seventy passive-source broadband seismometers were deployed in a 100-km-diameter array centered on MSH, with an average spacing of 10 km, and a planned duration of two years. The deployment over two weeks in June 2014 involved a group of 18 people split into 6 teams. Approximately half of the seismic stations have aircell batteries and/or pole-mounted solar panels in order to maintain power through deep snow at higher elevations during the winter months. Data will be retrieved 2-4 times a year throughout the duration of the experiment. The first service run performed in mid-July 2014 had a 98.4% data recovery. This is one of the largest wide-aperture two-dimensional arrays covering a volcano anywhere.\nThe active-source portion of the experiment successfully set off 23 shots in late-July 2014. These were recorded clearly at permanent stations run by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network up to 200 km away, and are expected to be well-recorded on many of the 70 broadband seismometers in addition to the 2500 Reftek “Texans” deployed temporarily for this purpose. For the 2-4 weeks of broadband data collected in July, local earthquakes down to magnitude 0 are recorded across the array, with clear P- and S- arrivals. Earthquakes of this size occur daily within 50 km of MSH. We are keeping a careful catalog of all activity in the region for the duration of the iMUSH experiment.\nWe will pick P- and S-wave travel times at the 70 broadband stations from local earthquakes and active shots, for available data from between June and October 2014. We will also use a tomographic code (Preston et al, 2003, Science) to invert the travel times to obtain preliminary earthquake location and 3-D velocity structure.",

            "abstract": "A great deal of effort is made to preserve scientific data. Not only because data is knowledge, but it is often costly to acquire and is sometimes collected under unique circumstances. Another part of the science enterprise is the development of software to process and analyze the data. Developed software is also a large investment and worthy of preservation. However, the long term preservation of software presents some challenges. Software often requires a specific technology stack to operate. This can include software, operating systems and hardware dependencies. One past approach to preserve computational capabilities is to maintain ancient hardware long past its typical viability. On an archive horizon of 100 years, this is not feasible. Another approach to preserve computational capabilities is to archive source code. While this can preserve details of the implementation and algorithms, it may not be possible to reproduce the technology stack needed to compile and run the resulting applications. This future forward dilemma has a solution. Technology used to create clouds and process big data can also be used to archive and preserve computational capabilities. We explore how basic hardware, virtual machines, containers and appropriate metadata can be used to preserve computational capabilities and to archive functional software systems. In conjunction with data archives, this provides scientist with both the data and capability to reproduce the processing and analysis used to generate past scientific results.",

In order to obtain freshly soot particles emitted by home-made wood-burning cook stoves, copper grids for Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) were placed on the last two of an 8-stages MOUDI cascade impactor. The analysis of HRTEM micrographs revealed the nanostructure and the particle size of soot particles. The XPS survey spectra show a large carbon peak around 285 eV and the oxygen signal at 533 eV. Some differences observed in the carbon/oxygen (C/O) ratio of the particles probably depend on the combustion process efficiency of each cook-stove analyzed. The C-1s XPS spectra show an asymmetric broad peak and other with low intensity that corresponds to sp2 and sp3hybridization, which were fitted with a convolution using Gaussian functions. Elastic backscattering technique allows a chemical elemental analysis of samples and confirms the presence of C, O and Si observed by XPS.\nAdditionally, the morphological properties of soot aggregates were analyzed calculating the border-based fractal dimension (Df). Particles exhibit complex shapes with high values of Df. Also, real-time absorption (σabs) and scattering (σsct) coefficients of fine (with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm) soot particles were measured. The trend in σabs and σsct indicate that the cooking process has two important combustion stages which varied in its flaming strength, being vigorous in the first stage and soft in the second one.",

The goal of this work has been to maintain or enhance a TA station’s noise performance while reducing the weight and logistical considerations required for its installation. Motivating this research are developments in posthole broadband seismometer design and the unique conditions for operating in this region, where many potential sites are located on frost-fractured outcrops or underlain by permafrost, in either case only accessible by helicopter.\nCurrent emplacement methods use a portable rig to auger or hammer-drill a hole 2.5-5 meters deep, in unconsolidated materials and permafrost, or by diamond bit coring 1-3 meters into rock. These emplacements are used at new TA installations and upgrades to existing AK network stations, and we compare their performance to the lower-48 TA vault installations. Through July 2014 there are eight TA and six upgraded AK stations operating under USArray; including five since at least October 2012, providing a detailed record of seasonal and/or site-specific behavior. We also discuss testing of different downhole configurations for 13 stations deployed at Piñon Flat Observatory in California since April 2014.\nStation performance is presented and compared using probability density functions summed from hourly power spectral density calculations. These are computed for the continuous time series of seismic data recorded on each seismic channel. Our results show that the noise performance of seismometers in Alaska with cased- or core- hole installations sometimes exceeds that of the quietest TA stations in the lower-48, particularly for the horizontal channels at long periods. We analyze and discuss the performance of example stations, comparing to other nearby seismometers. We also examine the performance of AK stations before and after they have been converted from surface vault to posthole configuration. At Piñon Flat, different methods for packing the seismometer and clamping its cables within cased holes has guided development of field procedure. The new posthole emplacements generally improve upon the mean performance of the lower-48 TA vaults.",

            "abstract": "Snowfields at Glacier National Park will likely retreat or disappear with climate change. GNP contains numerous snowfields previously designated as permanent, although this designation is no longer accurate. The edge of a snowfield moves inward while melting in summer and provides a water-rich microhabitat for alpine plants capable of growing in this harsh environment. We hypothesize that the species distribution of alpine plants will change with the retreat or disappearance of snowfields. Small, herbaceous plants live at the edges of snowfields, but trees and drought-tolerant, xeromorphic cushion plants may eventually inhabit the current snowfield edges.\nWe established permanent, geospatially referenced transects and plots in 2012-14 at the lateral and leading edges of snowfields at Siyeh, Logan, and Piegan Passes, at Preston Park, and the Mt. Clements moraine (the outer, downslope boundary of a vast snowfield). We used the Raunkiaer scheme to classify snowfield and proximal plants according to functional traits, the position of overwintering buds, and overall morphology. We characterized leaf morphology; developed height-frequency profiles; determined soil composition; and sieved soil to examine the seed bank.\nThe majority of the current snowfield edge plants are protohemicryptophytes, which means their buds overwinter at or just below the ground surface, or geophytes, which means their buds overwinter farther beneath the ground. Cushion plants were found farther from the snowfields while relatively thin-leaved (and likely less drought tolerant) plants were found near the snowfield’s edge.\nKrummholz subalpine fir grows on the cliffs above the Mt. Clements snowfield, on the Mt. Clements moraine (15-20m from the snowfield) and 20-25m from the Piegan Pass snowfield. Krummholz whitebark pine grow within 50m of the snowfield at Piegan Pass. Non-krummnolz subalpine fir trees grow within 10m of the Preston Park snowfield’s upper edge. Trees were not found within 50m of the Siyeh Pass snowfield, which is characterized by harsh winds and a seemingly arid scree slope. It may be that the retreat and possible disappearance of the snowfields will open habitat that will eventually be colonized by trees, especially since these trees are currently found very close to most of the snowfields.",

            "abstract": "Low frequency (0.006~0.02 Hz) magnetic oscillations are frequently observed to be associated with the substorm-related dipolarization in the near-Earth plasma sheet. It has been suggested that these oscillations are possibly triggered by ballooning instability in the transition region. However, our multi-point observations using THEMIS spacecraft have shown that similar oscillations are observed to be associated with the earthward moving flow channels as they penetrate from middle tail to the transition region. Linear MHD wave analysis suggested that these oscillations ahead of the dipolarization front are magnetosonic waves. For most of the cases, the thermal pressure and magnetic pressures variations are anti-phase, indicating slow mode waves. However, by taking advantage of the spacecraft located very close in X-Y plane and slightly away from the central plasma sheet, we found that for many events the phase relation between the thermal and magnetic pressure variations is Z-dependent, which suggests that the observational evidence for slow mode may not be applicable. In order to further examine these waves, we performed a MHD analysis in inhomogeneous plasma sheet. The calculation shows that for Harris Sheet configuration, the thermal and magnetic pressures variations can be anti-phase for any wave other than slow mode waves where the vertical velocity disturbance reaches its maximum, thus this phase relation may not be used as an identifier of magnetosonic wave modes. We will show the dispersion relation and wave generated disturbances obtained from the numerical calculations.",

            "abstract": "Stack records of accumulation, d18O and deuterium excess were produced from up to 4 shallow ice cores at NEEM (North-West Greenland), spanning 1724-2007 and updated to 2011 using pit water stable isotope data. Signal-to-noise ratio is high for d18O (1.3) and accumulation (1.2) but is low for deuterium excess (0.4). No long-term trend is observed in the accumulation record. By contrast, NEEM d18O shows multi-decadal increasing trends in the late 19th century and since the 1980s. Decadal d18O and accumulation variability is in phase with Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation indices, and enhanced at the beginning of the 19th century. Large-scale spatial coherency is detected between NEEM and other Greenland ice core and temperature records, strongest for North-West Greenland d18O and summer South-West coastal temperature instrumental records. The strength of correlations with the North Atlantic Oscillation is smaller than in central or south Greenland. The strongest positive d18O values are recorded at NEEM in 2010, followed by 1928, while maximum accumulation occurs in 1933. The coldest/driest decades are depicted at NEEM in 1815-1825 and 1836-1836. The spatial structure of these warm/ wet years and cold/dry decades is investigated using all available Greenland ice cores. During the period 1958-2011, the NEEM accumulation and d18O records are highly correlated with simulated precipitation, temperature and d18O from simulations performed with MAR, LMDZiso and ECHAM5iso atmospheric models, nudged to atmospheric reanalyses. Model-data agreement is better using ERA reanalyses than NCEP/NCAR and 20CR ones. Model performance is poor for deuterium excess. Gridded temperature reconstructions, instrumental data and model outputs at NEEM are used to estimate the d18O-temperature relationship for the strong warming period in 1979-2007. The estimated slope of this relationship is 1.1±0.2‰ per °C, about twice larger than previously used to estimate last interglacial temperature change from the deep NEEM ice core.",

The magnetic state of Titan could provide important constraints on its interior structures. The presence of an induced field indicates that there are conductive layer/layers in the interior, while the presence and strength of a dynamo-driven intrinsic field provide information on the dynamics in the interior and the thermal state of the material deep inside. When estimating the induced and intrinsic fields of Titan, the most important technique and biggest difficulty is to separate the field generated by the interaction between Titan’s ionosphere and its plasma environment from that generated from Titan’s interior. Therefore we use MHD simulations to predict the fields from external and internal sources. By comparing observations with simulations, we can search for the signatures of the induced field of Titan and improve the accuracy of our previous intrinsic field estimates.",

            "abstract": "The peripheral Himalayan foreland basin preserves a rich archive of Himalayan landscape dynamics. In particular, high-resolution geochronology and thermochronology of sedimentary units provides unique perspectives on the evolution of river drainage patterns and source exhumation rates when conventional bedrock applications may be limited. A case example is the rapid exhumation of the Namche Barwa metamorphic massif within the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. Here, thermo-mechanical feedbacks between erosion by the Yarlung River and uplift of a crustal-scale antiform may have locally sustained exhumation rates as high as 10 km/Ma through the Plio-Quaternary. However, the origins of these feedbacks remain difficult to constrain from the extremely young (<4 Ma) cooling histories observed in bedrock samples. To extend the record of landscape evolution, we quantify the depositional age, provenance and cooling histories of detrital minerals from Neogene sedimentary units proximal to the eastern syntaxis. Specifically, we combine magnetostratigraphy, detrital muscovite 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology, zircon fission track thermochronology and U-Pb geochronology to test the hypothesis that the development of a thermo-mechanical feedback is related to capture of the Yarlung River by a Himalayan tributary to the Brahmaputra River. Thermal modeling of thermochronologic lag-times indicates that extremely rapid exhumation rates (5-10 km/Myr) have persisted in the syntaxis since 5 Ma, following a dramatic rate increase in the Late Miocene. However, the presence of Gangdese-age zircons in older sedimentary units requires connection of the Yarlung and Brahmaputra Rivers by at least 11 Ma, predating the onset of rapid exhumation. These results suggest that capture of the Yarlung River was not a potential mechanism to initiate rapid exhumation of the Namche Barwa massif. Instead, we propose that Late Miocene tectonic uplift locally steepened the antecedent river channel, increasing rock exhumation rates and promoting a thermo-mechanical feedback localized within this area of the eastern syntaxis, but not the broader eastern Himalaya, in the Plio-Quaternary.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological modelling and streamflow prediction for watersheds over which multiple data sets are available can benefit from data assimilation. For example, updating modelled upstream flows and snow water equivalent (SWE) via existing correlations with downstream flow and SWE observations can positively impact short-term (days) and mid-term (weeks) streamflow forecast, respectively. Other variables can be updated indirectly if they are included in the state vector, which will further affect results. In order to fully benefit from existing correlations between variables, one may be tempted to augment the state vector to include all related variables and parameters, or choose to include a very limited number of variables in order to prevent erroneous correlations from deteriorating other model states. Localizing the correlations on the spatial level or between variables can also affect results. This makes it unclear as to how to configure the state vector, especially when multivariate observations are assimilated. This study presents a sensitivity analysis of the state vector configuration for synthetic multivariate data assimilation using an Ensemble Kalman filter. A spatially distributed hydrological model is used to simulate streamflow predictions for the mountainous Nechako River located in British-Columbia, Canada. Synthetic data includes daily snow cover extent, daily measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) at three different locations and daily streamflow data at the watershed outlet. Results show a large variability of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and streamflow bias over a wide range of prediction horizons (days to weeks) depending on the state vector configuration and the type of observations assimilated. Some configurations are shown to improve the accuracy of streamflow predictions while others offer worse results than the open loop simulation. These results serve as a first step toward comparing streamflow prediction performance of various real multivariate data assimilation scenarios.",

In a larger number of members (>6), all forcings are specified and these, along with an extended control integration, are used to to estimate internal variability and distinguish it from forced changes in the global monsoon system.\nThis analysis examines the relevance of the global monsoon concept, which suggests coherent variability across the monsoon systems, to simulated variability since 850. The analysis also examines the ability of the CESM-LM model configuration to reproduce key features of the global monsoon in the present day while distinguishing between regional monsoon systems, and land-ocean and inter-hemispheric contrasts across timescales.

            "abstract": "Many active volcanic systems are associated with high-enthalpy geothermal systems. For systems characterized by shallow magmatic intrusions, liquid water often predominates at depth with two-phase fluids, vapor and liquid water, occurring at shallower depth due to depressurization boiling. Close to the intrusion, superheated or supercritical vapor may also occur. The Krafla high-enthalpy geothermal system provides an ideal opportunity to study such volcanic geothermal systems. Over forty wells have been drilled into the system with fluid discharge temperatures of <200°C to ~450°C and enthalpy between <900 and >3200 kJ/kg. In this study, geochemical modelling of multicomponent fluid phases associated with shallow magmatic intrusions were conducted across variable temperature, pressure and enthalpy conditions and the results compared with the fluid geochemistry of the Krafla system.\nWithin the reservoir at geothermal temperatures (250-300°C) liquid water predominates. Under these conditions, the concentrations of most major elements are controlled by equilibrium with secondary minerals. Geochemical modelling and observations at Krafla support these findings. Around the magma intrusions believed to be at shallow depth at Krafla, superheated vapor is formed. Such fluid was discharged by the IDDP-1 well at 450°C and 140 bar. According to the geochemical modelling, superheated vapor is produced upon heat addition by the intrusion to the surrounding geothermal water resulting in boiling to dryness, precipitation of non-volatiles (Si, Fe, Mg, Al, SO4, Na, K, Ca) whereas volatiles (CO2, H2S, Cl, F, B) are unaffected. By mass, quartz is the predominant secondary mineral around the intrusions. The chemical composition of the modelled and observed superheated vapor compared well.\nUpon ascent and depressurization of the liquid geothermal water and the superheated vapor various processes may occur, including superheated vapor condensation, mixing and depressurization boiling. This leads to formation of two-phase liquid and vapor fluids, dilute acid fluids produced upon vapor condensation and mixtures thereof. Such fluids are indeed observed within the Krafla system supporting the results of the geochemical modelling.",

One of the challenges in maintaining this archive is the need for providing Quality Assurance (QA) on its contents so that the data can be most effectively used by the scientific community. In the past, IRIS has focussed its QA efforts on improving data quality for a targeted subset of seismic networks, most notably the Earthscope USArray Transportable Array and the Global Seismic Network (GSN). Now with the rollout of MUSTANG, the DMC's new automated data quality metrics system, we are embarking on an ambitious effort to bring QA to the entirety of the DMC seismic data archive.\nAnalysts at the DMC are in the process of developing improved techniques to find data problems, document significant issues, and communicate our results. Our initial efforts are directed at creating a prototype of a scalable QA process using GSN data and MUSTANG metrics. We will show how MUSTANG metrics, both as single measurements and aggregates of multiple measurements, can be used to quickly flag potential problems and demonstrate how analysts can use visualization tools to track changes in data quality at stations and across networks. Communication between IRIS, network operators, and data users will be crucial to the success of any QA effort. To that end, we are also improving our web presence with the aim of increasing data quality awareness within the seismological community and providing a place where people can report issues they encounter with either data or metrics measurements.",

            "abstract": "Biological soil crusts (BSC) are known to play a critical role in the stabilization of desert surfaces by helping to protect sediment from wind and water erosion and aiding in the trapping of airborne particles. The crusts are often composed of cyanobacteria, algae, and fungi, and occupy the upper few cm of a soil. Due to their high tolerance of desiccation and ability to utilize fog and dew sources, BSC are able to exist in environments that may otherwise be too dry for vascular plants. In the hyperarid Atacama Desert, decades or more between measurable precipitation events has created a landscape devoid of macroscopic life. While precipitation is rare, coastal fog occurs regularly and microbial communities capable of utilizing fog and dew water are able to persist. Here we found cyanobacteria and lichen living in association with a thin sulfate and dust crust (~2 cm) covering the surface of ‘dust plateaus’. Topographically the region is highly irregular and part of a largely erosional landscape. We hypothesized that these flat-topped plateaus are accretionary features that have been able to maintain dust accumulation for thousands of years as a result of the surface crusts. To test this hypothesis we conducted radiocarbon analysis of crusts and soil profiles at two sites approximately 30 km apart, one in a high fog zone and another in lower fog frequency zone. The radiocarbon analysis shows that sediment has been accumulating in the ‘plateaus’ for the past 15,000 years and that biological activity and rates of C cycling in the crust increase with increasing fog frequency and intensity. The ages of organic material in the dust decrease monotonically with decreasing soil thickness, suggestive of progressive upward growth by dust accumulation. Our data indicate that the BSC are capable of surviving in hyperarid the Atacama Desert, a Mars analogue, through the utilization of fog water, and that their presence can leave a visible geomorphic imprint on the landscape.",

            "abstract": "The boreal forest contains over 30 percent of Earth’s terrestrial carbon, stored mainly as organic matter in soils. Warming temperatures have decreased the fire return interval at many locations, potentially opening more boreal forest space to early-successional deciduous species. However, previous observational studies have shown that the residual forest organic layer depth after a fire can be directly related to fire severity and that this organic layer depth plays a critical role in determining post-fire secondary succession in the North American boreal forest. In this study, we use a numerical model constrained by field data to evaluate: (1) the extent to which the organic layer inhibits deciduous seedling establishment; (2) whether differences in seedling establishment after mild and severe burns affect mature forest structure and composition on decadal to century time scales. Our modeling experiments were carried out with the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2) terrestrial biosphere model. ED2 is designed to explicitly track the growth and mortality of individual trees, which compete for light, water, and nutrients using an open nitrogen cycle. Our simulations feature parameterizations for aspen and black spruce species-types as well as a new dynamic soil organic layer module with species-specific litter decay rates. The updated boreal forest model is validated using several datasets across the North American boreal forest that range from daily carbon and energy fluxes to multi-century basal area chronosequences including: (1) sub-daily to monthly eddy covariance measurements taken in Delta Junction, Alaska and Manitoba, Canada; (2) decade-long forest inventory data from the Cooperative Alaska Forest Inventory taken throughout the Alaskan boreal forest; and (3) multi-century basal area chronosequences measured in Manitoba and Quebec. We then use the model to identify the controls that the soil organic layer exerts on secondary succession between aspen and black spruce, and subsequent forest growth using a suite of post-fire burn scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Sulfur metabolisms are major drivers of organic matter remineralization and microbial growth in marine sediments. Sulfur-isotope systematics are particularly powerful for interrogating metabolic processes in these systems due to the large sulfur-isotope fractionations associated with bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) and some other metabolic reactions. Recent analytical advancements have made it possible to measure δ34S values of very small samples (>50 nmol), including aqueous sulfate and sulfide as well as pyrite, elemental sulfur, and multiple fractions of sedimentary organic matter. We have generated comprehensive 2.5 cm-resolution depth profiles of these sulfur pools over a 2-m core from Santa Barbara Basin, a sub-oxic environment off the California coast. We find that the porewater sulfide δ34S values appear to be strongly influenced by anaerobic sulfide oxidation and sulfur disproportionation in addition to BSR. These sulfur-isotope signals can be tracked over the course of several thousand years of sediment diagenesis, moving from the oxic-anoxic transition at the sediment-water interface to the sulfate-methane transition zone in deeper sediments. Shifts in δ34S relationships among sulfur pools correlate with changes in microbial community composition as shown in TAG genomic data, which supports the existence of the metabolisms indicated by δ34S profiles. Our results suggest that the existence and activity of multiple microbial communities and coexisting sulfur metabolisms have the potential to be recorded in sedimentary δ34S records.",

            "abstract": "The competition between diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and advective transport in valleys sets fundamental spatial and temporal landscape scales, including ridge-valley spacing and landscape response time. However, the interactions between hillslopes and channels are difficult to measure in natural landscapes, due to long timescales and confounding climatic and lithologic factors. Laboratory experiments allow us to observe complex sediment dynamics in a controlled setting, but past work on erosive landscapes does not include diffusive hillslopes and hence cannot provide insight into channel-hillslope interactions. Here, we present the first results from a novel laboratory experiment combining hillslope diffusion and valley advection. Our experimental apparatus, the eXperimental Landscape Modeling (XLM) facility at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory, consists of a 0.5 m x 0.5 m test flume filled with crystalline silica (D50 = 30μ) mixed with water, a high-resolution laser scanner to measure topography, and a series of load cells to measure sediment flux. Baselevel lowering is simulated by dropping two motorized weirs. During each run, we alternated between: (1) advective transport induced by a series of misting nozzles, where drops are not large enough to disturb sediment on impact, and (2) diffusive rainsplash transport driven by a constant head drip tray. We report a series of experiments where the relative strength of advection and diffusion are varied systematically between runs, testing theoretical predictions that dominantly diffusive landscapes will have larger ridge-valley spacing and respond more slowly to perturbations in baselevel. Our work provides an invaluable dataset for both testing numerical models of landscape evolution and guiding field investigations of channel-hillslope interactions.",

            "abstract": "The Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) (34-33.5 Ma) is one of the most dramatic climatic changes in the Cenozoic and represents a shift from global “hothouse” to “icehouse” conditions. Climatic and hydrologic data from across the globe indicate a high degree of heterogeneity in the terrestrial climatic response to this global cooling, with the largest changes observed at high latitudes. Recent data from northern Europe shows cooling across this interval associated with major faunal turnover. However, paleosol data from northeastern Spain suggests only modest changes to temperature and precipitation associated with this transition. We measured the hydrogen isotopic composition of higher plant-derived normal alkanes in Eocene to Oligocene sediments of Northeastern Spain to quantify changes to climate and isotope hydrology across this transition. Hydrogen isotopes of plant waxes provide a record of isotopes of precipitation and/or factors that influence stomatal regulation. Our data show a small increase in the average chain length of higher plant waxes across the EOT cooling event, which may reflect changes in water availability or ecosystem type. Hydrogen isotopes of higher plant waxes show a small positive shift in δD from the late Eocene to early Oligocene, but high-frequency variability prior to and after the Eocene-Oligocene transition. In total, when coupled with other paleoclimate proxy data, these suggest minimal changes to the hydrologic cycle in NE Spain from the late Eocene to early Oligocene.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is an important nutrient that contributes to eutrophication of water bodies and plays a key role in various terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem processes. Thus, understanding the amounts and timing of N inputs from watersheds to aquatic ecosystems is critical. Most research to date has focused on the dissolved forms (< 0.45 micron) of N such as nitrate-N and organic N, which constitute a major portion of the N flux during baseflow and small to moderate storm events. The amounts of particulate N (PN > 0.45 micron) in runoff, can however, increase dramatically with large storms such as those associated with tropical depressions and hurricanes and can have a lasting impact on downstream aquatic systems. We determined the exports and storm-event patterns of PN for two (12 and 79 ha) intensively instrumented, headwater, forested, catchments located in the Piedmont Region of Maryland. Stream runoff sampling has been performed for baseflow and storm events since 2011 and has included numerous large tropical storms including Irene (2011) and Sandy (2012). Key questions that we address are: How significant is the PN flux, i.e., what proportion of the annual N is exported as PN during the large tropical events? How does PN export vary with storm magnitude? How do PN exports change with catchment scale? What are the temporal patterns of dissolved and particulate N species during the largest storms? Observations for tropical storm Irene (2011) revealed that in just 59 hours this storm contributed to one-third of the annual (2011) N flux from the 12 ha watershed and 87% of this N was in particulate form. A large portion of this particulate N is likely deposited in the fluvial network, especially in headwater reaches, and could potentially become bioavailable. Understanding these contributions from large events is especially important considering that climate-change scenarios indicate increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and thus potentially a greater role for PN in watershed N fluxes and cycling. This study will also enhance our ability to develop better management practices and decision tools to regulate N exports from watersheds.",

Since fuel conditions tend to be driest from late September through the middle of November, Santa Ana winds occurring during this period have the greatest potential to produce large, devastating fires when an ignition occurs. Such catastrophic fires occurred in 1993, 2003, 2007, and 2008. Because of the destructive nature of these fires, there has been a growing desire to categorize Santa Ana wind events in much the same way that tropical cyclones have been categorized. The Santa Ana Wildfire Threat index (SAWT) is an attempt to categorize such events with respect to fire activity, based on surface wind velocity, dew point depression, and forecasted fuel conditions. The index, a USDA Forest Service product, was developed by the Forest Service in collaboration with San Diego Gas and Electric Utility (SDG&E), the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UCLA, The Desert Research Institute (DRI), and Vertum Partners. The methodology behind the SAWT index, along with the index itself will be presented in detail. Also, there will be a discussion on the construction of a 30-year climatology of the index, which includes various meteorological and fuel parameters. We will demonstrate the usefulness of the index as another decision support tool for fire agencies and first responders, and how it could assist the general public and private industry in the preparation of critical Santa Ana wind events.",

In some previous experiments, reactive melt infiltration led to channelization; in others, it did not. To better understand the conditions required for channel formation, we developed an experimental set-up that allows flow of a reactive melt through a rock under a controlled pressure gradient by sandwiching a partially molten rock between a melt reservoir and porous sink.\nHot-pressed 50:50 mixtures of olivine (Ol) and clinopyroxene (Cpx) with either 4 or 20 vol% alkali basalt formed ~4 mm long cylinders of partially molten rock. Source and sink are disks of alkali basalt and porous alumina. A melt reservoir-to-rock volume ratio of 2:1 ensured chemical disequilibrium. We anneal melt:rock:sink triplets for up to 5 h at a confining pressure of Pc=300 MPa with effective pressure Pe=0 to 299.9 MPa (Pe = Pc - Pp) , at T = 1200° & 1250°C.\nTwo distinct melt migration features form, 1) a planar reaction layer and 2) finger-shaped channels. Both the reaction layer and the fingers contain Ol + melt with little to no Cpx. Planar reaction layers develop at the melt-rock interface in all experiments. Finger-shaped channels form only in experiments in which a fluid pressure gradient exists from source to sink, i.e. Pe>0\nThe thickness of the planar reaction layer increases with increasing T and with the square root of time, indicating that diffusion controls the growth rate, reaching thicknesses of ~70 µm at 1200°C and ~200 µm at 1250°C in 5 h, though layer thickness is independent of Peand initial melt content. The finger-shaped channels are more closely spaced and thicker in the experiments at higher temperature and higher initial melt content.\nTo conclude, under our laboratory conditions, channelization of a reactive melt required application of a fluid pressure gradient; scaling conditions for channel formation requires further experiments and connection to theory.",

            "abstract": "The understanding of the crystal chemistry of serpentine minerals (incl. antigorite, lizardite and chrysotile) is fundamental since serpentinization processes concern very large scientific domains: e.g., natural abiotic hydrogen production (Marcaillou et al., 2011), origins of life (Russell et al., 2010), fluid properties and mobility of metals in subduction zones (Kelley and Cottrell, 2009). This study aims at characterizing relations between the micro-, and nano-structures of the most abundant serpentine polytypes in the oceanic crust. Serpentine theoretical formula is Mg3Si2O5(OH)4 but several natural substitutions are possible and the formula may be written such as: (Mg,Fe2+,Fe3+,Al)3(Si,Al,Fe3+)2O5(OH)4; showing that Fe and Al may play an important role in the crystallization of serpentines. Preliminary crystal chemistry studies, suggest that, 1) the Al content alone cannot be directly correlated to serpentine polytypes (Andreani et al., 2008), 2) the amounts of tetrahedral iron can be significant in the presence of ferric iron (Marcaillou et al., 2011). Because magnetite is usually associated to serpentine, the Fe-speciation characterization of serpentine is delicate. Here, we provide the study of 33 magnetite-free serpentines containing various amounts of Fe and Al. The samples were characterized by SEM, Raman, XRF, as well as XANES, pre-edge, and EXAFS spectroscopy at the Fe K-edge. XANES experimental data were crosschecked and interpreted thanks to ab initio calculations and EXAFS shell-fitting. Also, preliminary 27Al-RMN data is presented. Results suggest relationships between the type and amount of substitution of trivalent cations in minerals, and the microstructures observed. Chrysotile incorporates less trivalent cations than other varieties, which tends to preserve the so-called misfit between the TO layers, and therefore the tubular structure of the mineral. Lizardites mainly involve Fe/Al Tschermak-type substitutions, while M-site vacancy charge-compensation mechanisms could be favored for antigorite crystals.\n",

            "abstract": "The Unalaska seismic gap flanks the eastern part of the zone of aftershocks that followed the great Mw 8.6 Andreanof Islands earthquake in 1957, yet the historical and paleo seismicity in this part of the Aleutian subduction zone is poorly resolved. Inversions of seismic and tsunami waveforms indicate little or no megathrust slip near Unalaska in 1957, leading some to designate the region as a seismic gap. In the absence of a long seismic record, inundation modeling validated by geologic evidence for tsunami inundation provide constraints on rupture parameters of tsunamigenic earthquakes. Parameters such as magnitude and slip distribution have broad uncertainties, but are very important in furthering earthquake and tsunami hazard assessments. Field investigations at Stardust Bay on Sedanka Island (near the eastern end of Unalaska) identified a sequence of six paleotsunami deposits over the last 1770 years that inundated up to 18.5 m above sea level, the youngest deposit probably records the tsunami generated by the 1957 earthquake. Tsunami inundation scenarios, modeled in GeoCLAW (simulating tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation) and using published sources of the 1957 tsunami cannot account for the tsunami deposit runup observed at Stardust Bay. Inundation scenarios that used a variety of alternative hypothetical earthquake sources suggest that at least a part of the Unalaska gap must rupture to agree with paleotsunami deposits. Scenarios modeled using a non-uniform slip distribution on the fault consistent with updip strengthening had significantly higher runup compared to scenarios that used a uniform slip distribution. By modeling a variety of non-uniform slip-distributions on a fault representing the subduction zone spanning the Unalaska Gap, we are trying to determine the minimum amount of slip that results in the observed deposit runup. The slip distribution used for the preferred 1957 tsunami scenario [that best fits the 1957 deposit data] provides an estimate of the minimum average slip of the tsunami source. Coupling the inundation model with a forward sediment transport model might reveal relative tsunami magnitudes for each deposit observed in Stardust Bay.",

            "abstract": "Numerous studies have suggested that variations in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) can drive variations in North Atlantic sea surface temperature (NASST). Such a relationship raises the prospect of predicting NASST changes years in advance. The recent study of Zhang and Wang (2013), however, has raised questions about the ability of coupled models to reproduce this behavior. Specifically, they show that some models (like CCSM4) produce a negative correlation between indices of the AMOC and NASST, while other models (like CanESM2) produce a positive correlation. Their analysis was based on linearly detrended output from the CMIP5 20th century historical simulations.\nWe demonstrate that, even after detrending, the presence of time-varying external forcing has a confounding influence on the AMOC-NASST relationship. First, we present calculations from nine pre-industrial control simulations showing that, in the absence of forced variability, all nine models produce positive simultaneous correlations between the AMOC and NASST. Even when we split the control simulations into shorter segments, the positive AMOC-NASST correlation remains. This suggests that forced variability--and not simulation length--explains the apparent inconsistency of the AMOC-NASST relationship in the CMIP5 historical simulations.\nWe provide additional support for this claim by presenting analysis of the CESM1 29-member \"large ensemble\" covering the period 1920-2005. The ensemble mean NASST index shows a slight cooling trend from 1940 to 1965 and a warming trend thereafter, corresponding approximately to trends in aerosol forcing. The ensemble mean AMOC index is mostly flat from 1940 to 1960, and increases from 1960 to 1980. Thus, the ensemble means of the AMOC and NASST have a slightly negative simultaneous correlation, and some realizations exhibit this “forced relationship,” even after removing the linear trend. However, when the ensemble mean is first subtracted from each realization, then all realizations show a positive AMOC-NASST correlation. Since the ensemble mean is an estimate of forced variability, this suggests that properly removing forced variability is key to producing an AMOC-NASST relationship that is robust across all models and all realizations.",

Ocean research is deserving of a focused coordination network given: the ocean’s scale (71% of the planet) and role in global change and in human society; the numerous existing Global Environmental Change core projects related to ocean science (as many as 19) and numerous other relevant ICSU and international programs to be considered; and the resources and infrastructure required to access the ocean. We propose a model for ocean research coordination that will work with existing Global Environmental Change projects and the Future Earth Secretariat to facilitate research collaboration, communication, and stakeholder co-design of an integrative ocean science program focus beyond the level or responsibility of any individual project, with the goal of building capacity for cross-cutting research and deliverables.",

Recent studies propose a series of events that makes the connection between Arctic amplification/sea ice decline and increased frequency of extreme weather events in the mid-latitudes plausible. This study examines relationships between 1978-2013 spring (MAM) and summer (JJA) extreme surface air temperature (SAT) conditions across North America (NA) and simultaneous Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) conditions. Seasonal summaries of daily frequency of occurrence of extreme SATs are correlated to simultaneous mean seasonal SIC anomalies. Low MAM SICs coincide with higher-than-normal incidence of cool nights/days across central US and Canada and eastern in Canada and lower-than-expected incidence of cool nights/days is observed westward from Nevada and Arizona. At this time, large portions of northern and eastern Canada and NE US coincide with decreased frequency of warmest days/nights and large sections of the US southwest show a significant increase in the frequency of warmest days/nights when SICs are low. SAT extremes continue to be related to SIC conditions into JJA across large portions of northern and eastern NA where lower-than-expected SICs coincide with significantly lower frequencies of cool nights/days and higher frequency of warm days/nights. Also examined are various simultaneously-occurring atmospheric and synoptic flow conditions that may begin to suggest potential mechanisms behind the observed relationships. Initial analyses indicate the observed relationships are reflected in mean monthly SATs and atmospheric thickness conditions, as well as 500 and 250 hPa geopotential height and zonal wind anomaly patterns. Both seasons display strong north-south meandering of the 500 hPa surface. During low MAM ice seasons the mid-tropospheric flow resembles the positive phase of the AO with a well-developed polar vortex that dips south of the Great Lakes; low SIC JJA seasons are characterized by a low-high-low flow over NA with a ridge over the central-eastern sector. Zonal flow at the 500 hPa level is significantly weakened in JJA over eastern NA. Areas with greatest flow anomalies are associated with regions that display most notable SAT extreme frequency deviations.",

            "abstract": "Extratropical cyclones are a main driver of mid-latitude weather conditions, continually interacting with their synoptic and mesoscale environment. These systems are a product of the cyclogenetic environment in which they develop, and their associated circulation, latent heating, and radiative heating in turn exert significant influence on the near and far-field dynamic and thermodynamic state. With the projected warming to our climate system, the environments in which mid-latitude cyclones develop are changing, as are the controlling influences on storm characteristics: temperature, moisture content, jet strength, and baroclinicity. Feedbacks between changes in the initial environment and changes in extratropical cyclone properties represent a challenge to our ability to characterize the effects of changes in climate on the winds and rainfall produced by these storms.\nIn this presentation, we consider how extratropical cyclones might respond to simultaneous changes in multiple environmental factors. We utilize an idealized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), allowing for systematic control of environmental conditions. We perform a comprehensive ensemble analysis by tracking the variations in extratropical cyclone properties as a function of the changes in the surrounding environment, with the aim of identifying key controls on cyclone characteristics. We consider the socially relevant impacts of changes in dynamics and precipitation, as well as considering the climatologically relevant impacts of changes in cloud and radiative properties. We identify and implement tunable variables best approximating changes in temperature, moisture content, jet strength, and baroclinicity. Examining the effects of each variable with single-variable sensitivity tests, we document the effect of each variable alone, before filling out a multivariate parameter space by combining variations of two or more variables. In reviewing the multivariate results, we use the single-variable functions to untangle potential feedbacks in the system, teasing out relationships and interactions between our tunable variables and their effects on the entire system.",

            "abstract": "As the conduit between the ocean and an inland body of water such as a lagoon, estuary or harbor, tidal inlets serve an important role in the hydrodynamics of the nearshore environment. As the global population grows in a world where 13% of the coastline is composed of barrier islands, an understanding of the physical processes that influence the transport of inland waters offshore is increasingly paramount. Water renewal, or the replacement of old lagoon water with new seawater has been well studied and is controlled by the tides through the process of tidal exchange or ‘tidal pumping’. The magnitude of tidal exchange is influenced by the inlet hydraulics and geometry of the inlet and various physical processes driven by the tide, wind, and waves. To examine the correlation between tidal exchange and the renewal of lagoon water with seawater, a new method to quantify lagoon residence time is explored.\nModeling experiments in Delft3D of idealized inlet systems are used to quantify the effect that tidal exchange has on residence time. Tidal exchange is decomposed into two fractions, an ocean exchange fraction and a lagoon exchange fraction. A simple transport model that utilizes both these fractions is compared to both a tidal prism model that neglects the lagoon exchange fraction and Delft3D. The tidal prism model over predicts the seaward transport of lagoon water as compared to Delft3D for all inlet channel geometries studied. The transport model shows good agreement with Delft3D for narrower inlets that support high ocean exchange fractions, but less agreement for wider inlets that support low ocean exchange fractions. Residence time distributions for each geometry are calculated using a new virtual tracer method in Delft3D. The spatially averaged residence time in the lagoon is found to be inversely proportional to the product of the two exchange fractions of each inlet system.\nFunded by ONR and NDSEG",

Present Clinton set the stage for this revolution in the year 2000 when he ordered a cessation to Selective Availability, making reliable GPS available for civilian use. Geologists began using personal digital assistants and ruggedized tablet PCs for geolocation and data recording and the pace of change accelerated with the development of mobile apps such as Google Maps, digital notebooks, and digital compass-clinometers. Despite these changes in map-making technologies, most students continue to learn geology in the field the old-fashioned way, by following a field trip leader as a group and trying to hear and understand lecturettes at the outcrop.\nIn this presentation, we demonstrate the potential of a new Augment Reality (AR) mobile app called \"FreshAiR\" to change fundamentally the way content-knowledge and learning objectives are delivered to students in the field. FreshAiR, which was developed by co-author and ODU alumnus M.D., triggers content delivery to mobile devices based on proximity. Students holding their mobile devices to the horizon see trigger points superimposed on the field of view of the device's built-in camera. When they walk towards the trigger, information about the location pops up. This can include text, images, movies, and quiz questions (multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank). Students can use the app to reinforce the field trip leader's presentations or they can visit outcrops individuals at different times. This creates the possibility for asynchronous field class, a concept that has profound implications for distance education in the geosciences.",

Getting the right forcing on the ice sheet models plays a critical role in the coupling process. The issue is further complicated by the mismatch between the grids used by atmosphere and ice sheet. Typically surface mass balance (SMB) and temperature fields are downscaled from the coarse atmospheric grid to the fine ice grid. We present one technique employed to couple NASA Goddard GEOS5 AGCM to JPL Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). The Greenland ice surface from ISSM is explicitly embedded in the GEOS5 AGCM grid with a ‘tile’ representation. Atmospheric forcing fields are interpolated and further adjusted to account for elevation differences and fed into a SMB model operating on ice surface tiles. The coupling is done in such a way that mass and energy are conserved. The proposed method is independent of the underlying ice grid and can be used to couple any ISM. Comparison of resultant downscaled SMB fields from a suite of AGCM resolutions will be discussed.",

GloVIS was introduced shortly after the launch of Landsat 7 to provide a visual client to select images squired by the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus. Since then, it has been expanded to search on other Landsat imagery (Multi-spectral Scanner, Thematic Mapper, Operational Land Imager), imagery from a variety of NASA instruments (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emissions and Reflection Radiometer, Advanced Land Imager, Hyperion), along with images from high-resolution airborne photography and special collections representing decades-long observations. GloVIS incorporated a number of features considered novel at its original release, such as rapid visual browse, and the ability to use one type of satellite observation (e.g., vegetation seasonality curves derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) to assist in the selection of another (e.g., Landsat).\nAfter 14 years, the GloVIS client has gained a large following, having served millions of images to hundreds of thousands of users, but is due for a major re-design. Described here are a set of guiding principles driving the re-design, the methodology used to understand how users discover and retrieve imagery, and candidate technologies to be leveraged in the re-design. The guiding principles include (1) visual co-discovery – the ability to browse and select imagery from diverse sources simultaneously; (2) user-centric design – understanding user needs prior to design and involving users throughout the design process; (3) adaptability – the use of flexible design to permit rapid incorporation of new capabilities, and (4) interoperability – the use of services, conventions and protocols to permit interaction with external sources of Earth science imagery.",

            "abstract": "The Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) aims to use a top-down inversion methodology to quantify sources of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions over an urban domain with high spatial and temporal resolution. Atmospheric transport of tracer gases from an emission source to a tower mounted receptor are usually conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. WRF is used extensively in the atmospheric community to simulate mesoscale atmospheric transport. For such simulations, WRF employs a parameterized turbulence model and does not resolve the fine scale dynamics that are generated by the flow around buildings and communities that are part of a large city. Since the model domain includes the city of Indianapolis, much of the flow of interest is over an urban topography. The NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) is a computational fluid dynamics model to perform large eddy simulations of flow around buildings, but it has not been nested within a larger-scale atmospheric transport model such as WRF. FDS has the potential to evaluate the impact of complex urban topography on near-field dispersion and mixing that cannot be simulated with a mesoscale atmospheric model, and which may be important to determining urban GHG emissions using atmospheric measurements.\n A methodology has been developed to run FDS as a sub-grid scale model within a WRF simulation. The coupling is based on nudging the FDS flow field towards the one computed by WRF, and is currently limited to one way coupling performed in an off-line mode. Using the coupled WRF / FDS model, NIST will investigate the effects of the urban canopy at horizontal resolutions of 2-10 m. The coupled WRF-FDS simulations will be used to calculate the dispersion of tracer gases in an urban domain and to evaluate the upwind areas that contribute to tower observations, referred to in the inversion community as influence functions. Predicted mixing ratios will be compared with tower measurements and WRF simulations, and FDS influence functions will be compared with those generated from WRF and the Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model. Results of this study will provide guidance regarding the importance of explicit simulations of urban atmospheric turbulence in obtaining accurate estimates of greenhouse gas emissions.",

The highly degraded state of the native vegetation as found by the new settlers coming to Israel in the beginning of the previous century, has provided the basic motivation for an extensive afforestation enterprise carried out during the last 100 years. This talk will present an overview on the accumulating experience in establishing and managing multifunctional forests in this dryland region. Given their very limited timber value, dryland forests are designed and managed under various goals the important of which are landscape aesthetics, recreation opportunities, grazing land, ecosystem restoration and soil conservation. Being subjected to water scarcity of high temporal and spatial variation, these manmade systems are managed to withstand water deficiency of unpredictable magnitude through the manipulation of both water input and water consumption. In the dry subhumid regions, forest management focuses mainly on controlling water consumption through the manipulation of vegetation structure using thinning and livestock grazing as primary silvicultural tools. Going into the semiarid zone, practices of rainfall redistribution and runoff harvesting become crucial for tree establishment and growth. The implementation of these practices varies depending on topography, rainfall amount and forest goals. The talk will provide a brief description of these unique silvicultural systems, review some of the recent scientific work in them and refer to critical gaps in knowledge. The relevancy to intercrop agroforestry in rainfed ecosystems will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Natural gas hydrates, stored in huge quantities beneath permafrost, and in submarine sediments on the continental shelf, have the potential to become a vital clean-burning energy source. However, clear evidence is recorded in coastal sediments worldwide that past changes in environmental conditions have caused hydrates to become unstable and trigger both massive submarine landslides and the development of crater-like pockmarks, thereby releasing methane into the overlying seawater and atmosphere, where it acts as a powerful greenhouse gas. Arctic permafrost is thawing, and environmental changes can alter ocean circulation to warm the seafloor, causing hydrates to dissociate or dissolve in the sediments beneath. Decades of focused research provide a firm understanding of laboratory conditions under which hydrates become unstable and dissociate, and how hydrate reserves form when microbes convert organic material into methane, which can also dissolve and be carried by pore waters into the hydrate stability zone. Despite these advances, many key questions that concern both the resource potential of hydrates and their role in causing environmental geohazards, are intimately tied to the more poorly understood behavior of hydrate anomalies, which tend to be concentrated in the large pores of sand layers and form segregated lenses and nodules in muds. We present simple models designed to unravel the importance of the diverse physical interactions (i.e. flow focusing, free-gas infiltration, and pore-scale solubility effects) that help control how hydrate anomalies form. Predicted hydrate distributions are qualitatively different when accumulation in anomalies is supplied primarily by: 1. aqueous flow through sediments with enhanced permeability, 2. free-gas transport high above the three-phase stability boundary, or 3. diffusive transport along solubility gradients associated with pore-scale effects. We discuss examples that illustrate each of these distinct generation modes, in hopes of providing a framework for interpreting field observations of hydrate anomalies and their geomechanical properties in terms of the history of environmental forcing that led to their development.",

In examining conjugate region receptions of ±1 kHz/sec frequency ramps, we find that the rising ramps generate a total power that is on average 1.9 times higher than that of falling frequency ramps when both are observed within a given transmission. Also, in 17% of receptions, only the rising frequency ramps are observed, and the descending ramps are below the detectable signal level. Using a narrowband Vlasov-Maxwell numerical simulation, we explore the preferential amplification of rising ramps due to differences in the linear growth rate as a function of frequency and the onset and duration of nonlinear phase trapping. These results contribute to the understanding of magnetospheric wave amplification and the formation of structured rising elements in chorus.",

            "abstract": "Successful development of chemical profiles that link soil carbon vulnerability and resilience to climate change would greatly facilitate assessment of soil ecosystems response to global climate change. Additionally these signatures could be used to support the design of sustainable agricultural and food/energy crop security practices. We test this possibility using soils obtained from a 17-year reciprocal soil transplant experiment between two elevations in the arid environment of eastern Washington [1]. 30-cm diameter soil cores were reciprocally transplanted between the upper and lower sites. Cores were also transplanted in place to control for disturbance. Extracted subcores were incubated in environmental chambers and measured microbial respiration revealed statically a significant decrease in respiratory response as a function of temperature in cores transferred from low elevation to high elevation. We use ultra high resolution mass spectrometry to identify thousands of organic molecules and changes in geochemistry that would indicate the vulnerability of the soil ecosystem to climate perturbation. In our experiments we used methanol extraction followed by direct injection to 12 T ESI FT-ICR MS to identify about 4000 of individual compounds in about 200 mg soils at sub ppm mass accuracy. Chemical formulae were assigned to approximately 65% of the measured peaks using a modified Kujawinski pipeline and second order Kendrick transformations [2] resulted in approximately 75% assigned peaks.\nOur preliminary analysis finds that while the bulk C content of soils from the cooler, wetter conditions at the upper elevation is approximately twice that of the warmer, drier conditions at lower elevation, the molecular soil geochemistry is remarkably similar. Detailed analysis reveals subtle differences in the lipid, carbohydrate, and condensed hydrocarbon compositional makeup of the soil. Additionally, of the more than 17,000 individual compounds identified approximately 50% contain N which is atypical geochemistry of soil obtained from other ecosystems.\n1.

            "abstract": "Water security is an increasing concern around the globe. The goal of this research is to better understand the complex relationships which exist between land cover change and water use within a dryland ecosystem. The Santa Cruz watershed in southeastern Arizona is experiencing increasing population growth and reduced water resources, highlighting a direct relationship between land cover change and water use. Using multi-source and multi-scale data sets including multispectral imagery, thermal imagery, and climate variables, we present the following three-step research approach: 1) land cover change, 2) evapotranspiration modeling, and 3) data validation. Assessment of land cover change between 2003 and 2013 was performed using Landsat data and validated via high resolution imagery. Regional evapotranspiration was calculated using the Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model. Validation of the METRIC model was performed using measurements from multiple flux towers within the watershed. With the capability to observe historical changes as well as current events, this approach integrates multiple public data sources representing varying scales to accurately monitor and assess environmental change. Overall, this approach demonstrates how remote sensing capabilities combined with surface measurements can be utilized to ascertain and validate complex ecosystem relationships. Preliminary results suggest that land cover change alters the amount of evapotranspiration within the Santa Cruz watershed. We also show that METRIC performed better in agricultural areas compared to naturally vegetated shrubland areas. Finally, this research will be used as a prototype to evaluate other dryland regions of the Americas.",

            "abstract": "In this work we present a DC 2D inversion algorithm using conjugate gradients relaxation to solve the maximum likelihood inverse equations. We apply, according to Zhang (1995), the maximum likelihood inverse theory developed by Tarantola and Valette (1982) to our 2D resistivity inversion. This algorithm was chosen to this research because it doesn’t need to calculate the field’s derivatives. Since conjugate gradient techniques only need the results of the sensitivity matrix Ã or its transpose ÃT multiplying a vector, the actual computation of the sensitivity matrix are not performed, according to the methodology described in Zhang (1995). In Zhang (1995), the terms Ãx and ÃTy, are dependent of the stiffness matrix K and its partial derivative ∂K⁄∂ρ. The inversion methodology described in Zhang (1995) is for the case of 3D electrical resistivity by finite differences discretization. So it was necessary to make a series of adjustments to obtain a satisfactory result for 2D electrical inversion using finite element method.\nThe difference between the modeling of 3D resistivity with finite difference and the 2D finite element method are in the integration variable, used in the 2D case. In the 2D case the electrical potential are initially calculated in the transformed domain, including the stiffness matrix, and only in the end is transformed in Cartesian domain. In the case of 3D, described by Zhang (1995) this is done differently, the calculation is done directly in the Cartesian domain. In the literature was not found any work describing how to deal with this problem. Because the calculations of Ãx and ÃTy must be done without having the real stiffness matrix, the adaptation consist in calculate the stiffness matrix and its partial derivative using a set of integration variables. We transform those matrix in the same form has in the potential case, but with different sets of variables. The results will be presented and are very promising.",

            "abstract": "While until recently marsh loss was largely thought to be due to an inability for vertical accretion rates to match rates of sea level rise, marsh edge erosion by wind waves is now thought to be the leading cause of marsh loss worldwide. To better understand the response of coastal ecosystems to future changes in sea level and storm intensity, we further develop the coupled barrier-island marsh evolution model GEOMBEST+. We use the relationship between wave height (and therefore energy) and fetch and wind speed to add marsh edge erosion to the model, as well as to provide a more physical formulation for bay bottom erosion. Previous research addressing marshes in isolation from barrier islands (Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2013) suggests that the existence of a backbarrier marsh is an unstable state, tending to either grow laterally to completely fill an adjacent basin or to erode away completely. Previous results of GEOMBEST+ experiments (Walters et al., in review) suggest that couplings with an adjacent barrier island can add an additional alternate long-lasting state: a narrow marsh supported by sediment influx from overwash. Here we present the results of new GEOMBEST+ model experiments that address how the addition of lateral erosion by wind waves affects the existence and characteristics of the narrow marsh state. Specifically, we seek to address how the frequency and characteristic time and space scales of the narrow march state are affected. Model experiments also explore more broadly the importance of wind wave effects in understanding the coupled dynamics of marsh-barrier island systems.",

            "abstract": "The dynamic pressure of the plasma in the dayside magnetosheath is typically much lower than in the solar wind, just upstream of the bow shock. Sometimes, however, transient enhancements in dynamic pressure (called high speed jets) can be observed. Recently, we performed a statistical study of potentially geo-effective jets in the noon sector sheath. These jets exhibit a major velocity component in anti-sunward direction, toward the magnetopause. The study was based on four years (2008-2011) of THEMIS magnetosheath and OMNI solar wind measurements, and resulted in a set of 2859 single-spacecraft-based jet identifications.\nDuring those years, by orbit design, the three inner THEMIS spacecraft (THA, THD, and THE) were flying in close configuration near their respective apogees. Hence, dayside magnetosheath jet observations by one of the spacecraft are often complemented by context-providing measurements from the other two spacecraft. The multi-point information enables us to infer the spatial structure and extend of jets. In particular, we are able to compute a distribution of scale sizes (based on a model of probability for simultaneous multi-spacecraft jet observations), due to the high number of jets in our set and the relatively large spread in corresponding distances between the spacecraft. Furthermore, we present statistical results of the plasma flow pattern within jets and in their environment, showing how the magnetosheath plasma flow is modified on jet passage.",

            "abstract": "A warming climate is altering land-atmosphere exchanges of carbon, with a potential for increased vegetation productivity and mobilization of soil carbon stores. Here we investigate land-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics through analysis of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and the component fluxes of gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) and soil carbon residence time as simulated by a set of process models over a region spanning the drainage basin of northern Eurasia. The retrospective simulations were conducted over the period 1960-2009 at 0.5 degree resolution. Performance benchmarks are made through comparisons of model estimates and CO2 fluxes derived from tower eddy covariance measurements and satellite data driven GPP estimates. The site comparisons show the timing of peak summer productivity to be well simulated. Modest overestimates in model GPP and ER are also found, which are relatively higher for two boreal forest validation sites. Averaged across the models, NEP increases by 135% of the mean (10% to 400% among the models) from the first to last ten years of record (1960-1969 vs 2000-2009), with a weakening terrestrial carbon sink indicated over recent decades. Vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) increased by 8 to 30%, contributing to soil carbon storage gains, while model mean residence time for soil organic carbon decreased by -10% (-5% to -16% among the models) due to enhanced litter decomposition and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) losses offsetting soil carbon inputs. Our analysis points to improvements in model elements controlling vegetation productivity and soil respiration as being most beneficial for reducing uncertainty in land-atmosphere CO2 exchange. These advances require collection of new field data in key areas and the incorporation of spatial information on vegetation characteristics into models.",

In this specific study, we examine offset river terraces at the well-known Saxton River site on the Awatere fault, and at Tophouse Road on the Clarence fault. By constraining the ages of those river terraces using post-IR IRSL (225 °C) single-grain K-feldspar dating protocols, we determine latest Pleistocene to late-Holocene slip histories of the Awatere and Clarence faults at those locations. This project is part of a broader effort to generate incremental slip rates and paleoearthquake ages from the four main faults that comprise the Marlborough Fault System with the goal of further understanding how mechanically complementary faults work together to accommodate relative plate motions.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic measurements of postseismic deformation are rich signals with which the mechanical behavior of the lithosphere can be inferred, predominantly localized fault creep and distributed viscoelastic deformation. Numerous studies have used postseismic deformation to estimate the lithosphere’s rheology but they are hindered by potentially computationally intensive forward problems with nonlinear relationships between surface deformation and the rheologic properties. As a result, most studies oversimplify the rheologic structure of the lithosphere and rely on forward estimation methods, such as grid or monte carlo searches. We present a novel method to simultaneously estimate patterns of fault slip and heterogeneous distribution of effective Maxwell viscoelasticity from postseismic deformation. Our method utilizes an approximation which linearizes the viscoelastic contribution to postseismic deformation with respect to the inverse relaxation time of discrete regions in the lithosphere, allowing the use of least squares techniques, akin to seismic tomographic methods. The validity of this approximation is inversely proportional to the time since the main rupture and holds for roughly as long as the lowest relaxation time in the lithosphere proximal to the coseismic rupture. Our estimation of both the slip history on a fault and the effective Maxwell relaxation times of the lithosphere takes a matter of minutes. We apply our method to postseismic deformation following the 2010 El Mayor earthquake, as well as the 1999 İzmit-Düzce earthquake sequence. We discuss the significance of both fault creep and three dimensional viscosity structure in describing postseismic deformation.",

            "abstract": "The North Atlantic accounts for 25% of the world ocean’s anthropogenic carbon uptake (Sabine et al. 2004). Its propensity as a carbon sink is largely mediated by physical dynamics of the solubility pump in the subarctic North Atlantic (Sarmiento et al. 1997). The biological pump also acts as an important pathway of carbon to the deep ocean; springtime phytoplankton blooms rely on regimes of deep winter convection, spring and summer stratification, and eddy features to flux ~11Gt C yr-1 of organic carbon via sinking into the deep ocean (Sanders et al 2014; Mahadevan et al 2012; Behrenfeld 2010). To quantify the biological pump in the subarctic North Atlantic, in situ data of chlorophyll fluorescence, nitrate concentration, O2 saturation and temperature were collected from an underway sensor system during a two-leg, four week ship transect from April to May, 2014. This was compared with satellite observations of ocean color, sea surface temperature (SST), and particulate organic carbon to assess the fidelity of the underway measurements to remotely sensed measurements and to better understand the dynamics of springtime phytoplankton blooms in relation to carbon flux. Underway data was found to agree well with remotely sensed data (3 and 8-day composites), although satellite observations were sparse and had coarser temporal resolution. The in situ data better resolved features of the bloom and physical oceanographic features. Using both data types, we were able to estimate net community productivity and carbon export. SST was negatively correlated with high chlorophyll values and high O2 saturation, while chlorophyll and O2 were positively correlated in both the satellite and ship datasets. Nitrate was difficult to quantify as the integrity of the sensor was undermined by biofouling accumulation during the cruise. In situ data from shipboard sensors are at least as competent as satellite measurements of chlorophyll and temperature in the subarctic North Atlantic. This methodology provides new insights into the viability of long term biogeochemical observations from ships of opportunity. It begins to elucidate the mechanisms of springtime phytoplankton blooms and their role in sequestering then fluxing organic carbon into the deep ocean.",

            "abstract": "Characterization of aeolian systems is complicated by rapidly changing surface-process regimes, spatio-temporal scale dependencies, and subjective interpretation of imagery and spatial data. This paper describes the development and application of analytical reasoning to quantify instability of an aeolian environment using scale-dependent information coupled with conceptual knowledge of process and feedback mechanisms. Specifically, a simple Fuzzy Cognitive Model (FCM) for aeolian landscape instability was developed that represents conceptual knowledge of key biophysical processes and feedbacks. Model inputs include satellite-derived surface biophysical and geomorphometric parameters. FCMs are a knowledge-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique that merges fuzzy logic and neural computing in which knowledge or concepts are structured as a web of relationships that is similar to both human reasoning and the human decision-making process. Given simple process-form relationships, the analytical reasoning model is able to map the influence of land management practices and the geomorphology of the inherited surface on aeolian instability within the South Texas Sandsheet. Results suggest that FCMs can be used to formalize process-form relationships and information integration analogous to human cognition with future iterations accounting for the spatial interactions and temporal lags across the sand sheets.",

            "abstract": "China is one of the most populous and fast developing countries, also faces a great pressure on grain production and food security. Multi-cropping system is widely applied in China to fully utilize agro-climatic resources and increase land productivity. As the heat resource keep improving under climate warming, multi-cropping system will also shifting northward, and benefit crop production. But water shortage in North China Plain will constrain the adoption of new multi-cropping system. Effectiveness of multi-cropping system adaptation to climate change will greatly depend on future hydrological change and agriculture water management. So it is necessary to quantitatively express the water demand of different multi-cropping systems under climate change. In this paper, we proposed an integrated climate-cropping system-crops adaptation framework, and specifically focused on: 1) precipitation and hydrological change under future climate change in China; 2) the best multi-cropping system and correspondent crop rotation sequence, and water demand under future agro-climatic resources; 3) attainable crop production with water constraint; and 4) future water management. In order to obtain climate projection and precipitation distribution, global climate change scenario from HADCAM3 is downscaled with regional climate model (PRECIS), historical climate data (1960-1990) was interpolated from more than 700 meteorological observation stations. The regional Agro-ecological Zone (AEZ) model is applied to simulate the best multi-cropping system and crop rotation sequence under projected climate change scenario. Finally, we use the site process-based DSSAT model to estimate attainable crop production and the water deficiency. Our findings indicate that annual land productivity may increase and China can gain benefit from climate change if multi-cropping system would be adopted. This study provides a macro-scale view of agriculture adaptation, and gives suggestions to national agriculture adaptation strategy decisions.",

            "abstract": "The sizes of particles entrained in debris flows influence flow dynamics, affecting erosive power and runout distance. Particle size distributions evolve due to wear by abrasion and fracturing, and by gains or losses of sediment mass during transport. To tease apart these factors, we need a better understanding of the controls on rates and patterns of particle wear in debris flows. Here we focus on changes in particle angularity with travel distance, combining laboratory experiments with field study of a rocky debris flow at Inyo Creek, Sierra Nevada California. Angularity can indicate proximity to sediment source, assuming abrasion leads to progressive smoothing of particle surfaces. However, particle fracture can create fresh angular surfaces, confounding estimates of travel distance from angularity. This study is a component of an ongoing set of experiments using a 4 m diameter rotating drum to create near-prototype-scale debris flows. We load the drum with 1.7 Mg of highly angular granodiorite clasts, with median b-axis diameter of 100 mm. The 0.75 m deep, shearing mass flows at 1 m/s. After each 250 m travel distance, we measure mass and length of principal axes for every particle >19 mm, and sieve all smaller particles, to track evolution of the size distribution. We document the angularity of subsamples of selected particle sizes, using several techniques, including analysis of 2D photographs, 3D laser scans, and hand-placed equilibrium points. We use the same techniques in analyzing particles collected in the field study of the downstream evolution of rock clasts along a 1 km length of Inyo Creek. In this catchment, underlain by granodiorite, sediment transport is dominated by debris flows, which leave deposits on the bed and channel margins at slopes >20%. Preliminary laboratory results show rapid smoothing of large particle surfaces combined with creation of smaller angular particles by fracture. In contrast, downstream evolution of angularity in the field is more variable, possibly due to mixing of particles from multiple source areas. Results suggest that downstream changes in angularity contain information about proximity to sources and intensity of particle interactions in transport, and may be useful for constraining predictive relations for particle size evolution in debris flows.",

            "abstract": "The release of Escherichia coli into the environment from untreated manure can pose a threat to human health. Environmental survival of E. coli has been linked to extracellular fibers called curli. We investigated the effect of manure management (surface application followed by incorporation versus immediate incorporation) on the relative abundance of curli-producing E. coli in subsurface drainage effluent. Samples were collected from three dairy farms. The proportion of curli-producing E. coli in the manure storage facilities was uniform across the farms. However, the abundance of curli-producing E. coli was much greater (P < 0.05) in the tile drains of farms performing surface application of manure than in the tile drain of the farm that incorporated manure. This field result was corroborated by controlled soil column experiments; the abundance of curli-producing E. coli in soil column effluents was greater (P < 0.05) when manure was surface-applied than when it was incorporated. Our findings suggest selection pressures resulting from the different manure application methods affected curli production by E. coli isolates transported through soil. Given the importance of curli production in pathogenesis, this work highlights the effect that manure management strategies may have on pathogenesis-associated phenotypes of bacteria in agricultural subsurface runoff.",

We used EA-IRMS (Elemental Analysis – Isotopic Mass Spectroscopy) to determine the δ13C and δ15N values of bulk stream water DOM to understand how the source of C and N varies with land use. Approximately 30 streams in New Hampshire and Maine that vary in land use and ultimately drain into The Great Bay, a nitrogen impaired estuary, were sampled. We also measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient concentrations, characterized DOM optical properties using fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy, and measured DOM bioavailability via DOC biodegradation assays.

            "abstract": "We present the first Holocene geologic slip rate for the Banning strand of the southern San Andreas Fault in southern California. The southern San Andreas Fault splays into the sub-parallel Banning and Mission Creek strands in the northwestern Coachella Valley, and although it has long been surmised that the Banning strand eventually accommodates the majority of displacement and transfers it into San Gorgonio Pass, until now it has been uncertain how slip is actually partitioned between these two fault strands. Our new slip rate measurement, critically located at the northwestern end of the Banning strand, overlaps within errors with the published rate for the southern San Andreas Fault measured at Biskra Palms Oasis. This indicates that the majority of southern San Andreas Fault displacement transfers from the southeastern Mission Creek strand northwest to the Banning strand and into San Gorgonio Pass. Our result corroborates the UCERF3 hazard model, and is consistent with most previous interpretations of how slip is partitioned between the Banning and Mission Creek fault strands. To measure this slip rate, we used B4 airborne LiDAR to identify the apex of an alluvial fan offset laterally 30 ± 5 m from its source. We calculated the depositional age of the fan using 10Be in-situ cosmogenic exposure dating of 5 cobbles and a depth profile. We calculated a most probable fan age of 4.0 +2.0/-1.6 ka (1σ) by combining the inheritance-corrected cobble ages assuming Gaussian uncertainty. However, the probability density function yielded a multi-peaked distribution, which we attribute to variable 10Be inheritance in the cobbles, so we favor the depth profile age of 2.2-3.6 ka. Combined, these measurements yield a late Holocene slip rate for the Banning strand of the southern San Andreas Fault of 11.1 +3.1/-3.3 mm/yr. This slip rate does not preclude possibility that some slip transfers north along the Mission Creek strand and the Garnet Hill fault, but it does confirm that the Banning strand has been the most probable rupture path for earthquakes nucleated on the southern San Andreas Fault over the past few thousand years, and is likely to remain so in the near future. This clarification of slip partitioning within the northwest Coachella Valley is timely given that the southern San Andreas Fault is considered overdue for a large earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Jeffreys Ledge, located ~50 km off the coast of New Hampshire, USA, is a major physiographic feature in the western Gulf of Maine (WGOM), extending over 100 km along its axis, while generally only being 5 to 10 km in width (~20 km maximum). The feature rises over 200 m from nearby basins to depths less than 50 m on the ridge surface. A major field campaign was undertaken at Jeffreys Ledge and adjacent areas in order to assess the roles of glaciation, sea-level fluctuations, and marine processes on the development of the major depositional environments. The study focused on an ~500 sq km area that extended from the shallowest reaches to the deep adjacent basins utilizing high resolution multibeam echosounder bathymetry (synthesized and gridded at the highest possible resolution), subbottom seismics, videography, and bottom sediment sampling. Due to the coarseness of the sediments composing the surface of Jeffreys Ledge (which frequently included cobbles and boulders), direct sampling was largely limited. Therefore, a descriptive seafloor classification utilizing video was developed and applied. The seafloor on Jeffreys Ledge typically ranges from sandy pebble gravel to pebble cobble gravel with boulders. Major glacial features include several boulder ridges ~ 5m in elevation that extend kms in length. These ridges, which run roughly parallel to the axis of Jeffreys Ledge, likely reflect winnowed recessional moraines. Smaller, asymmetric linear ridges with varying orientations are found on the western (landward) boundary. Although the origin of these features are unknown, they are believed to be relict glacial features as well. On the seaward (east) edge of the platform facing the open Gulf of Maine is a relatively smooth, sandy bathymetric high that likely was formed by wave processes during the last sea-level low stand. Subbottom seismics show evidence of soft sediment faulting and slumping on the flanks of the ridge and in the adjacent muddy basins. The use of high resolution bathymetry, along with the subbottom seismics, video, and direct sampling, reveal features not previously identified aiding our understanding of the development and controls on the major depositional environments.",

This study provides a quantitative analysis of precipitation associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the equatorial northern Pacific. Results from 31 CMIP5 Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) Global Circulation Model (GCM) runs and their historical ocean-coupled counterparts are compared with Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observations. Differences found between the GCMs and observations are quantitatively analyzed using two innovative feature-based approaches with the intent of separating these discrepancies in the precipitation fields into components of magnitude-based error due to parameterizations, and location-based error due to large scale dynamics. Results show widespread and varied results across all GCMs, with some models showing large under/over-simulation of precipitation magnitude while other models suffer from significant pole-ward or equator-ward position shift of the ITCZ. Linkage between these results with the models' deep/convective and shallow/stratiform parameterizations are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Data lifecycle management awareness is common today; planners are more likely to consider lifecycle issues at mission start. NASA remote sensing missions are typically subject to life cycle management plans of the Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), and NASA invests in these national centers for the long-term safeguarding and benefit of future generations. As stewards of older missions, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that a comprehensive enough set of information is being preserved to prevent the risk for “information loss”. This risk is greater when the original data experts have moved on or are no longer available. Preservation of items like documentation related to processing algorithms, pre-flight calibration data, or input/output configuration parameters used in product generation, are examples of digital artifacts that are sometimes not fully preserved. This is the grey area of “information preservation”; the importance of these items is not always clear and requires careful consideration. Missing important “metadata” about intermediate steps used to derive a product could lead to serious challenges in the reproducibility of results or conclusions.\nOrganizations are rapidly recognizing that the focus of life-cycle preservation needs to be enlarged from the strict raw data to the more encompassing arena of “information lifecycle management”. By understanding what constitutes information, and the complexities involved, we are better equipped to deliver longer lasting value about the original data and derived knowledge (information) from them.\nThe “NASA Earth Science Data Preservation Content Specification” is an attempt to define the content necessary for long-term preservation. It requires new lifecycle infrastructure approach along with content repositories to accommodate artifacts other than just raw data. The NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) setup an open-source Preservation System capable of long-term archive of digital content to augment its raw data holding. This repository is being used for such missions as HIRDLS, UARS, TOMS, OMI, among others. We will provide a status of this implementation; report on challenges, lessons learned, and detail our plans for future evolution to include other missions and services.",

            "abstract": "We explore the impact of internal magnetic field gradients, which arise due to the presence of a magnetic susceptibility contrast between grains and the pore fluid, on the relaxation time distribution. Relaxation times provide powerful insight into the pore geometry. This link to pore geometry relies on the fast-diffusion assumption, where relaxation is controlled by the pore surface and each pore is treated as isolated and is described by a single relaxation time. This allows the relaxation time distribution to be interpreted as a pore size distribution. However, internal gradients can complicate this interpretation by providing an additional relaxation mechanism impacting the decay.\nWe present both synthetic and laboratory studies investigating the impact of internal gradients on the relaxation time distribution. A COMSOL multiphysics package is employed to determine the magnetic field’s spatial distribution across the pore space, and to simulate the pore’s NMR relaxation. The NMR simulation accounts for both surface relaxation, and relaxation related to internal gradients. We observe that as the influence of internal gradients increases, through either greater magnetic susceptibility contrasts or the use of longer echo times, the shape of the relaxation time distribution is altered. In these cases, relaxation within a single pore is no longer described by a single characteristic relaxation time, instead requiring multiple relaxation times to capture the time-dependent behavior. As a result, the relaxation time distribution is broadened and shifted to faster relaxation times. Laboratory results, performed for several samples sieved to ensure narrow grain size distributions and with varying magnitudes of magnetic susceptibility contrasts, exhibit similar trends to those observed in the synthetic studies. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of relaxation data to obtain pore size distributions, and the derived estimates of hydraulic conductivity for materials containing magnetic components.",

            "abstract": "The goal of geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) is to store carbon dioxide (CO2) in the subsurface for time periods on the order of thousands of years. To ensure the safe storage of CO2 in the subsurface, the migration of CO2 and resident brine needs to be predicted. Mathematical modeling is an important tool to predict the migration of both CO2 and brine. Many modeling approaches with different levels of complexity have been applied to the problem of GCS ranging from simple analytic solutions to full three-dimensional reservoir simulators. The choice of modeling approach is often a function of the spatial and temporal scales of the problem, reservoir properties, data availability, available computational resources, and the familiarity of the modeler with a specific modeling approach.\nThe Utsira Formation off the coast of Norway is the target formation of the Sleipner Project, where approximately 1 million tons of CO2 are injected per year. The Utsira Sand consists of a Pliocene sandstone with high permeability and porosity, interbedded with thin mudstone layers that act as baffles for vertical flow. CO2 is injected at the bottom of the formation and collects under the mudstone baffles as it migrates to the top of the formation. The layer of sandstone between the topmost mudstone baffle and caprock is termed the 9th layer. Geometrical and petro-physical data of the 9th layer have been made publicly available, and are the basis for this modeling study.\nIn this study we apply a series of models with different levels of model complexity to the 9th layer of the Utsira Sand. The list of modeling approaches includes (from least complex to most complex): macroscopic invasion percolation model, numerical vertical-equilibrium model with sharp-interface, numerical vertical-equilibrium model with capillary transition zone, vertically-integrated model with dynamic vertical pressure and saturation reconstruction, and full three-dimensional model. The models are compared based on the predicted CO2 plume footprints. The predicted CO2 plumes are also compared to the actual CO2 plume footprint from seismic surveys to determine the ability of the different models to predict the actual CO2 plume footprint.",

            "abstract": "The relative affect of climate versus people upon the landscape of southern Italy 2000 years ago is not clearly understood. This is in part due to the fact that there are conflicting data regarding both the climate record and the nature and extent of human activity. Even the timings of climatic events varies from record to record, and geomorphic responses seem to be out of sink with these events or the responses are difficult to explain. Acording to data collected until now, during the early Holocene, climate seems to have been the primary factor in affecting surficial processes. However after 3,000 years ago human impact seems to have had significant influence. We are conducting a program of research using radiocarbon dated sequences of soils and spring discharge events, description of alluvial exposures and analysis of samples taken from these exposures, combined with a study of palynological, and plant macrofossil records to reconstruct regional climate variation. Reconstructed regional climate and changes in the degree of human activity are being investigated to determine their relative impact upon surfical processes, the geomorphic record, regional hydrology, and vegetation history. Samples from alluvial exposures, cores from springs, as well as samples from the archaeological site of San Felice, are being examined for evidence not only for changes in types and rates of sediment erosion and deposition, but also of the past vegetation record, that resulted from variations in precipitation. These are being compared with other records from southern Italy and the central Mediterranean to unravel the complex interaction of climate and human activity. Ultimately, a picture of the Apulian-Lucanian landscape not only for the last two millennium, but for most of the Holocene, will emerge.",

            "abstract": "Various morphometrics are used to measure coastal change over a variety of time scales including shoreline, dune elevation and position, and beach profile volume. Each has limitations, many of which became apparent in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, including the juxtaposition of levelled dunes and a substantially prograded shoreline. In order to understand sustained beach behavior, including recovery after Hurricane Sandy, we develop a new morphometric – an upper beach change envelope (BCE) specific to Fire Island, NY. The upper beach better captures impacts from more frequent moderate storms during which there may be substantial beach change but less impact to the dune, and is less subject to the variable fluctuations nearer to the shoreline that only marginally influence future vulnerability and overall coastal resilience. The BCE can also be used to quantify the gradual recovery of the beach after storm events and is not reliant on the presence of a morphologic feature such as a dune, which may take many years to recover after a severe storm.\nThe BCE at Fire Island is based on a time series of historical response to storms. The BCE boundaries are elevation contours that capture the portion of the upper beach that experiences erosion during moderate nor’easter events but is above the influence of tides and lesser events.\nIn an application of the BCE concept, we use the BCE boundary elevations to quantify beach response from Hurricane Sandy and document the subsequent recovery, using a time series of post-Sandy elevation contours. The data include 10 profile sites from Fire Island that were surveyed multiple times from October 2012 to June 2014. Utilizing this time series we measure changes in the cross shore position of the BCE elevation boundaries. Initial assessments indicate the BCE successfully captures coastal response through time, including extensive change during Hurricane Sandy as well as subsequent seasonal changes. The recent data indicate there is a temporal trend towards widening of the BCE, due to sustained progradation of the lower boundary. This trend may represent a new “recovery state” of the beach which is wider than the pre-Sandy beach, providing an increase in the fetch that favors the aeolian processes of dune reformation.",

            "abstract": "As we progress into the 21st century, the world faces challenges of truly global nature bearing implications on the whole world in one way or another. The global economic engine has shifted from the western world (Developed Economies) to the eastern world (Developing Economies) which has brought about tremendous change in the climate related variables in this part of the world. As uncontrolled carbon emissions grow in the developing economies, the phenomenon of global warming and climate shifts become more and more prevalent. While this economic activity provides income for millions of households, it is contributing generously to the rapid degradation of the environment. Developing economies as it has been seen do not employ or abide by stringent regulations regarding emissions which result in uncontrolled emissions. In this particular scenario, it is a tedious task to convince governments in the developing economies to implement regulations regarding emissions because businesses in these economies deem such regulations to be economically unviable. The other side of the problem is that these uncontrolled emission are causing evident climate shifts which has had adverse impacts on the agricultural societies where shifting climates are leading to reduced agricultural output and productivity. Consequently the lives of millions associated directly or indirectly with agriculture are affected and on a more global level, the agricultural produce is decreasing which increases the chances of famine in parts of the world. The situation could have devastating impacts on the global economy and environmental standards and therefore needs to be addressed on emergency basis. The first step towards betterment could be the introduction of the carbon trading economy in the developing economies which would incentivize emission reduction and become more attractive and in the process sustaining minimum possible damage to the environment. Though carbon trading is a formidable first step in the right direction, it is in no way the only step and many other steps need to be taken. Agricultural economies have to study climate changes in detail and inculcate findings into their agricultural practices in order to keep the productivity from reducing.",

Unfortunately, in the current environment, some 20 years after the end of the TOGA project, sustaining the observing system is proving difficult. With the many advances in methods of observing the ocean, a group of scientists is taking a fresh look at what the Tropical Pacific Observing System requires for sustainability. This includes utilizing a wide variety of observing system platforms, including Argo floats, unmanned drifters, moorings, ships, etc.\nThis variety of platforms measuring ocean data also provides a significant challenge in terms of integrated data management. It is recognized that data and information management is crucial to the success and impact of any observing system. In order to be successful, it is also crucial to avoid building stovepipes for data management. To that end, NOAA’s Observing System Monitoring Center (OSMC) has been tasked to create a testbed of integrated real time and delayed mode observations for the Tropical Pacific region in support of the TPOS. The observing networks included in the prototype are: Argo floats, OceanSites moorings, drifting buoys, hydrographic surveys, underway carbon observations and, of course, real time ocean measurements.\nIn this presentation, we will discuss how the OSMC project is building the integrated data prototype using existing free and open source software. We will explore how we are leveraging successful data management frameworks pioneered by efforts such as NOAA’s Unified Access Framework project. We will also show examples of how conforming to well known conventions and standards allows for discoverability, usability and interoperability of data.",

While wind and surface roughness control the turbulent transfer of heat, stable boundary layer conditions offer additional challenges.\nGDAP strives for satellite and input consistency across the data sets. For the sensible heat data product, this manifests itself primarily in the land surface temperature (LST) (being consistent with the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) observations). Due to its sparse coverage (swath and cloud-contamination), a HIRS-consistent, hourly, global, 0.5 degree resolution LST dataset for clear and cloudy conditions (1979 to 2009) is developed through merging of the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) estimates with HIRS retrievals, which are validated against the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN)-based LST. The surface air temperature is estimated by adding the temperature gradient from CFSR to the HIRS-consistent LST data product, and validated against ~10,000 surface stations. The aerodynamic resistance is based on optimized values at 70 global FluxNet towers and extended globally through an objective analysis with land cover and climate covariates.\nThese products are used to form a global terrestrial, hourly, 0.5 degree spatial resolution sensible heat dataset. The spatial, seasonal, and inter-annual variability of the dataset is presented. The sensible heat flux is combined with the LandFlux latent heat estimates and the surface radiation budget ver. 3 (SRB-3) to assess the space-time variability in the combined surface fluxes (e.g. Bowen ratio) as well as budget closure.",

            "abstract": "We processed the accelerograms for the Sept. 28, 2004 Parkfield mainshock (M6) from the Parkfield Dense Seismograph Array (UPSAR) using beam forming techniques to determine coherence and slowness of incoming arrivals and we found that the frequency-dependent effects of rupture propagation of can be seen in the acceleration records in at least two ways. The first is the effect of directivity. During the 4-6s interval after nucleation, UPSAR lies in the forward azimuth of the rupture front and coherence and amplitudes are relatively high. In this interval, the records are rich in frequencies as high as 40 Hz. As the rupture front progresses, UPSAR becomes perpendicular to the location of the rupture front on the fault and then passes into the back azimuth. During this 5-7s interval, the coherence drops off, amplitudes are typically smaller and the traces are depleted in high frequencies compared to when UPSAR was in the forward azimuth. We model the rupture process of the Parkfield mainshock using realistic distributions of slip and show that they also have significant changes in frequency as the rupture passes from the forward to the back azimuth.\nThe second effect is the frequency dependence of the rupture front. That is observations at UPSAR were used to address the question of whether low frequency energy emerges from the same parts of the fault as high frequency energy. Acceleration records of the Parkfield mainshock from UPSAR were filtered in 5 different narrow frequency bands (0.25-0.5 Hz, 0.5-1 Hz, 1-2 Hz, 2-4 Hz, and 4-8 Hz) and beam forming was repeated. Above 1 Hz the estimates of back azimuth and apparent velocity are about the same and are independent of frequency. Below 1 Hz, however, the estimates appear to be significantly different with a change of about of 0.34 km/s in apparent velocity and 22 degrees in back azimuth at 2s after the S wave arrival, for example, between the middle and lowest band. From previous work on mapping values of apparent velocity and back azimuth to specific locations on the San Andrea fault (Fletcher et al., 2006, Bull. Seism. Soc. Amer.), the values suggest that the low frequency energy comes from shallower parts of the fault and trails the high frequency energy radiated by the rupture front, but we have not investigated the frequency-dependence of this correction.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that hydrogen (δD) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopic composition in precipitation defines a meteoric water line with a slope close to 8 and an intercept of 10, and that evaporation causes water to deviate from the line, acquiring a d-excess value different from 10. It has also been observed that a group of lakes subject to significant evaporation often define a line, which we refer to as the lake line, with a slope lower than 8. While there has been much discussion about the slope of lake lines and its dependence on relative humidity, little attention has been given to the scatter around these lines. We show that this seemingly random scatter contains systematic environmental information.\nWater in over 20 lakes around Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, was collected in the summers of 2009 to 2013, and the δD and δ18O values were determined. Each year’s isotopic data were used to find: 1) the slope of the lake line; 2) the displacement of each lake parallel to the lake line, which we refer to as the “enrichment”; and 3) the distance between a given lake and the lake line, which we call the “deviance”. The enrichment and deviance are the values of the principal components, PC1 and PC2, respectively, of the set of δD and δ18O coordinates. When comparing the climate and environmental variables, we observed the following. A) The lake line slope varies from 4.12 to 4.63 among the 5 years. B) The enrichment is, in some years, significantly correlated with lake size and longitude (which increases along the moisture and temperature gradient). C) The deviance is significantly correlated with both lake size and longitude every year.\nA simple water and isotopic mass balance model suggests that the enrichment is largely controlled by the lake to basin area ratio, while the deviance is controlled predominantly by the humidity and isotopic ratios of air above the lake. The latter variables systematically change from east to west (glacial margin to coast), so longitude is a relevant explanatory variable. In addition, it appears the interannual variations of the lake line slope are controlled by the regional water balance, including precipitation, evaporation and humidity. Interestingly, the lake slope correlates quite well with the NAO index, which, according to our previous work, significantly influences the regional hydrological balance.",

            "abstract": "The bright coronal loops that trace bundles of field lines within coronal arcades have been observed to oscillate with one or more preferred frequencies. Recent studies indicate that two distinct categories of oscillation occur: large-amplitude, transient oscillations that are initiated by flares and low-amplitude, “decayless” oscillations that can persist for as long as the loop remains visible. The preferred frequencies of these oscillations have previously been interpreted as the resonant frequencies of MHD fast waves that are trapped between the photospheric footpoints of a bundle of field lines in a 1-D cavity. The nascent field of coronal-loop seismology attempts to deduce loop properties, such as the magnetic-field strength, loop length, etc., by exploiting the information contained in the measured mode periods.\nWe present an alternative 2D model of the wave cavity whereby the waves can propagate across field lines and the entire magnetic arcade acts as a waveguide. Within this framework, the two types of oscillations, flare-induced waves and decayless oscillations, can both be attributed to MHD fast waves. The two components of the signal differ only because of the duration and spatial extent of the source that creates them. The flare-induced waves are generated by strong, localized sources of short duration, while the decayless background is excited by a diffuse, stochastic source. Further, the oscillatory signal induced by a flare can be interpreted as a pattern of interference fringes produced by waves that are launched from a compact source and have traveled diverse routes of various pathlength through the waveguide. The amplitude of the resulting fringe pattern decays in time without the need for local dissipation mechanisms. The details of the interference pattern depend on the shape of the arcade and on the spatial variation of the Alfvén speed within the arcade. We explore these details with a view to understanding the excitation mechanism of the oscillations and the seismological implications of the interference process.",

            "abstract": "Although the aerosol life cycle and its interaction with clouds are explicitly represented in many modern climate models, predictions of vertical distributions in aerosol mass concentration, composition, size, and optical properties still have relatively large uncertainties that consequently affect estimates of aerosol radiative forcing. The region near the east coast of North America is one area where aerosol-climate models have a large diversity. Motivated by this problem, the Two-Column Aerosol Project (TCAP) supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program collected intensive field campaign measurements in July 2012 and Feb 2013 at a column over Cape Cod and a second column located ~200 km to the east over the ocean. DOE’s ARM Aerial Facility G-1 aircraft collected in situ measurements of aerosol mass, composition, size, and optical properties. The aerosol mixing state was estimated based on measurements from a single particle mass spectrometer. TCAP was the first science mission for the NASA Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research (4STAR) spectrometer deployed on the G-1 and the second generation downward-looking High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL-2) deployed on the NASA B-200 aircraft. On many days, the aircraft measurements show one or more aerosol layers in the free troposphere above the residual and marine boundary layers.\nIn this study, we perform hindcast simulations with both the global model CAM5 and the regional model WRF-Chem, using either low- or high- temporal-resolution emission data over North America. In-situ and remote sensing data collected from TCAP are used to evaluate the model simulations. We will discuss the impact of a) individual sources (anthropogenic, biogenic, and biomass burning), b) model horizontal/vertical resolutions, and c) biases in simulated meteorological conditions on the simulated aerosol properties and the direct aerosol forcing. Particular attention will be given to observed and simulated vertical profiles of black carbon (BC), coating of BC, and the impact of BC on vertical variability in radiative forcing. Similarities and differences between the global and regional model simulations will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The recent studies showed that the summertime Western North Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) experienced an interdecadal shift to the 2–3-yr band of the variability after around 1990, which coincides with the time that the El Niño shifted from predominantly the EP type to predominantly the CP type. For weather forecast and climate projection in the East-Asia, it is important for an AGCM to simulate the WPSH variability associated with the two types of ENSO. By analyzing the CMIP5-AMIP model output, we find that one model group successfully simulates the observed quasi-biennial (2–3-yr) band but not the low-frequency (3–5-yr) band while the other group produces the observed low-frequency band better than the quasi-biennial band of the variability. We also find the SST anomalies in the tropical central Pacific (i.e., CP ENSO) responsible for forcing the quasi-biennial WPSH variability and the anomalies in the tropical eastern Pacific (i.e., EP ENSO) responsible for the low-frequency variability. This study suggests that the relative strengths of the Hadley Circulation and Walker Circulation, which link the two bands of the WPSH variability to the SST variations in the central and eastern Pacific, are crucial to a realistic simulation of the summer WPSH variability in AGCMs.",

            "abstract": "Cassini camera's movies in 2009-2013 show Saturn's aurora in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The color of the aurora changes from pink at a few hundreds of km above the cloud tops to purple at 1000-1500 km above the cloud tops. The spectrum observed in 9 lters spanning wavelengths from 250 nm to 1000 nm has a prominent H-alpha line and roughly agrees with the laboratory simulated auroras [1]. Auroras in both hemispheres vary dramatically with longitude. Auroras form bright arcs, sometimes a spiral around the pole, and sometimes double arcs at 70-75 both north and south latitude. 10,000-km-scale longitudinal brightness structures can persist for more than 100 hours. This structures rotate together with Saturn. Besides the steady structure, the auroras brighten suddenly on the timescales of few minutes. 1000-km-scale disturbances may move faster or lag behind Saturn's rotation on timescales of tens of minutes. The persistence of the longitudinal structure of the aurora in two long observations in 2009 and 2012 allowed us to estimate its period of rotation of 10.65±0.15 h for 2009 and 10.8±0.1 h for 2012. The 2009 north aurora period is close to the north branch of Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR) detected at that time. The 2012 south aurora period is longer than the SKR periods detected at the time. These periods are also close to the rotation period of the lightning storms on Saturn. We discuss those periodicities and their relevance to Saturn's internal rotation.\n[1] Aguilar, A. et al.

The magnitude of completeness of the catalogue is carried out using different methods and found as 3.0. A large difference in magnitude of completeness is found using different methods and a reliable value is obtained after testing the distribution of magnitudes with time. The region is prone to large earthquake and many studied have shown that seismic activation or quiescence takes place before large earthquakes. We studied such behavior of seismicity based on Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model and found that a stationary ETAS model is more suitable for modelling the seismicity of this region. The earthquake catalogue is de-clustered using stochasting approach to study behavior of background and triggered seismicity. The triggered seismicity is found to have shallower depths as compared to the background events.",

The future land cover maps are projected by a spatially explicit, dynamic land use model (LuccME) and are then used as inputs, in combination with climate change scenarios, to drive four biosphere models (INLAND, ORCHIDEE, JULES and LPJ). The biosphere models simulate changes in evapotranspiration and carbon fluxes and stocks.

            "abstract": "Direct simple shear (DSS) experiments on mud samples from 4.3-13.4 meters below sea floor (mbsf) in the Ursa Basin of the northern Gulf of Mexico document how stress level impacts soil strength and pore pressure genesis during failure. As burial depth increases from 7.3 to 13.4 mbsf, cohesion decreases from 12.3 to 6.5 kPa and internal friction angle increases from 18° to 21°. For the same depth increase, peak shear strength increases from 30 to 63 kPa. For a specimen from 11.75 mbsf, an increase in maximum consolidation stress from 45 to 179 kPa results in an increase in the shear-induced pore pressure from 29 to 150 kPa. The normalized shear strength at peak shear strength, however, decreases from 0.37 to 0.25 over this consolidation stress range. Our results document that compaction induces a positive feedback on pore pressure genesis. This feedback suggests an increase in failure potential during burial at shallow depth. To further understand the physical controls on this behavior, we complete DSS experiments on resedimented samples to erase stress history and sediment fabric. For the resedimented samples, cohesion is 3.6 kPa and internal friction angle is 24°. As maximum consolidation stress increases from 40 to 254 kPa on resedimented samples, peak shear strength increases from 14 to 91 kPa and shear-induced pore pressure increases from 22 to 203 kPa. The normalized shear strength at peak shear strength, however, decreases from 0.32 to 0.25. These results show resedimented samples have similar strength and failure behavior to intact samples. By constraining pore pressure and strength in comparison to initial stress state, we gain better insight on slope failure dynamics. Therefore, this study may provide constraints on soil strength of shallow sediments and pore pressure genesis during failure of shallow marine sediments. The impact of compaction stress on soil strength and pore pressure genesis during shear failure can be included in slope failure and risk models to better constrain failure conditions and potential.",

            "abstract": "Rayleigh waves and leaky Rayleigh waves are sometime used to interpret crustal properties of fault zones or the seafloor. Interpreting these surface wave modes requires an understanding of the effect of mechanical discontinuities such as faults, joints and fractures on leaky Rayleigh wave propagation. In this work, laboratory wavefront imaging experiments were performed to capture the behavior of the leaky Rayleigh waves propagated across fractures at a liquid-solid interface.\nCubic samples of aluminum submerged in water were used in this study. The fractured sample was composed of two identical aluminum blocks (dimension: 102 mm x 102 mm x 61 mm), while the intact sample was measured around 102mm on edge. A contact piezoelectric shear-wave transducer (1MHz) was used as the source. A spherically-focused water-coupled compressional-wave transducer (1MHz) was used to receiver the radiated component of the leaky Rayleigh wave. Measurements were made for a range of normal stresses (0 – 6 MPa). For each loading condition, the receiver scanned a 60 mm x 20 mm region in 1 mm increments to map out the arriving wavefront as a function of time.\nThe measured waveforms at different depths from the intact reference sample were the same under different loading conditions. For the fractured sample, the following phenomenon were observed: (1) Prior to crossing the fracture, the velocity of the leaky Rayleigh wave did not change with stress; (2) After crossing the fracture, the velocity was lower than that measured above the fracture and the velocity increased as the stress increased from 0 to 6 MPa; (3) the amplitude of the leaky Rayleigh wave transmitted across the fracture increased with stress; (4) High frequency components experienced more attenuation than the low frequency components; (5) At high stress, the velocity of the leaky-Rayleigh wave approached that observed above the fracture. Correct interpretation of leaky-Rayleigh waves in fractured/faulted regions must account for time delays and attenuation caused by mechanical discontinuities.\nAcknowledgments: This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Geosciences Research Program under Award Number (DE-FG02-09ER16022) and by the Geo-mathematical Imaging Group at Purdue University.",

            "abstract": "As the oil plumes from deep water blowouts reach the ocean mixed layer (OML), their near-surface dispersions are highly influenced by the wind and wave-generated submesoscale Langmuir turbulence in the OML. In this study, we use large eddy simulations (LES) to model the oil dispersion at scales < 1 km. We find that despite the complex patterns of the instantaneous surface oil slick, the time-averaged surface oil plume can be parameterized as a Gaussian-type plume. The mean surface plume grows linearly downstream, with the centerline inclined clockwise (in the Northern Hemisphere) with respect to the wind and wave direction due to the Ekman transport. The inclination angle increase as the droplet size decreases, while the plume growth rate varies non-monotonically with oil droplet size. Using LES data, we evaluate the eddy viscosity and diffusivity following the K-profile parameterization (KPP) framework. We also evaluate the stress-strain misalignments caused by Stokes drift and the enhancement of eddy viscosity and diffusivity caused by Langmuir circulations. Improvements to the KPP model will be discussed. This study is supported by a Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative research grant.",

            "abstract": "In the early evening sector of the F region near the geomagnetic equator, an eastward pressure gradient as the sun sets reorients the neutral flow toward the east, typically occurring within one hour of local sunset. Very few vertically-resolved measurements of this effect exist. We present recent in-situ chemical tracer results from the EVEX campaign, as well as results from the earlier Guara campaign, that show strong vertical shear in the zonal wind during sunset hours in the F region, up to a 150 m/s westward shift over 60 km altitude. Eastward F-region neutral winds near the geomagnetic equator drive vertical Pedersen currents at sunset that, in turn, drive the prereversal enhancement (PRE) of the eastward electric field in the equatorial F-region that is thought to be a primary driver of equatorial spread-F. Studies of the neutral winds relating to the PRE have been primarily focused on the winds observed from ground-based interferometry and from satellite accelerometer data, techniques which generally lack vertical resolution. We show that eastward winds at one altitude are not necessarily accompanied by eastward winds at higher altitudes, i.e., that the forces that drive the neutral wind are not constant with altitude at sunset. At sunset, solar heating varies significantly with altitude, decreasing at lower altitudes first, which would create a thermal pressure gradient with a similar vertical profile to that observed in the neutral winds. We discuss the magnitude of this effect as well as other factors that could contribute to the observed vertical gradients. We then apply these effects to typical ionospheric conditions at the time of the experiments and examine the resulting neutral forcing in relation to the observed wind profiles.",

Environmental literacy programs at K-12 level provide a unique opportunity in motivating young minds in joining STEM and also provide additional value in learning about “saving planet earth”. The Women in Engineering at the University of Illinois organize an annual week long camp, for female high school students with tracks corresponding to different fields of Engineering. The Environmental Engineering and Sustainability (EES) track is organized by faculty and graduate students of the Civil and Environmental Engineering department and introduces students to concepts in sustainability and systems thinking in connection with air and water quality, climate change and renewable energy.\nThis study is a preliminary assessment of the relevance of the EES outreach track conducted in July 2014 in student learning. Specific goals include assessing (a) demographics of participants and their motivation to join this camp, (b) educational and enjoyability quotients of the modules and (c) learning and motivational outcomes using the Likert scale. A pre-camp survey indicated keen interest in learning about environmental engineering (4.56/5.0) and expected this camp to be a venue to learn about related career choices (4.9/5.0). Five days of instruction were divided thematically and included a mix of lectures, activity based learning, demonstrations and field visits. Overall modules were rated as educational (4.4/5.0) and enjoyable (4.5/5.0). Modules with hands-on learning were best received (4.67/5.0) and rated unique (4.7/5.0). Post camp, participants acknowledged the important contribution of environmental engineers to society (4.8/5.0) and could relate the different modules to the role engineer’s play (4.06/5.0) for sustainability. On an average, the participants evinced interest in engineering as a career choice (4.0/5.0) but there was a broader range of responses regarding environmental engineering as their career choice (3.13/5.0).",

            "abstract": "Globally, root production accounts for 30-70% of terrestrial net primary productivity and influences decomposition via root production and turnover, carbon (C) allocation to mycorrhizal fungi and root exudation. As recognized aboveground, the timing of phenological events affects terrestrial C balance, yet there is no parallel understanding for belowground phenology. The objective of this study is to use meta-analysis to identify broad patterns in the phenology of root production and its relationship to temperature, soil moisture, and aboveground phenology. Synthesizing 87 observations of whole plant phenology from 40 studies, we found that on average root growth occurs 25±8 days after shoot growth but that the offset between the peak in root and shoot growth varies >200 days across biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical). Growth form also affected phenology, with deciduous trees more synchronous than evergreen trees. This and the temperature differential between air and soil in spring may explain the relatively early shoot compared to root growth in boreal biomes. Root and shoot growth are positively correlated with median monthly temperature and mean monthly precipitation in boreal, temperate, and subtropical biomes. However, a temperature hysteresis in these biomes leads to the hypothesis that internal controls over C allocation to roots are an equally, if not more, important driver of phenology. In addition, a lack of correlation with temperature or precipitation in the Mediterranean biome implies that other mechanisms are driving phenology. The specific mechanism(s) are as yet unclear but are likely mediated by some combination of photosynthate supply, hormonal signaling, and growth form.",

            "abstract": "Warming during the 20th century changed the Arctic landscape, including aspects of vegetation, permafrost, and glaciers, but effects on wildlife have been difficult to detect. We explored linkages between components of the riparian ecosystem in Arctic Alaska since the 1970s, including streamflow timing, temperature, floodplain shrub habitat, and shrub herbivore distributions. Streamflow records showed that the peak spring snowmelt discharge has occurred 3.4 days per decade earlier, and consistent fall temperatures and snow arrival dates over the same period suggest that earlier peak discharge has prolonged the ensuing period of reduced flow in the floodplain. We used empirical correlations between cumulative summer warmth and riparian shrub height to estimate that the longer and warmer growing seasons since the 1970s have stimulated a 63% increase in the height of riparian shrubs. Earlier spring discharge and the estimated increase in riparian shrub height are consistent with the observed riparian shrub expansion in the region. Our measurements showed that snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) require a mean riparian shrub height of at least 1.05 to 1.35 m, a threshold which our hindcasting indicates was met between 1977 and 2002. This generally coincides with observational evidence we present suggesting that snowshoe hares became established in 1977 or 1978. Similar relationships are shown for moose, which colonized the region in the 1940s. We also show that Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) inhabited the region in 1998, probably due in part to increasing availability of snowshoe hares. The novel appearance in the Arctic during the 20th century of terrestrial herbivores such as snowshoe hares and moose in response increased shrub habitat is a contrasting terrestrial counterpart to the decline in marine mammals reliant on decreasing sea ice.",

            "abstract": "The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Broadband Platform is a collaborative software development project involving geoscientists, earthquake engineers, graduate students, and the SCEC Community Modeling Environment. The SCEC Broadband Platform (BBP) is open-source scientific software that can generate broadband (0-100Hz) ground motions for earthquakes, integrating complex scientific modules that implement rupture generation, low and high-frequency seismogram synthesis, non-linear site effects calculation, and visualization into a software system that supports easy on-demand computation of seismograms.\nThe Broadband Platform operates in two primary modes: validation simulations and scenario simulations. In validation mode, the Platform runs earthquake rupture and wave propagation modeling software to calculate seismograms for a well-observed historical earthquake. Then, the BBP calculates a number of goodness of fit measurements that quantify how well the model-based broadband seismograms match the observed seismograms for a certain event. Based on these results, the Platform can be used to tune and validate different numerical modeling techniques.\nIn scenario mode, the Broadband Platform can run simulations for hypothetical (scenario) earthquakes. In this mode, users input an earthquake description, a list of station names and locations, and a 1D velocity model for their region of interest, and the Broadband Platform software then calculates ground motions for the specified stations.\nWorking in close collaboration with scientists and research engineers, the SCEC software development group continues to add new capabilities to the Broadband Platform and to release new versions as open-source scientific software distributions that can be compiled and run on many Linux computer systems. Our latest release includes 5 simulation methods, 7 simulation regions covering California, Japan, and Eastern North America, the ability to compare simulation results against GMPEs, and several new data products, such as map and distance-based goodness of fit plots. As the number and complexity of scenarios simulated using the Broadband Platform increases, we have added batching utilities to substantially improve support for running large-scale simulations on computing clusters.",

            "abstract": "Mangrove forests and seagrass meadows provide numerous ecosystem services, with huge recent interest in their carbon sequestration and storage value. Mangrove forests and seagrass meadows as well as mudflats and sandbars form a continuum of intertidal wetlands, but studies that consider these spatially-linked habitats as a whole are limited. This paper presents the results of a field-based and remote sensing carbon stock assessment, including the first study of the ecosystem carbon stocks of these adjacent habitats in the tropics. Aboveground, belowground and soil organic carbon pools were quantified at Chek Jawa, an intertidal wetland in Singapore. Total ecosystem carbon stocks averaged 499 Mg C ha-1 in the mangrove forest and 140 Mg C ha-1 in the seagrass meadow. Soil organic carbon dominated the total storage in both habitats. In the adjacent mudflats and sandbars, soil organic carbon averaged 143 and 124 Mg C ha-1 respectively. High amount of carbon stored in soil demonstrate the role of intertidal wetlands in sequestering large amount of carbon in sediments accumulated over millennia. High-resolution remote sensing imagery was used to create spatial models that upscaled field-based carbon measurements to the national scale. Field-based data and spatial modeling of ecosystem carbon stocks to the entire island through remote sensing provides a large-scale and holistic carbon stock value, important for the understanding and management of these threatened intertidal ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Research on deep-sea corals has expanded rapidly over the last two decades, as scientists began to realize their value as long-lived structural components of high biodiversity habitats and archives of environmental information. The NOAA Deep Sea Coral Research and Technology Program’s National Database for Deep-Sea Corals and Sponges is a comprehensive resource for georeferenced data on these organisms in U.S. waters. The National Database currently includes more than 220,000 deep-sea coral records representing approximately 880 unique species. Database records from museum archives, commercial and scientific bycatch, and from journal publications provide baseline information with relatively coarse spatial resolution dating back as far as 1842. These data are complemented by modern, in-situ submersible observations with high spatial resolution, from surveys conducted by NOAA and NOAA partners.\nManagement of high volumes of modern high-resolution observational data can be challenging. NOAA is working with our data partners to incorporate this occurrence data into the National Database, along with images and associated information related to geoposition, time, biology, taxonomy, environment, provenance, and accuracy. NOAA is also working to link associated datasets collected by our program’s research, to properly archive them to the NOAA National Data Centers, to build a robust metadata record, and to establish a standard protocol to simplify the process.\nAccess to the National Database is provided through an online mapping portal. The map displays point based records from the database. Records can be refined by taxon, region, time, and depth. The queries and extent used to view the map can also be used to download subsets of the database. The database, map, and website is already in use by NOAA, regional fishery management councils, and regional ocean planning bodies, but we envision it as a model that can expand to accommodate data on a global scale.",

Uncertainty in NH3 emissions lead to uncertainty in the formation, vertical distribution, and radiative impacts of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate aerosol, which in turn leads to significant uncertainties in predictions of air quality and future climate. Here we present preliminary results of evaluating NH3 sources, aerosol formation, and their impacts during the 2010 NOAA CalNex and 2013 NOAA Southeast Nexus (SENEX) field campaigns (in LA and the Central Valley of California and the Southeast US, respectively). We use the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) driven with meteorological fields from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate NH3. Model results are compared to surface and aircraft measurements of aerosol inorganics and gas-phase NH3, HNO3, NOx, and SO2 during each campaign, as well as satellite NH3 observations from the NASA Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and the NOAA Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) for each region.",

            "abstract": "A significant source of alert latency in earthquake early warning (EEW) algorithms, which can possibly be reduced, is the duration of the time window used to estimate EEW parameters following a P wave detection. We investigate whether the detection time for the τc-Pd Onsite algorithm can be reduced by estimating EEW parameters using shorter waveform windows. The Onsite algorithm is currently one of three EEW algorithms implemented in ShakeAlert, the earthquake early warning system being developed for the west coast of the United States. Onsite uses the ground-motion period parameter (τc) and peak initial displacement parameter (Pd) to estimate the magnitude and expected ground shaking of an ongoing earthquake. The current implementation of Onsite requires a 3 second window of the P waveform before issuing magnitude estimates. We use a large suite of waveform records of local earthquakes (M>3) recorded in southern California to examine the performance for a range of window lengths between 1-5 s. We examine source-to-station distances up to 300 km and focus on the results for distances less than 100 km. We find that Pd shows a stronger correlation with magnitude than is observed for τc, for all tested window lengths. τc does not correlate with magnitude for earthquakes with M<4; however, we do not apply any quality metrics to remove bad or noisy records (e.g. Böse et al., 2012). The broadband waveforms give more reliable Pd and τc measurements than strong motion waveforms, at least for moderate sized earthquakes, likely because of higher signal to noise ratios. However, these results may be biased since the dataset does not include many waveforms for earthquakes with M>6. Overall, preliminary results suggest that it may be feasible to use shorter window lengths (1 sec) without significantly degrading the magnitude estimate in the Onsite algorithm. We will determine the optimal waveform window that provides both fast and reliable estimates of τc and Pd for use in the Onsite algorithm, and will work with spatially varying station density. Further, we will investigate if sliding window lengths can be used to improve the τc and Pd estimates continuously.",

            "abstract": "Ozone is the third most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas and a significant pollutant at the surface affecting human and plant health. Rapidly increasing Asian emissions of ozone precursors, land-surface changes from burning, and decreasing surface emissions in Europe and North America have resulted in unknown changes to the distribution of tropospheric ozone. Satellite-borne instruments provide the means for global and continuous monitoring of this important trace gas. High spectral resolution infrared radiance measurements, such as those from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) on the NASA Aura satellite (launched in 2004), and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Instruments (IASI), on the MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellites (launched in 2006 and 2012 respectively) can be used to derive vertical information of tropospheric ozone. As part of efforts to assess consistency between the TES and IASI data records, a retrieval for ozone from IASI radiances, building on the data processor for TES, has been developed as a collaboration between NASA JPL and NCAR. Using a priori information consistent with TES retrievals, the optimal estimation approach is applied to IASI radiances in order to obtain vertical distributions of ozone. This presentation shows the characterization of these IASI ozone retrievals with respect to the vertical distribution of the uncertainties and sensitivities as well as comparisons with TES. Further, trends in ozone over Asia, North America, and Europe as seen by TES and IASI are presented.",

ATTREX is using the high-altitude, long-duration NASA Global Hawk Unmanned Air System to make in situ and remote-sensing measurements spanning the Pacific. A particular ATTREX emphasis is to better understand the dehydration of air as it passes through the cold tropical tropopause region. The ATTREX payload contains 12 in situ and remote sensing instruments that measure water vapor, clouds, multiple gaseous tracers (CO, CO2, CH4, NMHC, SF6, CFCs, N2O), reactive chemical compounds (O3, BrO, NO2), meteorological parameters, and radiative fluxes.\nATTREX flight series have been conducted in the fall of 2011 from Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) in California, in the winter of 2013 from AFRC, and in the winter/spring of 2014 from Guam. The first two flight series provided extensive sampling of the central and eastern Pacific, whereas the last flight series permitted sampling in the western Pacific. The sampling strategy has primarily involved repeated ascents and descents through the depth of the TTL (about 13-19 km). Over 100 TTL profiles were obtained on each flight series. The ATTREX dataset includes TTL water vapor measurements with unprecedented accuracy, ice crystal size distributions and habits. The cloud and water measurements provide unique information about TTL cloud formation, the persistence of supersaturation with respect to ice, and dehydration. The plethora of tracers measured on the Global Hawk flights are providing unique information about TTL transport pathways and time scales. The meteorological measurements are revealing dynamical phenomena controlling the TTL thermal structure, and the radiation measurements are providing information about heating rates associated with TTL clouds and water vapor.\nThis presentation will provide an overview of the ATTREX flights, examples of measurements from the flights, and plans for modeling/analysis of the ATTREX dataset.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between fault zones and hydrogeological domains are an open challenge and require the understanding of the complex relationship between structure, fluid flow and hydrothermal transport and processes. Faults stimulate hydraulic conductivity when acting as conduit, but it can also be a barrier by mineral precipitation and comminution. Structural heterogeneity of fractured lithology induces a flow partition within the aquifer system creating preferential flows paths and some fracture connectivity. We propose an interdisciplinary approach from hydrogeological and structural point of view, in a low-enthalpy aquifer system in the central valley of Central Chile, where several low-temperature thermal springs are spatially related to regional long-lived fault zone (Pocuro Fault Zone). Pocuro Fault zone is a kilometric NS-striking steeply dipping fault zone, with at least 50 km long. Metric wide fault core includes gouge and cataclastic rocks, whereas decametric damage zone consists of intensely fractured and hydrothermal altered Meso-Cenozoic volcanic and volcaniclastic host rocks, crossed by centimetric to milimetric subvertical NE-striking veins. Preliminary results of vein infill clays minerals and zeolites from damage zone, suggest P-T conditions interpreted as an exhumed fossil high-temperature (120º-230ºC) geothermal system. Currently, only low-temperature thermal springs are discharging with different geochemical patterns (bicarbonate to chlorine and sulphate dominant ions) and a homogeneous temperature range (20º-25ºC). This is an interesting study case, to better understand the permeability evolution of geothermal system and the link between internal fault architecture, hydrogeology and hydrothermal inputs.",

            "abstract": "Dept. of Geology and Geophysics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA\nWe performed frequency-dependent polarization and power analysis on continuous ambient seismic energy recorded by broadband seismic stations that were part of the Utah Regional Seismic Network (UU) for the years of 2001-2013. The number of broadband seismometers increased from 10 to 28 in this time period. As expected, at all 28 stations the single and double frequency peaks caused by microseisms were observed in the range of 3-20 s. At four of the stations located around the Great Salt Lake (BGU, HVU, NOQ, and SPU) an additional noise peak was intermittently observed in the period range of 0.8-1.2 s. This noise peak was strongest at SPU, a station located on the tip of a peninsula jutting into the lake from the north, and weakest at NOQ, a station located a few kilometers south of the lake in the Oquirrh Mountains. The noise peaks occur in both daytime and nighttime, and have durations lasting from a couple of hours to multiple days. They occur more frequently in the spring, summer, and fall, and less commonly in the winter. The occurrences of noise peaks in the summer show a day night pattern and seem to reach a peak during the night.\nThe time dependence of this 1-s seismic noise was compared to records of wind speed measured at 1-hr intervals from nearby meteorological stations run by the NWS, and to lake level gage height measurements made by the USGS. Correlations with wind speed and lake level were done for every month of the year in 2013. Results showed that the correlations with wind varied throughout the year from a high of 0.49 in November to a low of 0.20 in the month of January. The correlation with lake level also varied throughout the year and the strongest correlation was found in the month of December with a correlation of 0.43. While these correlation values are statistically significant, neither wind nor lake level can completely explain the seismic observations. Further work will be done comparing wind and lake level to the seismic data for the years of 2001-2012 over a broader range of periods. We are currently investigating whether this noise source can be used to image the basin structure of the Salt Lake Valley via cross-correlation.",

            "abstract": "Ferric iron (Fe(III)) and humic substances (HS) are important terminal electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration in wet tundra soils of the Arctic Coastal Plain near Barrow, Alaska. These soils are rich in both solid phase Fe minerals (including oxides such as ferrihydrite and goethite and other minerals with reduced or mixed valence such as siderite and magnetite) and soluble Fe, chelated by siderophores and other small organic molecules. This latter pool may also include nanocolloidal Fe: extremely fine-grained minerals that pass through a 0.2 micron filter. Both the solid phase and aqueous Fe pools undergo seasonal changes in redox state as a result of biological reduction by Fe-reducing microorganisms and oxidation by a variety of potential mechanisms, both abiotic and biotic. These redox cycles of solid and aqueous pools are not in phase: solid phase Fe became progressively more reduced from mid- to late summer, while aqueous phase Fe became reduced over the first half of the summer. It is well-known that HS interact with Fe, and that HS can act as electron shuttles in the reduction of Fe oxides. In other ecosystems chelated Fe(III) has been incubated with soil samples and the resulting Fe(II) produced is used as an indicator of the reducing power of HS. In these Fe-rich Arctic soils, HS are continuously in contact with chelated Fe, and therefore we interpret the redox state of this pool as an indicator of HS redox status. To verify this we conducted redox titrations of extracted HS with both reduced and oxidized Fe chelates and showed that chelated Fe could interact with HS both as electron acceptor and donator. In a field experiment, the addition of oxidized humic acids to soils resulted in an immediate oxidation of the aqueous Fe pool within 24 hours, which we attribute to abiotic oxidation of Fe by HS, followed by a slow reduction of this pool over the next week, presumably due to biological Fe reduction of the HS/aqueous Fe pool. At the end of summer 2010, both the solid-phase and aqueous Fe pools were in a mostly reduced state. At the beginning of summer 2011, the solid phase Fe pool was unchanged but aqueous Fe was re-oxidized. Several mechanisms for the reoxidation of the HS/aqueous Fe pool during the shoulder seasons and/or winter will be explored.",

Prosperity in the Caucasus region, and its successful development, unconditionally depends on international projects aiming to integrate the region into leading economical structure. Earthquake hazard analysis is especially important for economically undeveloped countries, since the recovery period after strong earthquakes is very long.\nThe main objective of our study was to improve the database for hazard calculations and develop modern and new common hazard maps for the region. The primary tasks to obtain our objective were defined as follows:\n1. Improvement of the shared regional database, with quality control, to include seismological, geological, geophysical, geodetic, geotechnical and other information, as well as data on critical infrastructure.\n2. Seismic hazard assessment based upon the newly improved database and using new methodologies and CRISIS software.\n3. Tectonic studies of the region. The improved database facilitated tectonic studies, including the development of physical/mathematical models for regional seismotectonic processes. These models were incorporated active tectonic structures throughout the area, including transborder regions.\nThe National Building codes of Georgia are based on the seismic hazard map developed in 1999. Presented study participants were the key researchers in compiling the 1999 hazard map. Map has been slightly updated in 2006 and adopted in 2009. Based on the world experience national seismic hazard map should be updated periodically (approximately once in every 5 years.). We believe that the results of this study, namely the new probabilistic seismic hazard maps, which were compiled using modern approaches and the updated data, is very important for the development of the country and its growing construction industry.",

For accurate modeling and sensor simulation of ice clouds at these wavelengths, realistic particle shapes and size distributions (PSD) need to be used. During the Jan-Feb 2012 Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Cold Season Precipitation Experiment (GCPEx) near Toronto, Canada, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) dual-frequency (Ku/Ka-band) Airborne Precipitation Radar (APR-2) flew onboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft. Coordinated flights were carried out with the Univ. of North Dakota Citation aircraft carrying the High Volume Precipitation Spectrometer (HVPS-3), to collect cloud PSD and particle imagery. Selected flights enabled collection of coincident sampling volumes from the APR-2 and the HVPS. This unique dataset enables the scattering properties of the frozen hydrometeors to be modeled using the HVPS-provided particle distributions, and compared with APR-2 observations.\nThe wide variety of fractal-like particle shapes measured in the HVPS data were separated into size bins and presented as 2 dimensional histograms with bins defined by Aspect (As) and Area (Ar) ratio. Individual histograms were previously characterized by the mean As and Ar values, ignoring the preferential linear trend between As and Ar visible for data points within most particle sizes. To facilitate the scattering models, we attempted to partition particles by shape within four size-invariant As and Ar categories. The four unique PSD, created by particle shape segregation, were then used to forward model the Ku and Ka- band radar reflectivities to locate the particle characteristics that provided the best agreement with actual APR-2 observations. In future work, these PSD will be used for passive microwave satellite sensor simulations of cold season precipitation and compared to actual satellite observations.",

            "abstract": "A stochastic joint inverse algorithm is used to analyze diverse geophysical and hydrologic data associated with a geothermal prospect. The approach uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) global search algorithm to develop an ensemble of hydrothermal groundwater flow models that are most consistent with the observations. The algorithm utilizes an initial conceptual model descriptive of structural (geology), parametric (permeability) and hydrothermal (saturation, temperature) characteristics of the geologic system. Initial (a-priori) estimates of uncertainty in these characteristics are used to drive simulations of hydrothermal fluid flow and related geophysical processes in a large number of random realizations of the conceptual geothermal system spanning these uncertainties. The process seeks to improve the conceptual model by developing a ranked subset of model realizations that best match all available data within a specified norm or tolerance. Statistical (posterior) characteristics of these solutions reflect reductions in the a-priori uncertainties. The algorithm has been tested on a geothermal prospect located at Superstition Mountain, California and has been successful in creating a suite of models compatible with available temperature, surface resistivity, and magnetotelluric (MT) data. Although the MCMC method is highly flexible and capable of accommodating multiple and diverse datasets, a typical inversion may require the evaluation of thousands of possible model runs whose sophistication and complexity may evolve with the magnitude of data considered. As a result, we are testing the use of sensitivity analyses to better identify critical uncertain variables, lower order surrogate models to streamline computational costs, and value of information analyses to better assess optimal use of related data.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

            "abstract": "Since the classic work of Hays, Imbrie, and Shackleton in 1976, we have known that glacial cycles are paced by the Milankovitch frequencies. However, it has also been long recognized that deglaciations, especially in the ‘100k-world’, are too abrupt to be a linear response of the climate system to this orbital forcing. To explain this ‘sawtooth’ behavior, rising pCO2 in the atmosphere has been proposed to be an amplifier of deglacial climate change. Yet this CO2 must come from somewhere and it does not seem to be an early responder in the deglacial sequence of events. Most ideas focus on the deep ocean as the only reservoir large enough to store the CO2 on G-I timescales, including the capacity to release it quickly.\nHere we propose a new ‘capacitor’ for the climate system, deep ocean heat storage, that could provide the key physical mechanism to explain the important features of deglacial climate. There is a growing body of evidence, from carbonate stable isotopes and pore water salinity estimates, that the Last Glacial Maximum deep ocean was more stratified than today. Through thermobaricity in seawater’s equation of state (the pressure dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient), salt stratification can store heat in a water column that is locally statically stable. However, analogous to CAPE in the atmosphere, this heat energy is convectively available and can lead to large, abrupt deep-ocean mixing. Using clumped isotopes in deep-sea corals from Heinrich Event 1, we have found warmer water underneath colder water, about 800 years before the Bolling-Alerod warming recorded in Greenland ice cores. We propose that the abrupt nature of the Bolling is due to the discharge of this deep ocean thermal capacitor which then changes the deep circulation from a glacial to a modern pattern.",

            "abstract": "There has been significant interest in so-called narrowband Stimulated Electromagnetic Emission SEE over the past several years due to recent discoveries at the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program HAARP facility near Gakone, Alaska. Narrowband SEE (NSEE) has been defined as spectral features in the SEE spectrum typically within 1 kHz of the transmitter (or pump) frequency. SEE is due to nonlinear processes leading to re-radiation at frequencies other than the pump wave frequency during heating the ionospheric plasma with high power HF radio waves. Although NSEE exhibits a richly complex structure, it has now been shown after a substantial number of observations at HAARP, that NSEE can be grouped into two basic classes. The first are those spectral features, associated with Stimulated Brillouin Scatter SBS, which typically occur when the pump frequency is not close to electron gyro-harmonic frequencies. Typically, these spectral features are within roughly 50 Hz of the pump wave frequency where it is to be noted that the O+ ion gyro-frequency is roughly 50 Hz. The second class of spectral features corresponds to the case when the pump wave frequency is typically within roughly 10 kHz of electron gyro-harmonic frequencies. In this case, spectral features ordered by harmonics of ion gyro-frequencies are typically observed, and termed Stimulated Ion Bernstein Scatter SIBS. This presentation will first provide an overview of the recent NSEE experimental observations at HAARP. Both Stimulated Brillouin Scatter SBS and Stimulated Ion Bernstein Scatter SIBS observations will be discussed as well as their relationship to each other. Possible theoretical formulation in terms of parametric decay instabilities and computational modeling will be provided. Possible applications of NSEE will be pointed out including triggering diagnostics for artificial ionization layer formation, proton precipitation event diagnostics, electron temperature measurements in the heated volume and detection of heavy ion species. Finally potential for observing such SEE at the European Incoherent Scatter EISCAT facility will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Cloud phase state is a key piece of information in characterizing the impact of clouds on radiation and dynamics. Identifying cloud phase is also the first step towards deriving further information about hydrometeor mass, concentration, and size in remote sensing retrievals. While a variety of phase identification algorithms exist, they don’t have quantitative estimates of their uncertainty when run operationally. The difficulty of assigning uncertainties to remote sensing retrievals stems both from a lack of objective “truth” of hydrometeor properties, and insufficient independent information available to fully constrain the properties of cloud particles.\nTwo promising directions for improving and identifying uncertainties in cloud phase characterization are inclusion of additional information available in cloud radar Doppler spectra and using statistical techniques to quantify the value of the information available from multiple sensors at a given time. We will report on progress incorporating multiple remote sensing observations from the ARM Climate Research Facility into a Bayesian net framework to characterize the rigor of identifying cloud phase given different sets of information, including higher order moments of the doppler spectra than are often used. Comparisons to available in situ data will be used to evaluate the results, identify further in situ measurements needed to characterize the problem, and to discuss the implications of the uncertainty in phase state identification for microphysical retrievals.",

            "abstract": "Wildland fire is a primary threat to watersheds that can impact water supply through increased sedimentation, water quality decline, and change the timing and amount of runoff leading to increased risk from flood and sediment natural hazards. It is of great societal importance in the western USA and throughout the world to improve understanding of how changing fire frequency, extent, and location, in conjunction with fuel treatments will affect watersheds and the ecosystem services they supply to communities. In this work we assess the utility of the InVEST Sediment Retention Model to accurately characterize vulnerability of burned watersheds to erosion and sedimentation. The InVEST tools are GIS-based implementations of common process models, engineered for high-end computing to allow the faster simulation of larger landscapes and incorporation into decision-making. The InVEST Sediment Retention Model is based on common soil erosion models (e.g., RUSLE –Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) and determines which areas of the landscape contribute the greatest sediment loads to a hydrological network and conversely evaluate the ecosystem service of sediment retention on a watershed basis. We evaluate the accuracy and uncertainties for InVEST predictions of increased sedimentation after fire, using measured post-fire sedimentation rates available for many watersheds in different rainfall regimes throughout the western USA from an existing, large USGS database of post-fire sediment yield [synthesized in Moody J, Martin D (2009) Synthesis of sediment yields after wildland fire in different rainfall regimes in the western United States. International Journal of Wildland Fire 18: 96‐115]. The ultimate goal of this work is to calibrate and implement the model to accurately predict variability in post-fire sediment yield as a function of future landscape heterogeneity predicted by wildfire simulations, and future landscape fuel treatment scenarios, within watersheds.",

Specifically, our objective is to investigate new methods by which telepresence can be used to conduct cutting edge research and provide authentic educational experiences to undergraduate students, remotely. We choose to conduct this research in an Oceanographic context for two reasons: first with the move toward smaller research ships in the national Oceanographic research fleet, we anticipate that access to berth space at sea will continue to be at a premium. Any component of traditional oceanographic research that can be ported to shore without loss of effectiveness would be of immediate benefit to the Ocean Sciences. Equally, however, we argue that any improvements to work place and/or education practices that we can identify while delivering research and education from the bottom of the deep ocean should be readily mappable to any other scientific or engineering activities that seek to make use of telepresence in less extreme remote environments. Work on our TREET project, to-date, has included recruitment of 6 early career scientists keen to take advantage of the research opportunity provided, together with two senior science mentors with experience using Telepresence and a cohort of undergraduate students at three of the ECS partner Universities, spanning 4 time zones across the continental US. Following a 12-week synchronous on-line seminar series taught in Spring-Summer 2014, the entire team joined together at the Inner Space Center in Sept-Oct 2014 to participate, virtually, in a cruise of research and exploration to the Kick’Em Jenny underwater volcano and adjacent cold seep sites, conducted by the Ocean Exploration Trust’s ROV Hercules aboard the Exploration Vessel Nautilus.

            "abstract": "At mid-ocean ridges magmatic, hydrothermal, and tectonic processes are linked. Understanding their interactions requires mapping magmatic systems and tectonic structures, as well as their relationship to hydrothermal circulation. Three-dimensional seismic images of the crust can be used to infer the size, shape, and location of magma reservoirs, in addition to the structure of the thermal boundary layer that connects magmatic and hydrothermal processes. Travel time tomography has often been used to study these processes, however, the spatial resolution of travel time tomography is limited.\nThree-dimensional full waveform inversion (FWI) is a state-of-the art seismic method developed for use in the oil industry to obtain high-resolution models of the velocity structure. The primary advantage of FWI is that it has the potential to resolve subsurface structures on the order of half the seismic wavelength—a significant improvement on conventional travel time tomography. Here, we apply anisotropic FWI to data collected on the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Starting models for anisotropic P-wave velocity were obtained by travel time tomography [Weekly et al., 2014]. During FWI, the isotropic velocity model is updated and anisotropy is held constant.\nWe have recovered low-velocity zones approximately 2-3 km beneath the ridge axis that likely correspond to a segmented magma-rich body and are in concert with those previously resolved using multi-channel seismic reflection methods. The segmented crustal magma body underlies all five known high-temperature hydrothermal vent fields along the Endeavour segment. A high-velocity zone, shallower than the observed low-velocity zones, underlies the southernmost hydrothermal vent field. This may be indicative of waning hydrothermal activity in which minerals are crystallizing beneath the vent field. Our FWI study of the Endeavour Ridge will provide the most detailed three-dimensional images of the crustal structure to date over a spreading center.",

            "abstract": "Circum-Arctic warming has been linked to a range of vegetation changes, including increased shrub-tundra biomass, shrub encroachment, and altered forest succession. Coarse spatial resolution AVHRR satellite data have been commonly used to study these vegetation dynamics at continental scales, usually via the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) metric. However, AVHRR cannot resolve local, patch-scale trends in vegetation, or provide sufficient spatial detail to relate observed trends in NDVI to specific land cover types. We have assembled a record of atmospherically-corrected 30-meter Landsat data acquired during peak greenness months over three decades (1990-1992, 2000-2002, and 2010-2012) to study the vegetation dynamics of the entire Arctic and Subarctic of North America, and compare with the results derived from 1/12-degree AVHRR NDVI3g data for 1990-2012. Landsat NDVI values were screened for abrupt changes indicative of disturbance, and then assessed for statistically significant temporal trends. Landsat NDVI, at both 30-meter resolution and the aggregated 1/12-degree NDVI3g resolution, showed a strong greening trend continuously along the Arctic coast and sporadic browning trends inland (e.g. southern NWT). Approximately 29% and 3% of the study area shows greening and browning trend respectively. The spatial pattern and summary statistics are generally in good agreement with those for AVHRR results and are consistent with previous results indicating increased shrub-tundra biomass. Additional efforts are focusing on separating long-term, climate-induced vegetation change from disturbance recovery, and in relating observed changes to specific vegetation types and topographic/edaphic conditions.

            "abstract": "Near-surface ozone in the western US can be sensitive to transported background pollutants from the free troposphere over the eastern Pacific, as well as various local emissions sources. Accurately estimating ozone source contributions in this region has strong policy-relevant significance as the air quality standards tend to go down. Here we improve modeled contributions from local and non-local sources to western US ozone base on the HTAP2 (Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution) multi-model experiment, along with multi-scale chemical data assimilation. We simulate western US air quality using the STEM regional model on a 12 km horizontal resolution grid, during the NASA ARCTAS field campaign period in June 2008. STEM simulations use time-varying boundary conditions downscaled from global GEOS-Chem model simulations. Standard GEOS-Chem simulation overall underpredicted ozone at 1-5 km in the eastern Pacific, resulting in underestimated contributions from the transported background pollutants to surface ozone inland. These negative biases can be reduced by using the output from several global models that support the HTAP2 experiment, which all ran with the HTAP2 harmonized emission inventory and also calculated the contributions from east Asian anthropogenic emissions. We demonstrate that the biases in GEOS-Chem boundary conditions can be more efficiently reduced via assimilating satellite ozone profiles from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) instrument using the three dimensional variational (3D-Var) approach. Base upon these TES-constrained GEOS-Chem boundary conditions, we then update regional nitrogen dioxide and isoprene emissions in STEM through the four dimensional variational (4D-Var) assimilation of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) nitrogen dioxide columns and the NASA DC-8 aircraft isoprene measurements. The 4D-Var assimilation spatially redistributed the emissions of nitrogen oxides and isoprene from various US sources, and in the meantime updated the modeled ozone and its US source contributions. Compared with available independent measurements (e.g., ozone observed on the DC-8 aircraft, and at EPA and Mt. Bachelor monitoring stations) during this period, modeled ozone fields after the multi-scale assimilation show overall improvement.",

The DEM allows for heterogeneous shape and size distributions of the ice floes to evolve over time. We simulated the interaction between sea ice and ocean waves in the marginal ice zone using a coupled wave-ice system. The waves were modeled with NHWAVE, a non-hydrostatic wave model that predicts instantaneous surface elevation and the three-dimensional flow field.

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves have been studied for decades, though remain a fundamentally important topic in heliospheric physics. The connection of EMIC waves to the scattering of energetic particles from Earth’s radiation belts is one of many topics that motivate the need for a deeper understanding of characteristics and occurrence distributions of the waves. In this study, we show that EMIC wave frequencies, as observed at Halley Station in Antarctica from 2009 through 2012, increase by approximately 50% over that interval. Assuming that these waves are excited in the vicinity of the plasmapause, the change in Kp in going from solar minimum to near solar maximum would drive increased plasmapause erosion, potentially shifting the generation region of the EMIC to lower L and resulting in the higher frequencies. A numerical estimate of the change in plasmapause location, however, implies that it is not enough to account for the shift in EMIC frequencies that are observed at Halley Station. Another possible explanation for the frequency shift, however, is that the relative density of heavier ions in the magnetosphere (that would be associated with increased solar activity) could account for the change in frequencies.",

            "abstract": "The pace and scale of contemporary urbanization is a defining feature of the Anthropocene, which characterizes the dominance of human influence on the global environment. Although urban areas occupy less than three percent of the global land surface, they have global-scale impacts on natural resources, social dynamics, human wellbeing and the environment. The global environmental changes already underway are profound and in some ways irreversible. Altogether, these have serious implications for future human and environmental health, and social wellbeing.\nDespite considerable research and policy attention to cities, efforts are strongly needed towards integration that builds upon this and facilitates intensive interactions among disciplines in developing new perspectives, theory and methods for understanding urbanizations and urban systems as they drive and are affected by global environmental change, and for exploring options to achieve sustainability and resilience in an urbanizing world.\nI will present initial outcomes from a 2014 NSF/Future Earth-funded activity to develop a co-designed and interdisciplinary urban initiative within the Future Earth framework. The complexity of urban systems and the global sustainability challenges we face require inter- and trans-disciplinary research approaches that adopt a contextual approach to finding solutions. I will synthesize perspectives spanning multiple urban research and practice communities from workshops that took place over 2014 including the 2104 UGEC Conference, where emphasis was given to exploring:\nknowledge gaps and key urban research and socially-relevant questions moving forward;\nmajor challenges and opportunities for developing conceptual and methodological frameworks that support the global transformation to sustainability in the context of an urbanizing planet;\noperational mechanisms that must be in place for a successful interdisciplinary urban project that fits within Future Earth.

Advanced tools for accessing, analyzing, and visualizing very large and complex climate data are required to maintain rapid progress in Earth system research. To meet this need, the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center is developing an advanced computational infrastructure that can provide high-performance analysis and visualization capabilities to the desktops of climate scientists.\nIn collaboration with the Ultra-scale Visualization Climate Data Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT) development consortium, NCCS is developing climate data analysis and visualization tools for UV-CDAT, which provides data analysis capabilities for the Earth System Grid (ESG). These tools feature workflow interfaces, interactive 3D data exploration, hyperwall and stereo visualization, automated provenance generation, parallel task execution, and streaming data parallel pipelines. NASA’s DV3D is a UV-CDAT package that enables exploratory analysis of diverse and rich data sets from various sources including the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). DV3D provides user-friendly workflow interfaces for advanced visualization and analysis of climate data at a level appropriate for scientists.\nDV3D’s integration with CDAT’s climate data management system (CDMS) and other tools provides a wide range of climate data analysis operations, e.g. simple arithmetic operations, regridding, conditioned comparisons, weighted averages, various statistical operations, etc. Several teams are developing parallel versions of these tools that will enable users to analyze and display large data sets that cannot currently be processed with existing desktop tools. This enables scientists to run analyses that were previously intractable due to the large size of the datasets and, using DV3D, seamlessly couple these analyses with advanced visualization methods.",

            "abstract": "The surface of Europa is crosscut by a dense network of structures, many of these representing a complex history of strike-slip tectonic activity, presumably arising from a combination of global and local stress sources. Several dominant (~1000 km) structures span geographically diverse locations of Europa, offering a unique opportunity to study strike-slip activity at the hemispheric scale. These structures also exhibit kilometer-scale geometric bends that can promote or discourage shear failure. To better understand the role of tidal stress sources and implications for strike-slip faulting on Europa, we investigate the relationship between shear and normal stresses at four major fault zones: Agenor Linea, Rhadamanthys Linea, Conamara Chaos (Agave and Asterius Lineae), and Astypalaea Linea. Assuming tidal diurnal and non-synchronous rotation (NSR) stresses as the primary mechanisms for strike-slip tectonism, here we investigate the mechanics of Coulomb shear failure on Europa. We consider a range of friction coefficients (µf = 0.2 – 0.6) and fault depths (0 – 6 km) to evaluate how the predicted failure varies as a function of depth and its dependency on ice friction, geographic location, and fault geometry. Our results indicate that the conditions for failure at depth are not met for any of the lineae if subject to diurnal stresses only. Alternatively, models that include both diurnal and NSR stresses readily generate stress magnitudes that could permit shear failure. Shear failure is easily activated and extends to depths ranging from 3 – 6 km on all four linea systems when a low coefficient of friction (µf = 0.2) is assumed, but is generally limited to depths < 3 km when a high coefficient of friction (µf = 0.6) is applied. Based on these results, we infer that the conditions for shear failure are potentially met along at least these four studied lineae, and possibly others, on Europa when NSR is adopted as a driving stress mechanism and the coefficient of friction is low.",

Tools such as the Geospatial Climate Tool (GeoCLIM) have been developed to interpolate time-series grids of precipitation and temperature values from station observations and associated satellite imagery, elevation data, and other spatially continuous fields. The GeoCLIM tool also allows the identification of anomalies and assessments of both their frequency of occurrence and directional trends. A major effort has been put forth to build the capacities of local and regional institutions to use GeoCLIM to integrate their station data (which is not typically available to the public) into improved national and regional gridded climate data sets.\nIn addition to the improvements and capacity building activities related to geospatial analysis tools, FEWS NET will assist in two other areas; 1) downscaling of climate change scenarios and 2) vulnerability impact assessments. FEWS NET will provide expertise in statistical downscaling of Global Climate Model output fields and work with regional institutions to assess results of other downscaling methods. Completion of a vulnerability impact assessment (VIA) involves the examination of sectoral consequences in identified climate “hot spots”. FEWS NET will lead the VIA for the agriculture and food security sector, but will also provide key geospatial layers needed by multiple sectors in the areas of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.\nProject implementation will strengthen regional coordination in policy-making, planning, and response to climate change issues.",

            "abstract": "In the coastal areas of Southwest Bangladesh polders are surrounded by tidal channels filled with brackish water. In the wet season, farmers create openings in the embankments to irrigate rice paddies. In the dry season, farmers do the same to create saline shrimp ponds. Residents on Polder 32, located within the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta system, practice these seasonal farming techniques. Soils in the area are entisols, being sediment recently deposited, and contain mostly silt-sized particles. Brackish water in brine shrimp ponds may deposit salt in the soil, causing soil salinization. However, saline connate groundwater could also be contributing to soil salinization. Groundwater, surface water (fresh water pond, rice paddy and tidal channel water) and soil samples have been analyzed via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy and ion chromatography in an attempt to correlate salinity measurements with each other in order to determine major sources of soil salinity. Multiple parameters, including distances of samples from tidal channels, inland streams, shrimp ponds and tube wells were measured to see if spatial correlations exist. Similarly, values from wet and dry seasons were compared to quantify temporal variations. Salt content in many soil samples were found to be high enough to significantly decrease rice yields. Continued soil salinization can decrease these yields even more, leading to farmers not producing enough food to sustain their families.",

            "abstract": "Spatiotemporal variability combined with few lake measurements have resulted in a large amount of uncertainty regarding the emission potential of lakes. Both the amount of methane (CH4) emitted and controls on this emission vary spatially and temporally. A positive correlation has been shown between lake water/sediment temperature and the amount of CH4 emitted from lakes. Lack of data available on how other lake characteristics affect the emission of greenhouse gasses, specifically CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2), indicate the need for measurements across a diversity of lake types to be able to accurately predict emissions in the future.\nThis study focused on answering the question of how lake physical and geochemical traits impact emission potential in lake waters. Twenty subarctic lakes located in the Stordalen area, Abisko, Sweden (68°21’N, 18°49’E) were sampled for dissolved CH4, CO2 (as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)), DOC, particulate organic carbon (POC), water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, and pH. Qualitative characteristics of shoreline vegetation and lake bottom structure were also noted. Data analysis included analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple linear regression analysis to determine the differences and predictability of emission potential based on the observed lake characteristics. The strongest correlation between CH4 concentrations and temperature occurred in lakes with algae and sediment bottom types with the lowest occurrences in rock and peat bottom types. Methane concentrations were highest in lakes with shore types composed of Carex spp., peat/ Carex spp. and rock/ Carex spp..",

            "abstract": "Germanium (Ge) is an element with a chemical behavior very similar to that of silicon (Si), albeit with some important differences. As a result, Ge/Si ratios in the environment can be used to investigate the Si cycle. For example, glacial-interglacial variations of the global marine Ge/Si ratio1 could be reflecting either changes in terrestrial weathering (river water Ge/Si has been proposed as a proxy for silicate weathering intensity1) or the degree of decoupling between Ge and Si during marine sediment diagenesis and burial2.\nThe investigation of Ge stable isotopes (δ74Ge) may help to better constrain the dynamics of the Ge cycle and aid in the interpretation of Ge/Si paleorecords. It also has the potential to provide useful information on the weathering environment, complementing other isotopic critical zone proxies, such as δ7Li, δ30Si, 87Sr/86Sr, etc..\nWe present the first δ74Ge measurements of river waters. We analyzed δ74Ge as well as Ge/Si ratios and several other major and trace element concentrations across a mountain-to-floodplain gradient reaching from the Peruvian Andes to the Amazon. In contrast with other areas and the global trend1, there is no correlation between Ge/Si and Si concentration among different tributaries, indicating either the heterogeneity of Ge sources or the dominance of different secondary weathering reactions within different tributary catchments. We are currently investigating if Ge/Si varies with seasonal changes in runoff, which may help constrain the factors controlling Ge/Si.\nRiver water δ74Ge ranges from +3.4 to +6.5‰ among the different tributaries and is heavy relative to Bulk Silicate Earth (δ74Ge = +0.6‰3). Significant negative correlation of δ74Ge and Ge/Si suggests that both ratios may be fractionated during Ge uptake with secondary mineral precipitation. Similar (but weaker) correlation is observed for an extended dataset, including multiple U.S. rivers draining various lithologies.\nOverall, our data show that δ74Ge and Ge/Si have the potential to provide useful information on continental weathering processes and further investigation of these proxies in the critical zone is warranted.\nFroelich et al.

            "abstract": "The north margin of the rapidly-shortening, rapidly subsiding offshore and western onshore Ventura Basin is comprised of major N-dipping faults that step left. Offshore in Santa Barbara Channel, part of the shortening accommodated by the shallow Red Mountain fault is transferred farther offshore to the North Channel-Pitas Point fault system (NC-PP). We previously investigated the eastern offshore 50 km of this fault system using dense grids of industry multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) data and local grids of high resolution MCS data. Timing and rates of the observed deformation were determined by correlation to a detailed dated stratigraphy derived from piston cores that sampled seafloor outcrops back to 740 ka, as well as biostratigraphy, oxygen isotopic stratigraphy, a dated industry well-log horizon, and tephrochonology of the 639 ka Lava Creek ash. We are now continuing our interpretation of the NC-PP through its western 50 km using 2D and 3D MCS data and this previous dated seismic stratigraphy. The PP-NC is variably blind along strike, with its upper tips in places below the 1 Ma horizon and in other locations cutting up to higher levels. The blind slip is absorbed by a progressively-tilting S-dipping forelimb everywhere. Preliminary examination of cross sections through our 8 gridded, depth-converted horizons suggests that the rate of tilting has not significantly changed during the last 1 Myr, and that dips and structural relief, although variable, are not systematically greater in the east than in the west between Carpinteria and the UCSB campus at 119° 50’ W.. Farther westward, the rate of tilting, and probably the rate of offshore shortening, decreases steadily through 40 km between 120° 05’ W. and the end of the system beyond Point Conception. This trend mirrors the decrease in elevation and structural relief of the Santa Ynez Mountains above the deep fault. As in its eastern part, there is no evidence of a major change in tilt rate through the last 1 Myr in its western part. The fault bends to the northwest around Point Conception and its hanging-wall is cut by a strand of the right-lateral Hosgri fault. The NC-PP system has now been continuously mapped from onshore Ventura to west of Point Conception, a distance of ~120 km.",

This analysis provides 5 patterns of sea ice for inter-spring period and 3 patterns for summer-autumn for Antarctica (69,2% of the total variance) and 3 different patterns for summer-autumn and 3 for winter-spring season for the Arctic Ocean (67,8% of the total variance).Each of these patterns has a positive and negative phase. We used the Monthly Polar Gridded Sea Ice Concentrations database derived from satellite information generated by NASA Team algorithm. To understand the links between the SICA and climate trends, we extracted the mean pressure and, temperature field patterns for the months with high loadings (positive or negative) of the sea ice patterns that gave distinct atmospheric structures associated with each one. For Antarctica, the first SICA spatial winter-spring pattern in positive phase shows a negative SICA centre over the Drake Passage and north region of Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas together with another negative SICA centre over the East Indian Ocean. Strong positive centres over the rest of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans basins and the Amundsen Sea are also presented. A strong negative pressure anomaly covers most of the Antarctic Continent centered over the Bellingshausen Sea accompanied by three positive pressure anomalies in middle-latitudes. During recent years, the Arctic showed persistent associations of sea-ice and climate patterns principally during summer. Our strongest summer-autumn pattern in negative phase showed a marked reduction on SICA over western Arctic, primarily linked to an overall increase in Arctic atmospheric temperature most pronounced over the Beaufort, Chukchi and East Siberian Seas, and a positive anomaly of pressure over Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Sea surface temperature (SST) has been one of the most extensively observed Earth physical parameters by satellite instruments. Measurements from a diverse set of sensors, including satellite infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) data along with drifter/buoy/ship-based data, provide highly variable coverages of the SST field. For example, the microwave (MW) sensors have typically coarser 25-km resolution than the infra-red (IR) sensors which can resolve down to a 1-km scale. However, the IR-based data are prone to voids due to cloud contamination, which does not affect MW sensors nearly as much. We have combined the coarse MW data with even coarser buoy data along with the high-resolution IR data (from MODIS and AVHRR sensors) into a daily global analysis (synoptic map). Specifically, the Multi-Resolution Variational Analysis (MRVA) algorithm is used to produce the maps at different resolutions: 1km, 2km, 4km, 8km, 16km, 32km, etc. We compare these multi-resolution analyses against independent (not participating in the combination) satellite data sets including the recent 1km NPP-VIIRS and 9km AVHRR tracked (L2) data sets, with a focus on determining how well the higher resolution features are represented in the daily analysis. We have examined the mean differences between the analysis and L2 data as a function of the inherent (feature) scale of the analysis and have observed that the minimum difference (best match) tends to occur near the stated resolution of the L2 data but not at resolution higher than 4km. We also show that the mean difference generally decreases as the match-up time window for the L2 data is limited in duration from a day to its fractions (down to 3 hours) and that the length of the time window affects the finer scales progressively more. These indicate that the resolving capability of the daily analysis combining this particular set of data products is closer to 4km than 1km and that narrowing the analysis time-window can potentially improve the match-up agreement at higher resolution, given the implication that the smaller SST features tend to evolve faster than larger features. A sub-daily analysis using more L2 data sets would then be necessary to map the smaller scale features resolvable by the present-day satellite SST sensors.",

Both instruments have detected terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) via direct searches for statistically significant bursts of gamma-rays. In our new analysis, we instead identified times when the instruments were near known lightning discharges based on VLF radio data (from the Worldwide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) in the case of RHESSI and from three North American networks in the case of ADELE). We then stacked together the gamma-ray signals for each instrument, with times adjusted to be relative to the time of radio emission for each discharge (corrected for light propagation time to the spacecraft in the case of RHESSI). The resulting stacked gamma-ray time profile is sensitive to an average level of gamma-ray emission far lower than what can be recognized above background for a single TGF.\nThe summed signal from small, untriggered TGFs is remarkably weak, and preliminary evidence suggests that it comes mostly from distant, bright TGFs observed outside the main bremsstrahlung beam, not from a population of subluminous TGFs near the spacecraft. Under the assumption of a broken power-law differential distribution of TGF intensities, we find that the index must break (harden or cut off) just below the current sensitivity limit of satellites like RHESSI and Fermi, and that less than 1% of lightning can produce a TGF that belongs to the same distribution as those that are observable.",

            "abstract": "In this study, modeling of suspended sediment particle movement in extreme flows is proposed by stochastic particle tracking modeling approaches. The proposed stochastic model is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) composed of two random processes (a Wiener process and a Poisson process), and a random variable (i.e., flow magnitude) simulated by the extreme value Type I distribution. An extreme flow is defined as a hydrologic flow event (such as a flash flood) or a large flow perturbation with a low probability of occurrence and a high impact on its ambient flow environment. In the proposed particle tracking model, a random term mainly caused by fluid eddy motions is modeled as a Wiener process, while the random occurrences of a sequence of extreme flows can be modeled as a Poisson process. Following previous work by Oh and Tsai (2010)\n[1]\nand Tsai et al. (2014)\n[2]\n, this study is intended to modify the jump term, which models the abrupt changes of particle position in the extreme flow environments. It is proposed that the probabilistic magnitude of extreme events can be simulated by the extreme value type I (EV I) distribution. The ensemble mean and variance of particle trajectory can be obtained from the proposed stochastic models via simulations. Our findings suggest that the ability to consider the probabilistic magnitude of extreme events can provide a more comprehensive and realistic estimate of the uncertainty of particle movement when extreme flow events occur. It is also found that the variance of particle position may be attributed to both the random magnitudes and occurrences of particle jumps in the presence of extreme flow events. It is demonstrated from this study that the proposed model can more explicitly quantify the uncertainty of particle movement by taking into considerations both the random arrival process of extreme flows and the variability of the extreme flow magnitude.\n\n[1] Oh, J.

            "abstract": "Two-dimensional electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations are performed to investigate the emergence of electron velocity distributions with an “anisotropy gap” in the radiation belts. Such distributions have been shown to be able to excite banded chorus as anisotropic electrons with T⊥/T||>1 at different T|| , where || and ⊥ denote directions relative to the background geomagnetic field, can drive the whistler anisotropy instability in the upper- and lower-bands, independently. Energy-dependent convection and loss of the electrons in the radiation belts can generally lead to anisotropic electrons which, subsequently, excite whistler waves. As a simplification of reality, the simulations in the present study start with an electron distribution which is constantly anisotropic at all energies. The anisotropic electrons lead to growth of whistlers in the system. The enhanced waves, in turn, scatter the electrons and reduce their anisotropy. Interestingly, the reduction of anisotropy is more dramatic for electrons with intermediate energies. An anisotropy gap arises as a natural consequence of the self-consistent wave-particle interactions and, in the quasi-steady phase of the simulations, produces the banded structure in the spectrum of the enhanced whistler waves.",

            "abstract": "Vesta, the second most massive asteroid, has long been perceived as anhydrous. However, recent studies suggesting the localized presence of hydrated minerals and past sub-surface water have challenged this perception (e.g. Sarafian et al., 2013; De Sanctis et al., 2012; Prettyman et al., 2012; McCord et al. 2012; Reddy et al. 2012; Treiman et al, 2004). Herein we show evidence that transient water flowed on the surface, in a debris-flow-like process, and left distinctive geomorphologic features. Based on analysis of ~20 m/ pixel images obtained by Dawn, we identify a class of locally occurring, interconnected and curvilinear systems of gullies in the walls of young (< 100s Ma) impact craters, ending in lobate deposits near the crater floors. As curvilinear systems only occur within impact craters, we propose that they formed by a particulate-dominated transient flow of water (≤ 26 minutes) that was released from buried ice-bearing deposits by impact-induced heating. Our interpretation is in accordance with the occurrence of pitted terrain on lobate deposits and crater floors. Pitted terrain is interpreted to result from the degassing of volatiles (Denevi et al., 2012). We also identify linear gully systems, which are morphologically distinct from the curvilinear systems, and are interpreted to form by dry flow of material. Craters containing curvilinear systems are clustered in two regions of Vesta’s surface, whereas linear systems are evenly distributed. This indicates that the proposed buried ice-bearing deposits are likely localized in extent. Together with the newly expanded understanding of the distribution and behavior of water in the asteroid belt (e.g. Küppers et al., 2014; Hsieh & Jewitt, 2006), our results support the new paradigm that there is a continuum of small bodies in the solar system with many intermediate states of hydration. The varied hydrologic processes that occur within this new paradigm suggest the evolution of our solar system is more complex than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "The trade wind inversion (TWI) is a prominent feature of the climate of Hawai‘i. When the TWI is present, the vertical development of clouds is suppressed and the transport of moisture to high elevation ecosystems above the inversion on Hawai‘i’s highest mountains is inhibited. In this study, 34 years (1979-2013) of TWI data were analyzed to determine the long-term characteristics of TWI occurrence frequency and its effects on moisture regimens at high elevations for the 6-month dry and wet seasons in Hawai‘i. An assessment of linear trends in each season shows that on average, TWI occurrence frequency has increased by 6% and 5% per decade for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Application of change point analysis to the time series reveals that a prominent upward shift in TWI occurrence frequency occurred after 1990, resulting in a 15% increase in mean TWI persistence across the island chain during the most recent ~2 decades (1991 – 2013) when compared to a period preceding this shift (1973 – 1990). This change has generally coincided with decreases in precipitation at high elevations (> 1900 m), especially during the wet season. An analysis of mean precipitation from 21 high elevation stations in Hawai‘i for 1991-2013 in relation to 1973-1990 shows changes of -178 to 159 mm/season for the dry-season and -969 to -29 mm/season for the wet season. The increased persistence of the TWI and coincident decreases in precipitation can be explained by amplified subsidence within the regional Hadley cell circulation over this time period. An analysis of the vertical velocity variable, Omega, at the 500 hPa pressure level shows statistically significant average increases in subsidence of 35% (dry-season) and 28% (wet-season) for the 10˚ longitudinal band centered over the highest Hawaiian Islands (20˚ N Latitude) when these ~2-decade pre- and post-shift periods are compared.",

Despite the broad adoption of metadata standards for Earth science data, there are still heterogeneous and incompatible representations of information due to differences between the many standards in use and how each standard is applied. Federal agencies are required to manage and publish metadata in different metadata standards and formats for various data catalogs. In 2014, the NOAA National Climatic data Center (NCDC) managed metadata for its scientific datasets in ISO 19115-2 in XML, GCMD Directory Interchange Format (DIF) in XML, DataCite Schema in XML, Dublin Core in XML, and Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) in JSON, with more standards and profiles of standards planned. Of these standards, the ISO 19115-series metadata is the most complete and feature-rich, and for this reason it is used by NCDC as the source for the other metadata standards. We will discuss the capabilities of metadata standards and how these standards are being implemented to document datasets. Successful implementations include developing translations and displays using XSLTs, creating links to related data and resources, documenting dataset lineage, and establishing best practices. Benefits, gaps, and challenges will be highlighted with suggestions for improved approaches to metadata storage and maintenance.",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of earth surface processes is based on long-term empirical understandings, short-term field measurements as well as numerical models. In particular, numerical landscape evolution models (LEMs) have been developed which have the capability to capture a range of both surface (erosion and deposition), tectonics, as well as near surface or critical zone processes (i.e. pedogenesis). These models have a range of applications for understanding both surface and whole of landscape dynamics through to more applied situations such as degraded site rehabilitation. LEMs are now at the stage of development where if calibrated, can provide some level of reliability. However, these models are largely calibrated based on parameters determined from present surface conditions which are the product of much longer-term geology-soil-climate-vegetation interactions. Here, we assess the effect of the initial landscape dimensions and associated error as well as parameterisation for a potential post-mining landform design. The results demonstrate that subtle surface changes in the initial DEM as well as parameterisation can have a large impact on landscape behaviour, erosion depth and sediment discharge. For example, the predicted sediment output from LEM’s is shown to be highly variable even with very subtle changes in initial surface conditions. This has two important implications in that decadal time scale field data is needed to (a) better parameterise models and (b) evaluate their predictions. We question how a LEM using parameters derived from field plots can firstly be employed to examine long-term landscape evolution. Secondly, the potential range of outcomes is examined based on estimated temporal parameter change and thirdly, the need for more detailed and rigorous field data for calibration and validation of these models is discussed.",

            "abstract": "It is now widely recognized that superthermal electrons commonly exist with the thermal population in most space plasmas. When plasmas consisting of such electron population expand, double layers (DLs) naturally forma due to charge separation; the more mobile superthermal electrons march ahead of the thermal population, leaving a positive charge behind and generating electric fields. Under certain conditions such fields evolve into thin double layers or shocks. The double layers accelerate ions. Such double-layer formation was first invoked to explain expansion of laser produced plasmas. Since then it has been studied in laboratory experiments, and applied to (i) polar wind acceleration,(ii) the existence of low-altitude double layers in the auroral acceleration, (iii) a possible mechanism for the origination of the solar wind, (iv) the helicon double layer thrusters, and (v) the deceleration of electrons after their acceleration in solar flare events. The role of superthermal-electron driven double layers, also known as the low-altitude auroral double layers in the upward current region, in the upward acceleration of ionospheric ions is well-known. In the auroral application the upward moving superthermal electrons consist of backscattered downgoing primary energetic electrons as well as the secondary electrons. Similarly we suggest that such double layers might play roles in the acceleration of ions in the solar wind across the coronal transition region, where the superthermal electrons are supplied by magnetic reconnection events. We will present a unified theoretical view of the superthermal electron-driven double layers and their applications. We will summarize theoretical, experimental, simulation and observational results highlighting the common threads running through the various existing studies.",

            "abstract": "To establish effective emission controls to achieve National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), state air agencies need to quantify contributions to extreme ozone events from anthropogenic precursor emissions sources from a given state versus from regional and international pollution transport or from natural sources. An understanding of the meteorology and sources contributing to observed high ozone events is a first step towards assessing the impacts on surface ozone from future changes in regional climate. We analyze two Eastern U.S. (EUS) high ozone events that led to exceedances of the ozone NAAQS in multiple states: (1) June 10-18, 2007 and (2) June 24-July 14, 2012. These events are prototypes for determining source contributions and establishing a baseline for comparison with other EUS ozone pollution episodes. We (1) use daily NOAA weather maps, observed surface ozone concentrations, and satellite NO2 columns to identify regional transport and (2) analyze a series of emission perturbation simulations with the GEOS-Chem chemistry-transport model (2ºx 2.5º) to estimate contributions from several sources. We find that enhancements of the NO2 column persist for days over multiple states and are examining whether the persistence of this typically short-lived ozone precursor is due to regional transport and its contribution to the pollution event. As in other historical EUS extreme ozone events, high pressure systems facilitate regional ozone build-up during June 10-18, 2007. For example, observed surface ozone over WI is 60-85 ppb. GEOS-Chem captures the main features of the observed ozone enhancements and attributes less than 15% (~4-10 ppb) to WI anthropogenic emissions; over 50% (~32-50 ppb) to other U.S. states’ anthropogenic emissions; and greater than 10% (~10-20 ppb) to Canadian anthropogenic emissions. Similar to the 2007 event, high pressure systems dominate the EUS during the 2012 episode and the model indicates that anthropogenic U.S. sources contribute the most to the high ozone observed on these days. During the first two weeks of July, however, the region is influenced by stationary fronts. We will discuss how the changing meteorological situation influences the relative source contributions to regional ozone accumulation.",

            "abstract": "Deltas are generally classified as river-, tide-, or wave-dominated systems, but the influences of all environmental forces cannot be ignored when fully addressing the dynamics of the system. For example, in river-dominated deltas, river flow from the feeder channel acts as the primary driver of dynamics within the system by delivering water, sediment, and nutrients through the distributary channels, but tides and waves may affect their allocation within the network. There has been work on the asymmetry of environmental fluxes at bifurcations, but relatively few studies exist on the water partitioning at the network scale. Understanding the network and environmental effects on the flux of water, sediment, and nutrients would benefit delta restoration projects and management practices.\nIn this study, we investigate the allocation of water flow among the five major distributary channels at Wax Lake Delta (WLD), a micro-tidal river-dominated delta in coastal Louisiana, and the effects of tidal amplitude on distributary channel discharges. We collect and compare discharge results from acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) velocity transects between spring and neap tide and between falling and rising tide. The results show that discharges increased from spring to neap tide and from rising to falling tide. We investigate the spatial gradients of tidal influence within the network and validate hydraulic geometry relations for tidally influenced channels. Our results give insight into the control of network structure on flow partitioning and show the degree of tidal influence on channel flow in the river-dominated WLD.",

            "abstract": "Based on the difference between the orientation of the interstellar and the solar magnetic fields, there was an expectation by the community that the magnetic field direction will rotate dramatically across the heliopause (HP). Based on the radio emission, the Voyager team concluded that Voyager 1 (V1) crossed into interstellar space at the end of August 2013. The question is then why there was no significant rotation in the direction of the magnetic field across the HP. Our recent global simulations (Opher & Drake 2013) revealed that strong rotations in the direction of the magnetic field at the HP at the location of V1 (and Voyager 2) are not expected. We showed that for a wide range of orientations of BISM the angle δ = a sin(BN /B) is small (around 10◦–20◦) ahead of V1 as seen in the observations. Only after some significant distance outside the HP (~ 20AU) is the direction of the interstellar field distinguishably different from that of the Parker spiral. The field outside the HP slowly rotates with a small change (around 2 degree/AU); as seen by observations (Burlaga & Ness 2014). Here we show that the reason for the twist of the BISM to the solar direction is due to favorable locations for global reconnection on the HP. We explore of the effect of the location of the reconnection on the draping of the magnetic field and flows just outside the HP. We further explore the consequences for what Voyager 2 will encounter.",

            "abstract": "The sensitivity of the Amazon rainforests to climate change has received great attention by the scientific community due to the important role that this vegetation plays in the global carbon, water and energy cycle. The spatial and temporal variability of tropical forests across Amazonia, and their phenological, ecological and edaphic cycles are still poorly understood. The objective of this work was to infer seasonal and spatial variability of forest structure in the Brazilian Amazon based on anisotropy of multi-angle satellite observations. We used observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Terra and Aqua) processed by a new Multi-Angle Implementation Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC) to investigate how multi-angular spectral response from satellite imagery can be used to analyze structural variability of Amazon rainforests. We calculated differences acquired from forward and backscatter reflectance by modeling the bi-directional reflectance distribution function to infer seasonal and spatial changes in vegetation structure. Changes in anisotropy were larger during the dry season than during the wet season, suggesting intra-annual changes in vegetation structure and density. However, there were marked differences in timing and amplitude depending on forest type. For instance differences between reflectance hotspot and darkspot showed more anisotropy in the open Ombrophilous forest than in the dense Ombrophilous forest. Our results show that multi-angle data can be useful for analyzing structural differences in various forest types and for discriminating different seasonal effects within the Amazon basin. Also, multi-angle data could help solve uncertainties about sensitivity of different tropical forest types to light versus rainfall. In conclusion, multi-angular information, as expressed by the anisotropy of spectral reflectance, may complement conventional studies and provide significant improvements over approaches that are based on vegetation indices alone.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between lithospheric and crustal tectonics in continental regions is not entirely understood; in order to understand past and present lithospheric tectonic participation in tectonic processes, we need to image the lithosphere at terrane scale. We are developing an improved continental-scale image of the Canadian lithosphere using surface waves from distant earthquakes. Existing continental-scale models are primarily based on single-station analyses, which provide constraints on individual event-station paths and so are limited by the available seismicity in the study area; as much of Canada is essentially aseismic, such models have had limited resolution. Instead, we employ two-station measurement, in which seismograms from global earthquakes are compared between pairs of instruments; phase delays between two seismograms record structure along the path between the two stations and cancel out the contribution of the earthquake itself. We have developed a software suite that allows for efficient two-station phase velocity analysis, and will present results showing differing surface-wave dispersion responses between tectonic environments and dispersion maps of central and western Canada. One hundred and six station pairs were used to create dispersion curves of western Canada. Early tomographic inversion results show slower lithospheric velocity to the west of the Cordilleran deformation front and faster lithospheric velocity to its east. These maps also show that the position of the velocity transition varies with period, implying that the contact surface between cordillera and craton is not vertical. These measurements will ultimately be incorporated into a three-dimensional model of mantle structure for Canada as a whole.",

            "abstract": "Recently, we developed an alternative CTRW formulation which uses a \"latching\" upscaling scheme to rigorously map continuous or fine-scale stochastic solute motion onto discrete transitions on an arbitrarily coarse lattice (with spacing potentially on the meter scale or more). This approach enables model simplification, among many other things. Under advection, for example, we see that many relevant anomalous transport problems may be mapped into 1D, with latching to a sequence of successive, uniformly spaced planes. On this formulation (which we term RP-CTRW), the spatial transition vector may generally be made deterministic, with CTRW waiting time distributions encapsulating all the stochastic behavior. We demonstrate the excellent performance of this technique alongside Pareto-distributed waiting times in explaining experiments across a variety of scales using only two degrees of freedom. An interesting new application of the RP-CTRW technique is the analysis of radial (push-pull) tracer tests. Given modern computational power, random walk simulations are a natural fit for the inverse problem of inferring subsurface parameters from push-pull test data, and we propose them as an alternative to the classical type curve approach. In particular, we explore the visibility of heterogeneity through non-Fickian behavior in push-pull tests, and illustrate the ability of a radial RP-CTRW technique to encapsulate this behavior using a sparse parameterization which has predictive value.",

            "abstract": "Forested riparian zones serve many ecosystem functions from species habitat through stream shading and large woody debris recruitment, to improvements in water quality. Moreover, stream depth and bathymetry in forested environments is difficult and costly to measure in the field, but critically important for stream-dwelling organisms. Green (bathymetric) LiDAR (G-L) can be used to characterize stream bathymetry, but little is known of its ability to accurately characterize stream bathymetry in narrow (width less than 5 m), heavily forested streams. Canopy characterization with green LiDAR is also poorly understood. We compared canopy and digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from green and near-infrared LiDAR (NIR-L) to field measurements in a narrow, forested stream in Oregon, USA, as well as comparing the two canopy models and DEMs to each other along the length of the stream and to estimates of leaf area index. We observed that the canopy models from the G-L are lower in accuracy compared to NIR-L canopy models. Canopy height models from the G-L were up to 26% less accurate in dense stands, compared to the NIR-L accuracy of 94%. We attribute these errors in part to the lower quality of DEMs generated from the G-L as compared to the NIR-L DEMs. As for bathymetry, the G-L DEM was 0.05 cm higher in elevation than the field measured stream elevation, while the NIR-L ground model was 0.17mm higher. The elevation difference tended to increase with stream depth for both types of LiDAR-derived DEMs, but stream depth only explained a small portion of the variability (coefficient of determination equals 0.09 for NIR-L DEM and 0.05 for G-L DEM). Our results suggest that G-L may be limited in accurately characterizing the bathymetry of narrow streams in heavily forested environments due to difficulty penetrating canopy and interactions with complex topography.",

Located by the Penghu Submarine Canyon, the Frontal Ridge is the westernmost structural relief of the orogenic wedge which is separated from the SCS continental margin by a deformation front. The Penghu submarine canyon, which starts from the China continental shelf and cuts across the fold-and-thrust belt, may plays an important role for transporting orogenic sediments from on shore Taiwan to the deep sea South China Sea basin. In this study, high-resolution seismic data collected in the Frontal Ridge area have been analyzed, a significant variation of stratigraphic architectures with time were identified by detailed analyzing both structural and depositional characteristics. Seismic facies analysis shows that the older parallel strata were eroded and superimposed by a series of lobe-channel-levee complex, interpreted as the fan deposits of the paleo Penghu Submarine Canyon. These deposits were later deformed by a multi-stage frontal thrusting. We propose a model to show how tectonic processes change the depositional environment. During the evolution of fold-and-thrust belt, the slope gradient and sedimentation rate changed. The Frontal Ridge area was at the abyssal plain, and then changed to the continental rise environment. Finally, convergent tectonics changed this area to be part of the orogenic wedge, and frontal fold developed.",

            "abstract": "The Hayward fault (HF) in the San Francisco Bay Area, California is one of the major strands of the San Andreas fault system, extending for about 70 km. Crustal deformation along the HF is characterized by a wide variety of fault slip behaviors from aseismic creep to stick-slip earthquake including a Mw ~6.8 earthquake in 1868. We here document the high-resolution imaging of the rupture models for the recent M 3+ HF earthquakes by making use of waveforms from the Hayward Fault Network (HFN). The HFN is an array of borehole seismic instrumentation and provides an unprecedented high-resolution coverage of the earthquake source study for HF earthquakes. Using the finite-source rupture inversion with an empirical Green’s function approach, we find a variety of rupture propagations including subevents, directivity, and high stress drop. Our finite-source modeling reveals a complex slip distribution for the 2013 Mw 3.2 Orinda earthquake that is characterized by a patch of slip with a maximum slip of 4 cm concentrated near the hypocenter at about 6.6 km depth, with a large secondary patch of slip (peak slip of 2 cm) centered up-dip and southeast from the hypocenter at a distance of about 400 m away. The two subevents release 43% and 23% of the total seismic moment (6.7 x 1013 N m) and the inferred peak stress drops are 18 MPa and 10 MPa. The 2011 Mw 4.0 Berkeley and 2012 Mw 4.0 El Cerrito earthquakes are marked by high stress drop. The inferred peak and mean stress drops are about 130-165 MPa and 45 MPa, respectively, which suggests that there are locally high levels of the fault strength on the HF. Our finite-source modeling suggests that the radiation efficiency determined for these two earthquakes is very low (< 0.1) and implies that majority of energy is dissipated during the earthquake rupture process.",

            "abstract": "Considering the impacts of dams on natural hydrology and ecosystems, it is important to be able to simulate their behavior and effects in hydrological and ecological models. Overlooking human engineering of river systems may significantly affect modelling results and impact decisions addressing water management issues.\nSimulating reservoir operation at the regional and global scale remains a challenge in water resource and environmental science. There are numerous studies that model the operating rules of a single or small cluster of dams based on available observed data or that try to find an optimized set of rules for their operation based on their characteristics and intended purpose. On the other hand, there are few works that consider the operation of dams for regional and global hydrological models. One major problem in modeling dams operation in such large-scale systems is the lack of efficient algorithms for modelling reservoir operation. Depending on site-specific characteristics of the dam, its watershed and its intended purpose, each dam has a specific and optimum operating rule; as a result, effective simulation of their operation is not a trivial task when hundreds and thousands of dams exist in the area of study.\nAs part of the development of the Northeast Regional Earth System Model (NE-RESM), we are developing an integrated hydrological modeling framework that incorporates various aspects of the coupled human-hydrologic system, from supply to demand, into a single framework. We use an Artificial Neural Network to develop an accurate yet generalized daily operating rule with minimal input requirements that is suitable for use in large scale hydrological models. We implement this reservoir operating scheme into WBMplus and study how dams alter natural hydrology of the Northeastern United States. We also show how climate change impacts the operation of reservoirs and hence availability of water in the region by the end of the 21st century.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric H2S emissions are among major environmental concern associated with geothermal energy utilization. It is therefore of great importance for the geothermal power sector to reduce H2S emissions. Known solutions for H2S neutralization are both expensive and include production of elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid that needs to be disposed of. Icelandic energy companies that utilize geothermal power for electricity production have decided to try to find an environmentally friendly and economically feasible solution to reduce the H2S emission, in a joint venture called SulFix. The aim of SulFix project is to explore the possibilities of injecting H2S dissolved in water into basaltic formations in close proximity to the power plants for permanent fixation as sulfides. The formation of sulfides is a natural process in geothermal systems. Due to basalt being rich in iron and dissolving readily at acidic conditions, it is feasible to re-inject the H2S dissolved in water, into basaltic formations to form pyrite.\nTo estimate the mineralization rates of H2S, in the basaltic formation, flow through experiments in columns were conducted at various H2S concentrations, temperatures (100 – 240°C) and both fresh and altered basaltic glass.\nThe results indicate that pyrite rapidly forms during injection into fresh basalt but the precipiation in altered basalt is slower. Three different alteration stages, as a function of distance from inlet, can be observed in the column with fresh basaltic glass; (1) dissolution features along with precipitation, (2) precipitation increases, both sulfides and other secondary minerals and (3) the basalt looks to be unaltered and little if any precipitation is observed. The sulfur has precipitated in the first half of the column and thereafter the solution is possibly close to be supersaturated with respect to the rock.\nThese results indicate that the H2S sequestration into basalt is possible under geothermal conditions. The rate limiting step is the availability of iron released from the dissolving rock. The rapid precipitation of secondary phases in the column suggests the possibility of decreased porosity in the vicinity of the injection well.",

            "abstract": "The aqueous reaction of methylglyoxal (MG) with ammonium sulfate has been suggested as a source of atmospheric ``brown carbon.'' We have utilized high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry to study the products of this reaction at high concentrations. The overall product spectrum shows a large number of distinct components; however, the visible absorption from this mixture is derived a very small number of components. The largest contributor is an imine-substituted (C=N-H) product of aldol condensation/facile dehydration reaction between the parent MG and a hydrated product of the MG + ammonia reaction. The asymmetric nature of this compound relative to the aldol condensation of two MG results in a sufficiently large redshift of the UV absorption spectrum that absorption of visible radiation can occur in the long-wavelength tail. The simplicity of the imine products is a result of a strong bias toward ketimine products due to the extensive hydration of the aldehydic moiety in the parent in aqueous solution. In addition, a strong pH dependence of the absorption cross section was observed with significantly greater absorption under more basic conditions. We have performed time-dependent density functional theory calculations to evaluate the absorption spectra of all of the possible condensation products and their respective ions, and the results are consistent with the experimental observations. We have also observed smaller concentrations of other condensation products of the imine-substituted parent species that do not contribute significantly to the visible absorption but have not been previously discussed.",

            "abstract": "Glacial-interglacial cycles are responsible for the largest natural perturbations in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) over the past million years. Ice cores from Antarctica document a two-part rise in atmospheric CO2 by nearly 80 ppm during the last glacial termination in phase with southern hemisphere warm events. Although the source and cause of the rise in atmospheric CO2 remains a mystery, the rapid decrease in the 13C and radiocarbon signature of atmospheric carbon in sync with southern hemisphere warming provides key constraints [Monnin et al., 2001; Lourantau et al., 2010]. These data have led to the hypothesis that carbon accumulated in the abyssal Southern Ocean during glacial periods. Extensive sea ice and/or northward shifted westerly winds reduced upwelling and mixing of the carbon-rich deep waters to the surface ocean under glacial conditions, effectively isolating large volumes of carbon from the atmosphere. If correct, during glacial terminations we expect to find evidence for pulses of old carbon to the Southern Ocean surface and intermediate waters (SOIW) as the climate warmed.\nRadiocarbon measurements on benthic foraminifera provide direct evidence for the presence or absence of old carbon in intermediate and deep water masses. We add to a growing dataset of benthic foraminiferal radiocarbon data from sites bathed by SOIWs during the last glacial termination by evaluating the radiocarbon age of coeval benthic and planktic foraminifera in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP). We find definitive evidence for a sustained input of old carbon to SOIWs during the Younger Dryas and pulses of old carbon during Heinrich Stadial 1. The magnitude and timing of the benthic radiocarbon excursions in our record are comparable to those measured previously at intermediate depths near Baja [Marchitto et al., 2007] but are significantly less depleted than measurements made at a neighboring site in the Galapagos Islands: we record a minimum Δ14C of -310‰ versus the nearly -600‰ measured by Stott et al. [2009]. Our record is strikingly similar in structure to a benthic 14C record from the Southeast Pacific [Bryan, 2010], just below the site of SOIW formation, which thus provides support for a Southern Ocean source of old carbon to the EEP and atmosphere during the last glacial termination.",

However, this process raise concerns owed of the unintended effects of such interventions, like land use displacements. Here we explore an innovative modeling approach for the Amazon in order to simulate how the global demand for agricultural commodities and different regional land use policies could affect future deforestation trends inside and outside the Amazon, paying special attention to leakage effects over the Cerrado. A global economic model was taken to integrate supply and demand factors at both global and regional scales, coupled with a spatially explicitly land use model. Leakage effects are simulated in two different ways, regarding land demand and land allocation, based on the relative land rents of different land use types and spatial regression. Six contrasting multi-scale scenarios are explored focusing on deforestation rates and spatial pattern analysis. Our results unveil that Amazon conservation might not be the end of deforestation in Brazil once it can lead to 70% increase over the Cerrado cleared area up to 2050. Biofuels targets compliance can further press land cover changes over these regions revealing that productivity gains will be decisive for both Amazon and Cerrado conservation. In summary, closing the agricultural frontier in the Amazon cannot ensure biodiversity conservation or carbon savings in absence of complementary measures committed with land use efficiency, controlled land use expansion and new economic alternatives.",

            "abstract": "Totten Glacier, East Antarctica is one of the largest glaciers in Antarctica, draining an area of 5.3*105 km2 and containing ice at an equivalent 9 m sea level rise. Lidar/radar altimetry data from 2003-2009 suggests that the glacier is thinning. Thinning is concentrated in areas of fast flow and therefore indicative of changes in ice dynamics. Here, we employ time series of ice velocity from ERS-1/2, RADARSAT-1, LANDSAT-7, ALOS PALSAR, TanDEM/TerraSAR-X and COSMO-Skymed to measure the glacier velocity from 1996 till present. We find significant temporal changes in ice velocity, especially in 1996-2007, followed by a period of slow decrease in 2010-2013. Comparing the results with RACMO2 surface mass balance in the interior suggests that the glacier mass balance was already negative in 1996 and became more negative into the 2000s. The resulting mass loss and stretching of the ice is compatible with the 1.5 m/yr thinning detected by the radar altimeters near the grounding zone. The grounding zone of the glacier includes a vast 15 km long ice plain where the glacier is only grounded a few 10m above hydrostatic equilibrium. We detect a retreat of the region of partial floatation with time, but not solid migration of the grounding line of the glacier. Inverted bathymetry results from gravity data collected offshore suggest the presence of a paleo subglacial channel conducive to the transfer of surface ocean heat, likely diluted circumpolar deep water, whose transfer to the ice shelf cavity may have affected the glacier stability. We suggest that further transfer of ocean heat to the ice shelf could trigger a rapid glacier retreat in this region.",

            "abstract": "The long-wavelength non-hydrostatic geoid provides a strong constraint on the radial viscosity structure of Earth’s mantle. Past studies of mantle radial viscosity structure have generally imposed a substantial amount of prior information on the profile, such as prescribing the number of constant-viscosity layers and setting boundaries between layers having different viscosity to coincide with depths of major seismic discontinuities (e.g. at 410 and 660 km depth). We use transdimensional, Bayesian inversion to infer mantle viscosity structures that are compatible with seismic tomographic models and observations of the non-hydrostatic geoid. The strength of the transdimensional approach is that the number of layers and depths of layer interfaces need not be specified at the outset and that an ensemble of solutions is obtained, representing a range of possible mantle viscosity structures consistent with the observational constraints provided by the geoid. We solve the equations of conservation of mass and momentum for a Newtonian fluid together with Poisson’s equation for the gravitational potential via propagator matrices. We calculate the geoid predicted for each trial viscosity structure, and we use density anomalies inferred from seismic velocity variations in the VS tomographic model SEMUCB-WM1 and the SMEAN average of tomographic models. We present results using both a constant velocity-to-density conversion factor as well as depth-dependent conversion factors based on self-consistent, thermodynamically-based predictions for pyrolitic mantle mineral assemblages. We find evidence for the existence of a low viscosity layer separating the upper and lower mantle, as well as for an increase in mantle viscosity at c. 1000 km depth. The viscosity profile we obtain has important implications for mantle convection, consistent with the apparent stagnation of slabs and deflection of plumes seen in the latest generation of global VP and VS tomographic models.",

However, the extent to which patterns can be empirically predicted across Canada and the northern United States (US) has not been fully articulated. This study focuses on creation of empirically derived δ18O precipitation (δ18Oppt) isoscapes at a monthly frequency across the study domain utilizing CNIP (Canadian Network for Isotopes in Precipitation) and USNIP (United States Network for Isotopes in Precipitation) measurements. Five regionalization approaches are used to separate the study domain into isotope zones to explore the effect of spatial grouping on empirical model parameterization and performance.\nTime series simulations are evaluated at CNIP and USNIP stations, and model structure uncertainty and prediction bounds are assessed. Results show models are able to capture the annual cycle in observed δ18Oppt at Arctic and eastern stations, despite the large variability in observations. Arctic models have relatively simplistic parameterizations, with precipitable water and latitude consistently explaining the largest portions of δ18Oppt variability, suggesting fewer complicating factors influencing precipitation isotopes in northern latitudes. The eastern region requires more complex model parameterizations but still performs well, likely due to interannual consistency in this area. The continental west and north-west show less agreement between models, overall poorer model performance, and higher prediction uncertainty, suggesting more complex isotope-climate relations. This is the initial step towards empirically derived time-series δ18Oppt for iso-hydrological modelling; however results can provide insight into processes driving spatial and temporal δ18Oppt variability in Canada and the northern US, contributing to improved use of paleoprecipitation archives as indicators of hydro-climate variability.",

The presentation focuses on the American Sector response to the storm period since the majority of TEC data are from North and South America. We compare the ionosphere, neutral winds, and electric fields of the quiet day with the storm day and successive days after the storm and the stability characteristics of the low-latitude ionosphere based on the conditions generated by the model-data inversions. The calculated growth rates of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and the collisional shear instability will be compared for the days prior, during, and after the magnetic storm.",

            "abstract": "Terra marks its 15th year on orbit with an array of accomplishments and the potential to do much more. Efforts continue to extend the Terra data record to make its data more valuable by creating a record length to examine interannual variability, observe trends on the decadal scale, and gather statistics relevant to climate metrics. Continued data from Terra’s complementary instruments will play a key role in creating the data record needed for scientists to develop an understanding of our climate system. Terra’s suite of instruments: ASTER (contributed by the Japanese Ministry of Economy and Trade and Industry with a JPL-led US Science Team), CERES (NASA LaRC – PI), MISR (JPL – PI), MODIS (NASA GSFC), and MOPITT (sponsored by Canadian Space Agency with NCAR-led Science Team) are providing an unprecedented 81 core data products. The annual demand for Terra data remains with >120 million files distributed in 2011 and >157 million in 2012. More than 1,100 peer-reviewed publications appeared in 2012 using Terra data bringing the lifetime total >7,600. Citation numbers of 21,000 for 2012 and over 100,000 for the mission’s lifetime.\nThe power of Terra is in the high quality of the data calibration, sensor characterization, and the complementary nature of the instruments covering a range of scientific measurements as well as scales. The broad range of products enable the community to provide answers to the overarching question, “How is the Earth changing and what are the consequences for life on Earth?” Terra continues to provide data that: (1) Extend the baseline of morning-orbit collections; (2) Enable comparison of measurements acquired from past high-impact events; (3) Add value to recently-launched and soon-to-be launched missions, and upcoming field programs. Terra data continue to support monitoring and relief efforts for natural and man-made disasters that involve U.S. interests. Terra also contributes to Applications Focus Areas supporting the U.S. National Objectives for agriculture, air quality, climate, disaster management, ecological forecasting, public health, water resources, and weather.",

            "abstract": "The seismicity of Bhutan is characterized by the apparent lack of great earthquakes and a significantly lower activity compared to most other parts of the Himalayan arc. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of this anomalously low activity and to relate it with possible along-strike differences in the structure of the orogenic belt, a temporary network with 38 broadband seismometers was installed in the Kingdom of Bhutan between January 2013 and April 2014.\nIn this work we present a first catalog of local and regional earthquakes detected and located with the GANSSER (Geodynamics ANd Seismic Structure of the Eastern-Himalaya Region) network. Events were automatically detected using STA/LTA triggers with a global 1-D velocity model. A subset of more than 800 automatic locations were manually reviewed and more than 400 events in Bhutan and surrounding regions have been manually repicked and accurately relocated. Magnitudes of these hypocenters range from ML 0.5 to 5.6. Seismicity along the Main Frontal and Main Boundary Thrusts in south-central Bhutan is very low. The highest activity is clustered along a NE-SW oriented structure in southwest Bhutan, which might be associated with the Goalpara lineament. In eastern Bhutan a cluster of seismicity is identified in the vicinity of the 2009 Mw=6.2 event and the embayment of the Main Central Thrust, near the town of Mongar.\nFor two events in Bhutan a moment tensor was derived. Both solutions indicate strike-slip mechanisms and an Mw of 3.9 and 4.0. The majority of well-constrained focal depths ranges between 10 to 30 km and might be associated with the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). One exception is the Mw=4.0 event in northern Bhutan in June 2013, which occurred at about 70 km depth, most likely in the underthrusting Indian lower crust.\nTo further improve the accuracy of locations, about 100 events were used to simultaneously invert for seismic velocities and hypocenters. We will discuss possible seismotectonic models for Bhutan based on the relocated seismicity, focal mechanisms, seismic velocities, and interfaces (Moho and intra-crustal structures like the MHT) imaged by receiver functions.",

The participating models were NCEP/CFSv1&2, GFDL/CM2.2, NCAR/U.Miami/COLA/CCSM3, NASA/GEOS5, IRI/ ECHAM-a & ECHAM-f in the first year of the real time NMME forecast. Two Canadian coupled models CMC/CanCM3 and CM4 joined in and CFSv1 and IRI’s models dropped out in the second year. The NMME team at CPC collects monthly means of three variables, precipitation, temperature at 2m and sea surface temperature from each modeling center on a 1x1 global grid, removes systematic errors, makes the grand ensemble mean in equal weight for each model mean and probability forecast with equal weight for each member of each model. This provides the NMME forecast locked in schedule for the CPC operational seasonal and monthly outlook. The basic verification metrics of seasonal and monthly prediction of NMME are calculated as an evaluation of skill, including both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts for the 3-year real time (August, 2011- July 2014) period and the 30-year retrospective forecast (1982-2011) of the individual models as well as the NMME ensemble. The motivation of this study is to provide skill benchmarks for future improvements of the NMME seasonal and monthly prediction system. We also want to establish whether the real time and hindcast periods (used for bias correction in real time) are consistent. The experimental phase I of the project already supplies routine guidance to users of the NMME forecasts.",

In this work, we explore the distribution of activation energies upon implantation and the associated hydrogen-retention times; this for comparison with recent observation of OH on the lunar surface. We apply a Monte Carlo approach: for simulated solar wind protons at a given local time, we assume a distribution of U values with a central peak, Uc and width, Uw, and derive the fraction retained for long periods in the near-surface. We find that surfaces characterized by a distribution with predominantly large values of U (> 1 eV) like that expected at defect sites will retain implanted Hs (to likely form OH). Surfaces with the distribution predominantly at small values of U (< 0.2 eV) will quickly diffuse away implanted Hs. However, surfaces with a large portion of implantation activation energies between 0.3 eV < U < 0.9 eV will tend to be H-retentive in cool conditions but transform into H-emissive surfaces when warmed (as when the surface rotates into local noon). These mid-range activation energies give rise to a diurnal effect with diffusive loss of H at noontime.",

            "abstract": "Phosphorus is a geologically important element making up approximately 0.12 % of the Earth’s crust. It is commonly found as relatively insoluble apatite and this causes phosphorus to be a limiting nutrient in biologic processes. Despite this, phosphorus is a key element in DNA, RNA and other cellular materials. Recent works suggest that reduced phosphorus played a substantial role in the development of life on the early Earth. Reduced phosphorus is considerably more soluble than oxidized phosphorus, and reduced phosphorus may continue to play a role in biologic productivity. This study examines a new methodology for quantification of reduced phosphorus separated by coupled HPLC – ICP-MS. We show that phosphorus species (P1+, P3+ and P5+) are cleanly separated in the HPLC and coupled with the ICP-MS reaction cell (using O2 gas) effectively convert elemental P to P-O producing lower background and flatter baseline chromatography. Results suggest very low detection limits (0.05 mM) for P species analyzed as P-O at M/Z = 47. Additionally this technique has potential to speciate at least 5 other metastable forms of phosphorus. We verified this method on numerous materials including leached Archean rocks to suburban retention pond waters and many samples show small but detectible levels of reduced phosphorus. These data highlight a significant role of redox processing of phosphorus throughout the history of the Earth, with the reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds, phosphite and hypophosphite, potentially acting as significant constituents in the anaerobic environment.",

            "abstract": "During summer 2013 USCGC Healy cruise 1302 surveyed and cored between Barrow, AK and the mouth of Amundsen Gulf, far to the east in the Beaufort Sea. Holocene deposition rates on the continental slope are high in the eastern Chukchi Sea and are lower farther east where deglacial sediments dominate. This is evident in CHIRP seismic data that trace two groups of reflectors as the sub-bottom depth between them increases. On the slope, at ~700 m w.d. near the mouth of the Mackenzie River, a pair of piston cores make a composite sequence 17 m long. The lower 4 m are sandy and capped by a maximum in magnetic susceptibility (ms) and a prominent reflector. N. pachyderma is too rare in this interval for 14C dates, but the d18-O of this species is as low as late Holocene. Above the reflector, counts of IRD are low, d18-O continues low, and the sediment is an acoustically transparent 7 m thick unit. The deepest date is 12.8 conv. 14C kyr at 13 m, and 3 overlying dates indicate the transparent unit accumulated at 8 m/14C kyr. The top of this unit is marked by the upper reflector that is in detail a triplet that corresponds to triple peaks in ms, grainsize, and IRD abundance. Between the two oldest sub-peaks of this reflector, d18-O reaches minimum values of ~1‰, or about 0.5‰ lower than late Holocene. In contrast to the deeper interval, this event is only 0.5 m thick and is dated to 11,050 conv. 14C kyr. Following this event, d18-O increases abruptly and then gradually decreases within the Holocene, more like a typical isotope stratigraphy. Overall, 9 dates indicate a gradual down-core increase in sedimentation rates from 9 cm/kyr in the late Holocene to the extreme of the deeper transparent unit with no age reversals. Using the modern Beaufort Sea Delta R (DR; 436 yrs), our oldest date calibrates to 13.8 ka, a little too old to be the cause of the Younger Dryas. However, the combined seismic, isotope, and sedimentological data suggest that at least the older transparent unit is consistent with a flood deposit associated with the YD, and a DR of ~1100 yrs would bring the two into line. Here we will explore these data as well as underway studies including XRF and apparent ventilation ages of slope waters that may give some insight into DR.",

            "abstract": "The Fraser River is one of British Columbia's most diverse and valuable ecosystems. Water levels and temperatures along the Fraser are seasonally variable, with high flow during the spring freshet and low flow during winter months. The Fraser River is affected by urbanization and agriculture in the Fraser Valley, and mountain pine beetle and logging in other areas. Biological oxygen demand (BOD) is an indicator of water quality in freshwater environments as it measures the amount of oxygen consumed by bacteria during the decomposition of organic matter, relative to the total available dissolved oxygen (DO). We found BOD of the Fraser River at Fort Langley was higher in the summer than winter, but no relationship between BOD and nutrient concentration (NH4, NO2+NO3, PO4). There did appear to be a positive correlation between BOD and turbidity. There is increased agricultural input into the river in the summer: increasing dissolved organic matter (DOM) and coarse and fine particulate organic matter, as well, turbidity increases during the spring freshet. The Fraser River plume contributes to Strait of Georgia algal blooms. These blooms can occur as early as March and end as late as September. The algal bloom in the Georgia Strait does not correlate to nutrient levels in the river, but is more closely related to river turbidity and dissolved organic matter (DOM). It is predicted this algal bloom will become more prominent as the sediment and DOM levels increase in the Fraser River due to the loss of forests in the watershed from the Mountain pine beetle.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) is used in many studies to reconstruct the isotopic composition of ancient seawater sulfate and to infer stages in the development of Earth’s oxygenated atmosphere. CAS is acid extractable and commonly is referred to as structurally substituted sulfate in carbonate minerals. Several recent studies, however, have raised concerns about sulfate overprinting during early or late diagenesis, including contamination by modern secondary atmospheric sulfate (SAS) and by sulfide oxidation during laboratory processing. To test for overprinting and contamination, we studied the isotopic composition of sulfate in a bedded carbonate succession of the Neoproterozoic Lantian Formation, South China. Materials were obtained from a drilling core (635Ma- 551Ma). Water-leachable sulfate (WLS), acid-leachable sulfate (ALS, i. e. extracted CAS), and chromium-reducible sulfur (CRS) were sequentially extracted out and triple oxygen isotopic compositions of WLS and ALS were analyzed as well as sulfur isotope of WLS, ALS, and CRS. We also analyzed the oxygen isotope of sulfate resulting from pyrite oxidation at a condition similar to the extraction of WLS and ALS in the laboratory and the δ18O value is at ~ –1.4‰ (VSMOW). The slightly negative ∆17O values of all WLS and ALS indicates that the ALS was not contaminated by sulfate of modern SAS. The WLS from the first 24 hours with consistently negative values of δ18O (about –11.0‰) and low δ34S values (about +5‰) suggests that the WLS resulted from sulfide oxidation in water with very negative δ18O values, likely glacial melt-water in the distant past, which had likely soaked the whole stratigraphy of Lantian Formation for a long time. The WLS also comprised a significant fraction of ALS because both δ18O and δ34S of ALS have wide ranges, from –6.9 to +15.8‰, and +12.7 to +31.7‰, respectively. More importantly, there is a strong positive correlation between δ18O and δ34S of ALS. Our findings demonstrate that extracted CAS can be overprinted or contaminated by secondary sulfate during later diagenetic process. In addition, combining the triple oxygen isotope with sulfur isotope of WLS and ALS is a critical tool for unraveling the nature of CAS.",

Measuring & modelling these processes would help quantify the amount, timing, & preservation of these materials, providing insight into the morphodynamics of lowland fluvial systems in response to sea level change.\nWe investigated the infilling dynamics of the Fly and Strickland Rivers, Papua New Guinea. Field data include: 14C dated deep cores recording base level evolution over the Holocene, sonar imaging of floodbasin stratigraphy, and the observations of blocked valley lakes and weathered erosional remnants from LGM conditions. Similar research was conducted on the Mekong River, Cambodia, where we have imaged basin fill stratigraphy and recorded the extent of blocked valley lakes. Such field data provide tantalizing empirical glimpses into the landscapes & flux buffering exhibited by large tropical rivers during glacial-interglacial transitions.\n  We upscale our observations by modelling river system evolution, employing a GpU Lowland Landscape Evolution Model (GULLEM) to predict the evolution of the entire basin. A novel & powerful (>10 Tflops on an inexpensive computer) simulator, GULLEM models morphodynamics and estimates the accommodation space subsequently infilled during marine transgressions by representing a range of geomorphic processes, including: river & tributary incision, non-linear diffusion, sea level and isostatic change, hydraulic geometry, tectonic deformation, sediment production, transport & deposition, & tracking of the resulting stratigraphy. GULLEM's vectorized approach allows for massively parallel operation on GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit), making it practical to model coupled fluvial-landscape evolution for complex lowland river systems over large temporal and spatial scales.\n  Our combined approach affords estimates for the timing and budgets of sediment and carbon storage in Fly and Mekong River floodplains in response to sea level rise. This presentation will provide insights (& animations) illustrating river morphodynamics & resulting landscapes formed during the transgressions from glacial maximums to high-stand conditions.

A complete picture of how and where events originate in all seasons paves the way for statistical forecasting and simulation of extreme precipitation. We present a data driven methodology applicable to large geographic regions that can partition heterogeneous areas into subregions and then characterize the moisture delivery mechanisms for each subregion under specific climate regimes (e.g., ENSO phases, PDO, etc.) and in each season. Extreme subregions are defined using a new nonparametric extreme value clustering method and moisture delivery characterization is done using the HYSPLIT storm backtracking algorithm. We apply this methodology to the Western United States where the nature of extreme events varies widely due to complex terrain, teleconnections and climate interactions.",

            "abstract": "The land-surface models do not mechanistically resolve hydrodynamic processes within the tree. The Finite-Elements Tree-Crown Hydrodynamics model version 2 (FETCH2) is based on the pervious FETCH model approach, but with finite difference numerics, and simplified single-beam conduit system. FETCH2 simulates water flow through the tree as a simplified system of porous media conduits. It explicitly resolves spatiotemporal hydraulic stresses throughout the tree’s vertical extent that cannot be easily represented using other stomatal-conductance models. Empirical equations relate water potential at the stem to stomata conductance at leaves connected to the stem (through unresolved branches) at that height. While highly simplified, this approach bring some realism to the simulation of stomata conductance because the stomata can respond to stem water potential, rather than an assumed direct relationship with soil moisture, as is currently the case in almost all models. By enabling mechanistic simulation of hydrological traits, such as xylem conductivity, conductive area per DBH, vertical distribution of leaf area and maximal and minimal water content in the xylem, and their effect of the dynamics of water flow in the tree system, the FETCH2 modeling system enhanced our understanding of the role of hydraulic limitations on an experimental forest plot short-term water stresses that lead to tradeoffs between water and light availability for transpiring leaves in forest ecosystems. FETCH2 is particularly suitable to resolve the effects of structural differences between tree and species and size groups, and the consequences of differences in hydraulic strategies of different species. We leverage on a large dataset of sap flow from 60 trees of 4 species at our experimental plot at the University of Michigan Biological Station. Comparison of the sap flow and transpiration patterns in this site and an undisturbed control site shows significant difference in hydraulic strategies between species which affect their response to the disturbance. We used FETCH2 to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the total stand-level transpiration to the inter-specific differences in hydraulic strategies and used the results to reflect on the future trajectory of the forest, in terms of species composition and transpiration.",

            "abstract": "The adjoint of the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ) is used to map emissions that contribute to air pollution at receptors of interest. Adjoint tools provide an efficient way to calculate the sensitivity of a model response to a large number of model inputs, a task that would require thousands of simulations using a more traditional forward sensitivity approach. Initial applications of this technique, demonstrated here, are to benzene and directly-emitted diesel particulate matter, for which atmospheric reactions are neglected. Emissions of these pollutants are strongly influenced by light-duty gasoline vehicles and heavy-duty diesel trucks, respectively.\nWe study air quality responses in three receptor areas where populations have been identified as especially susceptible to, and adversely affected by air pollution. Population-weighted air basin-wide responses for each pollutant are also evaluated for the entire San Francisco Bay area. High-resolution (1 km horizontal grid) emission inventories have been developed for on-road motor vehicle emission sources, based on observed traffic count data. Emission estimates represent diurnal, day of week, and seasonal variations of on-road vehicle activity, with separate descriptions for gasoline and diesel sources.\nEmissions that contribute to air pollution at each receptor have been mapped in space and time using the adjoint method. Effects on air quality of both relative (multiplicative) and absolute (additive) perturbations to underlying emission inventories are analyzed. The contributions of local versus upwind sources to air quality in each receptor area are quantified, and weekday/weekend and seasonal variations in the influence of emissions from upwind areas are investigated. The contribution of local sources to the total air pollution burden within the receptor areas increases from about 40% in the summer to about 50% in the winter due to increased atmospheric stagnation. The effectiveness of control strategies based on region-wide exposure metrics is compared with strategies that focus on improving air quality at specific receptors.",

Science observations began October 23, 2013 and continued until minutes prior to the planned disposal of the LADEE spacecraft on April 18, 2014 (UTC). Over the course of the mission the UVS instrument made a series of systematic observations, including lunar limb stares at both terminators and about local noon, targeted activities, including anti-sun sodium tail observations, north/south limb stares, solar extinction measurements, and instrument calibrations.\nInitial analysis of these observations have resulted in temporal and spatial mapping of key exosphere species, such as sodium and potassium, and the detection of several previously-undetected species. Sodium and potassium show variations in concentration across both a single lunation and longer semi-annual periods. These changes are likely due to a response to micro-meteoroidal and solar wind fluxes as well as spatial variations in surface composition. Tentative detections of Ti, Si, Mg, O, Al and He+ have been made. Observations in search of dust, including limb and occultation activities, have provided high signal-to-noise spectra that show variations in extinction and light scattering possibly due to exospheric dust.\nThis talk will provide an overview of UVS results, with an emphasis on the sodium and potassium observations.",

Unfortunately, AMSR-E data collection ended in October 2011 due to a problem with the rotation of the antenna. After investigation, it was deemed safe to turn the sensor back on, but at a rotation rate of only 2 rpm. This yielded only limited data compared to the nominal operational rate of 40 rpm. However, though degraded, the AMSR-E sensor was able to provide valuable (albeit limited) overlap data with which to intercalibrate AMSR2. For sea ice, AMSR2 brightness temperatures were regressed with AMSR-E at overlap locations for January to December 2013. The full year of overlap allows investigation of any potential seasonal effects, which may be particularly relevant in high latitude regions. Based on the regressions, the AMSR2 brightness temperatures were adjusted to be consistent with the NASA Team 2 algorithm parameters for AMSR-E. This will allow a consistent climate record of enhanced sea ice concentration information from 2002 through the present and into the future. While not as long as other passive microwave sea ice time series from the SMMR-SSM/I-SSMIS record, the higher spatial resolution and other improvements in the AMSR sensors, along with an enhanced algorithm provide considerably improved sea ice fields that yield greater accuracy and improved details within the ice cover.",

Joint analyses of seismic velocity with attenuation anomalies can significantly reduce the non-uniqueness in the interpretation of velocity images and result in a better understanding of the Earth's interior structure, composition, and dynamics. Employing a Bayesian approach with a common spectrum simultaneous inversion for attenuation factors (Gao, 1997), we have processed over 14,000 teleseismic body-wave seismograms recorded by all publicly available broadband seismic stations in the western and central United States. Preliminary results show extensive low-attenuation areas beneath the central United States probably related to fragments of the ancient Farallon slab, while less pronounced regions of likely cold material underlie the Colorado Plateau. High-attenuation anomalies are discovered in association with the Snake River Plain and the Rio Grande Rift. We apply station-averaged parameters and P-S attenuation ratios and compare our findings with published shear-wave splitting results to examine the presence of partial melt and asthenospheric upwelling. Additionally, we examine the azimuthal variation of attenuation measurements to constrain the possible existence of attenuation anisotropy and attempt to constrain the source depth of anisotropy through tomographic methods.

And whereas “only” a hundred million people died in the 20th century from smoking, we are presently on a pace to have several times that toll in the present century. Much of that catastrophe would not be possible without a massive campaign of disinformation. The cigarette industry pioneered many of the black arts of disinformation, cleverly exploiting the inherent skepticism of science to claim that “more research” was needed to resolve a purported “cigarette controversy.” Cigarette makers funded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of “distraction research,” most of which was solid empirical science but off topic, focusing on basic biology and biochemistry, viral and genetic causes of disease, and other “cigarette friendly” topics. At least ten Nobel prizes were the result. Cigarette skepticism was thus more complex than we normally imagine: the tobacco industry corrupted science by funding “alternative causation,” meaning anything that could be used to draw attention away from cigarettes as a source of disease. The cigarette industry by this means became the most important source of academic corruption since the Nazi era. That corruption has also helped forge other forms of denialism and corruption on a global scale.",

            "abstract": "The exchange of water, sediment and nutrients between a river and its floodplain can significantly alter the fluvial flux towards the ocean. The flux of water and sediment from the active river channel to the floodplain during overbank flows can considerably reduce peak water discharge downstream and store large volumes of sediment. On the other hand floodplains can serve as short-term reservoirs of water, increasing base flow discharge following a flood event. For sediment, floodplains can serve as longer-term reservoirs, affecting the sediment flux as a function of river migration and flooding frequency. The effect of these relatively local processes can propagate downstream, potentially effecting riverine fluxes, especially in larger river systems. Here we present a floodplain module within our spatially and temporally explicit global riverine model (WBMsed v.2). The module predicts daily water and sediment exchange between the active river channel and its floodplain. Given the large spatial scale (and resulting resolution) of our predictions (6 arc-min) the floodplain module is based on simple estimations of bankfull discharge for every river location globally. During flood events, when daily-simulated water discharge is to “exceed” overbank flow, excess water and sediment will be routed to the floodplain. After the flood, water will be re-injected to the river when simulated water discharge is lower than bankfull discharge. These returning waters can transport sediment from the floodplain but here we assume that all the sediment transported during a flood event will be deposited on the floodplain. This will allow us to estimate floodplain sedimentation rates. Our results show that the WBMsed water discharge simulations significantly improved when introducing the floodplain reservoir module. Here we present our modeling approach, results and future developments.",

Multiple sediment cores resemble a very similar inclination pattern for the past 4000 years. This demonstrates the high potential of inclination to compare records over the Tibetan Plateau and eventually date other Tibetan records stratigraphically. Comparisons to an existing record from Nam Co, a lake 350 km west of Tangra Yumco, a varve dated record from the Makran Accretionary Wedge, and a stack record from East Asia reveal many similarities.

            "abstract": "The development of numerical wave models for coastal applications, including coupling with ocean circulation models, has spurred an on-going effort on theoretical foundations, numerical techniques and physical parameterizations. Some important aspects of this effort are reviewed here, and results are shown in different settings including the French Atlantic, Hawaii and U.S. West Coast, using version 4.18 of the WAVEWATCH III® modelling framework. Compared to previous results, the model errors have been strongly reduced thanks to, among other things, the introduction of currents, coastal reflection,\nand bottom sediment types. This last item allowed unprecedented accuracy at some sites along the French Atlantic coast. The adequate resolution, necessary to represent strong gradients in tidal currents,\nwas made possible by the efficiency brought by unstructured grids. A further increase in resolution, necessary to resolve surf zones and still cover vast regions is now made possible by the use of implicit schemes. First results with that scheme are presented here and should be made available in a future version 5.xx of WAVEWATCH III.",

            "abstract": "Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, and locates an information resource (e.g., data). It is often coarsely described as data about data, and documents information such as what was measured, by whom, when, where, and how it was sampled, analyzed, with what instruments. Metadata is inherent to ensure the survivability and accessibility of the data into the future. With the rapid expansion of biological response ocean acidification (OA) studies, the lack of a common metadata template to document such type of data has become a significant gap for ocean acidification data management efforts. In this paper, we present a metadata template that can be applied to a broad spectrum of OA studies, including those studying the biological responses of organisms on ocean acidification. The “variable metadata section”, which includes the variable name, observation type, whether the variable is a manipulation condition or response variable, and the biological subject on which the variable is studied, forms the core of this metadata template. Additional metadata elements, such as principal investigators, temporal and spatial coverage, platforms for the sampling, data citation are essential components to complete the template. We explain the structure of the template, and define many metadata elements that may be unfamiliar to researchers. For that reason, this paper can serve as a user’s manual for the template.",

It was found both temperature and duration times had significant effect on the biochar’s physiochemical properties, speciation and bioavailability of Zn. The ash content and pH increased as temperature and duration time increased, whereas the biochars yield decreased with the increasing temperature. Pyrolysis process increased the biochar surface area with biochars produced at 500 oC showing the greatest surface area at 43.02 and 32.79 m2/g for duration times of 1 and 2 h, respectively. While a further increase in pyrolysis >500 oC decreased the surface area, SEM analysis showed that the biochars produced at 500 oC had the most developed pore structure. Zn was concentrated through pyrolysis, and the pyrolysis process stabilized Zn by transforming acid-soluble species into relatively stable forms. EDTA sodium had higher biochar Zn extraction efficiency than that of citric acid, CaCl2 and NaOAc. The final phytotoxicity test based on plant response indicated that the application of antibiotic residue and resultant biochars had significant adverse effect on the ryegrass growth. The phytotoxicity decreased for the biochars produced with higher pyrolysis temperature and longer duration time, which reveals the stabilization of Zn during pyrolysis treatment. These results are useful for designing an environmental friendly means for disposing the Zn-rich antibiotic residue.",

            "abstract": "Water quality studies that quantify sediment and fecal bacteria loading commonly focus on suspended contaminants transported during high flows. Fecal contaminants in bed sediments are typically ignored and need to be considered because of their potential to increase pathogen loadings during high flows that produce bed load transport. Water (containing suspended sediment) and bed load samples (n = 145 & n = 28, respectively) were collected in a 122 km2 watershed located in N.E. Georgia, USA during the 2013 water year. Continuous discharge was calculated from level data using USGS rating curves. This study quantifies total sediment and fecal indicator bacteria loads (FIB) in an alluvial stream in a mixed land use watershed and provides valuable data for parameterization of watershed models that simulate sediment and bacteria transport. Annual loads for sediment and FIB were determined using linear relationships between the following: turbidity and total suspended solids (R2 = 0.96); turbidity and suspended Escherichia coli and enterococci (R2 = 0.54 and 0.67, respectively); discharge and bed load (R2 = 0.60), and discharge and sediment associated E. coli and enterococci (R2 = 0.55 and 0.50, respectively). The annual sediment load was 3660 t with approximately 95% attributed to suspended sediment load and 5% attributed to bed load. The annual E. coli load was 3.7 x 1014 colonies with approximately 99.5% attributed to suspended transport and 0.50% attributed to bed load sediment-associated transport. The annual enterococci load was 1.1 x 1015 colonies with approximately 100% attributed to suspended transport. Bed load sediment transport ranged from 2% to 8% of the total storm sediment load in several high flow events (Q = 5 to 40 m3 s-1). Bed sediment-associated E. coli load was 0.4% to 0.5% of the total storm E. coli load. Suspended transport is the predominant mechanism describing contaminant loading in this stream and load estimates can be determined using simple relationships between discharge and suspended concentrations.",

Thus, there are several studies particularly intended for the pre-Neogene geology of the basin. However, there is not any detailed study related to the geological units of Neogene and Quaternary periods. This study aims to exhibit facies features of these units within spatial and temporal distributions according to field studies. In the other hand, the region has modelled through stratigraphically by computing more than 250 borehole data within 3D GeoScientific Information System. In light of obtained model, basement topographies of Neogene and Quaternary units has revealed. The model indicate high amounts of sedimentation during the Mio-Pliocene with a southward increasing thickness of a freshwater lake basin while it is a shallow saline lake basin today that regressed towards the north during the Plio-Quaternary. The combination of these results with regional geological and geophysical data (i.e. gravity and crustal thickness) allows geodynamic implications for central Turkey. The spatio-temporal variations of Late Cenozoic units reflect the main effect of endogenic forces that were caused due to lithospheric slab break-off and following asthenospheric upwelling under central Turkey.",

            "abstract": "After 5 years of IBEX observations and 11 complete skymaps, we can now trace the time evolution of the heliospheric ENA flux at all points in the sky over the course of half a solar cycle. Generally we find that the ENA flux has decreased by 30-40% since the beginning of the mission, with a decline of up to 60% in some parts of the north ecliptic polar region. In the direction of the heliospheric tail, the ENA flux has been steady at all energies, exhibiting no drop in ENA flux, or perhaps even a slight increase. Preliminary analysis of the IBEX ribbon reveals the same fractional drop in flux as observed in adjacent parts of the sky. This has significant implications for the source mechanism for the ribbon.\nWe also have continuous coverage of the ENA flux directly at the north and south ecliptic poles, and from this we find that from the beginning of the mission until mid-2012, the ENA flux declined at all IBEX-Hi energies and the IBEX-Lo energies above 400 eV. Starting in mid-2012, the ENA flux began to level out and increase, first at 1.7 keV, and then a few months later at 1.1 keV (below this, the statistics are too poor to draw any conclusions). From this we can deduce a distance of about 150 AU to the ENA source region, which is likely within the inner heliosheath. Interestingly, at 2.7 and 4.3 keV, the flux continues to fall, most strongly in the north. This is somewhat unexpected, and might imply that these ENAs originate further out in the heliosheath and/or result from a different physical process.",

            "abstract": "We examine impacts of atmospheric and oceanic grid refinement on simulations of the tropical Pacific climatology, using a series of high-resolution global coupled GCMs recently developed at GFDL. Starting from the CM2.1 model developed for CMIP3, the new models progressively refine the horizontal grid spacing in the atmosphere by a factor of five (CM2.5-FLOR), and additionally in the ocean by factors of four (CM2.5) and ten (CM2.6). The atmospheric refinement is found to substantially improve the coupled simulation's tropical Pacific climatology of SST, rainfall, surface pressure, winds, coastal upwelling, and upper-ocean temperature and salinity -- and also reduces the net air-sea heat flux into the ocean near the equator, indicating reduced ocean-dynamical cooling due to weaker trade winds. Oceanic refinement, in contrast, results in much less improvement to the simulated surface climatology -- and in some respects actually degrades the simulation, for example by over-intensifying the thermal stratification of the equatorial upper ocean. This suggests that in the more strongly-eddying regimes permitted by higher resolution, some of the ocean component's physical parameterizations may need retuning or reformulation. The causes of these various sensitivities are discussed, along with avenues toward future improvements.",

            "abstract": "As vehicle-based atmospheric surveying becomes more commonplace, its natural evolution will see an increased movement towards detection of multiple gases and geochemical approaches for discriminating leaks of different origin. While multi-gas surveys are already feasible, the factor limiting our ability to interpret them is the understanding of gas source-sink dynamics, particularly at the soil level. This study aims to understand the relationship between soil processes and atmospheric methane concentrations. Using source regions of approximately 100 km2, extensive soil gas surveys were completed, measuring CH4, δ13CH4 and CO2. We compared this to daytime and nighttime vehicle-based surveys where we acquired data for the same gases to see which of these individual gases, or ratios thereof, could be detected in the lower atmosphere. These surveys were done in two contrasting regions, which were also expected to have different source/sink processes. Results showed that atmospheric CH4 concentration, its isotopic signature, and the CO2/CH4 ratio of above-background concentrations showed the highest level of correspondence with the soil CH4 values. Anomalies in CH4 concentrations in the first study area appeared to be from predominantly biological sources (δ13CH4 values near −60‰) rather than from a fossil source (underlying coal beds). However, the study area also showed anomalous values of δ13CH4, which may have been due to a soil CH4 sink. In both regions, nighttime atmospheric studies generally yield stronger signals and correlations because decreased night winds contributed to pooling of gases and higher atmospheric concentrations. This study helps advance our understanding of the relationship between soil processes and atmospheric methane, which is essential for improving vehicle-based surveys for use in detecting environmental side-effects of energy and geosequestration projects in regions of complex surface gas dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Landslide failures on the scale of mountains are spectacular, dangerous, and spontaneous, making direct observations hard to obtain. Measurement of their dynamic properties during runout is a high research priority, but a logistical and technical challenge. Seismology has begun to help in several important ways. Taking advantage of broadband seismic stations, recent advances now allow: (i) the seismic detection and location of large landslides in near-real-time, even for events in very remote areas that may have remain undetected, such as the 2014 Mt La Perouse supraglacial failure in Alaska; (ii) inversion of long-period waves generated by large landslides to yield an estimate of the forces imparted by the bulk accelerating mass; (iii) inference of the landslide mass, its center-of-mass velocity over time, and its trajectory.\nKey questions persist, such as: What can the short-period seismic data tell us about the high-frequency impacts taking place within the granular flow and along its boundaries with the underlying bedrock? And how does this seismicity relate to the bulk acceleration of the landslide and the long-period seismicity generated by it?\nOur recent work on the joint analysis of short- and long-period seismic signals generated by past and recent events, such as the Bingham Canyon Mine and the Oso-Steelhead landslides, provides new insights to tackle these issues. Qualitative comparison between short-period signal features and kinematic parameters inferred from long-period surface wave inversion helps to refine interpretation of the source dynamics and to understand the different mechanisms for the origin of the short-period wave radiation. Our new results also suggest that quantitative relationships can be derived from this joint analysis, in particular between the short-period seismic signal envelope and the inferred momentum of the center-of-mass. In the future, these quantitative relationships may help to constrain and calibrate parameters used in inversion or simulation of long-period waves generated by landslides. Relating the center-of-mass dynamics to the short-period seismic signal might also yield a new means to estimate kinematic parameters for the smaller events that generate too weak long-period seismic waves to allow inversion or simulation of the seismic source.",

This can be done through a multiple high-speed cameras network (RAMMER network) installed in the Paraiba Valley region – SP – Brazil. The RAMMER network (Automated Multi-camera Network for Monitoring and Study of Lightning) is composed by four high-speed cameras operating at 2,500 frames per second. Three stationary black-and-white (B&W) cameras were situated in the cities of São José dos Campos and Caçapava. A fourth color camera was mobile (installed in a car), but operated in a fixed location during the observation period, within the city of São José dos Campos. The average distance among cameras was 13 kilometers. Each RAMMER sensor position was determined so that the network can observe the same lightning flash from different angles and all recorded videos were GPS (Global Position System) time stamped, allowing comparisons of events between cameras and the LLS. The RAMMER sensor is basically composed by a computer, a Phantom high-speed camera version 9.1 and a GPS unit. The lightning cases analyzed in the present work were observed by at least two cameras, their position was visually triangulated and the results compared with BrasilDAT network, during the summer seasons of 2011/2012 and 2012/2013. The visual triangulation method is presented in details. The calibration procedure showed an accuracy of 9 meters between the accurate GPS position of the object triangulated and the result from the visual triangulation method. Lightning return stroke positions, estimated with the visual triangulation method, were compared with LLS locations. Differences between solutions were not greater than 1.8 km.",

To do this we need to determine if the year following an eruption was significantly colder and wetter than preceding or subsequent years as measured by any given proxy and if that year is consistently cold and wet across different proxies. The problem is complicated by the fact that normal inter-annual variations in any given proxy can be quite large and can obscure any volcanological impact and by the fact that inter-annual variations for different proxies will have different means and standard deviations. We address the first problem by assuming that on a regional scale, the inter-annual variations of different proxies are at best only weakly correlated and that, in the absence of a volcanological signal, these variations will average out on a regional scale. We address the second problem by renormalizing each record so that it has the same mean and standard deviation over a given time interval. We then sum the re-normalized records on a year-by-year basis and look for years with significantly higher total scores. The method can also be used to assess the statistical significance of an anomalous value. Our initial analysis of records primarily from the Northern Hemisphere shows that the years 1601 and 1816 were significantly colder and wetter than any others in the past 500 years. These years followed the eruptions of Huayanaputina in Chile and Tambora in Indonesia, respectively, by one year. The years 1698 and 1837 also show up as being climatologically severe although they have not (yet) been associated with specific volcanic eruptions.",

            "abstract": "Investigating climate dynamics governing rainfall over the western US during past warmings and coolings of the last glacial and deglaciation is pertinent to understanding how precipitation patterns might change with future global warming, especially as the processes driving the global hydrological reorganization affecting this drought-prone region during these rapid temperature changes remain unresolved. We present model climates of the Bølling warm event (14,500 years ago) and Younger Dryas cool event (12,200 years ago) that i) uniquely enable the assessment of dueling hypothesis about the atmospheric teleconnections responsible for abrupt temperature shifts in the North Atlantic region to variations in moisture conditions across the western US, and ii) show that existing hypotheses about these teleconnections are unsupported. Modeling results show no evidence for a north-south shift of the Pacific winter storm track, and we argue that a tropical moisture source with evolving trajectory cannot explain alternation between wet/dry conditions, which have been reconstructed from the proxy record. Alternatively, model results support a new hypothesis that variations in the intensity of the winter storm track, corresponding to its expansion/contraction, can account for regional moisture differences between warm and cool intervals of the last deglaciation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mechanism forcing the teleconnection between the North Atlantic and western US is the same across different boundary conditions. In our simulation, during the last deglaciation, and in simulations of future warming, perturbation of the Rossby wave structure reconfigures the atmospheric state. This reconfiguration affects the Aleutian Low and high-pressure ridge over and off of the northern North American coastline driving variability in the storm track. Similarity between the processes governing the climate response during these distinct time intervals illustrates the robust nature of the teleconnection, a novel result that provides context for understanding the climate processes governing the response of moisture variability to future climate change.",

            "abstract": "It is widely reported that land surface models (LSMs) are unable to use all of the information available from boundary conditions [1-4]. Evidence for this is that statistical models typically out-perform physics LSMs with the same forcing data. We demonstrate that this conclusion is not necessarily correct. The statistical models don’t consider parameters, and the experiments cannot distinguish between information loss and bad information (disinformation).\nRecent work has outlined a rigorous interpretation of model benchmarking that allows us to measure the amount of information provided by model physics and the amount of information lost due to model error [5]. Recognizing that a complete understanding of model adequacy requires treatment across multiple locations [6] allows us to expand benchmarking theory to segregate bad and missing information. The result is a benchmarking method that that can distinguish error due to parameters, forcing data, and model structure - and, unlike other approaches, does not rely on parameter estimation, which can only provide estimates of parameter uncertainty conditional on model physics.\nOur new benchmarking methodology was compared with the standard methodology to measure information loss in several LSMs included in the current and developmental generations of the North American Land Data Assimilation System. The classical experiments implied that each of these models lose a significant amount of information from the forcing data; however, the new methodology shows clearly that this information did not actually exist in the boundary conditions in the first place. Almost all model bias can be attributed to incorrect parameters, and that most of the LSMs actually add information (via model physics) to what is available in the boundary conditions.\n1 Abramowitz, G., Geophys Res Let 32, (2005).\n2 Gupta, H.

            "abstract": "Accurate time-shift estimation between arrivals in two seismic traces before and after a small velocity change is crucial for estimating the location and amplitude of the velocity change. Windowed crosscorrelation and trace stretching are two time-domain techniques commonly used to estimate local time shifts between multiply scattered coda signals. These methods can both fail when the induced changes in the scattered wavefield are not simple time shifts. Cycle skipping is an example of one such obstacle. A common approach to mitigate such problems is to choose only part of the coda to analyze. In the work presented here, we implement Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to search for the time shift at each time sample that globally minimizes the misfit between two seismic traces. We show that DTW is considerably less susceptible to errors in time-shift estimates caused by cycle skipping or disappearance of coda phases due to changes in the physical scattering properties. Our approach provides a new tool to estimate small time shifts in coda and has wide application across many disciplines of seismic monitoring and imaging.",

Operating from its base in Fairbanks, AK, the CARVE aircraft covers a range of principle flight paths in the Alaskan interior, the Yukon River valley, and the northern Alaska coast around Barrow and Dead Horse. Flight paths are chosen to maximize ecosystem variability and cover burn-recovery/regrowth sequences. CARVE observations cover the Arctic Spring/Summer/Fall seasons, with multiple flights per season and principle flight path. Science operations started in 05/2012 and are currently envisaged to continue until 2015.\nThe CARVE suite of instruments includes flask measurements, in situ gas analyzers for CO2, CH4 and CO observations, and a three-band polarizing Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) for column measurements of CO2, CH4, CO, their interfering species (e.g., H2O), and O2. The FTS covers the spectral regions of 4,200-4,900 cm-1 (CH4, CO), 5,800-6,400 cm-1 (CO2), and 12,900-13,200 cm-1 (O2), with a spectral resolution of 0.2 cm-1. Aircraft-based FTS science observations in Alaska have been performed since 23-05-2012. First-version data products from all CARVE instruments derived from observations during the 2012 campaign were publicly released earlier in 2013.\nThe FTS has performed well during flight conditions, particularly with respect to vibration damping. We present results from FTS column observations of CO2, CH4, and CO, observed during the 2012, 2013, and 2014 campaigns, including comparisons of CARVE FTS measurements with satellite observations of CO2 from TANSO/GOSAT retrieved by JPL/ACOS, and MOPITT CO.",

It is bounded to the south by the NE-SW striking Yavapai province, which was accreted along the southeastern margin of North America between 1.71 and 1.68 Ga and was one of a series of major collisional events responsible for the assembly of Laurentia. In this study, PdS teleseismic receiver functions were used to investigate the deep crustal structure associated with these collisions. Using data from over 800 broadband seismic stations distributed throughout the Great Plains/Midcontinent region, we calculated .5 Hz receiver functions using 245 M > 6.0 teleseismic events. The receiver functions were then CCP (common conversion point) stacked to create a 3D image volume. Profiles through this image volume show evidence of crustal scale thrusting of the Wyoming province in the west over the Superior province in the east and structural underplating associated with the Yavapai-Superior boundary. We also performed a density analysis of the region using the 2p1s and 0p1s receiver function phases from 233 stations. These data indicate a relatively low Moho density contrast throughout the THO and northern Yavapai region associated with a region of thickened crust (> 50 km), which we interpret to be evidence of a dense lower crustal layer that may be the result mafic underplating. Additionally, we investigate the role that this dense layer may have on the stabilization of the Superior craton and others relative to compositionally and thermally derived density variations in the mantle lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "In situ engineering measurements of natural gas well sites indicate leakage rates with a mean rate of 1.5% of the gas production rate from individual wells. These have been made at several gas basins using in situ measurements. These in situ engineering measurements are reported as the fugitive emission rates to the UNCCC by the EPA. On the other hand, atmospheric measurements at altitudes above the surface by several atmospheric groups indicate that gas fields are leaking at an average rate of over 9 %. Papers have been published in several highly reputable journals by government and university scientists. Both groups have been criticizing the methodologies of the opposite group. We propose that a more likely explanation is that both groups are correct. Although this appears as a direct conflict with one group on each side, a careful analysis shows that the two groups are measuring different air parcels. This is the only explanation which will explain the apparent conflicting situation. This can be understood if the basins in which the wells are sited are actually leaking from the bed rock formations in which the wells are drilled. If the geology of the natural gas basins is examined in detail, then the situation becomes understandable. Many basins contain gas in fault traps. These faults often leak, particularly if there is a small earthquake. The leaks can follow tilted layers, resulting in vertical transport of gas along the slanted layer cracks. This leakage may emerge into the atmosphere at large distances from the actual gas well under measurement. Fracking can obviously increase the leakage from a valley gas field.\nThe methane leaks could alter the budgets of greenhouse gases reported by various gas producing countries by significant amounts. The potential increases and altered budgets for various countries as reported to the UNCCC are estimated and reported in this presentation. The fraction of these unreported leaks which should be reported will have to wait for the development of appropriate methodologies to determine how much of the observed leakage is natural and how much is due to natural gas exploitation.",

            "abstract": "Porosity is an important parameter in models of many seafloor and sub-seafloor processes active on a global scale, such as methane hydrate occurrence, sub-seafloor metabolic activities, and hydrothermal circulation of fluids. While global models require a global input grid, direct porosity measurements are sparse. We compare gridding techniques from previous modelers (nearest neighbor interpolation, kriging, etc.) to both physical and statistical prediction techniques including Bayesian networks and random decision forests (RDF). Sparse data (only a few thousand direct seafloor porosity measurements worldwide) and sampling bias (toward shallow water depths and low-middle latitudes) adversely affect the interpolated grids. Estimating porosity as a function of water depth alone is as effective in some regions. We have roughly doubled the number of available data points by calculating porosity from thermal conductivity measurements, but sampling bias and spatial data gaps remain problematic. In contrast, statistical methods such as RDF allow for more geologically intelligent predictions, decreasing the effect of sampling bias and improving predictions in regions with little or no data, while rigorously estimating the uncertainty of the result. Statistical prediction is based on empirical statistical relationships between porosity and other parameters for which we have compiled or generated more densely sampled estimates (e.g. water depth, sediment grain type, proximity to rivers or volcanoes). Our results demonstrate the utility of RDF in predicting properties for use in earth system models.",

            "abstract": "Slip on shallowly dipping detachments is one of the longest-debated puzzles in structural geology. The Eocene Heart Mountain detachment in northwestern Wyoming is among the largest, best-studied examples of such an enigmatic feature. Extant exposures of the upper plate of the detachment, the Heart Mountain allochthon, form an elongate, internally coherent, extended mass comprising Paleozoic carbonate strata and overlying Eocene Absaroka volcanics. The allochthon is at least 70 km long, with apparent slip of as much as 45 kilometers. At present, the base of the allochthon is regionally subhorizontal, with local dips rarely exceeding a few degrees. Given its highly unfavorable orientation for either coulombic failure or continued slip, it would seem likely that a viscous mechanism, where failure may occur under relatively low ratios of shear stress to normal stress, is needed to explain how such low-angle faults are able to form.\nMost recent conceptions of the emplacement of the Heart Mountain allochthon as a catastrophic event, occurring within a single day. However, we have observed evidence of both cyclic and long-duration, fault-related deformation, including cross-cutting clastic dikes and overprinting relationships involving brecciation, cementation, veining, and pressure solution. In particular, textures within and around distinctive banded grains (“accreted grains” of previous workers) suggest their formation via the relatively slow, fluid-related processes.\nThe only known potential mechanism to facilitate viscous deformation under upper crustal conditions is pressure solution creep. We propose that the Heart Mountain detachment began to form via heterogeneous, perhaps highly localized, pressure solution creep along discrete patches of the future detachment surface. The loading induced by these patches could serve to rotate the principal stress directions locally, and thereby trigger brittle failure on the low-angle surface. Most of the slip along the detachment need not be accommodated by pressure solution creep for this mechanism to apply. An inclined orientation for the maximum principal stress direction is supported at one locality by the orientations of microfractures and possibly by en echelon clastic dikes near the fault plane.",

The preservation of nitrate in polar ice sheets can thus be used to retrieve information related to past changes in local and/or regional tropospheric oxidation chemistry, contributing to the understanding of atmospheric chemistry and climate interactions. We measured Δ17O(NO3-) in ice core samples from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2), covering the Holocene and the last glacial periods, as well as two Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) events in the last glacial period. The values of Δ17O(NO3-) are higher in the glacial period compared to during the Holocene. In addition, Δ17O(NO3-) changes abruptly by as much as 3 ‰ in ~100 years during these two DO events, suggesting a high sensitivity of O3/HOx to climate in the mid- to high northern latitudes. The observations suggest a general relationship between tropospheric O3/HOx ratios and climate, with larger O3/HOx ratios in colder climates compared to during warmer climates. High resolution measurements during the two DO events further indicate a second regime that in relatively warm climates, the O3/HOxratios decrease with decreasing temperature.\nWe hypothesize that the switch between the two regimes is due to changes in the relative importance of 1) surface emissions and chemistry, and 2) stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) for tropospheric O3/HOx in the mid- to high northern latitudes. Surface emissions and chemistry dominate variability in tropospheric O3/HOx in relatively warm climates. In colder climates, changes in STE become dominant for the observed variability in tropospheric O3/HOx in the mid- to high northern latitudes. Prior calculations from global chemistry-climate models are qualitatively consistent with this hypothesis.",

GPS data was also obtained from a Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) GPS receiver collocated with the THEMIS ASI. This GPS receiver is a commercial GPS scintillation receiver. A list of 140 patchy aurora events and 180 auroral arc events were catalogued from the ASI data for the years 2008-2013. Corresponding scintillation data for these time periods were obtained from the GPS receiver. In order to determine the effects of PPA and arcs on GPS signals, the number of cycle slips observed during each event were calculated. A total number of 197 cycle slips were observed during PPA compared to 16 cycle slips observed during arcs. This result suggests PPA affects GPS in a more adverse manner than auroral arcs. Even though the magnitude of the phase scintillation index (σφ) observed for auroral arcs was much higher than for PPA, the receiver was able to keep lock on to the signals much better during arcs compared to patchy aurora. We have also calculated spectral slopes/spectral index for all events which had σφ > 0.3. We obtained around 1500 spectral slopes for events during auroral arcs and around 600 for events during patchy aurora. Although the histograms for these spectral indices seem to reveal that average spectral index for both of these phenomena was ~3.5, spectral indices for auroral arcs seem to tend towards higher values compared to spectral indices of PPA. This result seems to suggest that for auroral arcs, large sized ionospheric irregularities dominate their spectral content compared to PPA. Elevation-angle and azimuthal distributions of PPA and arcs were also considered in this study.",

            "abstract": "Peroxy radicals (HO2, CH3O2, etc.) are commonly detected by the chemical amplification technique, in which ambient air is mixed with high concentrations of CO and NO, initiating a chain reaction that produces 30 – 200 NO2 molecules per sampled peroxy radical. The NO2 is then measured by one of several techniques. With the exception of CIMS-based techniques, the chemical amplification method has undergone only incremental improvements since it was first introduced in 1982. The disadvantages of the technique include the need to use high concentrations of CO and the greatly reduced sensitivity of the amplification chain length in the presence of water vapor. We present a new chemical amplification scheme in which either ethane or acetaldehyde is used in place of CO, with the NO2 product detected using Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift spectroscopy (CAPS). Under dry conditions, the amplification factor of the alternative amplifiers are approximately six times lower than the CO-based amplifier. The relative humidity “penalty” is not as severe, however, such that at typical ambient relative humidity (RH) values the amplification factor is within a factor of three of the CO-based amplifier. Combined with the NO2 sensitivity of CAPS and a dual-channel design, the detection limit of the ethane amplifier is less than 2 ppt (1 minute average, signal-to-noise ratio 2). The advantages of these alternative chemical amplification schemes are improved safety, a reduced RH correction, and increased sensitivity to organic peroxy radicals relative to HO2.",

            "abstract": "We are using a watershed-scale experiment to examine the water quality effects of growing woody crops for bioenergy in the southeastern United States. Three adjacent watersheds in the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina were instrumented and baseline conditions were established for two years (2010-2012). In spring 2012, approximately 40% of the 2 treatment watersheds were harvested while the third watershed served as an unmanipulated control. Loblolly pine seedlings were planted in spring 2013, and silvicultural activities (herbicide and fertilizer applications) were implemented following a short-rotation (8-12 year) schedule. The chemistry (nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, herbicides) of stream water, soil water (interflow), groundwater, and precipitation was measured weekly, monthly, or on an event basis. Baseline chemistry and hydrological measurements together showed that groundwater is the dominant flowpath in these watersheds, and thus we predicted that any effects of pine management on stream water quality may be lagged by several years. After two years of post-treatment water quality monitoring, there have been no changes in stream water quality in the two treatment watersheds. Ammonium concentrations varied temporally in all 3 watersheds, and this pattern may be driven by seasonal variation in nitrification rates. Stream nitrate concentrations were generally low (<500 μg N/L), and concentrations peaked in all 3 watersheds after stream flow resumed following a dry year. Ammonium and nitrate concentrations in deep groundwater increased for several months after harvest; however, concentrations were low (primarily <200 μg N/L for ammonium and <1,500 μg N/L for nitrate). Longer-term measurements are needed to determine if this pattern of increased nutrients in groundwater persists.",

While co-seismic and post-seismic responses to the three major earthquakes have been extrapolated from temporally correlated well data, here we develop a numerical model to reconstruct the aquifers’ response to each earthquake. By using fault slip distributions modeled from InSAR data, we can project the effects of slip on the fault to monitored well sites around the Canterbury region, ultimately extrapolating the stress regimes at these adjacent localities. Furthermore, our model will enable us to extract the specific responses of the hydrologic systems to both the co-seismic and post-seismic effects of the earthquakes. With this model we hope to gain a more comprehensive understanding of aquifer behavior, localized liquefaction, and surface deformation in relation to this devastating series of earthquakes.",

Current knowledge of the P cycle includes many insights about relatively short-term processes, but a long-term and landscape-level view may be needed to understand P status and optimize P management towards P sustainability. We reconstructed long-term (>40 years) P mass balances and rates of P accumulation in three major river basins where excess P pollution is demanding improvements in P management at local, national, and international levels. We focus on: Maumee River Basin, a major source of agricultural P to Lake Erie, the southernmost and shallowest of the Laurentian Great Lakes; Thames River Basin, where fluxes of effluent P from the London, England metropolitan area have declined following improvements in wastewater treatment; Yangtze (Changjiang) River Basin, the largest in China, which is undergoing rapid economic development. The Maumee and Thames are intensively monitored, and show long-term declines in basin P inputs that represent a step towards P sustainability. However, river P outputs have been slower to decline, consistent with the hypothesis that legacy P is mobilizing from soils or from within the river network. Published data on the Yangtze indicate the P flux from land to water has clearly increased with industrialization and population growth. Historical trajectories of P accumulation and depletion in major river basins are providing new understanding about the long-term impacts of P management, including watershed P legacies and response times, that may inform future policy towards local, national, and global P sustainability.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid population growth and economic development in the State of Texas, a fast urbanization process has occurred over the past several decades. The direct consequences of the increased impervious area are greater surface runoff and higher flood peaks. Meanwhile, climate change has led to more frequent extreme events. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the hydrological processes under urbanization and climate change is indispensable for sustainable water management. In this investigation, a case study was conducted by applying the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) to the San Antonio River Basin (SARB), Texas. Hosting the seventh largest city in the U.S. (i.e., City of San Antonio), the SARB is vulnerable to both floods and droughts. A set of historical and future land cover maps were assembled to represent the urbanization process. Two forcing datasets were employed to drive the DHSVM model. The first is a long-term observation based dataset (1915-2011), which was used as inputs for calibrating and validating DHSVM, as well as evaluating the urbanization effect. The second is the statistically downscaled climate simulations (1950-2099) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), which were applied for understanding impacts related to climate change. Results show that urbanization exerts a much larger influence on streamflow than climate change does. Under the same observed forcings, annual average streamflow increased from 993.0 cfs (with 1929 land cover) to 1777.7 cfs (with 2011 land cover). As for climate change, results suggest that it will exacerbate the drought severity — with reduced evapotranspiration and soil moisture caused by decreased precipitation. However, the projected future streamflow does not show a clear increasing or decreasing trend. Regarding the combined effect from urbanization and climate change, the results indicate that the seasonal streamflow pattern will be notably changed (i.e., streamflow in October will be significantly increased, which makes it a second flow peak in addition to May). Furthermore, with significantly decreased evapotranspiration and slightly increased soil moisture, more water will be available for streamflow, increasing the possibility of flood risk in the region.",

            "abstract": "The seismic waves propagating in mountainous areas are highly disrupted by the intricate surface geometry. As a consequence of that effect, the topography produces large ground-motion amplifications in the vicinity of summits, possibly causing damages during large earthquakes. Another consequence is the strong variability of the ground motion occurring on steep slopes, where the amplification patterns are complex and event-dependent. We introduce a new methodology to forecast the topographic site-effect amplification. Ground motions are obtained from a large database of 3-D earthquake simulations with numerical accuracy achieved up to 4 Hz and including the topography surrounding the inter-Disciplinary Underground Science and Technology laboratory (i-DUST/LSBB), Rustrel, France. Those ground motions show that the Earth’s surface curvature, defined as the second spatial-derivative of the elevation map, is correlated with the topographic site amplification. The highest linear correlation between the frequency-dependent topographic amplification and the topographic curvature is reached when the curvature is smoothed over a characteristic length equal to the S-wavelength divided by two, implying that the amplification is caused by topographic features whose horizontal dimensions are similar to half of the S-wavelength. The largest single-station variabilities are found at sites located on slopes and on the largest summits, while intermediate variabilities occur over narrow ridges and a stable behavior in the bottom valleys. The Frequency-Scaled Curvature (FSC) proxy allows the determination of topographic features with similar characteristic dimensions and probabilistic estimates of amplification values accounting on the phenomenon variability. Amplification estimates using the FSC proxy are robust and easily computed from digital elevation maps provided reasonable values of S-velocities in the area of interest.",

            "abstract": "The decade-plus near-continuous record from satellite scatterometers provides indirect measurements of vector winds over the global ocean with sampling largely determined by the satellite orbits. This allows investigation of wind-driven ocean processes even at remote locations that are poorly sampled by in situ measurements. Global satellite wind products are used to produce a database of time series of upwelling indices, similar to those typically produced using data from coastal ocean observing systems, at all coastal locations over the Earth. This database is analyzed to study spatial and temporal variability of coastal upwelling and downwelling throughout the world ocean. The upwelling index is typically a proxy for upwelling/downwelling across the slope assuming a simple local mass balance to the offshore surface Ekman transport. However, along-shore variations in winds and shelf geometry perturb this simple local balance via shelf wave dynamics. In particular, cross-slope velocities downcoast (in a shelf wave propagation sense) of changes in the topographic gradient orientation may respond preferentially to a wind direction not oriented along local isobaths. Data from numerical models are analyzed to illustrate this point and to clarify the relation between upwelling/downwelling and local wind direction throughout the global coastal ocean that may allow improvement in wind-derived upwelling indices.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen isotope partitioning (as H2O and D2O) between water-saturated silicate melts and coexisting silicate-saturated aqueous fluids with several different initial D/H ratios in the Na2O–Al2O3–SiO2–H2O system has been determined. In-situ measurements in a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HDAC) with the fluid and melt at the desired temperatures (≤800˚C) and pressures (≤1115 MPa) were carried out with microRaman and FTIR spectroscopy techniques.\nFor bulk D/H ratios were used: 0.05 ±0.02, 0.13 ±0.05, 0.53 ±0.01 and 2.35 ±0.04. Three experimental series (D/H: 0.05, 0.13, 0.53) with coexisting fluid and melt have comparable pressure/temperature trajectories (350-650 ºC/322-626, 313-741 and MPa; 248-648 MPa, respectively), whereas the experimental series with D/H=2.35 had a lower pressure/temperature trajectory (400-680 ºC/192-496 MPa). In these pressure/temperature ranges, the D/H ratios of fluids barely change with temperature, with an average small negative ΔHfluid -1.2 ±0.5 kJ/mol. In contrast, the D/H ratios of coexisting melts display strong temperature dependence. The ΔHmelt decreases from 14.6 ±2.2 to -3.7 ±1.1 kJ/mol with the D/H ratio increasing from 0.05 ±0.02 to 2.35 ±0.04. Consequently, the (D,H) exchange equilibrium between melt and fluid is temperature dependent, and varies so that its ΔH increases from -15.9 ±2.7 to 0.3 ±0.4 kJ/mol with increasing D/H ratios.\nHydrogen isotope fractionation between silicate melts and low density phases (aqueous fluids or gases) may affect the δD values during, for example degassing of mantle derived-magmatic liquids. Moreover, D/H fractionation between silicate minerals and melts in the Earth’s interior can be affected by the significant temperature and composition-dependent D/H fractionation in silicate melts at high temperatures and pressures.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Climate Model Data Service (CDS) and the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) are collaborating to manage an Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) node that distributes over 150 TB of climate model data in support of multiple ESGF projects; Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), NASA observational data for model-data comparisons (obs4MIPs), reanalysis data (ana4MIPs) and downscaled NASA Earth Exchange Downscaled Climate Projections (NEX-DCP30) climate data. The purpose of ESGF is to improve collaboration among climate modelers and to extend access to these climate data to other scientific communities.\nA complementary THREDDS server was set up to provide services that are not available through the ESGF data node but are of great interest to a broad user community. For example, the high spatial resolution of the downscaled NEX-DCP30 climate data attracts many GIS users who are interested in a slice/point time series subset. This cannot be done through ESGF but can be done through the complementary THREDDS server that is seamlessly linked to ESGF. Another example is the customized aggregation prepared for the complementary THREDDS service that provides access from the USGS Geo Data Portal (GDP). This access requires the aggregation of 23 models each containing 3 variables.\nBioClim data (Biodiversity) in geotiff format have been published, becoming the first geotiff image files to be successfully published in ESGF. In order to make ESGF's Live Access Server (LAS) work with BioClim geotiff, we recompiled THREDDS with the USGS-CIDA geotiff-iosp plugin. The plugin adds the ability to access geotiff format with OPeNDAP through THREDDS. This enables LAS, which uses FERRET, to provide visualizations of the data. This technique was extended to provide LAS access to the NEX-DCP30 data.\nRecently we have expanded the complementary server to cover NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) forecast and assimilation operational products in near real time. Future work includes incorporating Web Map Service (WMS), either when it is enabled in ESGF or through a standalone WMS viewer accessing the complementary server, to visualize ana4MIPs and obs4MIPs datasets, thereby providing georeferenced images of climate data stored as netcdf files. Use Cases for each of these projects will be presented.",

Bills endorsing “critical analysis” of the evolution “controversy” or supporting “academic freedom” to question evolution are routinely introduced in state legislatures. Presidential candidates find evolution denial to be a winning strategy, and nearly half of all Americans reject any suggestion that evolution played a role in human origins. What’s the best way to respond to such challenges, mingled as they are with elements of cultural warfare, resentment of academic elites, and religious doctrine? As a veteran of the “evolution wars,” I will describe a strategy that actually uses each of these lines of attack to make a case for evolution that appeals to popular concern about the honesty, motivation, and validity of the scientific enterprise itself.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forests are critical for global biodiversity, carbon and energy cycling. The Amazon basin accounts for about 15% of terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP); climate related changes of tropical GPP would therefore affect atmospheric CO2 levels. GPP is a function of the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the fraction of this radiation absorbed by vegetation (fPAR) and the efficiency with which this radiation can be utilized to produce sugars and fixate carbon (light use efficiency, ε). PAR and fPAR can be determined from remote sensing measurements, but ε is dependent on complex limitations. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has been used to derive ε as a function of the status of the xanthophyll cycle, a biophysical mechanism that controls the down-regulation of photosynthesis but PRI alone depends on extraneous effects and the sun observer geometry. As a result, this technique is not applicable over larger areas or seasonally. Recent findings have shown that ε may be inferred from multi-angle observations by relating ε to the slope of PRI with respect to shadow fractions. This technique minimizes background effects and provides an approach that is based on radiative transfer theory. The lack of multi-angle data has been the main limitation of this multi-angle technique to be applied, however, over fairly homogeneous tropical regions, multi-angle observations may be obtained from a few days of MODIS overpasses, under the assumption that ε remains relatively constant during these overpasses. To obtain multi-angle PRI from MODIS, we took advantage of a new multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) that provides surface reflectance without assuming a Lambertian reflectance model, thereby preserving the multi-angle character of MODIS observations. We hypothesize that vegetation stresses will result in down regulation of photosynthesis prior to more obvious changes such as litter fall or dieback. Our finding show clear seasonality of light use efficiency over tropical forests that are related to dry and wet season cycles and correspond well to flux tower related measurements of photosynthesis. Multi-angle MODIS observations, while not optimal for measuring short term changes in ε, may provide realistic estimates of photosynthesis over tropical regions.",

            "abstract": "Bimodal volcanism is common in continental rift zones. Structural controls to the emplacement and compositions of magmas, however, are not well understood. To address this issue, we examine the location, age, and geochemistry of active volcanic centers, and geometry and kinematics of rift-related faults across the active transtensional Owens Valley rift zone. Building on existing studies, we postulate that the spatial distribution and geochemical composition of volcanism are controlled by motion along rift-bounding fault systems. Along-strike variation in fault geometry and characteristics of active volcanism allow us to divide Owens Valley into three segments: southern, northern, and central. The southern segment of Owens Valley is a simple shear, asymmetric rift bounded to the west by the east-dipping Sierra Nevada frontal fault (SNFF). Active vents of Coso volcanic field are distributed along the eastern rift shoulder and characterized by the eruption of bimodal lavas. The SNFF within this segment is low-angle and penetrates through the lithosphere and into the ductile asthenosphere, allowing for mantle-derived magma to migrate across the weakest part of the fault zone beneath the eastern rift shoulder. Magma thermally weakens wall rocks and eventually stalls in the crust where the melt develops a greater felsic component prior to eruption. The northern segment of Owens Valley displays similar structural geometry, as the west-dipping White Mountains fault (WMF) is listric at depth and offsets the crust and mantle lithosphere, allowing for vertical transport of magma and reservoir emplacement within the crust. Bimodal lavas periodically erupted in the Long Valley Caldera region along the western rift shoulder. The central segment of Owens Valley is a pure shear, symmetric graben generated by motion along the SNFF and WMF. The subvertical, right-slip Owens Valley fault (OVF) strikes along the axis of the valley and penetrates through the lithosphere into the asthenosphere. Volcanic centers of Big Pine volcanic field are located along the trace of the OVF and characterized by mafic eruptions. The OVF is interpreted to provide a subvertical conduit for asthenospheric magma to migrate across the LAB and Moho and erupt on the rift surface without significant contamination with felsic crust.",

            "abstract": "Atlantic tropical cyclones and African easterly waves (AEWs) are strongly linked on the synoptic timescale, with about 85% of observed major Atlantic hurricanes originating from AEWs (e.g., Landsea et al. 1993). However, the influence of variability in AEWs on seasonal Atlantic tropical cyclone activity is not fully understood; a positive correlation between AEW activity and Atlantic tropical cyclone activity exists on the interannual timescale during just some periods of the observational record (e.g., Thorncroft and Hodges, 2001; Hopsch et al. 2007).\nThis study investigates the impact of AEWs on seasonal Atlantic tropical cyclone activity using regional climate model simulations in which AEWs were either prescribed or removed through the lateral boundary condition (LBC). The control simulation (10-member ensemble) was run at 27 km resolution and used 6-hourly LBCs from the NCEP CFS Reanalysis and daily NOAA Optimum Interpolation (OI) V2 sea surface temperature (SST) from the year 2005. In the experiment AEWs were suppressed by filtering 2-10 day variability over tropical latitudes from the eastern LBC, located along the west coast of the Sahel.\nThe difference in Atlantic tropical cyclone frequency was insignificant between the simulations in which AEWs were prescribed versus suppressed, indicating that AEWs are not necessary to maintain climatological tropical cyclone frequency even though tropical cyclones readily originate from these features. This further implies that seasonal Atlantic tropical cyclone frequency is uninfluenced by variability in AEWs, and that the value of AEW variability as a predictor of Atlantic tropical cyclones is limited to the weekly timescale. However in response to filtering AEWs, accumulated cyclone energy significantly increased by about 15% of the control simulation mean and the spatial pattern of track density shifted in association with changes in steering winds. This suggests the importance of AEWs in impacting tropical cyclone tracks through their influence on the large-scale circulation via wave-mean flow interaction.",

            "abstract": "East Antarctica is the least known continent, despite being a keystone in the Gondwana, Rodinia and Columbia supercontinents. Significant progress has been made in recent years in exploring East Antarctica using aeromagnetic and airborne gravity together with radar. Major aerogeophysical campaigns over the Wilkes Subglacial Basin (Ferraccioli et al., 2009 Tectonophysics), the Aurora Subglacial Basin (Aitken et al., 2014 GRL) and the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (Ferraccioli et al., 2011, Nature) provide new glimpses into the crustal architecture of East Antarctica.\nHowever, a major sector of the continent that includes key piercing points for reconstructing linkages between East Antarctica and Laurentia within Rodinia, and also the inferred remnants of a major suture zone active during Gondwana amalgamation in Pan-African times (ca 500 Ma), has remained largely terra incognita. Here we present the results of a major aerogeophysical survey flown over this sector of East Antarctica, named the Recovery Frontier, from the major ice stream flowing in the region. The survey was flown during the IceGRAV 2012-13 field season, as part of a Danish-Norwegian-UK and Argentine collaboration and led to the collection of 29,000 line km of radar, laser altimetry, gravity and magnetic data.\nWe present the new aeromagnetic anomaly, Bouguer and residual and enhanced anomaly maps for the region. Using these images we trace the extent of major subglacial faults and interpret these to delineate the tectonic boundaries separating the Coast block, the Shackleton Range and the Dronning Maud Land crustal provinces. Forward magnetic and gravity modelling enables us to examine the inferred Pan-African age suture zone in the Shackleton Range and address its tectonic relationships with older terranes of the Mawson Craton and Grenvillian-age terranes of Dronning Maud Land and interior East Antarctica. Finally, we present new models to test our hypothesis that Paleozoic to Mesozoic rift basins underlie the giant Recovery subglacial lakes and compare these with the rift basins of the East Antarctic Rift System, which have been proposed to host other major subglacial lakes, such as Lake Vostok, Lake 90E and Lake Sovetskaya.",

            "abstract": "A rapidly warming and wetting Arctic climate is changing the net ecosystem production (NEP) of northern landscapes and subsequent exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere. Assessments of northern terrestrial NEP have focused mostly on the rich peatland landscapes of the low Arctic, with far fewer studies from expansive, but sparse, high Arctic polar landscapes. Consequently, how these ecosystems may respond to a warming and wetting climate is still a key gap in our understanding of global carbon feedbacks. We used multi–season eddy covariance measurements to quantify growing season (June to September) NEP on contrasting polar desert and meadow wetland landscapes near Lake Hazen on northern Ellesmere Island (81ºN), in Canada’s high Arctic. We also used variation in contemporary NEP and weather to improve our understanding of potential future carbon cycling in a warmer and wetter high Arctic climate. During a typical growing season, we found that a dry polar desert landscape accumulated only 6.6±1.2 g C m-2 similar to other high Arctic sites and consistent with cold, barren soils with weak plant growth. Desert NEP coincided strongest with landscape moisture, rather than heating, with increased NEP occurring during drier conditions when soil heterotrophic rates were lowest. With a nearly constant but varying supply of water, the productive meadow wetland accumulated 13 times more carbon (86.1±16.9 g C m-2) than the desert during the growing season. NEP at the wetland was similar to comparable landscapes much further south, owing to continuous 24–hour daylight and typically clear–skies surrounding Lake Hazen. Wetland soils showed a consistent strong burst of CO2 to the atmosphere each spring (min. NEP: –2.5 µmol CO2 s-1 m-2) and a well–defined peak in July productivity (3.9–4.4 µmol CO2 s-1 m-2). Wetland NEP associated positively and strongly with both landscape heating and moisture, suggesting that autotrophic limitations other than water or heat controlled ultimate carbon accumulation on the wetland landscape. Because polar desert landscapes comprise the majority of land area in the high Arctic, changes in moisture, rather than heating, will likely continue to strongly affect future net carbon accumulation, at least until plant cover and soil quality changes substantially.",

            "abstract": "California is experiencing one of its worst droughts in history; in early 2014, the Governor released the Water Action Plan outlining opportunities to secure reliable water supplies. Groundwater recharge and storage is suggested as an alternative to surface storage, but little research has been conducted to see if groundwater recharge is a competitive alternative to other water-supply infrastructure projects. Although groundwater recharge and storage data are not readily available, several voter-approved bonds have helped finance groundwater recharge and storage projects and can be used as a proxy for costs, geographic distribution, and interest in such projects. We mined and analyzed available grant applications submitted to the Department of Water Resources that include groundwater recharge and storage elements. We found that artificial recharge can be cheaper than other water-supply infrastructure, but the cost was dependent on the source of water, the availability and accessibility of infrastructure used to capture and convey water, and the method of recharge. Bond applications and funding awards were concentrated in the Central Valley and southern California – both are regions of high water demand. With less than 60% of proposals funded, there are opportunities for groundwater recharge and storage to play a bigger role in securing California’s water supplies.",

            "abstract": "A deployment of ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) in the area of the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates, the Cascadia Initiative (CI) provides a useful laboratory to probe the tectonics of ocean plates. With intermediate spreading rates, the Juan de Fuca and Gorda ridges provide a contrast with the rapidly spreading East Pacific Rise, where the MELT experiment, the only other detailed OBS study of a spreading ridge, was conducted. One key question we explore is whether migration in the hotspot reference frame drives an asymmetry in ridge structure. On the westward-migrating East Pacific Rise, more abundant seamounts and lower seismic velocities are observed on the west side. On the Juan de Fuca ridge, which is also migrating westward, a similar seamount asymmetry has been observed, and preliminary results from Rayleigh wave tomography using the first year of data suggested a corresponding low velocity anomaly. The second and third year of data from the CI will allow us to test the asymmetry of the Gorda ridge and improve the resolution of the Juan de Fuca ridge. Another key question we explore is the validity of the conductive cooling model of oceanic plates. In the MELT experiment at the East Pacific Rise, significant deviations from the conductive cooling model were found, attributed to the combined effects of melt and dehydration of the uppermost mantle. At the Juan de Fuca and Gorda ridges, we assess whether the conductive cooling model is more applicable at intermediate spreading rates. Finally, we explore whether there are any structural differences between the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates. Unlike the Juan de Fuca ridge, there is a pronounced median valley at the Gorda axis and there is much intraplate seismicity within the deforming Gorda plate. To explore these questions, we present Rayleigh wave tomography of the Cascadia region. Because OBS data have high noise at long periods, and long periods are necessary for probing greater depths, noise complicates exploring the lower lithosphere and upper mantle with Rayleigh wave tomography. There are two primary sources of noise, tilt noise and compliance noise, which we have removed using a method pioneered by Crawford and Webb (2000). With noise removed, we can analyze data at periods of 125 to 150 s, giving us good control on lithospheric and asthenospheric structure.",

            "abstract": "The Western Solomons forearc has undergone repeated uplifts that probably were coseismic and similar to that during the 1 April 2007 Mw 8.1 megathrust rupture that raised the outer forearc as much as 2.5 m. A parallel swath of the inner forearc subsided ~0.5 m during the 2007 event. The Western Solomons is ideal for crustal motion measurements because both the outer forearc above the seismogenic zone and the inner forearc are occupied by reef-fringed islands enabling land-based measurements of vertical displacements. U-series and 14C dating of uplifted corals and microatolls has provided the ages for a number of paleo-uplift events that we infer to have been coseismic. While the outer forearc has uplifted rapidly in late Holocene time at rates from ~1 to 8 mm/yr, the inner forearc has risen at only 0 – 1.1 mm/yr. It is notable that the inner and outer forearcs are separated by an arc-parallel boundary along which there is little or no net uplift. However, although both the inner and outer forearcs have late Quaternary histories of relatively rapid net uplift, they appear to have quite different uplift histories. The outer forearc has uplifted several times over the past 1000 years by as much as several meters in each event. Although the inner forearc subsided during the 2007 event and should subside during all events that ruptured the seismogenic zone beneath the outer forearc, it also has undergone abrupt late Holocene uplifts that do not correspond to those of the outer forearc. But the most surprising difference between the inner and outer forearcs is that 8-9 ka corals in growth position and emerged solution notches were found in a number of inner forearc sites adjacent to corals of the ~6 ka mid-Holocene high sea level that was a little higher than present sea level. Because sea level at 8-9 ka was 10-20 m lower than present in this region, 10-20 m of uplift is required between 8-9 ka and 6 ka during one or more tectonic events. Some of the 9 ka corals have morphologies indicate abrupt emergence that may have been coseismic. Much slower uplift after ~8 ka allowed rising sea level to almost overtake the 8-9 ka corals. Fortunately they remained slightly above subsequent sea level so that we could discover them. Our presentation will show the evidence and propose hypotheses to explain the early Holocene interval of great uplift inferred from the 8-9 ka corals.",

In addition to having water management applications in agriculture, including monitoring water rights compliance and irrigation scheduling, it is also important to be able to accurately measure water used by other landscapes for soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) models. This can only be done with large scale estimations which are most efficiently achieved with remote sensing.\nThis research compares daily ET retrieved from two remote sensing modeling schemes: a) Reconstructed METRIC: Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration; and b) ALEXI/DisALEXI: Atmosphere-Land EXchange Inverse /Disaggregated ALEXI, over two predominately forested landscapes. ET flux estimates are retrieved from ALEXI/DisALEXI using GOES (daily, 4km), MODIS (daily, 1km) and Landsat 8 (16 days, 30m) and from Reconstructed METRIC using Landsat 8. We develop daily Landsat scale ET maps for the summer months of 2013.\nThe flux-tower footprint is calculated at each site to match the remotely sensed retrieval with that of the flux tower such that modeled output can be evaluated against ground based observations, taken from the AmeriFlux network. In addition, surface and evaporative fluxes retrieved from the two models are inter-compared over the different land cover types in the scenes. Differences in input and data processing requirements for each of the two methods will be also described",

            "abstract": "In this presentation, we outline the USGS response to dramatically increased earthquake activity in the central and eastern US, with a focus on Oklahoma. Using the November 2011 Prague, OK earthquake sequence as an example, we describe the tensions between the need to conduct thorough scientific investigations while providing timely information to local, state, and federal government agencies, and the public. In the early morning hours of November 5, 2011 a M4.8 earthquake struck near the town of Prague, Oklahoma and was followed by a M5.6 earthquake just over 20 hours later. The mainshock was widely felt across the central US, causing damage to homes close to the epicenter and injuring at least 2 people. Within hours of the initial event several portable instruments were installed and following the mainshock a larger seismic deployment was mounted (Keranen et al., 2013). A sizeable earthquake in the central or eastern US is always of scientific interest due to the dearth of seismic data available for assessing seismic hazard. The Prague sequence garnered especially strong scientific and public interest when a link between the sequence and injection of wastewater at several local deep wells was postulated. Therefore, there was a need to provide immediate information as it became available. However, in the first few days to months it was impossible to confidently confirm or refute whether the seismicity was linked to injection, but it was known that the foreshock occurred close to several deep injection wells and many of the events were shallow; thus, the sequence warranted further study. Over the course of the next few years, several studies built the case that the Prague sequence was likely induced by wastewater injection (Keranen et al., 2013; Sumy et al., 2014; McGarr, 2014) and additional studies suggested that the changes in seismicity throughout Oklahoma were not due to natural variations in seismicity rates (Llenos and Michael, 2013; Ellsworth, 2013). These studies changed the public discourse from providing primary information about the on-going earthquake sequences to how to mitigate the hazard associated with wastewater injection. And, scientific studies are now focused on how to include the impact of induced events within the National Seismic Hazard Maps (e.g. Peterson et al., 2014).",

            "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and other transient solar phenomena play important roles in magnetospheric and exospheric dynamics. Although a planet may only occasionally interact with the products of these events, such transient phenomena can result in departures from the background solar wind that often involve more than an order of magnitude greater ram pressure and interplanetary electric field applied to the magnetosphere. For Mercury, an order of magnitude greater ram pressure can push the magnetopause to the planet’s surface, exposing the surface directly to the solar wind. In order to understand how the solar wind interacts with Mercury’s magnetosphere and exosphere, previous studies have used the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA)-ENLIL solar wind modeling tool to calculate basic and composite solar wind parameters, such as solar wind velocity (V) and Alfvén Mach number (MA) at Mercury’s orbital location. This model forecasts only the background solar wind, however, and does not include these transient events. The Cone extension permits the inclusion of CMEs and other phenomena, and thus enables characterization of the effect of strong solar wind perturbations on the Mercury system. The Cone extension is predicated on the assumption of constant angular and radial velocities of ejecta to integrate them into the WSA-ENLIL coupled model. Comparisons of the model results with the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft observations indicate that the WSA-ENLIL-Cone model more accurately forecasts total solar wind conditions at Mercury and has greater predictive power for magnetospheric and exospheric processes than the WSA-ENLIL model alone.",

The array consisted of eight seismometers plus three stations with only differential pressure gauges covering a lateral extent of 200 km by 600 km in seafloor with an average depth of about 6000 m. Intermediate- and deep-focus earthquakes in the Mariana and Izu-Bonin subduction zones provide paths for P waves that probe different depths beneath the seafloor and globally distributed shallow earthquakes serve as Rayleigh wave sources. Q estimates from P waves are based on frequencies from 1 to 15 Hz, primarily 2 to 10 Hz, while Rayleigh wave attenuation is measured in the 0.007 to 0.045 Hz range. Qp is statistically required to be frequency dependent, with a best-fitting power law coefficient α = 0.40. A different form of frequency dependence is required to reconcile Rayleigh wave and P wave attenuation.\nNot surprisingly, both P wave and Rayleigh wave data sets require a very low attenuation, high Q lithosphere. Two other aspects of the model are more surprising. First, Q in the asthenosphere in the depth range 100-250 km is quite low, with attenuation comparable to that in the highly attenuating wedges above subducting plates in back arc regions. This observation suggests the accumulation of a small melt fraction beneath the lithosphere. Second, attenuation in the transition zone deeper than 410 km is negligible, suggesting that the transition zone seaward of the subducting Pacific plate is dehydrated.",

            "abstract": "A common feature of continental collision zones is the entrainment of ophiolitic and subduction complex rock units. The crystallization and metamorphic ages of these units provide important constraints on both subduction zone evolution and the maximum age of ophiolite obduction. Ophiolites and subduction complexes have been well described in the Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone (YTSZ), but thus far relatively few high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphic assemblages from within the suture zone have been documented and successfully dated. Here we present structural, petrologic, and chronologic data from a recently discovered subduction complex occurrence of high-pressure (blueschist facies) rocks along the YTSZ in south central Tibet (29.31º N, 86.68º E). Mapping of the complex based on ASTER satellite image analysis as well as field work enabled the identification of four major lithostratigaphic units; from structurally highest to lowest, they are: 1) forarc affinity Chengdoi sandstones 2) a variably serpentinized ophiolitic fragment; 3) a structural mélange of blueschist-facies metabasic and metaclastic rocks; and 4) sandstones containing serpentinite and rutile detritus. The second and third of these tectonostratigraphic units are separated by thrust faults, whereas the Chengdoi sandstones unconformably overlie the ophiolitic fragment. We interpret the thrust separating the blueschists from the ophiolites as a paleo-subduction zone that dips northward when the entire section is rotated to restore the Chengdoi formation to horizontal. The subduction complex is further disrupted by oblique faults, including some with apparent normal sense offset that may be pre-collisional, intraoceanic normal faults. U/Pb zircon dating of the blueschist facies metavlocanic rocks implies a ca. 111 Ma protolith age, while a ca. 65 Ma 40Ar/39Ar amphibole date from one blueschist sample is interpreted as representing a close approximation of the timing of high-pressure metamorphism given Zr-in-rutile constraints on maximum metamorphic temperatures of ≤ 540˚C. The metamorphic age also constrains suturing along this segment of the YTSZ to have postdated the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.",

            "abstract": "The transport of warm waters from the subtropics into the subpolar North Atlantic (NA) strongly affects the climate variability of Europe and governs the strength of NA deepwater convection and the resulting AMOC strength. Modern oceanographic studies and climate models propose that this transport is mainly driven by the interaction between the subtropical (STG) and the subpolar (STG) gyre via subsurface pathways. Paleoceanographic studies postulate that subsurface transport of warm saline water from the STG may counterbalance freshening of the SPG and stabilize the Holocene AMOC mode. We tested this hypothesis, with new stable isotope and Mg/Ca analyses from surface and subsurface dwelling foraminifera obtained from a core site situated at the northern boundary of the STG.\nOur new dataset indicates stable sea surface conditions and stronger variability in the subsurface temperature and salinities. During early Holocene similar subsurface temperatures and salinities in STG and SPG indicate that both regions were directly influenced by the same water mass that probably originated from NH meltwater discharges (e.g. Thornalley et al., 2009). This period is followed by a strong Mid-Holocene divergence between subpolar and STG salinity and temperature records, while the latter two properties in the STG converge towards the records from the subtropical source region (Bahr et al., 2013). We infer that this convergence was driven by a change in the source of subsurface waters due to the expansion of subtropical water masses in the Mid-Holocene. The Mid- to late Holocene (after 6 ka BP) is characterized again by in phase variations of subsurface subpolar and STG records although both temperatures and salinities differ in absolute values. This resemblance indicates a strong connection via subsurface transport between the STG and the subpolar region that probably stabilized the late Holocene NA gyre circulation.",

            "abstract": "The encounter between negative and positive streamers has recently been suggested to be a plausible mechanism explaining the production of X-rays by discharges in air [Cooray et al., JASTP, 71,1890, 2009; Kochkin et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys., 45, 425202, 2012]. Moreover, encounters between streamers of different polarities are very common. Indeed, during the formation of a new leader step, the negative streamer zone around the tip of a negative leader and the positive streamers initiated from the positive part of a bidirectional space leader strongly interact. In laboratory experiments, when streamers are approaching a sharp electrode, streamers with the opposite polarity are initiated from the electrode and collide with the former streamers. Given that positive and negative streamers respectively carry positive and negative charges at their fronts, it is reasonable to consider that the electric field between a negative and a positive streamer would increase as the two streamers are approaching each other. However, this is a non-linear problem that depends on the dynamics of both streamers. Indeed, an increase of the electric field above the conventional breakdown threshold field will increase the electron density, and therefore the conductivity, at this location, which in turn, will tend to reduce the electric field. In this work, we will simulate numerically encounters between negative and positive streamers in order to examine the behavior of the maximum electric field that can be reached. We will quantify whether and how such collisions between streamers can increase the electric field up to sufficient magnitudes to produce thermal runaway electrons and the associated X-rays.",

As a result, implementation of the isoprene oxidation mechanism by regional models may lead to misrepresentation of ozone, organic aerosol, and related species important to air quality. Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a major product of isoprene oxidation and thus provides observational constraint on the mechanism. The SouthEast NEXus (SENEX) 2013 aircraft campaign provides observations of HCHO over the Southeast United States, an environment that is high in isoprene but variable in NOx, with the lowest concentrations of NOx in remote regions such as the Ozarks and the highest near cities and power plants. Such a range of conditions provides a unique opportunity to map out the sensitivity of HCHO to changes in the isoprene oxidation mechanism. We use the University of Washington Chemical Model (UWCMv2.2) to evaluate the HCHO dependence on isoprene and NOx throughout the range of conditions observed during SENEX. Particular emphasis will be placed on the effects of newly proposed mechanisms, including enhanced OH regeneration and updated alkyl nitrate chemistry.",

            "abstract": "Some recent studies suggest that the long-term variability of the North Atlantic SST may exert a significant influence on the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation in winter. In the observational record, an inverse relationship is found between the polarity of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) - that depicts the basin-wide fluctuations of the North Atlantic SST with a period of ~70 years - and the multidecadal trends of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, this statistical relationship is uncertain since only two cycles of the AMO are included in the observations. Here we use a set of experiments performed with the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5) to investigate the response of the atmospheric circulation to AMO-SST anomalies. As in observations, the positive phase of the AMO results in a southward shift of the North Atlantic storm track and more frequent negative NAO and blocking episodes in winter. The role of tropical vs extratropical AMO-SST anomalies is discussed, as well as the sensitivity of the results to the ocean-atmosphere feedback (using a slab-ocean model) and to the representation of the stratosphere (using the high-top version of CAM, WACCM).",

With climate change forecasts for more frequent and extensive drought in the future, a more complete understanding of the mechanisms that determine differential ecosystem sensitivity to drought is needed. In 2012, the Central U.S. experienced the 4th largest drought in a century, with a regional-scale 40% reduction in growing season precipitation affecting ecosystems ranging from desert grassland to mesic tallgrass prairie. This provided an opportunity to assess ecosystem sensitivity to a drought of common magnitude in six native grasslands. We tested the prediction that drought sensitivity is inversely related to mean annual precipitation (MAP) by quantifying reductions in aboveground net primary production (ANPP). Long-term ANPP data available for each site (mean length = 16 yrs) were used as a baseline for calculating reductions in ANPP, and drought sensitivity was estimated as the reduction in ANPP per mm reduction in precipitation. Arid grasslands were the most sensitive to drought, but drought responses and sensitivity varied by more than 2-fold among the six grasslands, despite all sites experiencing 40% reductions in growing season precipitation. Although drought sensitivity generally decreased with increasing MAP as predicted, there was evidence that the identity and traits of the dominant species, as well as plant functional diversity, influenced sensitivity.",

A time series of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 16-day composites from 2001 to 2013 was analyzed with the TIMESAT program to automatically retrieve key phenological stages. The temperature data from CRUNCEP was analyzed with R based on the crop model to calculate potential planting date and harvest date by AgroIBIS crop phenology algorithm. With these two methods, start of season (planting date), end of season (harvesting date), and length of growing season from 2001 to 2013 were determined and compared. The results showed a good relationship between estimates derived from satellites and estimates calculated by the crop model formula. Crop progress reports from USDA NASS were used to validate our estimates. We will present the relationship between our estimates and validation data. We will select some specific sites to investigate finer scale local changes of crop phenology during the last decade.",

The volcanic center is composed of several Pleistocene volcanic structures aadjacent to Ebeko and hosts a hydrothermal system with a high outflow rate of hot SO4-Cl acidic water (Upper Yurieva springs) with the current maximum temperature of ~85oC, pH 1.3 and TDS ~ 10 g/L. All discharging thermal waters are drained by the Yurieva River to the Sea of Okhotsk. The hot springs have been changing in time, generally decreasing their activity from near boiling in 1960s, with TDS ~ 20 g/L and the presence of a small steaming field at the upper part of the ~ 700 m long discharging area, to a much lower discharge rate of main vents, lower temperature and the absence of the steaming ground. The spring chemistry did not react to the Ebeko volcanic activity (14 strong phreato-magmatic events during the last 60 years).\nThe total measured outputs of chloride and sulfur from the system last time (2006-2010) were estimated on average as 730 g/s and 980 g/s, respectively, which corresponds to the equivalent fluxes of 64 t/d of HCl and 169 t/d of SO2. These values are higher than the fumarolic volatile output from Ebeko. The estimated discharge rate of hot (85oC) water from the system with ~ 3500 ppm of chloride is about 0.3 m3/s which is much higher than the thermal water discharge from El Chichon or Copahue volcano-hydrothermal systems and among the highest hot water natural outputs ever measured for a volcano-hydrothermal system.\nWe also report the chemical composition (major and ~ 60 trace elements including REE) of water from the main hot spring vents and the Yurieva river mouth.",

            "abstract": "Reactive halogen chemistry has been shown to instigate or be active during ozone depletion events in the polar regions. It has long been hypothesized that iodine may be an important contributor to ozone depletion in the atmosphere near ice/snow-covered polar surfaces. This has been supported in recent years by measurements of IO and I2 in marine environments and around Antarctica. However, the detection of inorganic iodine compounds (I2, IO, HOI) in the Arctic has been very sparse, and molecular iodine (I2) measurements have not previously been reported. Here we present measurements of I2 in the interstitial snowpack air, conducted at Barrow, Alaska in January and February of 2014. Using chemical ionization mass spectrometry, I2 was measured at up to 35ppt in the snowpack interstitial air when the top of the snowpack was artificially illuminated. During the daylight hours, I2 concentrations were highest in the late afternoon and were significantly higher on clear days than on overcast. Together these observations suggest that, like Br2 and Cl2, I2 has a photochemical production mechanism. While I- can be directly oxidized by O3, this may not be the dominant initiation pathway for sunlit conditions. A zero dimensional photochemical model shows that, because of coupling between XO radicals, proper simulation of ozone depletion events in the arctic will require understanding and inclusion of detailed iodine chemistry.",

These efforts require precise concentration measurements that are internally consistent across the network so that small changes in concentration from one location to another are representative of emissions along the pathway. In this presentation, we examine the calibration strategy for these long-term monitoring efforts using data collected over the past few years. We will address the following issues as they apply to the Picarro G2301 CRDS CO2/CH4/H2O gas analyzer: (1) The frequency of calibration required. (2) The duration of calibration needed for the inlet system to stabilize. (3) The stability and linearity of the instrument span and options for monitoring with a high concentration tank or zero air tank in addition to an ambient concentration calibration tank. We will also outline the calibration tank overlap scheme employed to ensure a consistent long-term record of calibration.",

While there are numerous hypotheses for the origin of Jupiter’s GRS, recent work suggests that the GRS’s color could originate from multiple components (Carlson et al., 2012; Simon et al., submitted). In light of this, we have recently begun conducting in situ laboratory experiments that test whether ammonium hydrosulfide, NH4SH, or its radiation decomposition products contribute to the GRS spectrum. In this presentation, we will discuss some of our most recent results, where we have studied the stability of NH4SH samples as a function of temperature using infrared and mass spectrometry.

To this end, a number of quantification methods have been proposed, such as Apatite Fission Track Analysis (AFTA), and integration of seismic surveys with well log data. AFTA usually provides accurate uplift estimates, but the data is limited due to its high cost. While the seismic survey can provide good uplift estimate when well data is available for calibration, the uncertainty can be large in areas where there is little to no well data.\nWe estimated South-Western Barents Sea uplift based on well data from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. Primary assumptions include time-irreversible shale compaction trends and a universal normal compaction trend for a specified formation. Sonic and density logs from two Cenozoic shale formation intervals, Kolmule and Kolje, were used for the study. For each formation, we studied logs of all released wells, and established exponential normal compaction trends based on a single well. That well was then deemed the reference well, and relative uplift can be calculated at other well locations based on the offset from the normal compaction trend. We found that the amount of uplift increases along the SW to NE direction, with a maximum difference of 1,447 m from the Kolje FM estimate, and 699 m from the Kolmule FM estimate. The average standard deviation of the estimated uplift is 130 m for the Kolje FM, and 160 m for the Kolmule FM using the density log. While results from density logs and sonic logs have good agreement in general, the density log provides slightly better results in terms of higher consistency and lower standard deviation. Our results agree with published papers qualitatively with some differences in the actual amount of uplifts. The results are considered to be more accurate due to the higher resolution of the log scale data that was used.",

            "abstract": "Crop burning season, over northern India, occurs during October-November and April-May after harvesting season. The mechanized harvesting started in 1986, and every year crop residues are burnt in the northwestern parts of India. During post-monsoon season, October – November, the boundary layer is shallow; as a result the crop burning greatly impacts the regional air quality and climate of the northern parts of south Asia. Due to intense burning episodes, heavy smoke pollution-laden plumes are transported all along the Indo-Gangetic basin in the northern parts of India, depending upon diurnal changes in the wind patterns. We find that, in general, the dominant westerly winds transport the plumes and emissions far away from the source region up to the eastern parts of Indo-Gangetic basin, further dispersing over central India to the south. We use retrievals of formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide and Aerosol Index from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard NASA Aura satellite together with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard NASA Terra and Aqua fire counts to assess the seasonal variation and geographical extent of the emissions due to burning of crop residues. In addition, our results, based on satellite measurements, indicate that the smoke plumes and biomass burning emissions are also transported over the Himalayan region and beyond, resulting in enhanced concentrations of aerosol loading and trace gases. Overall, our findings suggest that, during post-monsoon season, crop burning smoke plumes and emissions are the main cause of poor air quality, high atmospheric pollution and dense haze/smog, especially in the Indo-Gangetic basin.",

These data have always been publicly available on a nondiscriminatory basis, but since 2008 these data have been accessible at no cost to the user community. This change in the Landsat data policy has revolutionized the use of Landsat data for scientific research and applications, enabling the construction of time series of observations with which to establish historical trends in land cover state and condition. The USGS provides interdisciplinary scientific expertise to the U.S. Department of the Interior to support the stewardship and management of more 500 million acres of Federal lands. Landsat data serve as the basis from which numerous information products can be derived in order to map, monitor, and assess the natural and human-induced impacts on the landscape and natural resources.

Uncertainties in the timescales of these processes are key caveats in the accurate interpretation of sedimentary records. As part of a multi-isotope leaf wax biomarker project, we report the age of biomarkers transported by rivers from mountain to floodplain across the Andes-Amazon transition in southern Peru. We tracked the age of organic carbon using the radiocarbon (14ΔC) composition of plant leaf waxes extracted from particulate organic carbon (POC) in river suspended sediments. Leaf waxes from POC are younger in mountain headwaters (<500 yrs old) and increase in age across the floodplain (>1000 yrs). Downstream aging is associated with the greater storage potential and residence times in lowland mineral soils and sedimentary sequences that include Pleistocene age eroding river terraces. Given three key observations that 1) carbon loading in suspended sediment does not substantively change from Andes to Amazon, 2) ~80% of sediment is sourced in the Andes, and 3) age increases downstream (this study); we find proof of the decoupling of organic carbon from sediment, which we attribute to loss of Andean carbon and replacement during transport.",

            "abstract": "Extended field-based summer courses provide an invaluable field experience for undergraduate majors in the geosciences. These courses often utilize the construction of geological maps and structural cross sections as the primary pedagogical tool to teach basic map orientation, rock identification and structural interpretation. However, advances in the usability and ubiquity of Geographic Information Systems in these courses presents new opportunities to evaluate student work. In particular, computer-based quantification of systematic mapping errors elucidates the factors influencing student success in the field. We present a case example from a mapping exercise conducted in a summer Field Geology course at a popular field location near Dillon, Montana. We use a computer algorithm to automatically compare the placement and attribution of unit contacts with spatial variables including topographic slope, aspect, bedding attitude, ground cover and distance from starting location. We compliment analyses with anecdotal and survey data that suggest both physical factors (e.g. steep topographic slope) as well as structural nuance (e.g. low angle bedding) may dominate student frustration, particularly in courses with a high student to instructor ratio. We propose mechanisms to improve student experience by allowing students to practice skills with orientation games and broadening student background with tangential lessons (e.g. on colluvial transport processes). As well, we suggest low-cost ways to decrease the student to instructor ratio by supporting returning undergraduates from previous years or staging mapping over smaller areas. Future applications of this analysis might include a rapid and objective system for evaluation of student maps (including point-data, such as attitude measurements) and quantification of temporal trends in student work as class sizes, pedagogical approaches or environmental variables change. Long-term goals include understanding and characterizing stochasticity in geological mapping beyond the undergraduate classroom, and better quantifying uncertainty in published map products.",

            "abstract": "Implementation of \"The Math You Need, When You Need It\" (TMYN) modules at a wide variety of institutions suggests a broad need for faculty support in helping students develop quantitative skills necessary in introductory geoscience courses. Designed to support students in applying geoscience relevant quantitative skills, TMYN modules are web-based, self-paced and commonly assigned outside of class. They include topics such as calculating slope, rearranging equations, and unit conversions and provide several applications of the mathematical technique to geoscience problems. Each instructor chooses modules that are applicable to the content in his/her individual course and students typically work through the module immediately before the module topic is applied in lab or class. Instructors assigned TMYN modules in their courses at more than 40 diverse institutions, including four-year colleges and universities (4YCs) that vary from non-selective to highly selective and open-door two-year colleges (2YCs). Analysis of module topics assigned, frequency of module use, and institutional characteristics reveals similarities and differences among faculty perception of required quantitative skills and incoming student ability at variably selective institutions. Results indicate that institutional type and selectivity are not correlated with module topic; that is, faculty apply similar quantitative skills in all introductory geoscience courses. For example, nearly every instructor assigned the unit conversions module, whereas very few required the trigonometry module. However, differences in number of assigned modules and faculty expectations are observed between 2YCs and 4YCs (no matter the selectivity). Two-year college faculty typically assign a higher number of modules per course and faculty at 4YCs more often combine portions of multiple modules or cover multiple mathematical concepts in a single assignment. These observations suggest that quantitative skills required for introductory geoscience courses are similar among all higher-education institution types. However, faculty at 4YCs may expect students to acquire and apply multiple quantitative skills in the same class/lab, whereas 2YC faculty may structure assignments to introduce and apply only one quantitative technique at a time.",

            "abstract": "Radar has the potential to enable temporally and spatially dense, continuous monitoring of waves and currents in nearshore environments. If quantitative relationships between the remote sensing signals and the hydrodynamic parameters of interest can be found, remote sensing techniques can mitigate the challenges of continuous in situ sampling and possibly enable a better understanding of wave transformation in areas with strongly inhomogeneous along and across-shore bathymetry, currents, and dissipation.\nAs part of the DARLA experiment (New River Inlet, NC), the accuracy of a rapid assessment of wave height transformation via radar remote sensing is tested. Wave breaking events are identified in the radar image time series (Catalán et al. 2011). Once the total number of breaking waves (per radar collection) is mapped throughout the imaging domain, radar-derived bathymetry and wave frequency are used to compute wave breaking dissipation (Janssen and Battjes 2007). Given the wave breaking dissipation, the wave height transformation is calculated by finding an inverse solution to the 1D cross-shore energy flux equation (including the effect of refraction). The predicted wave height transformation is consistent (correlation R > 0.9 and rmse as low as 0.1 m) with the transformation observed with in situ sensors in an area of complex morphology and strong (> 1 m/s) tidal currents over a nine-day period. The wave forcing (i.e., radiation stress gradients) determined from the remote sensing methodology will be compared with values estimated with in situ sensors.\nFunded by ONR and ASD(R&E)",

The studied area is characterized mainly by active subduction and extensional tectonic features. The evolution of such tectonically active regions is expressed through seismicity and is characterized by complex phenomenology. Nonextensive statistical physics (NESP) is a generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical physics and has been successfully used for the analysis of a variety of complex systems, where fractality and long-range interactions are important. The frequency-magnitude distribution analysis is performed in a nonextensive statistical physics context. The nonextensive parameter qM, which is related to the frequency-magnitude distribution, reflects the existence of long-range correlations and is used as an index of the physical state of the studied area. Moreover, temperature distribution within the earth’s crust has important effects on the active tectonics and seismicity. The spatial distribution of the nonextensive thermostatistical parameter qM and the heat flow are examined regarding seismicity in Greece. Using them we try to decode the spatial characteristics of seismicity in Greece. The models used, fit rather well to the observed distributions, implying the usefulness of NESP in the investigation of seismicity and such phenomena where non linearity, long range interactions, long memory effects and scaling are important.",

Upon irradiation, Cl2 and Br2 were produced, with the release being enhanced by the addition of ozone, for both molecular halogens. Flux measurements of Br2 and Cl2 from the tundra snowpack were also conducted, via the gradient flux method.

As the SCEC Community Fault Model (CFM) aims to accurately reflect this 3D deformation, we present the results of an extensive update to the model by using primarily detailed fault trace, seismic reflection, relocated hypocenter and focal mechanism nodal plane data to generate improved, more realistic digital 3D fault surfaces. The results document a wide variety of oblique strain accommodation, including various aspects of strain partitioning and fault-related folding, sets of both high-angle and low-angle faults that mutually interact, significant non-planar, multi-stranded faults with variable dip along strike and with depth, and active mid-crustal detachments. In places, closely-spaced fault strands or fault systems can remain surprisingly subparallel to seismogenic depths, while in other areas, major strike-slip to oblique-slip faults can merge, such as the S-dipping Arroyo Parida-Mission Ridge and Santa Ynez faults with the N-dipping North Channel-Pitas Point-Red Mountain fault system, or diverge with depth. Examples of the latter include the steep-to-west-dipping Laguna Salada-Indiviso faults with the steep-to-east-dipping Sierra Cucapah faults, and the steep southern San Andreas fault with the adjacent NE-dipping Mecca Hills-Hidden Springs fault system. In addition, overprinting by steep predominantly strike-slip faulting can segment which parts of intersecting inherited low-angle faults are reactivated, or result in mutual cross-cutting relationships. The updated CFM 3D fault surfaces thus help characterize a more complex pattern of fault interactions at depth between various fault sets and linked fault systems, and a more complex fault geometry than typically inferred or expected from projecting near-surface data down-dip, or modeled from surface strain and potential field data alone.",

            "abstract": "As the global population grows and the climate changes, having a secure food supply is increasingly important especially under water stressed-conditions. Although irrigation is a positive climate adaptation mechanism for agriculture, it has a potentially negative effect on water resources. It is therefore important to understand how crop yields due to irrigation are affected by climate variability and how irrigation may buffer against climate, allowing for more resilient agricultural systems. Efforts to solve these barely exposed questions can benefit from comprehending the influence of climate variability on crop yield and irrigation water use in the past.\nTo do this, we use historical climate data，irrigation water use data and rainfed and irrigated crop yields over the US to analyze the relationship among climate, irrigation and delta crop yields, gained by subtracting rainfed yield from irrigated yield since 1970. We find that the increase in delta crop yield due to irrigation is larger for certain climate conditions, such that there are optimal climate conditions where irrigation provides a benefit and other conditions where irrigation proves to have marginal benefits when temperature increased to certain degrees. We find that crop water requirements are linked to potential evapotranspiration, yet actual irrigation water use is largely decoupled from the climate conditions but related with other causes. This has important implications for agricultural and water resource system planning, as it implies there are optimal climate zones where irrigation is productive and that changes in water use, both temporally and spatially, could lead to increased water availability without negative impacts on crop yields. Furthermore, based on the exposed relationship between crop yield gained by irrigation and climate variability, those models predicting the global harvest will be redress to estimate crop production in the future more accurately.",

Advances in reservoir stimulation, diverter, and monitoring are being tested in a hot (>300 C), dry well (NWG 55-29) drilled in 2008. These technologies could reduce the cost of electrical power generation. The project began in 2010 with two years of permitting, technical planning, and development of a project-specific Induced Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP), and is funded in part by the Department of Energy.\nIn 2012, the well was hydraulically stimulated with water at pressures below the principle stress for 7 weeks, resulting in hydroshearing. The depth of stimulation was successfully shifted by injection of two pills of Thermally-degradable Zonal Isolation Materials (TZIMs). Injectivity changes, thermal profiles and seismicity indicate that fracture permeability in well NWG 55-29 was enhanced during stimulation. This work successfully demonstrated the viability of large-volume (40,000 m3), low-pressure stimulation coupled with non-mechanical diverter technology, and microseismic monitoring for reservoir mapping. Further analysis and field testing in 2013 indicates further stimulation will be required in order to develop an economically viable reservoir, and is scheduled in 2014. The 2014 stimulation will use improved stimulation and monitoring equipment, better knowledge based on 2012 outcomes, and create a deep EGS reservoir in the hottest part of the wellbore.",

We will present a hybrid a hybrid pore/Darcy scale model based on the Multiscale Finite Volume (MsFV) method, which couples a Darcy-scale model with a MsFV characterization of transport in a region of the computational domain where the Darcy-scale is deficient or inaccurate. The considered examples include transport and mineral precipitation in fractures and porous media. The proposed model results in a significant reduction of computational effort with respect to pore-scale simulations, and increased accuracy with respect to Darcy-scale models.

            "abstract": "Having been at Saturn for over a decade, the MIMI instrument on Cassini has created a rich dataset containing many details about Saturn’s magnetosphere. In particular, the images of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) taken by the Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA) offer a global perspective on Saturn’s plasma environment. The MIMI team is now regularly making movies (in MP4 format) consisting of consecutive ENA images. The movies correct for spacecraft attitude changes by projecting the images (whose viewing angles can substantially vary from one image to the next) into a fixed inertial frame that makes it easy to view spatial features evolving in time. These movies are now being delivered to the PDS and are also available at the MIMI team web site. Several other higher order products are now also available, including 20-day energy-time spectrograms for the Charge-Energy-Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS) sensor, and daily energy-time spectrograms for the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurements system (LEMMS) sensor. All spectrograms are available as plots or digital data in ASCII format. For all MIMI sensors, a Data User Guide is also available. This paper presents details and examples covering the specifics of MIMI higher order data products.\nURL:\nhttp://cassini-mimi.jhuapl.edu/",

The model is based on the inversion of the Reynolds-averaged depth-averaged steady shallow water equations in streamline curvilinear coordinates and assumes a quadratic bottom drag law with a known spatially-uniform friction coefficient. Iterative techniques are used to invert the discretized algebraic system relating the water depth to local gradients of the depth-averaged velocity and the water surface elevation. Inversion tests with in situ measurements of water surface elevations and surface currents from a 2010 field experiment on the Kootenai River (ID) showed encouraging agreement between the measured and predicted bathymetry. In situ measurements of velocity depth profiles obtained with an acoustic Doppler current profiler are used to relate the measured surface currents to the depth-averaged velocity used in the 2D hydraulic model. The shorelines were extracted from video imagery and the surface currents were estimated from remotely sensed infrared imagery or measured in situ from drifters. The value of the friction coefficient was obtained from previous calibration simulations with a forward hydraulic model that minimized the difference between the predicted and measured velocity and water level on a set of points along the river channel.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, many anthropogenic pollutants have been successfully reduced, providing improved air quality. However, a new influx of emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing and natural gas operations could be counteracting some of these benefits. Using hourly measurements from Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) in the Baltimore, MD and Washington, D.C. areas, we observed that following a period of decline, daytime ethane concentrations have increased significantly since 2010. This trend appears to be linked with the rapid natural gas production in upwind, neighboring states, especially Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Furthermore, ethane concentrations failed to display this trend at a PAMS site outside of Atlanta, GA, a region without widespread natural gas operations.\nYear-to-year changes in VOCs were further evaluated by using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to perform source apportionment on hourly observations in Essex, MD from 2005-2013. This process takes ambient measurements and attributes them to sources such as biogenic, natural gas, industrial, gasoline, and vehicle exhaust by using tracer species as identifiers. Preliminary PMF results also indicate an increasing influence of natural gas sources for this area.",

            "abstract": "Charge development on mineral surfaces is an important control on the fate of minor and trace elements in a wide range of environments, including in possible radioactive waste repositories. Formation waters have often a high ionic strength. In this study, we determined the zeta potential (ζ) of anatase in potassium chloride solutions with concentrations up to 3M (25°C). The zeta potential is the potential at the hydrodynamic shear plane. In this study, we made use of the electro-acoustic effect. This effect is based on the development of a measureable potential/current when the electrical double layer outside the shearplane is separated from a charged particle through rapid oscillation induced by a sound wave. The advantage of this type of measurement is that the particles are not subjected to a high electric field (common to typical zeta potential measurements), which leads to electrode reactions and a shift of solution pH.\nMeasurements were collected by subtracting the ion vibration current (IVI) due to the presence of potassium and chloride ions from the CVI. The correction is necessary for measurements in solutions with I > 0.25 M. This subtraction was done at each of the measurement conditions by centrifuging the slurrly, measuring the IVI of the supernatant, reconstituting the slurry, and then measuring CVI of the slurry. Subtraction of IVI at each condition is critical because IVI changes with pH and accounts for most of raw signal.\nThe results show that the anatase isoelectric point shifts from a pH ~6.5 to a value of ~4.5 at 1M KCl. At ionic strength in excess of 1 M KCl, the surface appears to be slightly negatively charged accross the pH range accessible by this technique (pH 2.5-10). The loss of an isoelectric point suggests that KCl is no longer an indifferent electrolyte at 1 M KCl and higher. The results are in disagreement with earlier measurements in which anatase was shown to have a positive charge at high ionic strength across the pH scale. The difference between the current and earlier work is likely a result of the IVI correction. While anatase is unlikely to be of importance in a waste environment, the work provides a method to determine charge on more relevant mineral surfaces. This can then lead to a better representation of the fate for radionuclides in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "Recent statistical studies have revealed with greater resolution the time and distance distributions of strokes within a lightning flash. Stroke to flash clustering algorithms stand to benefit greatly from the results of this research. The goal of this study is to develop a novel stroke to flash clustering algorithm that more accurately captures the observed patterns in cloud to ground (CG) lightning. First, we compare previous algorithms using National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) stroke data through statistical methods with the assumption that flash inter-arrival times should be uniform. With this result and the knowledge of the distance versus time distributions of strokes, we propose a new algorithm to cluster strokes into flashes that preserves the uniformity of flash inter-arrival times. This novel algorithm allows for further studies of lightning flashes without added bias from previous stroke to flash clustering methods. One such investigation involves recent studies on spatially separated storms and storm cells that exhibit flash synchronization due to electrical coupling. We use our newly developed algorithm to further explore the validity of this phenomenon. Our results show that the new method to cluster strokes to flashes successfully results in uniform flash inter-arrival times and also fails to find any significant link or synchronicity with regards to storm coupling.",

            "abstract": "Hodell et al. (2001) suggested that carbonate preservation in the deep Cape Basin represented a qualitative, high-resolution record of the temporal evolution of the carbonate saturation state of the deep sea. The carbonate signal reflects both transient events in the redistribution of alkalinity and DIC in the deep ocean and steady-state mass balance processes. Here we re-analyzed the carbonate records of Sites 1089/TN057-21 using an Avaatech XRF core scanner and measured elemental variations at 2.5-mm resolution for the past 400 kyrs. Log Ca/Ti is highly correlated to weight percent carbonate content and other dissolution proxies and resolves millennial-scale events in carbonate preservation. A high-pass filter removes the low-frequency (orbital) variability in carbonate preservation, which is attributed mainly to steady-state mass balance processes. The high-frequency (suborbital) component reflects transient responses to the redistribution of carbonate ion that is related mainly to changing deep-water circulation.\nDuring the last glacial period, distinct millennial-scale increases in carbonate preservation in piston core TN057-21 occurred during times of enhanced Atlantic Meridional Overtunring Circulation (AMOC) (Barker et al., 2010; Barker and Diz, 2014), as supported by increases in benthic δ13C and less radiogenic εNd values. Carbonate preservation peaked particularly during long, warm interstadials in Greenland when a deep water mass with high carbonate ion concentration was formed in the North Atlantic. Export of NADW may have been greater than the Holocene during some of these events (“overshoots”) and/or preformed carbonate ion concentrations in North Atlantic source areas may have been higher owing to lower atmospheric CO2 and less carbonate production in surface water. Each South Atlantic carbonate peak is associated with the start of Antarctic cooling and declining or leveling of atmospheric CO2, reflecting the signature of a thermal bipolar seesaw. The increased flux of carbonate ion to the Southern Ocean during strong interstadials may have played a role in titrating respiratory CO2, thereby slowing CO2 degassing to the atmosphere and providing a secondary mechanism, in addition to heat transport, for interhemispheric coupling on millennial time scales.",

Controls on soil production rate set this important characteristic, however, relative roles of these controls have not been quantitatively assessed. I take advantage of uniform lithology and climate on anenigmatic perched, low-relief high elevation landscape in the Pinaleno Mountains in southeastern Arizona to examine controls of formation and preservation of the upper, low-relief soil mantled landscape. This landscape is sharply bounded on all sides by steep, rugged terrain where soil cover is patchy but pervasive. Knickpoints appear along channel profiles around the edges of the low-relief landscape, suggesting a transient response to some tectonic disturbance, either due to rock uplift and basin subsidence during Basin and Range tectonic forcing, or more recent base-level drop in adjacent drainage systems. Slow erosion rates recently measured along the flanks of this range support the hypothesis that this upper transient surface has been preserved after a late Miocene-Pliocene basin and range disturbance that has since been followed by slow topographic decay.\nTo shed light on the processes driving weathering, soil production and erosion in this landscape that maintains steep, rocky catchments only below knickpoints on channels draining the upper low-relief landscape, we utilize high-resolution soil thickness measurements coupled with terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide soil production rate measurements. In order to determine soil thicknesses at the high-resolution scale useful to describe hillslope process, we utilize shallow seismic survey data, calibrated by soil pit measurements of soil down through saprolite and fractured bedrock. Broadly applicable, these high-resolution soil thickness measurements coupled with soil production and erosion rate data can be useful disentangle relationships among catchment-mean erosion rate, mean soil thickness, and soil production efficiency.",

The effort includes constitutive material behavior of the rock, the optimal means for representing the granite joint response, and the best modeling approach for including both the high-deformation source region and the complex material response in the near field. Each of these factors contributes to better estimates of explosion to seismic phenomena to help the verification community. We illustrate the transition of results from increasing modeling fidelity from one-dimensional (1-D) modeling which simplifies both the source geometry and the geologic character to full, detailed three-dimensional (3-D) modeling. Both levels of modeling include an accepted explosive source model and a laboratory test-based constitutive mode for the intact granite. But the full 3-D model also explicitly models the cylindrically-shaped explosive in a grout filled borehole as well as explicit representation of rock joints as contact surfaces. These modeling attributes provide for an excellent match to recorded velocity measurements in both amplitude and character. But as explicit modeling of joints is currently impractical for a large rock volume, we modify the laboratory intact properties to implicitly include the effects of joints such as in the method of Hoek and Brown to develop a credible predictive methodology for a large region.",

Here, we present the first detailed glacial geomorphic map of Río Tranquilo valley (47° S), which provide the basis for the reconstruction of the glacial and paleoclimatic history of the region. Río Tranquilo is a valley glacier located in the northern flank of Mount San Lorenzo, an isolated granitic massif, ~95 km to the east of the southern limit of the Northern Patagonian Icefield (NPI). Based on analysis of aerial photographs, satellite imagery and field-checking, we identified glacial landforms, including moraine, moraine ridges, outwash plain, proglacial lake and trimlines. We also included other non-glacial geomorphic features, such as deltas, rivers, lakes, alluvial fans, fluvial terraces, scarps and landslides. Preliminary 10Be ages suggest that all the glacial landforms identified here were deposited during the Late-Glacial and throughout the Holocene. Geomorphic evidence shows at least four periods of glacial stabilization. Identification of these multiples advances may hold implications for the design and interpretation of a dating programme.

However, as society becomes more vulnerable to drought and climate change threatens to increase water scarcity, it is clear that drought research would benefit from a more interdisciplinary approach. To assess avoided drought impacts from reduced climate change, drought risks need to be assessed in the context of both climate prediction as well as improved understanding of socio-cultural processes. To this end, this study explores a risk-based framework to combine physical drought likelihoods with perceived risks from stakeholder interviews. Results are presented from a case study on how stakeholders in south-central Oklahoma perceive drought risks given diverse cultural beliefs, water uses, and uncertainties in future drought prediction. Stakeholder interviews (n=38) were conducted in 2012 to understand drought risks to various uses of water, as well as to measure worldviews from the cultural theory of risk – a theory that explains why people perceive risks differently, potentially leading to conflict over management decisions. For physical drought risk, drought projections are derived from a large ensemble of future climates generated from two RCPs that represent higher and lower emissions trajectories (i.e., RCP8.5 and RCP4.5). These are used to develop a Combined Drought Risk Matrix (CDRM) that characterizes drought risks for different water uses as the products of both physical likelihood (from the climate ensemble) and risk perception (from the interviews). We use the CRDM to explore the avoided drought risks posed to various water uses, as well as to investigate the potential for reduction of conflict over water management.",

            "abstract": "We have applied supervised learning with random decision forests (RDF) to estimate, or predict, a global, densely spaced grid of crustal heat flow. The results are similar to global heat flow predictions that have been previously published but are more accurate and offer higher resolution. The training inputs are measurement values and uncertainties of existing sparsely sampled, (~8,000 locations), geographically biased, yet globally extensive, datasets of crustal heat flow. The RDF estimate is a highly non-linear empirical relationship between crustal heat flow and dozens of other parameters (attributes) that we have densely sampled, global, estimates of (e.g., crustal age, water depth, crustal thickness, seismic sound speed, seafloor temperature, sediment thickness, and sediment grain type). Synthetic attributes were key to obtaining good results using the RDF method. We created synthetic attributes by applying physical intuition and statistical analyses to the fundamental attributes. Statistics include median, kurtosis, and dozens of other functions, all calculated at every node and averaged over a variety of ranges from 5 to 500km. Other synthetic attributes are simply plausible, (e.g., distance from volcanoes, seafloor porosity, mean grain size). More than 600 densely sampled attributes are used in our prediction, and for each we estimated their relative importance. The important attributes included all those expected from geophysics, (e.g., inverse square root of age, gradient of depth, crustal thickness, crustal density, sediment thickness, distance from trenches), and some unexpected but plausible attributes, (e.g., seafloor temperature), but none that were unphysical. The simplicity of the RDF technique may also be of great interest beyond the discipline of crustal heat flow as it allows for more geologically intelligent predictions, decreasing the effect of sampling bias, and improving predictions in regions with little or no data, while rigorously estimating the uncertainty of the result.",

With the rapid advancement in gravity instrumentation in geosciences, it is realistic to envision space-borne systems that can measure the gravity field or its spatial gradients produced by asteroids in the near future. Such systems have related applications in planetary studies and in space resource exploration. It is therefore important to understand the information content in such data and the feasibility of imaging and characterizing asteroids using this emerging technology. Toward this goal, we focus on gravity gradiometry and carry out numerical simulations to understand the variation of gravity gradient tensors produced by asteroids, evaluate the signal strength due to the interior variation of density, and to assess the feasibility of imaging the internal structure through the reconstruction of density variation from measured gravity gradiometry data. We forward model the gravity gradiometry response from near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros by assuming a uniform density and observation points on spherical orbits at different distances. We also introduce synthetic density structure to assess the corresponding anomaly strengths. As a second example, we apply the simulation to 25143 Itokawa, which is known to have a strong internal density differential, and investigate the potential of directly imaging the transition between the two segments with strong density contrast.",

            "abstract": "Dayside magnetic reconnection plays a major role in the global dynamics of the magnetosphere as it interacts with the solar wind. Global MHD simulations typically use finite resistivity to mediate reconnection; however, in realistic parameters, resistive scales are significantly smaller than ion scales. Previously, 2-D studies have shown that including ion scale physics through the Hall term in the generalized Ohm's law can dramatically alter dynamics and reconnection rates when compared with resistive MHD models. In this study, we use OpenGGCM to investigate magnetopause reconnection at high Lundquist numbers with synthetic solar wind conditions. OpenGGCM has recently been extended to include a van-Leer constrained-transport numerical scheme (Stone 2008) similar to that used in the Athena code. We compare global simulations with asymmetric 2-D cases where, unlike in the magnetopause, flux tubes are not free to advect around the diffusion region. We also show how the Hall term affects the structure of flux transfer events.",

            "abstract": "To infer the occurrence of directional amplification effects, we performed ambient noise measurements along a 200m transect crossing the Campo Imperatore fault zone (Central Italy), an exhumed analogue of the faults responsible of the L'Aquila 2009 earthquake sequence,\nWe have recently found in several fault zones that ambient noise is not randomly polarized, but it is amplified on the horizontal plane along a specific site-dependent direction. The analysis repeated using earthquake signals revealed that S-coda waves and surface waves show the same polarization direction, independently of the earthquake backazimuth and focal mechanism. We have explained the observed directional amplifications in terms of fractured rocks in the fault damage zone, polarization being oriented orthogonally to fractures produced by the kinematic stress component. Therefore ground motion directional amplification could be related to the higher compliance of fractured rocks.\nIn the other studies the fracture pattern was derived from numerical-analytical modeling based on the fault geometry and kinematics, or compared with the fast direction of shear wave obtained by seismic anisotropy analysis. The aim of this study is to compare observations with fracture measurements (strike, dip, dip-azimuth, spacing, later continuity, etc.) performed in the selected fault zone. We thus acquired ambient noise using 25 stations installed along a transect where detailed structural geological measurements were carried out. Ambient noise was recorded for around 1 hour, and was processed to compute the horizontal-to-vertical noise spectral ratio as a function of frequency and direction of motion. Wavefield polarization was investigated in the time–frequency domain as well.\nWe found that, in spite of the complexity of the seismic data, the observed polarization pattern is generally oriented orthogonal to the measured dominant fracture system, confirming the existence of a high angle relation between ground motion polarization and fracture systems.",

            "abstract": "Several icy moons of the outer solar system carry subsurface oceans containing many times the volume of liquid water on Earth and may provide the greatest volume of habitable space in our solar system. Functional sub-ice polar ecosystems on Earth provide compelling models for the habitability of extraterrestrial sub-ice oceans. A key feature of sub-ice environments is that most of them receive little to no solar energy. Consequently, organisms inhabiting these environments must rely on chemical energy to assimilate either carbon dioxide or organic molecules to support their metabolism. Methane can be utilized by certain bacteria as both a carbon and energy source. Isotopic data show that methane in Earth’s polar lakes is derived from both biogenic and thermogenic sources. Thermogenic sources of methane in the thermokarst lakes of the north slope of Alaska yield supersaturated water columns during winter ice cover that support active populations of methanotrophs during the polar night. Methane in the permanently ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica varies widely in concentration and is produced either by contemporary methanogenesis or is a relic from subglacial flow. Rate measurements revealed that microbial methane oxidation occurs beneath the ice in both the arctic and Antarctic lakes. The first samples collected from an Antarctic subglacial environment beneath 800 m of ice (Subglacial Lake Whillans) revealed an active microbial ecosystem that has been isolated from the atmosphere for many thousands of years. The sediments of Lake Whillans contained high levels of methane with an isotopic signature that indicates it was produced via methanogenesis. The source of this methane appears to be from the decomposition of organic carbon deposited when this region of Antarctica was covered by the sea. Collectively, data from these sub-ice environments show that methane transformations play a key role in microbial community metabolism. The discovery of functional microbial ecosystems in Earth’s sub-ice aquatic environments together with what we know about the geochemistry of extraterrestrial ice-covered water worlds provide a compelling case that sub-ice oceans, such as those on Europa and Enceladus, may support microbial life.",

            "abstract": "The lunar Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission has provided a global gravity field of unparalleled resolution. There has been a strong scientific effort to understand the Bouguer anomalies (BA) of complex lunar craters (cf., impact basins) so that they can be used as probes of both the lunar crust and the cratering process itself [Phillips et al., 2012]. One of the key challenges in understanding the signal associated with craters has been separating out the background anomaly. We use a database of >1000 craters with the gravity and topography cutoff at degree and order 600. We focus on intermediate-sized craters with a diameter range of ~30–150 km. With this database, we compare different methods of isolating the crater anomaly, including subtracting the mean BA of a background annulus and spectral high-pass filtering. Specifically we set the minimum degree of expansion, lmin, to (2πR0)/(n·D) where R0 is the lunar radius, D is the crater diameter, and n is an integer between 3 and 6. We find that by scaling the background annulus and n as shown in Table 1, the two methods are in very close agreement.\nTable 1\nBackground Annulus\nn\n1.0r ↔ 1.5r\n3\n1.5r ↔ 2.0r\n4\n2.0r ↔ 2.5r\n5\n2.5r ↔ 3.0r\n6\nMonte Carlo simulations are used to test the hypothesis that the crater Bouguer anomalies are due to the pre-existing density structure of the crust or processing artifacts. These simulations have shown that the magnitude of a Bouguer anomaly (by either method of background signal removal) scales with the diameter used and is not diagnostic of the cratering process. We infer this behavior is due to the strong redness (power increases with wavelength) of the Bouguer spectrum.\nWe have also found robust regional differences, including a high predominance of craters with associated negative Bouguer anomalies in South Pole Aitken basin.\nPhillips, R.

            "abstract": "Land-atmosphere coupling was long thought not to be strong enough to have a profound effect on climatic conditions during colder months. Hence, while the impact of land-atmosphere coupling on summer is well documented, its effect on spring, winter and fall is less well established. In particular, soil moisture could be influenced by the considerable amount of snow/ice melt that occur during spring, which makes it an ideal season to investigate further. Here, we use the 5th Generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) to run coupled simulations, where the land and the atmosphere are allowed to interact freely, and uncoupled simulations, where the soil moisture content is prescribed, to evaluate the strength of land-atmosphere coupling and its impact on present and future spring climate over North America. Analysis of the coupled and uncoupled simulations reveal that soil moisture/temperature coupling in spring is indeed strong over the Great Plains but weaker over the same areas compared to summer under present climatic conditions. It is also strong over the Canadian Prairies in May, which is a transition month between spring and summer. Strong land-atmosphere coupling during transition periods could therefore be analogous to transition zones between dry and wet climates that were the land-atmosphere hotspots identified in the GLACE experiment. This study thus provides insight on the seasonal evolution of land-atmosphere coupling strength and its impact on extremes over North America.",

The atmospheric conditions tested represent those typically found in semi-arid and arid climates and the soil conditions simulate the three stages of evaporation. The data generated will help identify the importance of different soil conditions and atmospheric forcings with respect to land-atmospheric interactions which will have direct implications on future numerical studies investigating the effects of turbulent air flow on evaporation.\nThe experimental datasets generated for this study were performed using a unique climate controlled closed-circuit wind tunnel/porous media facility located at the Center for Experimental Study of Subsurface Environmental Processes (CESEP) at the Colorado School of Mines. The test apparatus consisting of a 7.3 m long porous media tank and wind tunnel, were outfitted with a sensor network to carefully measure wind velocity, air and soil temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and soil air pressure. Boundary layer measurements were made between the heights of 2 and 500 mm above the soil tank under constant conditions (i.e. wind velocity, temperature, relative humidity). The soil conditions (e.g. soil type, soil moisture) were varied between datasets to analyze their impact on the boundary layers.\nExperimental results show that the momentum boundary layer is very sensitive to the applied atmospheric conditions and soil conditions to a much less extent. Increases in velocity above porous media leads to momentum boundary layer thinning and closely reflect classical flat plate theory. The mass and thermal boundary layers are directly dependent on both atmospheric and soil conditions. Air pressure within the soil is independent of atmospheric temperature and relative humidity – wind velocity and soil moisture effects were observed. This data provides important insight into future work of accurately modeling the exchange processes associated with evaporation under various turbulent atmospheric conditions.",

            "abstract": "Sargassum is an important and protected genus of pelagic macroalgae that serves as habitat for numerous bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, fish, and sea turtles. Sargassum and its associated communities are also a significant source of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus to the otherwise deficient oligotrophic pelagic waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The densest concentration of pelagic Sargassum, primarily comprised of Sargassum natans and S. fluitans, is found in the North Atlantic Central Gyre of the Sargasso Sea, but large quantities are also found in the waters of the continental shelf of the southeastern United States and especially the western edge of the Florida Current/Gulf Stream, including off the coast of North Carolina. This western edge of the Gulf Stream off the North Carolina coast is also of interest for renewable current energy exploration and development because of the constant flow of the Gulf Stream current in close proximity to land at this location, which presents a potential source of substantial baseload power for the east coast of the United States.\nMarine hydrokinetic turbines placed in the Gulf Stream will likely be placed at depths of 30 to 50 m below the surface of the water, far removed from buoyant Sargassum that floats at the surface of the water and associated fish assemblages that extend to a depth of 3 m. Nonetheless, Gulf Stream turbines may influence the functional roles of Sargassum and its epibionts because the wakes generated by turbines will change turbulence conditions in the water column, which are in turn likely to affect nutrient cycling and productivity.\nOur research begins to examine how alterations of the Sargassum environment presented by increased turbulence will affect the productivity, nitrogen fixation, and organic matter fluxes of Sargassum macroalgae and their associated epibiotic communities. We have conducted field and laboratory experiments aimed at quantifying the influence of increased turbulence on the productivity and nutrient cycling roles that Sargassum plays in the pelagic marine environment. Methodologies and preliminary results of our ongoing research will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Los Alamos National Laboratory is standing up a new program to address the mitigation of a potentially hazardous objects (PHO) by using nuclear explosives. A series of efforts at Los Alamos have been working this problem for the last few years in an informal fashion. We now have a funded program to dedicate time to this important mission. The goal of our project is to study the effectiveness of using a nuclear explosive to mitigate (alter orbit or destroy) an PHO on an Earth crossing path. We are also pursuing studies of impact hazards should the international leadership decide not to organize a mission for active mitigation of a PHO. Such impact hazards are characterized as local, regional or global. Impact hazards include: a direct hit in an urban area (potentially catastrophic but highly unlikely); the generation a significant tsunami from an ocean impact close to a coastline and regional and global effects from medium to large impactors. Previous studies at Los Alamos have looked at 2D and 3D simulations in the deep ocean from large bolides, as well as impacts that have global consequences. More recent work has included radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of momentum transfer (and enhancement) from a low energy (10 kt) stand-off source, as well as surface and subsurface high energy explosions (100 kt - 10 Mt) for example PHOs. The current program will carefully look at two main aspects of using a standoff nuclear source: 1) a computational study for the optimum height-of-burst (HOB) of a stand-off burst using our best energy coupling techniques for both neutrons and x-rays; and 2) as a function of the nuclear energy produced and the HOB what is the optimum energy field: neutrons or x-rays. This team is also working with NNSA and NASA Goddard to compare numerical results for these complicated simulations on a well defined series of test problems involving both kinetic impactors and stand-off nuclear energy sources. Results will be shown by the co-authors on individual aspects of these simulations.",

            "abstract": "The first scientific dives of the new Nereid Under Ice (NUI) hybrid ROV were conducted in the Arctic Ocean in July 2014 on RV Polarstern cruise PS86, a German-US collaboration. NUI is the latest in a family of vehicles derived from the Nereus prototype, using a single optical fiber to provide real-time telemetry to and from a battery-powered vehicle allowing much greater lateral maneuverability relative to its support ship than a conventional ROV. During PS86, dives conducted in the Arctic Ocean (typical water depths ~4000m) were completed in >80% ice cover beneath multi-year ice that was typically 2-4m thick (increasing to depths of up to 20m beneath ridges). Dives extended up to 800m away from the ship and, over dive durations of approximately 5 hours each, covered survey tracklines of up to 3.7km at depths varying from “landing” on the underside of the sea-ice to maximum depths of 45m to conduct upward looking multibeam sonar mapping. Ultimately, the vehicle will be capable of both AUV and ROV mode operations at ranges of 10-20km away from the support ship and at up to 2000m water depth (including seafloor as well as under ice operations). During the current cruise, the following major science suites were utilized to prove a range of scientific capabilities of the vehicle in ice-covered oceans: multibeam mapping of rugged topography beneath multi-year sea-ice; video- and digital still photography of the under side of the ice, biota associated with the ice-water interface (algal material) and abundant fauna in the immediately underlying water column (ctenophores, larvaceans, copepods were all notable for their abundance in our study site over the Gakkel Ridge near 83N, 6W). Other scientific activities included: vertical profiles combining CTD data with a suite of biosensors to investigate the structure of primary productivity and biogeochemical cycling in minimally distrubed areas of the sunlit under-ice water column, revealing high stratification associated with meltwater formation; lateral surveys of radiance and irradiance (together with co-registered measurements on top of the same ice-floe on our last dive) to investigate light availability and variability as a function of ice-cover. We will present examples of each of these data sets, together with an outline of suggested future activities that NUI could pursue.",

            "abstract": "The interaction of aseismic ridges or buoyant crust in subduction zones can affect the volcanism occurring on the overriding plate. Here we describe the affect of the subduction of an aseismic ridge on volcanism in the NE Lesser Antilles. The Lesser Antilles island arc is a result of westward subduction of the North American plate beneath the Caribbean plate and stretches 800 km from Saba in the north to Grenada in the south. From Guadeloupe northwards, the arc bifurcates into an eastern, inactive arc (known as the Limestone Caribees) and a western, active arc (Volcanic Caribees). It has been suggested that this bifurcation is the result of the subduction of buoyant crust in the form of at least two aseismic ridges, in the North American plate.\nIn 2012, IODP Expedition 340 recovered 130 m of core from site U1396, located 55 km SW of Montserrat, Lesser Antilles. The core contains a detailed record of volcanism, in the form of more than 180 tephra layers, that stretches back nearly 4.5 Ma. This is the longest and most complete record of volcanism for the NE Lesser Antilles and provides insight into the evolution and development of the island arc in this region. A variety of techniques are being applied to the tephra layers from U1396 to determine their age, chemistry, components and origin. Here we present preliminary results from paeleomagnetic age determinations for each tephra layer to show how the subduction of aseismic ridges on the North American plate has affected the rate of volcanism and development of the island arc in the NE Lesser Antilles over the last 4.5 Ma.",

Much less frequent are the cases where the same gravity wave is observed in the mesopause and in the thermosphere. One of the reasons for this is the absorption that occurs in the intermediate region. A whole year of airglow observations conducted in southern Brazil (29°26' S, 53°49' W) has been analyzed to investigate the gravity waves. The data was acquired by an all-sky imager using filters for sodium, 555.7, 777.4 and 630 nm oxygen emissions from March 2011 to April 2012. Preliminary results show more than 300 gravity waves observed mainly in the O5 and sodium layers. However, less than 10 cases were identified as waves observed both in O5 and/or sodium and in the O6 band (in the thermosphere). In those specific cases the waves have the same general horizontal propagation direction, toward N-NW. Further analyses concerning the parameters and similarities of this kind of gravity wave as well as the possible reasons for the preferred propagation direction will be discussed.",

During the period of 2009-2014 occurred one extrusion inside the dome that was growth in 2007 originating deformations that will be analysed and compared with deformations measured before during the period of 1998-2007. Four dome extrusions have occurred during the recent activity stage from 1998-2014. During period of domes growth we show deformation of the Volcano edifice with sequences of inflation- deflation registered with a Tiltmeter net composed of 5 sensors deployed around the edifice. Measurements of deformation tilt changes during the period 2004-2014 at Volcán de Colima were characterized by a sequence of effusive-explosive episodes. These sequences occurred on October 2004, February 2007 and January 2014 were registered by sequences of inflation-deflation principally. The tiltmeter net used in this study is composed of 5 sensors installed around the volcano edifice at altitudes of 3060 masl (COIA), 3200 masl (PCJ1), 2590 masl (PC02), 2200 masl (EHJ1) and 2070 masl (PC01). The activity of Volcán de Colima during this period 1998-2014 can be summarized by the occurrence of four lava domes formed in November 1998, October 2004, February 2007, and January 2014. During this activity phase explosive sequences occurred in years 2005, 2012 and 2014. After the extrusion on February 2007 a deflation phase is registered with the tilt sensors until 2012 which explain the low activity that characterize the behavior of the volcano during these periods of time. Here we show the analysis of the activity during the 2009-2014 and compare the deformations surveys during these period with the occurred during the complete recent period of activity 1998-2014. This comparison is important to forecast the developing of the activity and help to prevent the volcanic Risk of the Population located around the volcanic edifice.",

This microthermometry, LA-ICP-MS, Raman spectroscopy, and crush-leach study of fluid inclusions in pegmatite quartz aims to discern the chemical variations of late-stage pegmatite fluids in relation to gem mineralization. We studied five mines from three San Diego Co. districts: Chihuahua Valley (C), Jacumba (J), and Pala (P). The ~100 Ma old, 1-10 m thick, subparallel magma sheets intruded plutons of the Peninsular Ranges Batholith or prebatholitic metasediments at an estimated pressure of 200-300 MPa. The pegmatites formed sequentially, from outer zones with comb, layered, and graphic quartz-feldspar textures at the magmatic stage to massive cores and miarolitic pockets at a late, fluid-saturated stage. Pocket quartz was analyzed from pegmatites of variable host rock, magmatic mineral assemblages, and known gem production.\nThe inclusions contained two-phase aqueous fluids and no CO2 or other gases. Fluid salinity ranged from 0.5 to 8.6 wt.% NaCl eq. and correlated positively with inclusion homogenization temperature. Isochoric T at 250 MPa calculated for primary and pseudosecondary inclusions in pocket quartz ranged from 280 to 500 °C in district P, 310-420°C in J, and 230-290°C in C. We attribute the higher T of pocket formation in districts P and J to higher surrounding T at emplacement caused by proximity to other dikes.\nThis preliminary study suggests that gem elbaite and/or kunzite occurrence correlates to Li and B contents in the pocket fluid, which, in turn, are a function of consumption by early, magmatic minerals. The P district has a simple leucogranite mineralogy at the magmatic stage; has as much as 5760 ppm B and 4950 ppm Li in the pocket fluid; and produced both elbaite and kunzite. The J district has abundant magmatic tourmaline; has only 3800 ppm B but up to 4700 ppm Li in the fluid; and produced only kunzite. The C district has no tourmaline in the outer zones; widely variable B and Li; and produced sporadic elbaite but no kunzite. In addition, variations in fluid chemistry and productivity along dike strike in district J is attributed to a change from gabbroic to metasedimentary host rocks.",

            "abstract": "The Canadian Prairies are home to 75% of Canada’s irrigated agriculture. This is supported by the historically reliable streamflow regime in the South Saskatchewan River (SSR), which is initiated from snowmelt on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. This streamflow regime, however, is facing various changes. Most obviously, post-settlement water resource management in the prairies has intensively regulated the timing and volume of natural streamflows. Moreover, the natural streamflow regime in the SSR exhibits large inter-annual variability, influenced by the phases of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Finally, some other sources of climate variability have recently resulted in significant shifts in the timing and volume of the regional streamflow, associated with changes in the form and timing of precipitation as well as variations in annual snow accumulation and melt in headwater catchments. By considering five unregulated and three regulated streams, we formally diagnose the post-settlement drivers of variability in the SSR’s streamflow regime using various statistical tests. Our results show that long-term variations in the SSR streamflow timing and volume can be described by complex interactions among the PDO, human regulation and non-PDO sources of climate variability. For instance, human regulation can intensify the variations in annual streamflow volume during extreme PDO conditions, and non-PDO sources of climate variability can be masked by the effects of PDO and/or human regulation. Changes in the annual streamflow timing can be linked to human regulation and non-PDO sources of climate variability; in particular, human regulation is the main driver of recent dependence between annual streamflow timing and volume. Our findings have major importance for water security assessment in the Canadian Prairies and contribute to better understanding of feedbacks in coupled Natural-Human water systems during the current Anthropocene.",

            "abstract": "Early depletion of Fe during magmatic differentiation is a characteristic of many arc magmas, and this may drive them towards the bulk composition of continental crust. In the Alaska-Aleutian arc, magmas are strongly Fe-depleted both in the east, where the arc sits atop pre-existing continental crust, and in the west, where the system is oceanic but convergence is highly oblique. Primary basaltic arc magmas may achieve early Fe depletion through a combination of high magmatic H2O, which delays silicate saturation, and high oxygen fugacity (fO2), which promotes early onset of Fe-oxide crystallization. Alternatively, low-Fe, high Mg# magmas may emerge directly from the arc mantle, possibly due to slab melting, driving mixing with Fe-rich basaltic magmas. Yet, the relative importance of H2O, fO2, and magmatic bulk composition in generating Fe-depletion is not clearly resolved. Here, we present new measurements of the oxidation state of Fe (Fe3+/∑Fe ratio; a proxy for magmatic fO2), in combination with major element and volatile data, of olivine-hosted melt inclusions from four Alaska-Aleutian arc volcanoes (Okmok, Seguam, Korovin, Augustine), acquired using XANES spectroscopy. We use the Tholeiitic Index (THI) of Zimmer et al., 2010 to quantify the behavior of Fe in each volcano magma series (<1 is Fe-depleted, >1 is Fe-enriched). These volcanoes span a range of THI, from 0.9-0.65. The Fe3+/∑Fe ratios of Aleutian basalts, corrected for fractional crystallization to 6 wt.% MgO (i.e., Fe3+/∑Fe6.0) range from 0.22-0.31 and correlate strongly with THI (r2>0.99), such that more Fe-depleted magmas contain a greater proportion of oxidized Fe. The maximum dissolved H2O contents of basaltic melt inclusions from these volcanoes also strongly correlate with THI (r2>0.96), and with measured Fe3+/∑Fe ratios (although H2O is not the direct cause of oxidation). These links point to a slab-derived origin of both H2O and oxidation and thus relate slab fluxes to the Fe-depletion trends of arc magmas. These correlations also illustrate the difficulty of separating the effects of H2O and fO2 on arc magmatic differentiation, as the two are challenging to isolate in nature. Analysis of experimental data, however, suggest that fO2 exhibits stronger control than H2O on the relative appearance of spinel and silicates on the liquidus.",

            "abstract": "Ecosystem disturbances come in multiple forms, impact various extents and last different amounts of time. Areas can be affected by one or multiple disturbances at any given time. Vegetation time series provide the means to examine conditions leading up to a disturbance event, during an incident and how a region recovers after the disruption. Using the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) package for R, 250m 16-day composite Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series were analyzed to examine drought and fire events. Case studies were conducted to focus in on different disturbances in parts of the western United States. The 2002 drought in Arizona and the subsequent Rodeo-Chediski fire were used to test how BFAST handles drought and post-fire recovery trends. Edwards Plateau was used to focus in on the 2011 drought in Texas. We used BFAST to examine extreme breaks and trends in the vegetation time series along with more subtle changes. We also used pre-disturbance, post-disturbance and temporal anomaly analysis to show when and where landscape changes occurred. This was done in concert with short term and longer multi-year trend analysis to determine the magnitude of these changes and how recovery differed based on disturbance regimes and agents. Some issues arose when dealing with areas impacted by snow. Gradual upward and downward trends in vegetation were distinguished compared to more extreme trends characterized by landscape response to disturbances. This analysis creates the foundation to assess the impact current droughts could have on vegetation measurements. We are also able to examine past fire events and determine how long recovery is taking in order to forecast how long it will take similar regions to recover after more recent wildfires.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and predicting the initiation and subsequent growth of ENSO events has proven exceptionally challenging, particularly from the dynamical perspective. Often, the inherent complexities of the coupled system prove a substantial hurdle in determining why, on a mechanistic level, certain ENSO events are initiated and the associated uncertainty can be difficult to quantify. To isolate the initiation process, we present a state-of-the-art coupled climate model framework to isolate the unstable growth of ENSO events via dynamically coupled instabilities. Earlier studies show that sufficiently strong air-sea coupling can destabilize ocean waves and initiate ENSO events. The presented model framework allows for coupled instabilities to grow under a fully coupled climate model configuration, which modernizes earlier approaches implemented with highly simplified models. An ensemble of NCAR-CCSM4 experiments is integrated for various initialization months and results show that the experimental design successfully captures the growth of ENSO events from small, random perturbations that are not prescribed. Additionally, these particular events occur in the absence of a previous ENSO event, without a subsurface heat content precursor in the western Pacific, and without wind stress “trigger patterns” characterized by large deterministic components, all of which tend to bias the coupled state towards a particular ENSO phase. The occurrence and type of event may be sensitive to the initialized state and we demonstrate that the ENSO growth rate displays strong seasonal characteristics as well as dependence on the initialization month. We also quantify the skill saturation and show that there exists a well-defined seasonal limit to growth.",

            "abstract": "Concentrations of redox-sensitive elements (S, Mn, Mo, U, Cd, Re) were analyzed in a set of 27 sediment cores collected along a section extending from the North Bering Sea to Davis Strait via the Canadian Archipelago. Sedimentary distributions and accumulation rates of the elements were used to document the early diagenetic properties of North American Arctic margin sediments and to estimate the importance of this margin as a sink for key elements in the Arctic and global ocean. Distributions of Mn, total S and reduced inorganic S demonstrated that most sediments had relatively thick (>1 cm) surface oxic layers underlain by weakly reducing conditions, reflecting limited sulphate reduction. Strongly reducing conditions sufficient for significant sulphate reduction and strong sedimentary pyrite burial occurred only in certain subregions, including the Bering-Chukchi Shelves, shallow portions of Barrow Canyon, and, to a lesser extent, Lancaster Sound. Estimated accumulation rates of authigenic S, Mo, Cd and U, and total Re displayed marked spatial variability related to sedimentary redox conditions. Strong relationships between the accumulation rates and vertical carbon flux, estimated from regional primary production values and water depth at the coring sites, indicate that the primary driver in the regional patterns is variation in labile carbon forcing. After accounting for the influence of carbon flux, authigenic Mo accumulation rates show a significant relationship with vascular plant input to the sediments, implying that terrestrial organic matter contributes to supporting metabolism in Arctic margin sediments. In the Chukchi Shelf, where our cores represent a sizeable area (~140,000 km2), and where we encountered the strongest reducing conditions and highest authigenic element accumulation rates in sediments, we estimate that the total authigenic S, Mo, Cd and U accumulation may account for as much as 9% of the pyrite S, 14% of the Mo, 6%-24% of the Cd, and 10% of the U that is captured in margin sediments of the world’s ocean. Our results thus imply a disproportionately strong role for the broad, shallow, productive shelves along the Arctic Ocean margin in global marine biogeochemical cycles.",

            "abstract": "Recently, we developed the Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator (WALRUS) to fill the gap between complex, spatially distributed models which are often used in lowland regions and simple, parametric models which have mostly been developed for mountainous catchments. This parametric rainfall-runoff model can be used all over the world, both in freely draining lowland catchments and polders with controlled water levels. Here, we present the model implementation and our recent experience in training students and practitioners to use the model.\nWALRUS has several advantages that facilitate practical application. Firstly, WALRUS is computationally efficient, which allows for operational forecasting and uncertainty estimation by running ensembles. Secondly, the code is set-up such that it can be used by both practitioners and researchers. For direct use by practitioners, defaults are implemented for relations between model variables and for the computation of initial conditions based on discharge only, leaving only four parameters which require calibration. For research purposes, the defaults can easily be changed. Finally, an approach for flexible time steps increases numerical stability and makes model parameter values independent of time step size, which facilitates use of the model with the same parameter set for multi-year water balance studies as well as detailed analyses of individual flood peaks.\nThe open source model code is currently implemented in R and compiled into a package. This package will be made available through the R CRAN server. A small massive open online course (MOOC) is being developed to give students, researchers and practitioners a step-by-step WALRUS-training. This course contains explanations about model elements and its advantages and limitations, as well as hands-on exercises to learn how to use WALRUS. All code, course, literature and examples will be collected on a dedicated website, which can be found via www.wageningenur.nl/hwm.\n",

            "abstract": "Previous research revealed that the cross-bedding related anisotropy in aeolian sandstones affects the orientation of compaction bands, also known as anticracks. We hypothesize that cross-bedding should a have similar influence on the orientation of the joints within the same rock at the same location. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between the cross-beds and the cross-bed package confined joints in the Jurassic aeolian Aztec Sandstone cropping out in the Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada. The field data demonstrates that the cross-bed package confined joints occur at high-angle to bedding and trend roughly parallel to the dip direction of the cross-beds. This shows that the cross-bed orientation and the associated anisotropy also exert a strong control on the formation and orientation of the joints.\nIn order to characterize the anisotropy due to cross-bedding in the Aztec Sandstone, we measured the P-wave velocities parallel and perpendicular to bedding from 11 samples in the laboratory using a bench-top ultrasonic assembly. The measured P-wave anisotropy is about 13% on average. Based on these results, a numerical model based on the generalized Hooke’s law for anisotropic materials is analyzed assuming the cross-bedded sandstone to be transversely isotropic. Using this model, we tested various cross-bed orientations as well as different strain boundary conditions (uniaxial, axisymmetric and triaxial). It is possible to define a boundary condition under which the modeled results roughly match with the observed relationship between cross-bed package confined joints and cross-beds.\nThese results have important implications for fluid flow through aeolian sandstones in reservoirs and aquifers.",

            "abstract": "The East African Rift System was initiated by the impingement of the Afar mantle plume on the base of the non-cratonic continental lithosphere (assembled during the Pan-African Orogeny), producing over 300,000 km3 [1] of continental flood basalts ~30 Ma ago. The contribution of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) to this voluminous period of volcanism is implied based on basaltic geochemical and isotopic data. However, the role of percolating melts on the SCLM composition is less clear. Metasomatism is capable of hybridizing or overprinting the geochemical signature of the SCLM. In addition, models suggest that adding fluids to lithospheric mantle affects its stability [e.g. 2, 3]. We investigated the nature of the SCLM using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) to measure water content in mantle xenoliths entrained in young (1 Ma) basaltic lavas from the Ethiopian volcanic province. The mantle xenoliths consist dominantly of spinel lherzolites and are composed of nominally anhydrous minerals, which can contain trace water as H in mineral defects. Eleven mantle xenoliths come from the Injibara-Gojam region and two from the Mega-Sidamo region. Water abundances of olivines in six samples are 1-5ppm H2O while the rest are below the limit of detection (<0.5 ppm H2O); orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene contain 80-238 and 111-340 ppm wt H2O, respectively. Two xenoliths have higher water contents – a websterite (470 ppm) and dunite (229 ppm), consistent with involvement of ascending melts. The low water content of the upper SCLM beneath Ethiopia is as dry as the oceanic mantle [2] except for small domains represented by percolating melts. Consequently, rifting of the East African lithosphere may not have been facilitated by a hydrated upper mantle. [1] Hoffman et al., 1997 Nature 389, 838–841.

Trends in aerosol concentrations have impacted the evolution of surface air temperatures and the hydrological cycle over the last 150 years, but the magnitude of influence and any role in shaping extreme events remains uncertain. We use a general circulation model (GISS GCM ModelE) to study the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on the formation of two potential U.S. droughts. Two periods are analyzed, the 1930s Dust Bowl and the 1970s “missed drought”. Each period realized ocean conditions ripe for the formation of central U.S. drought, but experienced differing composition and amounts of anthropogenic aerosol forcing. Simulations forced solely by observed sea surface temperature and sea ice distributions reveal drier and warmer conditions in the central U.S. (annual decreases of up to 0.5 mm/day and warming of 0.5°C). We find that anthropogenic aerosols of the 1930s, containing a significant warming component from U.S. black carbon, exacerbated the warm conditions (0.2°C) and provided slightly drier conditions. In contrast, anthropogenic aerosols of the 1970s, containing a large cooling component from U.S. sulfate, reduced annual precipitation deficits and lowered temperatures by up to 0.4°C. Our results showcase the importance of anthropogenic aerosol forcing in the evolution of U.S. droughts.",

            "abstract": "The land-atmosphere fluxes of water, energy and carbon, as computed by the Land Surface Model (LSM), are a critical component of Earth System Models and Numerical Weather Prediction models. Processes and parameters of LSMs are validated mostly against point measurements, for example from Eddy-covariance towers\u0004, with much attention given to biophysical processes and vegetation parameters\u0005. River discharge on the other hand is not considered very often although it provides an integrated signal of the hydrologic cycle over a catchment. Sensitivity analyses of hydrologic models have shown that soil parameters have then the largest impact on modeled river discharge. In this study, we quantify parametric sensitivities of the land surface model NOAH-MP simultaneously for model outputs at different spatial resolutions. NOAH-MP is a state-of-the-art LSM, which is used at regional scale as the land surface scheme of the atmospheric Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). NOAH-MP contains multiple process parameterizations (hence MP), yielding a considerable amount of parameters (> 500). Standard methods for sensitivity analysis such as Sobol indexes require too many model evaluations in case of many parameters. We therefore use first a recently developed inexpensive screening method based on Elementary Effects that has proven to identify the same informative parameters as the Sobol method but requires only 1% of model evaluations. This reduces the number of parameters to a feasible amount for a thorough sensitivity analysis. The study is conducted on twelve Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) catchments. This allows investigation of parametric sensitivities for distinct hydro-climatic characteristics, emphasizing different land-surface processes. The river basins range in size from 1020 to 4421 km², allowing fast model evaluation. The screening and sensitivity analysis identifies the most informative parameters of NOAH-MP for different model output variables. These parameters can subsequently be used in model calibration and adaptation for better representation of land-atmosphere fluxes at different scales. The long-term objective is to establish flux preservation at multiple resolutions in NOAH-MP to allow assimilation of observations at their representative scale.",

Flow through the beach results from water level differences between the estuary and the ocean. When the estuary is closed or perched, one of the major sources of outflow from the lagoon is seepage flow through the barrier beach. The location and design of the jetty could be altering subsurface flow paths through the jetty and possibly impeding subsurface flow where the jetty is still intact. This will result in unnatural connectivity between the ocean and the estuary leading to atypical surface water elevations and possibly salinity imbalance.\nWe are monitoring seepage through the jetty and beach berm with multiple surface and borehole geophysical methods, including: electrical resistivity (ERT), seismic refraction (SR), ground penetrating radar (GPR), and electromagnetic methods (EM). We use SR data to characterize deeper bedrock controls on beach barrier functioning; ERT and EM methods to characterize the beach sediment layers that could contribute to preferential flow paths during tide cycles in addition to preferential flow paths created by the jetty structure; time-lapse ERT and EM data to monitor moisture changes and mixing of saline and fresh water within the beach berm, and borehole ERT and GPR data to delineate the geometry of the (often buried) jetty. Preliminary ERT and EM results indicate two preferential flow paths through zones of missing jetty structure, while time-lapse borehole ERT data is expected to image saltwater flow impedance in zones of intact jetty structure. All data are being integrated with topography, tidal, borehole, and hydrological information and the results of the assessment will enable the Sonoma County Water Agency to develop the feasibility of alternatives to the existing jetty that may help achieve target estuarine water surface elevations.",

            "abstract": "Because the global climate cannot be observed directly, and because of vast and noisy data sets, climate science is a rich field to study how computational statistics informs what it means to do empirical science. Traditionally held virtues of empirical science and empirical methods like reproducibility, independence, and straightforward observation are complicated by representational choices involved in statistical modeling and data handling. Examining how climate reconstructions instantiate complicated empirical relationships between model, data, and predictions reveals that the path from data to prediction does not match traditional conceptions of empirical inference either. Rather, the empirical inferences involved are “complex” in that they require articulation of a good deal of statistical processing wherein assumptions are adopted and representational decisions made, often in the face of substantial uncertainties. Proxy reconstructions are both statistical and paleoclimate science activities aimed at using a variety of proxies to reconstruct past climate behavior. Paleoclimate proxy reconstructions also involve complex data handling and statistical refinement, leading to the current emphasis in the field on the quantification of uncertainty in reconstructions. In this presentation I explore how the processing needed for the correlation of diverse, large, and messy data sets necessitate the explicit quantification of the uncertainties stemming from wrangling proxies into manageable suites. I also address how semi-empirical pseudo-proxy methods allow for the exploration of signal detection in data sets, and as intermediary steps for statistical experimentation.",

            "abstract": "The chalcophile elements, as associated with sulfides, are believed mainly from the study of ophiolites to be generally enriched in the upper mantle, but depleted by magmatic processes in the lower and upper ocean crust. However, studies of some orogenic lherzolites suggest a copper depletion of peridotites in relation to the primitive mantle, suggesting that a portion of the sulfides is melted during decompression and incorporated into the ascending magmas. The rarity of abyssal peridotites and the high degree of their alteration have not allowed these results to be verified in situ in the oceans.\nHere, we present the first complete study of chalcophile elements based on a suite of rocks from an oceanic core complex (OCC), the Kane Megamullion at 22°30’N at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. OCCs provide large exposures of mantle and lower crustal rocks on the seafloor on detachment fault footwalls at slow and ultraslow spreading ridges. The Kane Megamullion is one of the best sampled OCCs in the world, with 1342 rocks from 28 dredge sites and 14 dives. We have made XRF, TD-MS and INAA analyses of 129 representative peridotites, gabbroic rocks, diabases and basalts.\nOur results suggest a depletion of some peridotites in relation to the primitive mantle (28 ppm Cu). Dunites, troctolites and olivine gabbros are relatively enriched in chalcophile elements. The amount of sulfides decreases gradually with progressive differentiation, reaching a minimum in gabbronorites and diabases. The highest bulk abundance of chalcophile elements in our sample suite was observed in dunites (up to ~ 300 ppm Cu in several samples) and a contact zone between residual peridotite and a mafic vein (294 ppm Cu). Plagioclase-bearing harzburgites, generally formed by late-stage melt impregnation in the mantle, are typically more enriched in Cu than unimpregnated residual peridotites. For these reasons, our initial results indicate sulfide melting during mantle melting, and their local precipitation in the mantle lithosphere due to late-stage melt impregnation.",

            "abstract": "Arecibo offers unique opportunity to investigate the structure of the mesospheric metal layers and their response to Sporadic E as observed by the incoherent scatter radar data. Previous studies have shown higher occurrences of sporadic activity in the neutral Fe layers as compared to Na at mid-latitudes. Other studies demonstrated that Sporadic Na (NaS) layers are more common at low and high latitudes as compared to FeS. It is important to note that case studies based on a few nights of observations are significant as they can shed more light on factors that are important on short term scales. These efforts can also help in evaluation of the role played by these factors in the climatological or global studies.\nIn this study, we have used two adjacent nights of simultaneous Na and Fe data obtained using resonance lidars at Arecibo, while the co-located Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) provides information about Sporadic E (ES). On both the nights (17 and 18 March 2004) ES was observed with electron densities exceeding 3000 electrons/cc. Some interesting observations are worth noting: The Fe main layer (below 90 km) was stronger than the corresponding sporadic layer around 95 km. However, Na data displayed a weaker main layer below 90 km with stronger NaS activity. Hence, the ratio of densities determined within layers of 3 km thickness centered at 97 km and at 87 km are less than 1 for Fe and exceeds 1 in the case of Na. A correlation analysis between Na/Ne and Fe/Ne also displays dissimilarities in the 94-100 km altitude range. An onsite all-sky imager recorded similar wave activities on both the nights with both ripple and band type structures that were observed in the 557.7 nm airglow. We will discuss the dissimilar response of Na and Fe to Sporadic E activity in relation to neutralization lifetimes of their respective ions and their sensitivity to temperatures.",

Six cross-shore stations were established to simultaneously measure near-bed velocity profiles, sediment concentration and water level fluctuations on a steep beach. Measurements of swash-zone hydrodynamics and morphological change were collected from February 12 to 25, 2014, following a large Nor’easter storm with surf zone significant wave height exceeding 5 m. Swash-zone flow velocities (u,v,w) were measured at each cross-shore location using a Nortek Vectrino profiling velocimeter that measured a 30 mm velocity profile at 1 mm vertical increments at 100 Hz. These velocity profiles were used to quantify the vertical flow structure over the foreshore and estimate hydrodynamic parameters such as bed shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation. Sediment concentrations were measured using optical backscatter sensors (OBS) to obtain spatio-temporal measurements during both uprush and backwash phases of the swash cycle. Cross-shore sediment transport rates at each station were estimated by taking the product of cross-shore velocity and sediment concentration. Foreshore elevations were sampled every low tide using a Leica GPS system with RTK capability. Cross-shore sediment transport rates and gradients derived from the velocities and bed shear stress estimates will be related to the observed morphological change.",

            "abstract": "Recent aircraft measurements from scattered records have shown long-term, global, seasonal photosynthetic CO2 uptake over land accelerating over the past 50 years. The successful launch of the sun-synchronous Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) on July 2, 2014 is expected to provide global, high spatial and spectral resolution datasets of vertical CO2 concentrations with surface spectral resolutions capable of yielding accurate CO2 flux profiles. It is unclear whether the biosphere will continue to act as a sink for anthropogenic CO2 loading of the atmosphere. Since current climate models with detailed terrestrial ecosystems are unable to simulate the observed increase in net ecosystem production (NEP), we will conduct assimilation studies with the derived CO2 fluxes in the GSFC Land Information System hydrological model to validate the generated NEP uptake. Further, we plan to use the OCO-2 CO2 concentrations to train a neural network to enable the calculation of long term trends from a decade of AIRS CO2 concentration data to produce regional NEP. To address this important Big Data science issue, a multi-institutional collaboration was formed to leverage their combined resources and the expertise of the researchers at the NASA GSFC, the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory and UMBC. We will employ a high speed 10Gb network to connect the collaborating researchers and provide them with remote access to dedicated computational hybrid multicore resources at UMBC, as well as access to an archive containing more than a decade of readily accessible continuous daily gridded AIRS data and ten years of daily MODIS data for each September. The status of the following research efforts is planned to be presented; (i) acquisition and processing of the expected CO2 profile data from OCO-2 for two test sites, a low latitude region over the Amazon and a Boral forest at high latitude, (ii) initial impact of 3-D data assimilation of CO2 fluxes with the advanced Goddard LIS hydrological surface model, (iii) preliminary results in training AIRS CO2 data. In addition, early results of innovative exploration on quantum annealing optimization for 3-D data assimilation, image registration and a Hopfield neural network for training the AIRS CO2 spectral data through UMBC remote access to the D-Wave system in Vancouver, CA, will be introduced.",

            "abstract": "Greenland’s fast-flowing tidewater outlet glaciers play a critical role in modulating the ice sheet’s contribution to sea level rise. Increasing evidence points to the importance of ocean forcing at the marine margins as a control on outlet glacier behavior, but a process-based understanding of glacier–ocean interactions remains elusive in part because our current capabilities for observing and quantifying system behavior at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales are limited. A recent international workshop on Greenland’s marine terminating glaciers (US CLIVAR, Beverly, MA, June 2013) recommended the establishment of a comprehensive monitoring network covering Greenland’s largest outlet glacier–fjord systems to collect long-term time series of critical in situ glaciological, oceanographic and atmospheric parameters needed to understand evolving relationships between different climate forcings and glacier flow. Given the remote locations and harsh environments of Greenland’s glacial fjords, the development of robust autonomous instrumentation is a key step in making the observing networks a reality.\nThis presentation discusses the design and development of a fully-autonomous ground-based Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system for monitoring outlet glacier behavior. Initial deployment of the system is planned for spring 2015 at Helheim Glacier in southeast Greenland. The instrument will acquire multi-dimensional point-cloud measurements of the mélange, terminus, and lower-reaches of the glacier. The heart of the system is a long-range, 1064 nm wavelength Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) that we have previously used in campaign-style surveys at Helheim Glacier and at Hubbard Glacier in Alaska. We draw on this experience to design and fabricate the power and enclosure components of the new system, and use previously acquired data from the instrument, collected August 2013 and July 2014 at Helheim, to optimize our data collection strategy and design the data processing and telemetry subsystems to ensure year-round data collection.",

            "abstract": "The most well-known example of a CO2-driven geyser is Crystal geyser in Green River, Utah. In situ monitoring of pressure and temperature and analysis of the elemental and isotopic composition of the emanating fluids has provided useful proxies for determining the geysering cycle, the source of water/CO2 and furthermore the physical constraints at depth which ultimately control the surficial expressions. Crystal geyser is the first geyser in the world which has been shown to go through repeated systematic chemical variations during its eruption cycle. The eruption cycle at Crystal geyser is comprised of 4 parts which follow the order of: minor eruption period (mEP), major eruption period (MEP), aftershock eruptions (Ae) and recharge period (R). Minor eruption periods are characterized by increasing specific conductivity (19.3 to 21.2 mS/cm), Na and Cl concentrations during the first half which plateau until the MEP. The beginning of the MEP denotes a sharp drop in temperature (17.4 to 16.8 ºC) Na, Cl, specific conductivity (21.2 to 18 mS/cm), and increasing concentrations of Fe, Sr, Ca, Mg and Mn. Downhole fluid sampling of the Entrada Sandstone and Navajo Sandstone provided 1 and 4 samples from the aquifers, respectively. The Entrada Sandstone in comparison to the deeper Navajo Sandstone has elevated concentrations of Sr and Fe and has lower concentrations of Na and Cl. Inverse modeling using the chemical characteristics of the Entrada Sandstone, Navajo Sandstone and brine was executed to determine the fractional inputs which comprise Crystal geyser’s fluid. Variances in the fractional contribution are dependent on the depth of the sample chosen to be representative of the Navajo Sandstone because the concentration of Na and Cl, among other elements, changes over depth. During the mEP the Navajo Sandstone, Entrada Sandstone and brine supply 50-55%, 44-48% and 1-3% of the total fluid, respectively. During the MEP the Navajo Sandstone, Entrada Sandstone and brine supply 39-43%, 56-59% and 1-2%, respectively. The results imply that the type of geysering seen at the surface is a function of the physical hydrologic characteristics of the supplying formations.",

The observed thickening rate inland in East Antarctica is 2 cm/a. To investigate the dynamic thickening rate, we apply the 3D AIF (Anisotropic Ice Flow) model to the Antarctica ice sheet for a series of the sensitivity experiments with the changes in climate forcing (surface mass balance and temperature). The modeled thickening rate near Vostok for the present time is consistent with the observations from ICESat and ERS data. The model results indicate that the East Antarctica ice sheet has been growing due to increased snowfall after the last ice age, and that the observed net mass gain is mainly caused by persistent dynamic thickening (excess of long-term accumulation relative to ice flow), and not by contemporaneous increases in snowfall.",

The Greenland ice sheet albedo has declined over the past decade and this decrease has been attributed to enhanced snow metamorphism. However, satellite data from the multispectral sensors MODIS and MERIS revealed that the albedo at high elevation in springtime has also decreased in the most recent years. Using spectral analysis and a snow model, our study shows that this decrease can be explained by an increase in light-absorbing impurity content in snow. Several sources of impurities can be considered. Enhanced dust transport from snow free-areas in the Arctic that are experiencing earlier melting of seasonal snow cover may be a contributor to the increase. The impact of the albedo decrease on Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance is estimated using a detailed snow model.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimates of forest growth at different ages are essential to evaluate the effect of a changing climate and to adjust management practices accordingly. Most current approaches are spatially discrete and therefore unable to predict forest growth accurately across landscapes. While airborne LiDAR has been widely used in forestry, it can only estimate growth rates with repeated passes. In contrast, Landsat imagery records disturbances (at 30 m resolution) but is unable to measure changes in growth rates. Historical archives of Landsat imagery provided us a way of knowing when and where even-aged stands of Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir) were cut and replanted. Since early growth rates are nearly linear with age, the height of dominant trees recorded in one pass by LiDAR yields a direct measure of growth and likely changes as stands age under recent climatic conditions. Process-based growth models are available to assess possible shifts in the growth rates of stands under a changing climate; the accuracy of such model predictions can be evaluated with additional LiDAR coverage. In this study we use the Physiological Principles Predicting Growth Model (3-PG) to estimate site index at the landscape level to predict site productivity based on the year of stand establishment obtained from Landsat, and one-pass airborne LiDAR measurement of forest height. We are monitoring forest plantations of known ages and with data on their current age we will calculate site index for 60 separate sites across western Oregon. The results of this study will allow us to create updated site index maps for the state of Oregon under varying climate scenarios.",

            "abstract": "During the past two decades, several atmospheric and oceanic general circulation models (GCMs) have been enhanced by the capability to explicitly simulate the hydrological cycle of the two stable water isotopes H218O and HDO. They have provided a wealth of understanding regarding changes of the water isotope signals in various archives under different past climate conditions. However, so far the number of fully coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs with explicit water isotope diagnostics is very limited. Such coupled models are required for a more comprehensive simulation of both past climates as well as related isotope changes in the Earth’s hydrological cycle.\nHere, we report first results of a newly developed isotope diagnostics within the Earth system model ECHAM5-JSBACH/MPIMOM. Both H218O and HDO and their relevant fractionation processes are included in all compartments and branches of the water cycle within this model. First equilibrium simulations have been performed for both pre-industrial (PI) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) boundary conditions. Evaluation of the PI simulation reveals a good overall model performance in accordance with available modern isotope data from vapor measurements, precipitation samples as well as marine records. For precipitation, root-mean-square error (RMSE) between model results and GNIP δ18O data is approx. 3‰. For ocean surface water, model results and GISS δ18O observational data deviate by 1‰ RMSE or less, with strongest differences in the Arctic Ocean. The LGM experiment results in spatially varying δ18O depletion in precipitation between -20‰ and 0‰ in agreement with data from various isotope records. The isotope data clearly mirrors a temperature change of similar range. For the ocean surface waters, the simulated isotopic composition shows a strong glacial δ18O enrichment in the North Atlantic of more than +0.5‰. In combination with glacial SST changes a LGM calcite δ18O enrichment of +2.5‰ is simulated. Analyses of the simulated Deuterium excess changes with Antarctic ice core data reveal a good model-data agreement and support the hypothesis of rather cool tropical SST during the last glacial maximum.",

At present palaeo-climatic datasets stretching the 3000 km of SWW influence are in latitudinal disagreement, suggesting a complex picture of SWW palaeo-behavior. In order to unravel the nature of the SWW over the last glacial cycle, a tighter grid of sensitive palaeo-proxies in the region is required.\nThe work presented here is based on the palaeo-glaciology of the Viedma outlet (49°S, 72°W), the second largest glacier draining the Hielo Patagonico Sur (HPS). This locality corresponds to the present day center of the precipitation bearing SWW in southern South America, which are a key factor in maintaining the HPS. Any variation in SWW strength or location has a direct impact on glacial expansion in the region, hence palaeo-glacial geometries can provide key insights into SWW dynamics.\nPalaeo-ice surface, thickness and thinning rates spanning MIS3 to the late Holocene are presented based on 16 Be-10 exposure ages along three vertical transects covering the accumulation and ablation areas of glacier Viedma. Results indicate a maximum ice thickness over MIS3, a thickening over the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR), which overprinted the vertical expression of the LGM, and progressive ice surface lowering from the middle to the late Holocene. The palaeo-climatic implications will be discussed, particularly with focus on SWW positioning and behavior.",

The OE-based retrieval is coupled with a fast IR radiative transfer model (RTM) that simulates observations of different sensors, and corresponding Jacobians in cloudy atmospheres. Ice cloud optical properties are calculated using the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) ice crystal habit (severely roughened hexagonal column aggregates). The OE-based method can be applied to various IR space-borne and airborne sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS), by optimally selecting IR bands with high information content.\nFour major error sources (i.e., the measurement error, fast RTM error, model input error, and pre-assumed ice crystal habit error) are taken into account in our OE retrieval method. We show that measurement error and fast RTM error have little impact on cloud retrievals, whereas errors from the model input and pre-assumed ice crystal habit significantly increase retrieval uncertainties when the cloud is optically thin. Comparisons between the OE-retrieved ice cloud properties and other operational cloud products (e.g., the MODIS C6 and CALIOP cloud products) are shown.",

            "abstract": "Waves are the dominant influence on the coastal morphology and ecosystem structure of tropical Pacific islands. 21st century wave heights, periods, and directions were forecast using output from four IPCC’s CMIP5 coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate models (GCMs), for representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. Wind fields from the GCMs were used to drive the global WAVEWATCH-III wave model to generate hourly time-series of bulk wave parameters for 25 islands in the mid to western tropical Pacific Ocean. Extreme significant wave heights decreased by the end of the 21st century under both climate scenarios compared to historical runs (1976-2010), except during the June – August season. Trends under both scenarios were similar, with the higher-emission 8.5 scenario displaying a greater decrease in significant wave heights compared to the lower-emission 4.5 scenario. The islands in the central Equatorial Pacific displayed the most change from historical values. Extreme significant wave heights within the region decreased by more than 30 cm during the December – February season, whereas in June – August, extreme wave heights increased by more than 20 cm and associated wave directions often rotated more than 30° clockwise. The largest directional changes occurred under RCP 4.5, possibly indicating a weakening of the trade winds’ influence on extreme wave directions during June – August and increasing influence of forcing from the Southern Ocean. Though the June – August season historically demonstrated smaller significant wave heights, the forecasted increase, coupled with a dramatic change in the direction of these extreme events, could result in changes to the morphology of these small coral islands. Large changes in wave direction would result in modifications to alongshore sediment transport gradients and, in turn, new accretional and erosional patterns, potentially damaging infrastructure and impacting the limited freshwater lenses on atoll islets. As most atoll islets accrete during large wave events, decreasing wave heights during other seasons may inhibit atoll islet accretion such that the low-lying islets may not be able to keep up with projected sea-level rise.",

Here we use state-of-the-art global\nclimate models to show that the projected increases in Arctic precipitation\nover the twenty-first century, which peak in late autumn\nand winter, are instead due mainly to strongly intensified local surface\nevaporation (maximum in winter), and only to a lesser degree\ndue to enhanced moisture inflow from lower latitudes (maximumin\nlate summer and autumn). Moreover, we show that the enhanced surface\nevaporation results mainly from retreating winter sea ice, signalling\nan amplified Arctic hydrological cycle.

As a result, the Arctic mean precipitation sensitivity\n(4.5 per cent increase per degree of temperature warming) is\nmuch larger than the global value (1.6 to 1.9 per cent per kelvin).\nThe associated seasonally varying increase in Arctic precipitation\nis likely to increase river discharge and snowfall over ice sheets\n(thereby affecting global sea level), and can even affect global climate\nthrough freshening of the Arctic Ocean and subsequent modulations\nof the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC).

The L1 band GPS amplitude scintillation intensities, represented by the S4 scintillation index, at the low latitude station of São José dos Campos (23.1º S, 45.8º W, dip latitude 17.3º S), located under the southern crest of the EIA, were analyzed during two northern hemisphere Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) events. These events occurred during the northern winter months of 2003/2004 marked by moderate magnetic disturbances and 2012/2013 during a very quiet magnetic period. Normally during these months (January to February) moderate to strong scintillation occurs in this Brazilian station for moderate and high solar flux. Long lasting weakening of the scintillation amplitude at this low latitude station was observed during these two SSW events, compared to the pre-SSW periods, however stronger S4 weakening was observed during 2003/2004. The main mechanisms that can lead to scintillation weakening are the meridional neutral wind and the equatorial vertical plasma drift. Since no wind data is available during pre-SSW and SSW periods, we have sought to identify its signature in the latitudinal distribution of the TEC along the 60o magnetic meridian and we suggest that a SSW induced southward meridional wind had a large contribution to the S4 weakening. The other mechanism that could have contributed to S4 weakening is the vertical plasma drift. This parameter, inferred from São Luís (2.52°S, 44.3°W, dip latitude 1.73°S) digisonde data for the 17 to 21 LT period during the SSW events, showed predominant decreases around the prereversal hours relative to their pre-SSW periods. The vertical drift during the period of the 2003/2004 SSW event presented a large flattening and remained constant at about 10 m/s. We suggest that this larger drift decrease during the magnetic storm, compared to the 2012/2013 SSW period, is caused by the SSW effects reinforced by the disturbance dynamo and overshielding westward polarity electric fields associated with the storm.",

How does precipitable water transport into the Arctic and Antarctic vary on seasonal and inter-annual timescales?

We answer these questions and more using a state-of-the-art, fully-coupled global climate model, CESM1.2, with added CAM5 water tagging capability, in which water entering the atmosphere is tagged at its point of origin within 10º latitude bands in each of the major ocean basins and within each continental land mass. We use a transformation matrix method to identify spatially coherent precipitable water transport modes and track their relative importance over a range of time scales and climates. We find that a majority of the precipitable water in the polar regions originates in the tropics and mid-latitudes, and that the relative importance of these source regions varies both seasonally and interannually. We conclude by considering the relevance of precipitable water sources and transport to climates of the past and future, and to the phenomenon of polar amplification.",

The upper continental slope off Cape Hatteras is a desirable area for development of offshore renewable energy because of the closeness of the Gulf Stream to the shelf edge and its minimal meanderings there. Using data from a moored 150-kHz ADCP and from the Mid-Atlantic Bight and South Atlantic Bight (MABSAB) ocean circulation model, MHK power characteristics have been computed for this area. These calculations quantify the Gulf Stream power resource and its temporal and spatial variations. During August 2013 – April 2014 at the moored ADCP site 30 meters below the surface and within the Stream’s cyclonic shear zone, a comparison of the ADCP and MABSAB model reveals that the average current speeds from the two sources are nearly identical and have a magnitude of 1.15 m/s. A comparison for the same time period was made for Betz power, which yielded an observed average of 0.8 kW/m2 and a model average of 0.7 kW/m2, a difference of about 13%. The model has shown to be more conservative than the ADCP in its computation of current speed and Betz power, and it shows somewhat less variability than the ADCP in directionality of the Stream. Additionally, model data have been used to calculate annual average vector velocities and yearly Betz power averages for a number of years, and at various locations over the NC continental slope. These results depict the variation of the Stream's position along the NC coastline over the most recent years, and show that yearly averaged Betz power at a given location has significant inter-annual variations, with average power during one year being nearly four times greater than in another year.",

            "abstract": "Changes in sea ice cover affect climate sensitivity by modifying albedo and surface heat flux exchange, which in turn affect the absorbed solar radiation at the surface as well as cloud cover, atmospheric water content and poleward atmospheric heat transport. Here, we use a configuration of the Community Earth System Model 1.0.4 with a slab ocean model and a thermodynamic-dynamic sea ice model to investigate the overall net effect of feedbacks associated with the sea ice loss. We analyze the strength of the overall sea ice feedback in terms of two factors: the sensitivity of sea ice area to changes in temperature, and the sensitivity of sea ice radiative forcing to changes in sea ice area. In this model configuration, sea ice area decreases by ~3 × 1012 m2 per K of global warming, while the effective global radiative forcing per unit area of sea ice loss is ~0.1 × 10-12 W m-2. The product of these two terms (~0.3 W m-2 K-1) approximately equals the difference in climate feedback parameter found in simulations with sea ice response (1.05 W m-2 K-1) and simulations without sea ice response (1.31 W m-2 K-1 or 1.35 W m-2 K-1, depending on the method used to disable the changes in sea ice cover). Thus, we find that in our model simulations, sea ice response accounts for about 20% to 22% of the climate sensitivity to an imposed change in radiative forcing. In our model, the additional radiative forcing resulting from a loss of all sea-ice in the “pre-industrial” state is comparable to but somewhat less than the radiative forcing from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content.",

            "abstract": "The eastern Tennessee seismic zone (ETSZ) may represent reactivation of an ancient shear zone that accommodated left-lateral, transpressive motion of the Amazon craton during the Grenville orogeny. Several different lines of evidence support this concept including velocity models for the crust, earthquake hypocenter alignments, focal mechanism solutions, potential field anomalies, paleomagnetic pole positions, and isotopic geochemical studies. The ETSZ trends NE-SW for about 300 km and displays remarkable correlation with the prominent New York – Alabama (NY-AL) aeromagnetic lineament. Vp and Vs models for the crust derived from a local ETSZ earthquake tomography study reveal the presence of a narrow, NE-SW trending, steeply dipping zone of low velocities that extends to a depth of at least 24 km and is associated with the vertical projection of the NY-AL aeromagnetic lineament. The low velocity zone is interpreted as a major basement fault. The recent Mw 4.2 Perry County eastern Kentucky earthquake occurred north of the ETSZ but has a focal depth and mechanism that are similar to those for ETSZ earthquakes. We investigate the possibility that the proposed ancient shear zone extends into eastern Kentucky using Bouguer and aeromagnetic maps. The southern end of the ETSZ is characterized by hypocenters that align along planes dipping at roughly 45 degrees and focal mechanisms that contain large normal faulting components. The NY-AL aeromagnetic lineament also changes trend in the southern end of the ETSZ and the exact location of the lineament is ambiguous. We suggest that the southern portion of the ETSZ involves reactivation of reverse faults (now as normal faults) that mark the ancient transition between a collisional to a more transpressive boundary between Amazonia and Laurentia during the formation of the super continent Rodinia.",

They provide calculations of atmospheric composition through the depth of the atmosphere over the entire globe. The models can simulate not only present-day conditions, but also provide reproductions of the past and predictions of the future. Thus, these models can generally address all questions relating to the concentrations of atmospheric species and the variability of those concentrations in location and time. However, these models are so complex that it is difficult to judge the confidence to place on the answers provided. The goal of this talk is to critically and quantitatively compare measured aspects of the tropospheric O3 distribution with those calculated by three CCMs. The focus will be on the seasonal cycles and long-term concentration changes observed at a variety of approximately baseline sites at northern mid-latitudes and in the southern hemisphere. Some important model-measurement disagreements will be noted. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop robust metrics for comparing model simulations to observations that will allow model-measurement comparisons to be rapidly performed in a standard, quantitative manner that can both effectively inform model improvement and advance our knowledge of tropospheric ozone.",

Critical to describing and understanding Earth system hydrologic and cryospheric parameters, data products derived from the passive microwave record include precipitation, soil moisture, surface water, vegetation, snow water equivalent, sea ice concentration and sea ice motion. While swath data are valuable to oceanographers due to the temporal scales of ocean phenomena, gridded data are more valuable to researchers interested in derived parameters at fixed locations through time and are widely used in climate studies. We are applying recent developments in image reconstruction methods to produce a systematically reprocessed historical time series NASA MEaSUREs Earth System Data Record, at higher spatial resolutions than have previously been available, for the entire SMMR, SSM/I-SSMIS and AMSR-E record. We take advantage of recently released, recalibrated SSM/I-SSMIS swath format Fundamental Climate Data Records. Our presentation will compare and contrast the two candidate image reconstruction techniques we are evaluating: Backus-Gilbert (BG) interpolation and a radiometer version of Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR). Both BG and SIR use regularization to trade off noise and resolution. We discuss our rationale for the respective algorithm parameters we have selected, compare results and computational costs, and include prototype SSM/I images at enhanced resolutions of up to 3 km.

Surface heat flow measurements may be available but without the underlying thermal structure it is not known if they are transient and affected by local hydrothermal flow, or conductive.\nThe Atlantis Massif oceanic core complex at 30 °N on the mid-Atlantic Ridge, offers a unique opportunity to better constrain hydrothermal circulation models. The temperature profile in gabbroic rocks of IODP Hole 1309D was measured in IODPExpedition 340T, and found to be near-conductive, but with a slight inflexion at ~750 mbsf indicating downward advection of fluid above that level. The lack of deep convection is especially remarkable given that the long-lived Lost City Hydrothermal Field (LCHF) is located only 5km to the south.\nWe have modelled hydrothermal circulation in the Massif using Comsol Multiphysics, comparing 2-D and 3-D topographic models and using temperature-dependent conductivity to give the best estimate of heatflow into the Massif. We can constrain maximum permeability in gabbro below 750 mbsf to 5e-17 m2. The thermal gradient in the upper part of the borehole can be matched with a permeability of 3e-14 m2 in a 750 m thick layer parallel to the surface of the massif, with upflow occurring in areas of high topography and downflow at the location of the borehole. However in 3-D the precise flow pattern is quite model dependent, and the thermal structure can be matched either by downflow centred on the borehole at lower permeability or centred a few hundred metres from the borehole at higher permeability.\nThe borehole gradient is compatible with the longevity (>120 kyr) and outflow temperature (40-90 °C) of the LCHF either with a deep more permeable (1e-14 m2 to 1e-15 m2) domain beneath the vent site in 2-D or a permeable fault slot 500 to 1000m wide and parallel to the transform fault in 3-D. In both cases topography exerts a strong control on vent location, and steep boundaries between permeable and impermeable domains stabilise long term steady venting.\nWork is in progress to model the thermal evolution of the massif during fault exhumation over the last 1.2 million years, comparing this with the present day heatflow estimated from measurements.",

To compensate for the large model domain and sparse data, rigorous meteorological development and characterization of hydraulic geometry were employed to spatially distribute climate and hydrologic processes in unmeasured locations. Parameterization techniques sought to include known spatial information for tributaries such as soil information and slope, and then parameters were scaled up or down during calibration to retain the spatial characteristics of the land surface in un-gaged areas. Accuracy was assessed by comparing model calibration to measured streamflow. Calibration and validation of the Sacramento River ranged from “good” to “very good” performance based upon a “goodness-of-fit” statistical guideline. Model calibration to measured sediment loads were underestimated on average by 39% for the Sacramento River, and model calibration to suspended sediment concentrations were underestimated on average by 22% for the Sacramento River.\nSediment loads showed a slight decreasing trend from 1958-2008 and was significant (p < 0.0025) in the lower 50% of stream flows. Hypothetical climate change scenarios were developed using the Climate Assessment Tool (CAT). Several wet and dry scenarios coupled with temperature increases were imposed on the historical base conditions to evaluate sensitivity of streamflow and sediment on potential changes in climate. Wet scenarios showed an increase of 9.7 - 17.5% in streamflow, a 7.6 - 17.5% increase in runoff, and a 30 – 93% increase in sediment loads. The dry scenarios showed a roughly 5% decrease in flow and runoff, and a 16 – 18% decrease in sediment loads. The base hydrology was most sensitive to a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius and an increase in storm intensity and frequency. The complete calibrated HSPF model will use future climate scenarios to make projections of potential hydrologic and sediment trends to the SFBD from 2000-2100.",

We have studied methane seeps on the active margin offshore Taiwan, where rapid tectonic activities occur. Our intention is to evaluate the scale and condition of gas seeps in the tectonic active region. Towcam, coring, heat probe, chirp, multibeam bathymetric mapping and echo sounding were conducted at the study areas.\nOur results showed that gas is violently venting at the active margin, not only through sediments, but also through overlying sea water, directly into the atmosphere. Similar ventings, but, not in this scale, have also been identified previously in the nearby region. High concentrations of methane as well as traces of propane were found in sediments and in waters with flares. In conjunction, abundant chemosynthetic community, life mussel, clams, tube worms, bacterial mats together with high concentrations of dissolve sulfide, large authigenic carbonate buildups were also found. Our results indicate that methane could be another major green house gas in the shallow water active margin region.",

            "abstract": "It is now generally accepted within the scientific community that the climate is changing, and that future climate change may have significant impact on water resources in both quantity and quality. Alterations of base flow to rivers due to changing subsurface flow patterns, fluctuations in soil moisture and in the depth of the groundwater table, water levels in lakes and wetlands, and altered groundwater recharge/discharge patterns are examples of possible consequences of future climate change. In this presentation, our physically-based model, HydroGeoSphere (HGS), is first briefly described. It is a physically-based 3D control-volume finite element model representing 2D surface water flow and transport on the land surface together with 3D variably-saturated flow and transport in the subsurface. A globally implicit scheme used to solve the nonlinear surface and subsurface flow and transport equations simultaneously. The model can explicitly account for the hydrologic, solute and thermal interactions between surface and subsurface flow regimes as well as the atmospheric inputs in terms of air temperature, solar radiation and sensible/latent heat fluxes. A parallel computational framework has been implemented to facilitate model applications in high performance computing environments. The applicability of the model is demonstrated for a variety of problems, covering the hill slope scale to improve the understanding of the physical and chemical processes in the water cycle, to the assessment of the impact of climate change on water resources over the Canadian landmass in three dimensions. The climate-driven 3D basin-scale examples range from that of a highly characterized watershed in Southern Ontario having an area of about 7000 km2 to a large basin in Western Canada that covers an area of about 120,000 km2. The continental scale simulations explore the impacts of global climate change on Canada’s surface and groundwater resources.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic material (SOM) is produced in the atmosphere from the oxidation of volatile organic compounds emitted from anthropogenic and biogenic sources. Aerosol particles, composed in part of SOM, play important roles in climate and air quality by scattering/absorbing radiation and serving as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The magnitude of climate-relevant perturbations depends on particle chemical composition, hygroscopic growth, and phase state, among other factors. Herein, the hygroscopic influence on particle rebound and the phase state of particles composed of isoprene, toluene, and α-pinene secondary organic material (SOM) was studied. Particle rebound measurements were obtained from 5 to 95% RH using a three-arm impaction apparatus. The experimentally determined rebound fractions were compared with results from a model of the rebound process that took into account the particle kinetic energy, van der Waals forces, and RH-dependent capillary forces. Comparison of the experimental and modeled indicated particles softened due to water uptake. For low RH values, the model explained the rebound behavior for all studied SOMs. At higher RH values specific to each SOM, however, particle rebound was no longer observed, and the model did not capture this behavior. Calibration experiments using sucrose particles of variable known viscosities showed the transition from non-rebounding to rebounding particles occurred for viscosity values from 100 to 1 Pa s, corresponding to a transition from semisolid to liquid material. The implication of the differing RH-dependent behaviors among the SOMs is that each SOM has a specific and quantitatively different interaction with water. A linear correlation between rebound fraction and hygroscopic growth factor was demonstrated, implying that absorbed water volume is the governing factor of viscosity for the studied classes of SOM. The findings of this study suggest that both the chemical composition and the ambient relative humidity influence the phase state of secondary organic material.",

            "abstract": "This environmental health risk assessment and management approach for atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution is based almost entirely on IPCC AR5 (2014) content, but the IPCC does not make recommendations. Large climate model uncertainties may be large environmental health risks. In accordance with environmental health risk management, we use the standard (IPCC-endorsed) formula of risk as the product of magnitude times probability, with an extremely high standard of precaution. Atmospheric GHG pollution, causing global warming, climate change and ocean acidification, is increasing as fast as ever. Time is of the essence to inform and make recommendations to governments and the public. While the 2ºC target is the only formally agreed-upon policy limit, for the most vulnerable nations, a 1.5ºC limit is being considered by the UNFCCC Secretariat. The Climate Action Network International (2014), representing civil society, recommends that the 1.5ºC limit be kept open and that emissions decline from 2015. James Hansen et al (2013) have argued that 1ºC is the danger limit. Taking into account committed global warming, its millennial duration, multiple large sources of amplifying climate feedbacks and multiple adverse impacts of global warming and climate change on crops, and population health impacts, all the IPCC AR5 scenarios carry extreme environmental health risks to large human populations and to the future of humanity as a whole. Our risk consideration finds that 2ºC carries high risks of many catastrophic impacts, that 1.5ºC carries high risks of many disastrous impacts, and that 1ºC is the danger limit. IPCC AR4 (2007) showed that emissions must be reversed by 2015 for a 2ºC warming limit. For the IPCC AR5 only the best-case scenario RCP2.6, is projected to stay under 2ºC by 2100 but the upper range is just above 2ºC. It calls for emissions to decline by 2020. We recommend that for catastrophic environmental health risk aversion, emissions decline from 2015 (CAN International 2014), and if policy makers are limited to the IPCC AR5 we recommend RCP2.6, with emissions declining by 2020.",

            "abstract": "This study represents the first investigation of crustal structure and mantle anisotropy using broadband seismic stations in the interior of Libya. Seismic anisotropy is an invaluable tool for interpreting the development of sub-surficial features and lithosphere-asthenosphere dynamics over the course of geologic time in response to the interaction of adjacent tectonic plates and the stresses. Similarly, spatial variations in crustal structure can provide constraints for the growth of terranes specific to local tectonism and the subsequent response. Here we report analysis of data obtained from 16 stations belonging to the Libyan Center for Remote Sensing and Space Science (LCRSSS) in addition to 3 publically available stations both in Libya and adjacent areas by employing both shear-wave splitting (SWS) and receiver function (RF) methods. A total of 449 pairs of high-quality SWS measurements utilizing PKS, SKKS, and SKS phases from 19 broadband stations demonstrate primarily NNE-SSW to NNW-SSE fast orientations. An absence of significant fast direction variation as a function of event back-azimuth indicates the presence of simple anisotropy. Lack of correlation between surficial features and the observed fast orientations suggests that the origin of the anisotropy is asthenospheric. Preliminary time-series stacking of about 1000 radial RFs indicates that the crust does not thin significantly from the continental margin, where the crustal thickness ranges from 30 to 35 km, to inland Libya where the crust is about 30 km thick excepting local thickening due to volcanic activity. Measurements of the P-to-S wave velocity ratio Vp/Vs, which range from 1.70 to 1.87, reveal short-order variations as the result of heavy sedimentary basin deposits and local magmatic emplacement.",

A remaining challenge is to better understand the nature of these changes and the impact of this decline on the climate through an examination of uncertainties in the sea ice thickness record. We first discuss known sources of error in the record of sea ice thickness from the Operation IceBridge sea ice thickness data product which are due to factors such as instrument and retrieval algorithm biases, tide model uncertainties, and interpolation errors. We then describe planned improvements for a new version of these data products which aim to reduce these uncertainties, and show how these improvements can also be used to yield improvements in satellite retrievals of sea ice thickness from ICESat and CryoSat-2. A new approach which synthesizes the combination of in-situ, airborne, satellite, and model data sources to produce a record of sea ice thickness change in the Arctic will be discussed. We then apply this technique to the ICESat, CryoSat-2, and IceBridge data records to demonstrate Arctic sea ice volume change from 2003 to the present time period from the combined data sets.",

            "abstract": "Ps converted waves recorded by 29 stations deployed from 2007 to 2011 are used to develop constraints on the crustal velocity discontinuities beneath western Tibet. We use the frequency-domain multiple-taper correlation (MTC) algorithm (Park and Levin, 2000) to develop receiver functions (RFs), and plot back-azimuth and epicentral gathers to identify clear converted waves beneath our study area.\nTo evaluate depths of major converting boundaries we use a S-wave velocity model of Gilligan et al., (2014), and the P-wave velocity model of Razi et al., (2014). From these models, we compute vertically averaged ratios of Vp and Vs for the crust beneath each site. We find Vp/Vs ratios vary between 1.71 and 1.8, with sites showing the high Vp/Vs ratio (1.75-1.8) concentrated along the plate boundary between India and Eurasia. The Vp/Vs ratio is lower in the Lhasa block (1.71-1.75), while south of the Indus-Yarlung suture (IYS), the highest Vp/Vs ratio (1.8) is observed.\nWe observe strong positive Ps converted phases attributable to the Moho with Ps-Ptimes ranging from 5.3 s south of the IYS to 10.1 s north of the Bangong-Nujiang suture (BNS), with corresponding range of crustal thicknesses of 41-82 km. Within the Lhasa block the Moho appears at 65-80 km depths. However, south of the IYS the crust is 43-60 km. We find the thickest crust north of the BNS at 82 km.\nAdditionally, at many locations our RFs contain another positive phase with Ps-Ptimes of 5-7 s, corresponding to an interface at 40-55 km. This phase is seen mostly beneath the sites along the Karakoram fault (KKF). The relative timing between this phase and the later one delimiting the extent of the crust is in 2-3 s range, implying a ~20 km thick layer in the lower part of the crust bounded by two sharp increases in seismic impedance.\nOur results also show coherent negative phases at some of the sites, mostly along the KKF. Ps-P delays of 2-5 s suggest boundaries at mid-crustal depths, and negative polarity indicates low velocity beneath them, a finding broadly consistent with vertical profiles of Vs in the model of Gilligan et al. (2014). A lack of the corresponding zone of low Vp velocities in the model of Razi et al. (2014) suggests that the origin of low Vs is not thermal. A plausible alternate is systematic sub-horizontal texture of the rocks aligned in the course of the formation of the plateau.",

SNL performed a 10-year hindcast using SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore), forced by spectral output from a WAVEWATCH III hindcast. The model was found to be insensitive to bottom friction and whitecapping parameterizations for the locations of interest, which included depths of 40m or greater. Predicted significant wave heights were found to be overbiased due to an overbias in the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) winds used to drive WAVEWATCH III. The spatial variability of the wave statistics calculated from the hindcast simulation were found to vary by season and were affected by the wind direction due to geographic features north of Humboldt Bay.

Here we present the depositional history of two outcrops known as Balmville and Dingo Gap, investigated during sols 508 to 538. Balmville represents the first opportunity for close-range imaging of a unique geologic unit that was identified in orbital mapping, characterized by northeast-southwest trending striations. At Balmville the beds that produce the striated appearance dip towards the north. We use both orbital observations and in-situ observations from Curiosity to compare the orientation, spacing and dip direction of the striations at Balmville to the Kimberley outcrop, where this unit was investigated in detail, and we present several hypotheses for the origin of the striations. Shortly after Balmville, the MSL drive strategy shifted from driving on the topographic high areas to the topographic low areas. The result was a unique vantage point while driving through a valley with several meters of stratigraphy on either side of the rover, revealing approximate cross-sections. Dingo Gap and Moonlight Valley expose ~3 m of stratigraphic section. We explore the diversity of facies exposed here, including coarse-grained conglomerates, cross-stratified sandstones, fine-grained evenly laminated sandstones and massive fining upward facies. However, the stratigraphy on north and south walls of the valley are not the same, despite being separated by only a couple 10s of m. We explore several depositional models to account for these differences. The stratigraphy exposed at Dingo Gap can also be compared to other stratigraphic sections taken at waypoints known as Darwin, Cooperstown, Kylie, and Kimberley for regional correlations.",

Modeling studies have found gravity wave production of large variations in thermospheric temperatures, 50K or more, and densities, as large as 10-25% (Vadas and Liu, 2013), at altitudes of 100 to 300 km. The effects are seen over spatial scales of tens to several hundred kilometers. Additionally, the dissipation of gravity waves creates localized regions of heating and cooling over scales of several hundred km. These effects may be observable by the Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) mission, a NASA mission of opportunity to be launched in 2017, which will simultaneously image the temperature and composition (O/N2 density ratio) of Earth’s thermosphere from geostationary orbit. GOLD images the temperature and composition at 160 km (the signal is dominated by contributions from within one scale height at that altitude), and it will provide the necessary spatial resolution and sensitivity. Therefore, the GOLD mission may make the first measurements of the predicted variations in neutral temperature in this region of the thermosphere.

The activity of non-isentropic mixing is highly localised and clearly structured due to isolated events that have been triggered naturally by a variety of hydrodynamic instabilities. The most active irreversible mixing is observed along the surface front where the density and thermal contrast are highest, followed by the region along the tropopause. In particular, the structure of the potential vorticity in the entire troposphere is practivally insensitive to the change of stratostification in the stratosphere. This includes the structure of the tropopause folds. We also find the stratosphere-troposphere (S-T) exchanges of net heat and mass are always from the troposphere into the stratosphere, and the most efficient S-T exchange occurs when the stratospheric stratification is set to the climatological level. We also find the climatological background state leads to the minimum non-isentropic mixing in terms of the integral over the whole domain. It appears that the climatological characteristics of the lower stratosphere are optimised for optimal efficiency of S-T exchange. This might be taken to imply that the S-T exchange and the level of stratification in the lower stratosphere are also controlled by troposphere, although further study is needed for confirmation.",

At this altitude trees are exposed to extreme conditions such as: low temperature (5°C), low humidity (<1%), UV radiation and a thinner atmosphere, among others factors. The study of soil factors is of paramount importance to understand the response of treeline to global warming. We have studied the physical and bioclimatic properties of the soils along altitudinal gradient (3500 a 4400 m) on the South face of Pico de Orizaba: organic matter, real and apparent density, texture and total amount of Va and Mo. Soil samples at treeline were also used to prepare thin sections to study the soil micromorphology. There is a disruption of values along the altitudinal gradient at treeline, between 4000 and 4100. The C/N ratio of soils below the treeline is typical of forest regions; however above 4100 m the value decreases to less than 1%. Also the quantity of interchangable cations is below 1cmol/kg above treeline. Analysis of thin soil sections show little weathering and compaction on regions above the treeline. We suggest that at least nine factors intervene in tree growth on the transition zone: soil temperature, organic matter, interchangable cations, clay content, compaction, porosity, C/N ratio, biological activity and soil structure. At the moment we cannot yet discern if some of them is preponderant as all of them are interlinked.",

Because Marcellus Shale wells are located in relatively water-rich areas, there has been less pressure in the region to recycle and reuse freshwater sourced from surface water streams for stimulating new wells. We review trends in actual freshwater withdrawals from surface water streams over time, and examine which regulations are most protective of flows intra- and inter-annually. Pass-by flow protective requirements appear to be most effective when set based on monthly flows, rather than annual flows, though not all regulatory agencies are using this protective mechanism. Total water use by industry in a shale play doesn’t appear to follow trends of seasonal availability until three to five years after development begins in that play, and intensity of water use from surface water withdrawal sites appears to decrease over time. Trends in water use can be tied to a number of factors including changing gas prices and demand (number of wells hydraulically fractured), increasing length of laterals, increasing recycling rates, increasing industrial efficiency, and others.",

            "abstract": "The distributed, service-oriented architecture of the US Integrated Ocean Observing System (US IOOS) has been implemented mostly independently by US IOOS partners, using different software approaches and different levels of compliance to standards. Some uniformity has been imparted by documenting the intended output data formats and content and service interface behavior. But to date, a rigorous testing of the distributed system of systems has not been done. To assess the functionality of this system, US IOOS is conducting a system integration test (\nhttp://github.com/ioos/system-test\n) that evaluates whether the services (i.e. SOS, OPeNDAP, WMS, CS/W) deployed to the 17 Federal partners and 11 Regional Associations can solve real-world problems. Scenarios were selected that both address IOOS societal goals and test different functionality of the data architecture. For example, one scenario performs an assessment of water level forecast skill by prompting the user for a bounding box and a temporal extent, searching metadata catalogs via a Catalog Services for the Web (CS/W) interface to discover available sea level observations and model results, extracting data from the identified service endpoints (either OPeNDAP or SOS), interpolating both modeled and observed data onto a common time base, and then comparing the skill of the various models. Other scenarios explore issues such as hypoxia and wading bird habitats. For each scenario, the entire workflow (user input, search, access, analysis and visualization) is captured in an IPython Notebook on GitHub. This allows the scenarios to be self-documenting as well as reproducible by anyone, using free software. The Python packages required to run the scenarios are all available on GitHub and Conda packages are available on binstar.org so that users can easily run the scenarios using the free Anaconda Python distribution. With the advent of hosted services such as Wakari, it is possible for anyone to reproduce these workflows for free, without installing any software locally, using just their web browser. Thus in addition to performing as a system integration test, this project serves to provide examples that anyone in the geoscience community can adapt to solve other real-world problems.",

            "abstract": "Various MPS (multi-point geostatistics) based techniques have been successfully employed for modeling heterogeneous geologic features such as channel bodies. However, few studies exist on modeling fracture networks implementing MPS. Selecting a TI (training image) that is representative of the target subsurface fracture pattern is key to an effective implementation of any MPS algorithm. While recent research has employed equivalent continuum models created from Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN) to serve as TIs, the present research explores the direct usage of outcrop analogues of fracture networks for this purpose. A set of nested-fracture maps from the Devonian Sandstone of Hornelen basin created at multiple scales and resolutions is considered. These maps have been previously classified as belonging to a single fractal system characterized by a fractal dimension but having slightly different spatial organization at each scale. Our research implements unconditional image quilting in generating multiple realizations of fracture networks from these maps. This pattern-based algorithm requires a template-size to be chosen which is representative of the heterogeneity of the pattern of interest. Lacunarity is a technique that essentially quantifies the distribution of spaces or gaps in a pattern and can thus delineate scale-dependent heterogeneity. It is therefore investigated if this technique, in conjunction with Entropy (a measure for randomness), can be applied for choosing the template-size required for reproducing a desired pattern from a given TI. Finally, it will be tested if fracture networks generated from two or more TIs at different scales but belonging to the same fractal-fracture system, can capture similar ranges of uncertainty.",

In this study, we attempt to characterize the systematic and random errors in AIRS CO2 retrievals by comparing to CO2 fields generated by the PCTM transport model using CarbonTracker-optimized fluxes. We examine both the standard and support products of AIRS Version 5 Release Level 2 CO2, together with other parameters (e.g., cloud top pressure/temperature) retrieved using coincident microwave measurements from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU). We formulate a bias correction for AIRS CO2 against these parameters, remove the bias, and use the bias-corrected data to solve for weekly flux corrections across 2009-2011 at a 3.0 x 3.75 deg resolution (lat/lon).",

Our processing started in 2009 due to the better coverage in the GPS ground network in the southern hemisphere in this solar cycle. Case studies are selected from different seasons and longitudes to compare and contrast quiet-time TEC and storm-associated TEC in both hemispheres. We first identify a seasonal dependence of the hourly TEC by analyzing hourly averages in a three-day period around the solstices and equinoxes from 2009 to 2013. Then, we examine storm-time effects on the TEC by examining the hourly averaged TEC in a three day window around a particular storm.

            "abstract": "The Cordillera Blanca, Peru, has the highest concentration of glaciers in the tropics. These glaciers, which in some valleys provide up to 70% of the dry season runoff, are rapidly retreating, with potential impacts on water resources. To predict the future changes in water resource in the region, it is important to better understand the processes driving tropical glacier ablation at the headwater of these systems. However, due to the glaciers’ high altitude and the remote location, new techniques are needed to investigate these processes. Here we use high-definition ground-based infrared thermal imagery, paired with traditional weather monitoring instruments located on and adjacent to the glacier, to obtain high temporal and spatial resolution temperature maps of the surface of the Cuchillacocha glacier in the Cordillera Blanca. For four consecutive dry seasons (July 2011-2014), 24 to 48 hours of time-lapse imagery (5-30 minute spacing) of the glacier surface and surrounding area were acquired in conjunction with climate data. We compare the spatial and temporal variability of the surface temperature with numerous factors, including the surface conditions (e.g. ice, firn, debris cover, etc.), the thermal gradient at the edge of the glacier and with night time radiative cooling under different atmospheric conditions. The results show that sub-daily fluctuations in runoff from the glacier can be explained in large part by the incoming solar radiation and that the heating not only of the ice surface, but the surround bedrock, are important controls on the rate of meltwater generation. This study shows the potential utility for collecting and analyzing ground based infrared imagery for glacier studies, with implications for hydrologic and water resource applications.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring of gravity change at a volcano is a valuable means of assessing mass change at depth and a good complement to other surveillance methods, like deformation and seismicity. At Kīlauea Volcano, Hawaiʻi, repeated gravity surveys of the summit region have been conducted since 1975, with hundreds of microgals of gravity increase measured at the center of the caldera but without the magnitude of surface uplift through 2008 that would be expected from the gravity increase. This gravity increase was attributed to magma accumulation in void space. Between 2009 and 2012, gravity increase and uplift were coincident, but the uplift was less than expected for the given gravity signal (assuming a basaltic magma density of 2500 kg/m3). The source of both deformation and gravity change was at 1.5 km depth beneath the east margin of Halemaʻumaʻu Crater, within Kīlauea Caldera, corresponding to the location of a known shallow magma reservoir. Densification of magma in this reservoir due to degassing through the open summit eruptive vent, active since 2008, is the preferred explanation of the observed gravity change and surface displacements. We conducted gravity surveys in 2013 and 2014 and found that both gravity change and surface displacements were negligible with respect to 2012. We interpret this lack of recent gravity change as an indication that the 1.5-km-depth magma reservoir has reached a steady-state density, where gas loss from the summit vent is compensated for by gas influx from below. Continued gravity surveys should identify any changes in this equilibrium that may presage changes in summit eruptive activity.",

We analyze the variability of the structure and brightness of the auroral ovals as a function of magnetic latitude. The investigation of the aurora is a diagnostic tool of the various processes, which contribute to Ganymede’s complex magnetic field environment. The variability which we find consists of both, spatial inhomogeneities on the moon disk and temporal variation as a function of Ganymede’s position within the current sheet of Jupiter’s magnetosphere.

Despite the fundamental role of magnetic fields in solar and heliospheric physics, there exists only very limited measurements of the field above the base of the corona. What is needed are direct measurements of not only the strength and orientation of the magnetic field but also the signatures of wave motions in order to better understand coronal structure, solar activity and the role of MHD waves in heating and accelerating the solar wind. Fortunately, the remote sensing instrumentation used to make magnetic field measurements is also well suited for measuring the Doppler signature of waves in the solar structures.\nWith this in mind, we are proposing the WAMIS (Waves and Magnetism in the Solar Atmosphere) investigation. WAMIS will take advantage of greatly improved infrared (IR) detectors, forward models, advanced diagnostic tools and inversion codes to obtain a breakthrough in the measurement of coronal magnetic fields and in the understanding of the interaction of these fields with space plasmas. This will be achieved with a high altitude balloon borne payload consisting of a coronagraph with an IR spectro-polarimeter focal plane assembly. The balloon platform provides minimum atmospheric absorption and scattering at the IR wavelengths in which these observations are made. Additionally, a NASA long duration balloon flight mission from the Antarctic can achieve continuous observations over most of a solar rotation, covering all of the key time scales for the evolution of coronal magnetic fields. With these improvements in key technologies along with experience gained from current ground-based instrumentation, WAMIS will provide a low-cost mission with a high technology readiness leve.",

The BrO algorithms are based on direct fitting of radiances from 319.0-347.5 nm. Radiances are modeled from the solar irradiance, attenuated and adjusted by contributions from the target gas and interfering gases, rotational Raman scattering, undersampling, additive and multiplicative closure polynomials and a common mode spectrum. The version of the algorithm used for both BrO includes relevant changes with respect to the operational code, including the fit of the O2-O2 collisional complex, updates in the high resolution solar reference spectrum, updates in spectroscopy, an updated Air Mass Factor (AMF) calculation scheme, and the inclusion of scattering weights and vertical profiles in the level 2 products. Updates to the algorithms include accurate scattering weights and air mass factor calculations, scattering weights and profiles in outputs and available cross sections. We include retrieval parameter and window optimization to reduce the interference from O3, HCHO, O2-O2, SO2, improve fitting accuracy and uncertainty, reduce striping, and improve the long-term stability.\nWe validate OMI BrO with ground-based measurements from Harestua and with chemical transport model simulations. We analyze the global distribution and seasonal variation of BrO and investigate BrO emissions from volcanoes and salt lakes.",

            "abstract": "Cross-correlating continuous seismic data streams with waveform templates has proven to be a sensitive, discriminating detector of repeating seismic signals; however, template matching requires a priori knowledge of the signals we wish to detect. Detection of unknown sources is possible with autocorrelation, which searches for similar waveforms within all pairs of short overlapping windows from continuous data. Unfortunately, naïve application of autocorrelation scales quadratically with time, which limits its use to short duration time series.\nWe previously developed an efficient, correlation-based approach to find similar seismic waveforms. We avoid comparing most non-similar signals by first developing compact, discriminative “fingerprints” of waveforms, and then assigning signals to sub-groups (buckets) using locality-sensitive hash functions (LSH). The probability that two signals enter the same bucket increases monotonically with similarity. LSH trades space for speed, requiring near-linear storage, yet yielding near-constant query time, and avoiding nearly all of the unproductive pair-wise computation of autocorrelation.\nOur method previously detected uncataloged earthquakes 40 times faster than autocorrelation when applied to 24 hours of single-channel continuous data from one station in the Northern California Seismic Network. Here we extend our method to incorporate multiple channels of continuous data from the distributed network of HRSN stations at Parkfield. Our goal is to detect low frequency earthquakes (LFEs), and to compare our detections to LFE events previously identified using waveform templates. This is a challenging test since LFEs are more difficult to find than earthquakes due to their non-impulsive nature, low snr, and only modest waveform similarity.",

In addition to the standard operational science measurements, the early phase of the mission will see intensive special calibration measurements. These will seek to validate the ground radiometric, spectral and spatial calibration of the three-band spectrometer.\nRadiometric calibration validation will be primarily accomplished via vicarious calibration using the playa at Railroad Valley, NV, from techniques demonstrated by the joint OCO-2/GOSAT fieldwork. Additional constraints will be established via lunar calibration using the USGS ROLO database. Critical to the radiometric calibration will be dark subtraction that will be validated via regular dark measurements.\nSpectral calibration validation will rely heavily on the OCO-2 Level 2 algorithm. By inspecting the residual fits, it will be possible to constrain the uncertainties in wavelength error and infer possible errors in the instrument line shape model. Additional constraints on line shape stability will be provided by monitoring the Doppler shift of solar lines during an extended solar calibration.\nSpatial calibration validation will be based on lunar calibration, with additional information provided by observing coastline crossings.\nThis presentation will summarize the current state of calibration knowledge leading up to the first public data release of the OCO-2 L1b data product.",

PRISMA is an Earth observation system with innovative electro-optical instrumentation which combines an hyperspectral sensor with a panchromatic medium-resolution camera. These instruments offer the scientific community and users many applications in the field of environmental monitoring, risk management, crop classification, pollution control, and Security.\nIn this context Mt. Etna (Italy) has been choose as main site for testing the sensor capability to assess volcanic risk. The volcanic calibration and validation activities comprise the managing of a large amount of in situ hyperspectral data collected during the last 10 years. The usability and interoperability of these datasets represents a task of ASI-AGI project. For this purpose a database has been created to collect all the spectral signatures of the measured volcanic surfaces. This process has begun with the creation of the metadata structure compliant with those belonging to some standard spectral libraries such as USGS ones. Each spectral signature is described in a table containing ancillary data such as the location map of where it was collected, description of the target selected, etc. The relational database structure has been developed WOVOdat compliant. Specific tables have been formatted for each type of measurements, instruments and targets in order to query the database through a user-friendly web-interface. The interface has an upload area to populate the database and a visualization tool that allows downloading the ASCII spectral file and also visualizing an interactive graph where the spectral range to plot can be selected by the user.",

This scheme is extremely flexible, applicable to unstructured meshes, and avoids the need to reconstruct the tangential velocity component, as the classical C-grid scheme does. But the co-volume has been shown to be a generalization of the E-grid scheme, and therefore inherits all the known defects of the latter. From another point of view, a recent study shows that, for the co-volume scheme on the f-plane, the mass-vorticity-divergence fields on the primary mesh are completely decoupled from the mass-vorticity-divergence fields on the dual mesh. We propose to periodically synchronize the fields on the primary mesh and the fields on the dual mesh. In this presentation, we explore approaches for the synchronization, and the effects of them.",

            "abstract": "Supraglacial lake drainage is a major source of subglacial water under the Greenland Ice Sheet, impacting the ice dynamics at different temporal and spatial scales. Previous studies have shown that fast drainage of a supraglacial lake can produce seismic waves that are detected by local seismometers; however, little work has been done on the regional detection of such waves. Here we present the results of a study focusing on seismic data and their potential linkage to the drainage of a supraglacial lake (Lake Ponting) in the Paakitsoq region of the West Greenland ice sheet. The formation and subsequent drainage of this lake were documented in the summer of 2011 by a multidisciplinary team of researchers (Tedesco, et al., 2013). The present study used all available high frequency data from the Greenland Ice Sheet Monitoring Network (GLISN) for one-half hour before and one hour after the onset of sudden drainage on June 19, 2011. Arrival times were picked manually, using a minimum amplitude of twice the noise level. The data were then plotted on a time-distance graph, using the location of Lake Ponting as the origin of the distance axis. Four linear trends are seen on the graph. Least-squares fitting of these linear trends show that two of the lines have apparent velocities of around 1,000 m/s. These two lines are approximately parallel, do not emanate from the time of lake drainage, and may be unrelated to it. The other two lines, however, do intersect the time axis at approximately the onset of the drainage. Based on this, we believe that these latter lines result from seismic waves associated with the drainage. The velocities derived from the curve fits for these lines are 378 m/s and 292 m/s. These velocities are too slow for the waves to be traveling through either the rock or the solid ice. Our current hypothesis is that they are traveling in a low-velocity channel of till underneath the ice. This would be consistent with the low attenuation required for the propagation of high frequency energy over regional distances. Further analysis, and the implications of these waves for the study of glacial processes, will be presented.",

Its onset and spatial/temporal variability have strong economic impact and may cause severe human suffering. Using sea surface salinity (SSS) data from Aquarius/SAC-D satellite mission, we study the seasonal and interannual variability of SSS, to identify the potential sources for the monsoon moisture supply. Preliminary analysis shows the rainfall integrated over India subcontinent, which often used as an indicator for the monsoon onset and intensity, is correlated higher with Aquarius SSS in Indian Ocean than the state-of-art estimate of evaporation (OAflux) minus precipitation (GPCP), indicating the important role of the oceanic processes. We also examine the relative importance of salinity tendency (dSSS/dt) and salinity advection at various stages of the monsoon. Ocean current data from OSCAR project is used to estimate the salinity advection. The role of ocean processes relative to other components of the water cycle is investigated in conjunction with data from multiple satellite missions. The atmospheric integrated moisture transport (IMT) is derived from ocean vector wind (OceanSAT2) and atmospheric precipitable water (SSMIS F17). Moisture in and out of the continent can be estimated by integrating IMT along the coasts, providing a quantitative description of moisture supply in the water budget. We analyze how IMT is influenced by oceanic processes and further related with large-scale circulation. This study underscores the importance of continuous good-quality and high-resolution spacebased observations towards the characterization, understanding, and prediction of the global water cycle.",

            "abstract": "Along with significant changes in Arctic climate system, the largest year-to-year variation in sea-ice extent has occurred in the Laptev, East Siberian, and Chukchi seas (define it here as the Area Of Focus, AOF), where two extremes of opposite signs were observed in the summers of 2007 and 1996. To untangle underlying forcing and feedbacks critical to the formation of the minimum (maximum) Arctic sea-ice extent of 2007 (1996), we examined in details the corresponding 2007 and 1996 anomalies of the large-scale atmospheric circulation and atmospheric physical parameters relevant to sea-ice variation utilizing satellite-derived sea-ice products and the NASA MERRA reanalysis. Our results indicate that, in addition to a triggering role of spring large-scale atmospheric circulation anomaly, a positive cloud-radiation-precipitable water vapor (PWV) feedback played the most important role in driving the sea-ice extent to a record low in the summer of 2007. Specially, atmospheric circulation change in spring induced anomalous southerly winds from the North Pacific not only advected more warm air, but also brought more water vapor to the AOF and formed more clouds. When cloud fraction (CF) was high and Arctic surfaces were covered by snow and ice, particularly during the onset of sea-ice melting (May-June), the cloud-greenhouse (LW) effect overwhelmed the cloud-albedo (SW) effect, producing a positive cloud radiative effect on surface radiation budget. Rising surface temperature subsequently enhanced evaporation and elevated atmospheric PWV, which drastically increased downwelling LW flux activating another positive feedback to the surface temperature. As sea-ice melting continued, additional SW (and LW) radiation was absorbed by open seas to increase surface temperature, and more water vapor evaporated to form more clouds, further accelerating sea-ice retreat through the positive cloud-radiation-PWV feedback. By contrast, when sea-ice reached an anomalously high extent in the summer of 1996, anomalous northerly winds and negative anomalies of surface temperature, CF, PWV, surface LW and total energy fluxes were reached. The findings reported here have major implications for improving the simulation of Arctic sea-ice variability and the related extremes of sea-ice extent in a climate model.",

However, Iceland itself constitutes a singularity in terms of the release of radiogenic 143Nd/144Nd to seawater, due to leaching of young volcanic basalts, whereas the Atlantic is dominated by less radiogenic Nd inputs from old Canadian crustal rocks and the European continent. Hence, release of volcanic material may affect the Nd-isotopic composition of water masses recirculating throughout the sub-polar gyre. This is of major importance regarding the use of Nd isotopes in sediments and corals to trace changes of recirculation patterns in the past. Here, seawater was analysed on three transects (local to basin scale) to fingerprint advection patterns as well as local radiogenic Nd sources in the sub-polar gyre domain. The first local transect followed open ocean water on to the shelf near the outflow of the Vatnajökull glacier. It demonstrates that freshwater runoff modifies the open ocean Nd signature only very close to the shelf (<40km near the outflow) and thus reflects a very local feature unlikely possible to alter the predominant water mass composition of Northeast Atlantic water or the underlying Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water. The second transect follows the Iceland shelfbreak from north-east towards the Reykjanes ridge and includes seawater samples near the recently formed volcanic island of Surtsey. Again no major modification of the Atlantic water mass compositions is observed, besides samples in direct vicinity of Surtsey island where local release of Nd modifies seawater εNd (-14) to values as high as -6. Finally we have monitored the isotopic composition of water masses along a North-South transect from Iceland towards the Azores, which confirms that εNd clearly fingerprints water masses of the sub-polar gyre down to 50°N. Hence, Nd isotopes seem a reliable tracer of water mass mixing in the North Atlantic, with only local influences from basalt weathering in shelf areas.",

            "abstract": "To assess the predictability of Arctic sea ice, a linear Markov model has been developed to forecast ice concentration in the pan Arctic region. The model was built to capture co-variability in the atmosphere-ocean-sea ice system that was defined by sea ice concentration, sea surface air and ocean temperature, geopotential height and winds at 300mb. Multivariate empirical orthogonal functions of these variables were used as building blocks. A series of model experiments were carried out to determine the dimension of the model. The predictive skill of the model was evaluated in a cross-validated fashion. The model showed considerable skill within the Arctic Basin during summer and fall. Particularly in the region north of Chukchi Sea, skills for fall predictions are above 0.6 even at 9-month lead. Because the Arctic Basin is completely frozen in winter and spring, the predictability appears in the marginal seas during these seasons. The model had higher skills in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic than in the Pacific sector. The experimental 4-month lead forecast for 2013 September pan Arctic ice extent yielded 5.16 million square kilometers, which slightly under-estimated the observation of 5.40 million square kilometer.",

            "abstract": "Paleogeographic and tectonic reconstructions in the Barberton greenstone belt (BGB) are challenged by syn- and post-depositional tectonics. The Barberton Drilling Project extracted two drill cores from the sedimentary rocks of the 3.26-3.22 Ga Mapepe Formation of the Fig Tree Group. The cores were taken from the Manzimnyama Syncline (BARB4) and the Barite Valley structural belt (BARB5), which are separated by belts of faulted older Onverwacht and younger Moodies strata. Stratigraphically, there is no clear correlation of Mapape strata in these two belts. Both BARB4 and BARB5 contain 25 to 300 m thick units of lithic sandstone that may represent correlative units. A comparative provenance analysis allows testing a possible correlation and evaluating the nature of tectonic uplifts that sourced the sediments. The sandstones have experienced pervasive metasomatic alteration and most primary silicate minerals except coarse quartz have been transformed into micromosaics of microquartz, phyllosilicates, and trace impurities. The majority of framework grains are chert, impure chert, and lithic grains while monocrystalline quartz and altered feldspar are minor components. The single thick sandstone in BARB4 displays a relatively uniform framework mode with average 38.7 % total quartz, 2.4% feldspars, and 58.9 % lithics and an increasing percentage of mafic to ultramafic grains upsection. In contrast, BARB5 includes three distinct sandstones with varying framework modes. The litharenite at 0 to 95m core depth was mainly sourced from an immediately underlying dacitic tuff. The chertarenite at 320 to 390m core depth is composed of 73% carbonaceous chert grains. All grain types appear to have been derived by erosion of sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the BGB as well as penecontemporaneous volcanism. Erosion did not reach deeper-seated plutonic rocks. The framework mode of the BARB4 sandstones represents a composite of common silicified BGB rocks and resembles those of other sediments in the southern domain of the BGB. In contrast, BARB5 sandstones derived locally by shallow erosion of underlying volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The distinct signatures suggest that these units are not correlative and were not derived from a common source. They may be a result of local uplifts of different parts of the greenstone sequence.",

In European Russia, fire mainly occurring on agricultural lands, wetlands, and abandoned lands. In the agricultural practice in Russia prescribed fires are believed to increase pasture and hay productivity, suppress trees and shrub expansion, and reduce fire hazards, with fire frequency fire dependent on land use and agricultural practices. The large-scale socio-economic transition since the fall of the Soviet Union has led to changes in land use and land management, including land abandonment and changing agricultural practices. In June 2014, an extensive field campaign was completed in the Smolensk Oblast, located approximately two hundred kilometers west of Moscow on the border with Belarus. Our field sampling was based on circa 1985 Landsat-based forest cover map (Potapov et al., 2014). Points were randomly selected from the non-forested class of the 1985 classification, prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Of total field collects, 55% points were sampled on land in either early or late stage of abandonment, 15% from actively cropped fields, and 30% from hay or pasture. Fire frequency was calculated for the 108 field points using 1 km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire data for years 2000-2014. Also we calculated percent of points burned in spring 2014 using 30 m Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data to derive burn scars. Actively cropped fields had lowest burn frequency while abandoned lands - early and late stage abandonment - had highest frequency. Fire frequency was significantly higher on wet soils than dry soils, with no relationship between fire frequency and tree canopy cover. We hypothesize, higher fire frequency on abandoned lands was likely due to greater fuel loads and because of traditional belief in rural Russia that fire is efficient way to suppress tree and shrub expansion.",

Hence, to formulate and implement climate risk management strategies, it is essential to detect where and when hydrological extremes have been changing and to what extent. This scientific research presents where and how low flow characteristics, particularly the occurrence, intensity and severity of hydrological extremes, have been changing in fourteen major river basins within the continental U.S. Of particular interest is to detect if monotonic trends in low flow characteristics shifted with decades, reflecting the known climatic shifts, particularly before and after 1980. Persistent low flow conditions in a river can directly influence water supply for domestic, agricultural, industrial, ecological, and other needs; and a monotonic trend in such persistent low flow condition can lead to chronic water scarcity—a main driver of societal and cross-boundary conflicts around the world. Thus, outcomes from this research are instrumental for the water managers to develop suitable adaptive management measures at the locations and times of need.",

            "abstract": "Sliding at the interface between ice and bed governs ice discharge for glaciers, including outlet glaciers in Greenland. Sliding is dependent on water pressure and the distribution of water across the bed. Both of these water qualities are sensitive to basal topography and roughness. Here, we characterize the subglacial environment beneath the ice sheet that feeds several outlet glaciers in West Greenland. These glaciers have time varying velocities that appear to be sensitive to surface water drainage and subglacial water pathways. Pathways are dependent on basal topography that we characterize using AGAP, Operation IceBridge and IcePod ice-penetrating radar data. These topographic data are then fed into a steady-state water flow algorithm to characterize the subglacial water pathways. These inferred pathways are sensitive to the input of water pressure, which we adjust to understand the sensitivity of the drainage network. Our results show that subglacial water pathways beneath outlet glaciers can evolve over time, following a combination of the ice surface slope and the bed slope. The degree to which water flow follows the surface slope or the bed slope depends on the magnitude and spatial heterogeneity of water pressures within the catchment. We find that water pathways are most sensitive to water pressure when the surface and bed have similar slopes. Because individual glaciers have different surface and bed topography, seasonal evolution of the size of the subglacial water catchment can vary considerably between neighboring glaciers.\nTo evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of subglacial water, we examine bed reflectivity using the range-migrated, SAR-focused airborne radar data collected by IceBridge and IcePod. To correct the observed bed reflectivity for attenuation, we use a radar attenuation model that accounts for the ice temperature. The reflectivity analysis allows us to identify water pathways independently of the inferred pathways from the algorithm. We compare both the identified and inferred pathways to yield information on the broad scale water pressure variations, which is important to constrain in order to understand the influence of subglacial hydrology on seasonal ice velocity.",

            "abstract": "The early Cenozoic (~53-33Ma) marks the most recent climatic shift in Earth’s history from a greenhouse to an icehouse world. This interval is characterized by a gradual deep-sea [1] and high-latitude [2, 3] cooling of ~10oC, and only moderate cooling of the tropics [e.g. 2] leading to the Eocene/Oligocene transition (EOT) marked by widespread continental Antarctic glaciation.\nThe cause of long-term Eocene cooling is currently poorly known but a gradual decline in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 is most frequently invoked. However, the majority of available early Eocene CO2 records are uncertain and only weakly correlated with climate variability. The exception to that is the final transition into the icehouse [4] where a decline in the CO2 content of the atmosphere has been suggested as the trigger. Therefore we generated new records of boron isotopes (δ11B) in planktonic foraminifera, a proven proxy of seawater pH [e.g. 5], using multicollector ICPMS [6]. We utilised depth profiles of very well preserved multi-species planktonic foraminifera recovered by the Tanzanian Drilling Project for five time slices spanning 53-37 Ma. Additionlly, we generated approximately 0.8My resolution planktonic foraminifera δ11B records from the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Sites 865 and 1258/1260. Our new records show consistent results of elevated atmospheric CO2 in the early Eocene that decreases through to the late Eocene. We will discuss our new reconstructions of seawater pH and derived atmospheric CO2 concentrations, not only in view of diagenesis, but also of estimates of seawater δ11B composition and alkalinity and their significance for Eocene Antarctic glaciation, in light of potential mechanisms for modulating climate.\n[1] Zachos et al.

The inclusion of stable water isotopes allows us to not only have a comprehensive picture of the climate state during a warm interglacial, but also allows for a direct comparison with climate proxy records. We compare our simulation with isotope data gathered from fossilized corals, which have an excellent temporal resolution and well constrained dating. A model data comparison allows us to see that there was an enhanced seasonality of both temperature and rainfall during the Eemian. While the data tends to produce a stronger winter cooling than the model, we suggest that this may be due to an incomplete climatology, as the measurements taken from the coral only encompasses a few decades. If the data happens to fall during an usually cool decade, the mismatch could be rectified. Alternatively, the data may include the cooling signal associated with centennial scale cold stadials during the Eemian. We test this by performing a freshwater perturbation experiment during the peak interglacial, which causes a pronounced cooling at the core site while the ocean circulation is depressed.",

A primary goal of the CONTRAST campaign was to determine the budget of inorganic bromine in the tropical tropopause. In order to address this issue BrO and HOBr were measured by CIMS on a series of research flights out of Guam. Here we will present our initial observations and compare them to both photochemical and chemical transport models. Preliminary results indicate very low levels of BrO (generally <0.5ppt) in the upper troposphere unless significant mixing ratios of ozone (>70ppbv) were present. The origin(s) of elevated BrO (>1pptv) will be discussed and comparison of CIMS measurements to preliminary DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) data will also be presented.",

These site characteristics are important elements in estimating ground shaking and seismic hazard. In this study, we use three-component broadband and strong motion seismic data from three recent earthquakes to determine site response characteristics in the Seattle and Tacoma basins, Washington. Resonant frequencies and relative amplification of ground motions were determined using Fourier spectral ratios of velocity and acceleration records from the 2012 Mw 6.1 Vancouver Island earthquake, the 2012 Mw 7.8 Queen Charlotte Island earthquake, and the 2014 Mw 6.6 Vancouver Island earthquake. Recordings from sites within and adjacent to the Seattle and Tacoma basins were selected for the study based on their signal to noise ratios. Both the Standard Spectral Ratio (SSR) and the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) methods were used in the analysis, and results from each were compared to examine their agreement and their relation to local geology. Although 57% of the sites (27 out of 48) exhibited consistent results between the two methods, other sites varied considerably. In addition, we use data from the Seattle Liquefaction Array (SLA) to evaluate the site response at 4 different depths. Results indicate that resonant frequencies remain the same at different depths but amplification decreases significantly over the top 50 m.",

The chronic and acute health risks of this dust inhalation have not been well studied nor has the dust been effectively characterized as to its chemical composition, mineral content, or microbial flora. Scientific experiments were designed to study the Kuwaiti and Iraqi dust as to its physical, chemical, and biological characteristics and for its potential to cause adverse health effects. First, dust samples from different locations were collected and processed and exposure data collected. Initial chemical and physical characterization of each sample including particle size distribution and inorganic analysis was conducted, followed by characterization of biologic flora of the dust, including bacteria, fungi and viruses.\nData indicates that the mineralized dust is composed of calcium carbonate over a matrix of metallic silicate nanocrystals containing a variety of trace and heavy metals constituting ~3 % of the PM10 particles by weight, of which ~1% is bioaccessible aluminum and reactive iron, each. The particles also consist of ~1% bioavailable aluminum and reactive iron each. Microbial analysis reveals a significant biodiversity of bacterial, fungi, and viruses of which ~30% are known pathogens. Of the microbes identified, several have hemolytic properties and most have significant antibiotic resistance. Viral analysis indicates a tremendous amount of virons with a large percent of RNA viruses. The level of total suspended particle mass at PM 10 along with environmental & physiological conditions present constitute an excessive exposure to micro-particulates including PM 2.5 and the potential for adverse health effects. Reported data on cell culture and animal studies have indicated a high level of toxicity to these dust particles. Taken together, these data suggest that at the level of dust exposure commonly found in the Middle East (i.e., Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan), in addition to the microbial and metal content of the mineralized dust, constitutes a significant health risk, both acute and chronic, to deployed troops and native inhabitants.",

            "abstract": "Glaciologists have suggested that a relatively small external forcing may compromise the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Further, there is compelling physical evidence that the WAIS has collapsed in the past, at times when the mean global temperature was only a few degrees warmer than it is today. In addition to a rapid increase in global sea level, the collapse of the WAIS could also affect the global circulation of the atmosphere.\nIce sheets are some of the largest topographic features on Earth, causing large regional anomalies in albedo and radiative balance. Our work uses idealized aquaplanet models in tandem with a fully coupled ocean/atmosphere/sea-ice model (CCSM4) to compare the atmospheric, radiative, and oceanic response to a complete loss of the WAIS. Initial findings indicate that the loss of the WAIS leads to a weakening and equator-ward shift of the zonal winds, a development of strong zonal asymmetries in the meridional wind, and a northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. We aim to characterize how the local and global climate is affected by the presence of the WAIS, and how changes in the distribution of Southern Hemisphere ice may be represented in the proxy record.",

            "abstract": "Despite centuries studying thunderstorm electrodynamics, our understanding of these phenomena remains limited. The difficulty lies partly in the large number of processes and their mutual dependency and the wide range of temporal and the spatial scales involved. In this study we combine two numerical models to move toward a simulation that addresses these broad scales. First, we use a 3D numerical model to calculate the large scale quasi-electrostatic (QES) fields and charge distributions built up by updrafts in the thundercloud. This model self-consistently accounts for the conductivities, particle densities, large scale currents and charging mechanisms inside a thundercloud in the atmosphere. Second, we use a time-domain fractal lightning (TDFL) model developed that takes into account both the thermodynamics and electrodynamics of leader development and the return stroke on small time and spatial scales (Liang et al. 2014). The QES model simulates slow thunderstorm charging dynamics, and then passes the state to the TDFL model when a flash is ready to trigger. Using this combined simulation, we explain some recently observed patterns of lightning inside a thunderstorm and within a flash (e.g. Zoghzoghy et al. 2013, 2014). We attempt to constrain properties of the thundercloud like the size and shape of the charge pockets removed from the thundercloud, the flash rate and updraft currents, the relative occurrence rate of different types of lightning, and the cloud charge distribution structure effects on the lightning type.",

            "abstract": "Since the landing in August 2012, DAN has provided a wealth of scientific data from the successful surface operation in both Active mode and Passive mode. While the main DAN science investigation so far has focused in estimating the contents of water-equivalent-hydrogen (WEH) and chlorine-equivalent-neutron-absorption in the surface, here we will provide/discuss low energy (less than about 1 keV) background neutron environment at the Martian surface as measured by DAN Passive mode operation. Passive mode measurements have been done on almost every sols with durations ranging from 1 hour to ~9 hour, covering different times of a day. Neutrons from the onboard power source Multi Mission Radioisotope Thermonuclear Generator (MMRTG) and induced by Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR)/Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) interactions with the Martian atmosphere and the surface material contribute to the DAN passive data. An approach to separate out the respective contributions from the DAN total count rates was developed previously (Jun et al., 2013) using the data collected at Rocknest (where the rover stayed from sol 60 to sol 100). The main goal of this paper is to extend the same analysis to other locations encountered during the rover traverse especially to understand the long-term (through Sol 800, covering more than 1 Martian year) behavior of the neutron environment at the Martian surface as measured by DAN in response to variation of the free space GCR/SEP environment. Extensive Monte Carlo transport simulations using Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX) have been performed to support the analysis and to aid interpretation of the DAN passive data.\nIn addition, the DAN passive data are compared to the long-term surface temperature and pressure data (both measured and modeled) from Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) to investigate possible correlation of the DAN data with ambient environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "The rational management of oil and gas reservoir requires an understanding of its response to existing and planned schemes of exploitation and operation. Such understanding requires analyzing and quantifying the influence of the subsurface uncertainties on predictions of oil and gas production. As the subsurface properties are typically heterogeneous causing a large number of model parameters, the dimension independent Monte Carlo (MC) method is usually used for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Recently, multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods were proposed, as a variance reduction technique, in order to improve computational efficiency of MC methods in UQ. In this effort, we propose a new acceleration approach for MLMC method to further reduce the total computational cost by exploiting model hierarchies. Specifically, for each model simulation on a new added level of MLMC, we take advantage of the approximation of the model outputs constructed based on simulations on previous levels to provide better initial states of new simulations, which will help improve efficiency by, e.g. reducing the number of iterations in linear system solving or the number of needed time-steps. This is achieved by using mesh-free interpolation methods, such as Shepard interpolation and radial basis approximation. Our approach is applied to a highly heterogeneous reservoir model from the tenth SPE project. The results indicate that the accelerated MLMC can achieve the same accuracy as standard MLMC with a significantly reduced cost.",

            "abstract": "Thawing permafrost and marine methane hydrate destabilization have been proposed as large sources of methane to the atmosphere in the future warming world. To evaluate this hypothesis it is useful to ask whether such methane releases happened during past warming events. The two major abrupt warming events of the last deglaciation, Oldest Dryas – Bølling (OD–B) and Younger Dryas – Preboreal (YD-PB), were associated with large (up to 50%) increases in atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations. The sources of these large warming-driven CH4 increases remain incompletely understood, with possible contributions from tropical and boreal wetlands, thawing permafrost as well as marine CH4 hydrates. We present new measurements of 14C of paleoatmospheric CH4 over the YD-PB transition from ancient ice outcropping at Taylor Glacier, Antarctica. 14C can unambiguously identify CH4 emissions from “old carbon” sources, such as permafrost and CH4 hydrates. The only prior study of paleoatmospheric 14CH4 (from Greenland ice) suggested that wetlands were the main driver of the YD-PB CH4 increase, but the results were weakened by an unexpected and poorly understood 14CH4 component from in situ cosmogenic production directly in near-surface ice. In this new study, we have been able to accurately characterize and correct for the cosmogenic 14CH4 component. Preliminary analysis of the results indicates that ≈10% of the overall CH4 source to the atmosphere during the nearly-constant climate of the YD was attributable to 14C-free sources. This 14C-free source fraction increased slightly over the YD-PB transition, however, wetlands were nonetheless the main driver of the CH4 increase. Final analysis and interpretation of the 14CH4 data are currently in progress.",

            "abstract": "The hydrological cycle is expected to undergo substantial changes in response to global warming, with all climate models predicting an increase in global-mean precipitation. There is considerable spread among models, however, in the projected increase of global-mean precipitation, even when normalized by surface temperature change. In an attempt to develop a better physical understanding of the causes of this intermodel spread, we investigate the rapid and temperature-mediated responses of global-mean precipitation to CO2 forcing in an ensemble of CMIP5 models by applying regression analysis to pre-industrial and abrupt quadrupled CO2 simulations, and focus on the atmospheric radiative terms that balance global precipitation. The intermodel spread in the temperature-mediated component, which dominates the spread in total hydrological sensitivity, is highly correlated with the spread in temperature-mediated clear-sky shortwave (SW) atmospheric heating among models. Upon further analysis of the sources of intermodel variability in SW heating, we find that increases of upper atmosphere and (to a lesser extent) total column water vapor in response to 1K surface warming only partly explain intermodel differences in the SW response. Instead, most of the spread in the SW heating term is explained by intermodel differences in the sensitivity of SW absorption to fixed changes in column water vapor. This suggests that differences in SW radiative transfer codes among models are the dominant source of variability in the response of atmospheric SW heating to warming. Better understanding of the SW heating sensitivity to water vapor in climate models appears to be critical for reducing uncertainty in the global hydrological response to future warming. Current work entails analysis of observations to potentially constrain the intermodel spread in SW sensitivity to water vapor, as well as more detailed investigation of the radiative transfer schemes in different models and how they relate to the sensitivity of SW heating.",

Prominences may exist for days or months prior to eruption and the magnetic structure of the cavity during the quiescent period is important to understanding the pre-eruption phase. We describe observations of a coronal cavity with a hot core situated above a polar crown prominence. The cavity, visible on the southwest limb, was observed for a period of three hours as a Hinode Coordinated Observation (HOP 114). Using Hinode’s X-ray Telescope (XRT) and EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) we present the thermal emission properties and coronal velocity structures of the cavity. We find the core has hotter temperatures than the surrounding plasma and there is evidence of turbulent velocities within the cavity. We also investigate the interaction of the cavity with the prominence material using Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) data and H-alpha data from Hinode’s Solar Optical Telescope (SOT). We find evidence of hot plasma at the spine of the prominence reaching into the cavity. These observations suggest a cylindrical flux tube best represents the cavity structure. The magnetic structure of the cavity is further discussed using data from the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP).\nThis work is supported by under contract SP02H1701R from Lockheed-Martin to SAO, contract NNM07AB07C from NASA to SAO and grant number NNX12AI30G from NASA to SAO.",

Nitrate is also measured in ice cores as a potential record of NOx in the past. A complete picture of the location, concentration, and availability of nitrate in snow and ice in Earth’s environment is currently lacking, but is essential to modelling air-snow chemical interactions. In this laboratory study, nitrate near the bottom surface of polycrystalline ice was observed with attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). Upon freezing millimolar solutions of sodium nitrate (NaNO3), magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2), and nitric acid (HNO3), the concentration of nitrate near the surface at -18 to -1°C was enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The nitrate concentration near the surface is close to values predicted by the bulk phase diagrams at warm temperatures. At colder temperatures, however, the concentration is less than predicted, even after annealing. In order to more closely approximate snow, ice was deposited on a cold ATR crystal from the gas phase with concurrent or subsequent exposure to gas-phase nitric acid. The potential advantages and limitations of ATR-IR in studying dendritic ice in the laboratory will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Vulnerability of the US Gulf coast to inundation has received increased attention since hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Compounding effects of sea level rise, wetland loss, and regional and local subsidence makes flood protection a difficult challenge, and particularly for the New Orleans area. Key to flood protection is precise knowledge of elevations and elevation changes. Analysis of historical and continuing geodetic measurements show surprising complexity, including locations subsiding more rapidly than considered during planning of hurricane protection and coastal restoration projects. Combining traditional, precise geodetic data with interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations can provide geographically dense constraints on surface deformation. The Gulf Coast environment is challenging for InSAR techniques, especially with systems not designed for interferometry. We use two InSAR capable systems, the L- band (24 cm wavelength) airborne JPL/NASA UAVSAR, and the DLR/EADS Astrium spaceborne TerraSAR X-band (3 cm wavelength), and compare results. First, we are applying pair-wise InSAR to the longer wavelength UAVSAR data to detect localized elevation changes potentially impacting flood protection infrastructure from 2009 - 2014. We focus on areas on and near flood protection infrastructure to identify changes indicative of subsidence, structural deformation, and/or seepage. The Spaceborne TerraSAR X-band SAR system has relatively frequent observations, and dense persistent scatterers in urban areas, enabling measurement of very small displacements. We compare L-band UAVSAR results with permanent scatterer (PS-InSAR) and Short Baseline Subsets (SBAS) interferometric analyses of a stack composed by 28 TerraSAR X-band images acquired over the same period. Thus we can evaluate results from the different radar frequencies and analyses techniques. Preliminary results indicate subsidence features potentially of a variety of causes, including ground water pumping to post recent construction ground compaction. Our overall goal is to enable incorporation of InSAR into the decision making process via identification and delineation of areas of persistent subsidence, and provide input to improve monitoring and planning in flood risk areas.",

            "abstract": "Fire activity has increased across the boreal forest biome in conjuction with climate warming and drying. Because these forests contain a large proportion of global terrestrial carbon (C) stocks, there has been great interest in understanding feedbacks between a changing fire regime and climate warming. An important mechanism by which increased fire activity may alter boreal C balance is by consuming the soil organic layer (SOL). Fire removal of the SOL may alter germination microsites and tree recruitment, thereby altering forest successional trajectories and C accumulation and storage. In permafrost soils, loss of the insulating SOL can increase soil temperature and active layer depth, impacting growth and survival conditions for both soil microbes and vegetation. To assess fire severity effects on permafrost soils and tree recruitment, we conducted plot-level experimental burns in July 2012 in a larch forest near Cherskii, Siberia. We achieved four burn severity treatments based on residual SOL depths: control, low (> 8 cm), moderate (5-8 cm), and high severity (2-5 cm). For two growing seasons post-fire, we measured thaw depth, soil moisture, and soil temperature. We sowed larch seeds in fall 2012 and 2013 and quantified seedling establishment and vegetation re-growth for two growing seasons. Immediately post-fire, thaw depth increased rapidly with increasing fire severity, and this trend has persisted for two years. In 2013 and 2014, thaw depth was ~ 40 cm deeper in high severity plots compared to controls, likely due to lower summer soil insulation, higher black char cover, and higher surface soil temperatures. We observed little to no larch recruitment in unburned and low severity plots, but new seedling density was ~5 seedlings m-2 in moderate and high severity plots, which had low cover of other vegetation types and high soil moisture. Findings suggest that increased fire severity may increase larch recruitment and provide favorable soil conditions for tree growth. As a consequence, forest density and potential to accumulate and store C in tree biomass will likely increase. The balance between C lost via fire and microbial respiration and C gained due to changes in forest stand structure will determine whether boreal forests represent a C pool or sink under changing fire regimes.",

The inclusion of the prognostic aerosol model in the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) is a major breakthrough in the model development of CAM. The Single Column Model (SCM) version of CAM is very useful tool for an efficient development of model numeric and physics. However, SCM hasn’t been well maintained due to focus to the full 3D model. SCM hasn’t been updated appropriately to handle the prognostic aerosol model in CAM. In this study we identify the problems of using the default SCM version of CAM5 (SCAM5) and introduce fixes to the identified problems. We used four different aerosol specification methods in the SCM simulations. The aerosol specifications are default model (with prognostic aerosol, initialized to zero), prescribed aerosol (with monthly climatological aerosol values), observed aerosol (with aerosols from observations), and a case with fixed droplet concentration. We use SCM simulations with the different aerosol specification for a variety of cloud regimes. The sites used for these study include subtropical drizzling stratocumulus (DYCOMSRF02), multi-level Arctic clouds (MPACE-B), shallow convection (RICO), and summertime mid-latitude continental convection (ARM95). Simulations at the default time step and default model resolution were conducted and results are analyzed and compared to observations and previous Large Eddy Simulation (LES) studies.",

            "abstract": "Large areas of mesotidal estuaries become subaerial during low tide. Here we study the effect of nutrient enrichment and several meteorological and hydrodynamic parameters on the erodability of mudflat substrates when they are emergent. We tested the impact of nutrient fertilization on tidal flat sediments over a two week period in September 2011 in Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts (USA). High resolution measurements from our experiment indicate that daily nutrient enrichment does not change the erosion threshold of the muddy substrate, nor affect the concentration of chlorophyll a at the surface. Sediment erodability is instead directly related to the potential evaporation rate and to the duration of the subaerial period. Chlorophyll a concentration decreases when evaporation is high, possibly due to the downward migration of diatoms. Sediment concentrations in the water column during submergence strongly depend on bottom shear stresses triggered by tidal currents. Surprisingly, they are also related to the total evaporation that occurred in the previous emergence period. We conclude that subaerial desiccation at low tide decreases the erodability of mudflat sediments. This strengthening effect is not lost during the following submerged period, thus limiting the erosive effect of tidal currents. For the first time we show that not only subaqueous but also subaerial processes control the erodability of mudflats. Global warming and other climatic variations regulating long-term evaporation rates can therefore directly affect the stability of mudflats in mesotidal environments.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, climate change has become an area of increasing importance as researchers strive to better understand the impact of increased greenhouse gas concentrations on earth’s atmosphere. Past studies suggest that in the thermosphere and ionosphere, there is a cooling effect which results in a reduction in neutral densities and height dependent changes in electron density. The purpose of this study is to further investigate the long-term changes in the neutral atmosphere by using ground-based incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements of the ionosphere and thermosphere. Ion energy balance calculations can be used to estimate exospheric temperature and neutral oxygen density from the radar-measured ionospheric parameters. By using modified versions of existing codes that describe the ion energy balance equations [Nicolls et al., 2006], ionospheric data collected from the Millstone Hill ISR (42.6°N, 288.5°E) between 200 and 600 km from 2002-2013 has been used to calculate exospheric temperature and neutral oxygen density. These results are then used to create a new local empirical model that can describe the climatology of these parameters, varying with local time, season, and solar and geomagnetic activities. Comparing the exospheric temperature and neutral oxygen density data measured at Millstone Hill to corresponding MSIS values, there is a possible long-term cooling trend seen in these observed thermospheric parameters at Millstone Hill. These results, based on the most recent solar cycle observations, will be extended to include more solar cycles, and a much improved understanding of the thermospheric long-term trends may be reached.",

            "abstract": "The majority of watersheds within the United States have been disturbed by anthropogenic land use change. On top of this, there is strong evidence of (historic and projected) climatic changes that affect earth's hydrologic cycle. Streamflow measurements integrate the effects of land use and climate change on watershed hydrology. Therefore, when temporal trends are present, teasing out the cause is challenging due to the overlying climate and land use signals. In this study, we develop an analytical framework for distinguishing trends in streamflow that are driven by climate change from those that are driven by land use change. This framework is based on the theory that during wetter years runoff is affected more by changes in climate than during drier years. Whereas, the inverse is true for land use change. During wetter years runoff is affected less by land use change than during drier years. This difference can be seen in the quantile regression of the 75th and 25th percentile annual stream flows which represent wetter and drier years, respectively. This creates a defining characteristic in how these two forcing mechanisms manifest within the streamflow record. We empirically test this framework and show that the sensitivity of runoff to climate and land use change is uniquely dependent on the spatiotemporal water and energy limitations of a catchment. Finally we apply the framework using 1,566 watersheds across the contiguous United States. We use gages from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS) network. The gages are selected because they have continuous and complete data from the years 1950 to 2009 and represent watersheds which are characterized by a range of disturbances. Our results show that the driving mechanisms of streamflow change across the U.S. are regionally coherent and correspond with land management activities and climate zones. This methodology provides a simple means of classifying watershed to regional scale hydroclimatic change without relying on reference stream gages, complex models, or observational climate networks.

            "abstract": "Recent research has shown that there are events where SSTA warming peaks in the eastern Pacific (EP El Niño) and where warming peaks in the central Pacific (CP El Niño), and CP events seem to be more prevalent in recent years. From a prediction standpoint, the ability of climate models to predict the differences in events may be important, as differences lead to distinctive climate impacts over regions such as North America. Research using the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) showed a tendency for excess eastern Pacific warming during CP events. Additionally, observed and modeled CP events tend to be weaker than EP events. One might assume that the comparatively weaker CP events would lead to weaker teleconnections and less predictability in regions such as North America. However, large scale, expected impacts are captured in NMME predictions for both types of events. Using ensemble agreement on the sign of the anomaly as a proxy for prediction skill in NMME, the strength of the event in the eastern or central Pacific leads to larger ensemble agreement in some North American regions. Precipitation ensemble agreement in the southeast US demonstrates a strong connection to eastern Pacific warming, and strong warm events lead to larger ensemble agreement. Precipitation ensemble agreement in the northwest US demonstrates a weak connection to central Pacific warming. Other regions, such as Northwestern US 2-meter temperature, do not show any change in ensemble agreement with strength of event. While the strength of event is only important for some North American regions, the ability of model predictions to correctly capture the position of warming for teleconnections is nevertheless of concern. Anomalously high SSTA in the eastern Pacific during CP events could lead to excessive forecast agreement in regions such as the Southeast, where larger NINO3 anomalies lead to larger ensemble agreement.",

These signals are most prevalent when the ionosphere magnetic field dips into the atmosphere, enabling the electromagnetic signal to enter the ionosphere. The signals can extend over the full bandwidth of the instrument, up to 64 Hz. The waves are nearly circularly polarized and are right-hand polarized, as expected for whistler-mode propagation generated by lightning. When isolated bursts of signal occur, dispersion is seen in which the high-frequency waves arrive first. This is the expected signature generated by impulsive electric discharges. These observations suggest that the rate of lightning occurrence on Venus is not unlike the terrestrial rate where atmosphere chemistry is affected measurably by these discharges. When Venus Express was inserted into its 24-hour elliptical polar orbit, periapsis was near 80 degrees and later precessed up to 88 degrees. Now in the orbit, Venus Express has precessed over the pole and has reached lower latitudes than on arrival. The spacecraft is in the final stages of its 8 year mission and reaching the lowest latitudes yet. In this study we present statistics of lightning-associated ELF signals from recent observations spanning more than 3 Venus years.",

            "abstract": "The North Anatolian Fault Zone is a narrow zone along a length of ~900 km and width of 10 km between the Karlıova to the east and Dokurcun Valley to the west. The fault zone splays into three strands around the Dokurcun Valley and forms a wide zone with a length of 400 km and width of 100 km. From the Dokurcun Valley, while the northern strand follows a route along the Lake Sapanca, Izmit Gulf, Marmara Sea and Saroz Gulf and connects to the North Aegean Trough, the middle strand tracks Lake Iznik, Gemlik and Bandırma Bays and southern coasts of the Marmara Sea. Although there is not a consensus on where it branches from the main strand, it is generally accepted that it trails a definite route along the Yenişehir, Bursa, Manyas-Karacabey and Yenice basins, and continues towards the Edremit Gulf in the west. Given the slip rates and seismic activities of the last century, the ranking between these three strands show a decrease from north to south. Among these three strands, the northern one offers significant differences with high values compared to the middle and southern strands. The aim of this study is to compare the differences represented by slip rate and seismicity data with morphometric features of the three strands of North Anatolian Fault Zone that controlled by their activities during the Quaternary period. We have calculated the morphometric values for each of the fault strands in the Marmara Region according to geomorphic indices. Our study presents the middle strand, which has represented the lower activity during the instrumental period, has an important sense of activity.",

            "abstract": "The impact of resolution on atmospheric predictions that will be used as forcing for oceanic models within regions of complex coastal geometry is evaluated. A quadruple nest of The Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System, COAMPS™, is used for hourly and 3-hourly surface wind predictions at four resolutions with ranging scales between 27km and 1 km over coastal waters. We studied the Turkish Straits System which is a two-strait region of complex coastline and topography, and the Chesapeake Bay area having a convoluted coastline. The 27-km coarse resolution model product produces a smoother wind field that can successfully simulate the general low-frequency variation but is unable to capture the high frequency peak events. The land-sea interface at 27-km resolution cannot resolve important details over coastal waters, around islands and along straits that will be crucial for coastal ocean modeling. The friction over land and the blocking of winds are affected by the coastline and landmass representation, therefore increase in resolution allows a more realistic coastline resulting in predictions with less error. As the resolution increases especially at those locations close to complex shorelines, the accuracy of atmospheric predictions increases which will allow the generation of better quality forcing files for ocean models. Results appear to converge at 3-km resolution and further increasing the resolution from 3-km to 1-km does not produce a clear improvement. Fast moving storm systems and frontal events with strong wind speeds and sharp gradients in coastal waters can hardly be captured by 3-hrly winds and an increase in temporal frequency of the wind records to hourly for ocean forcing generation is recommended. The analyses suggest the use of hourly atmospheric products at 3-km resolution as oceanic forcing for both the Turkish Straits System and the Chesapeake Bay region. A preliminary analysis on the direct impact of atmospheric forcing products at different resolutions on coastal ocean predictions using the Advanced Circulation Model, ADCIRC, is also presented.",

            "abstract": "Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) has been proposed as a valuable new measurement for understanding ecosystem carbon fluxes. Net OCS uptake is thought to be a proxy for gross photosynthetic uptake (which can’t be directly measured at large scales). However, our understanding of the OCS flux within forest ecosystems, and it's relationship to CO2, has been limited by a lack of long-term measurements of the OCS flux. Throughout 2011, the ecosystem flux of OCS was measured at a mid-latitude deciduous forest (Harvard Forest, MA, US), a site of long-term CO2 flux measurements. In order to understand the processes contributing to the seasonal ecosystem fluxes of OCS and CO2, we used the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB). This is an enzyme-kinetic model that couples the carbon cycle to the surface energy, water and radiation balance through stomatal regulation. The model has been extended to include a coupled representation of OCS uptake by leaves and soil. Here we test these parameterizations against the whole suite of ecosystem fluxes (including OCS flux) measured throughout the year. We also evaluate the effect of longer-term processes (such as phenology and soil moisture stress) on inter annual variation in ecosystem flux and OCS exchange.",

Frozen carbon in soils, if released through warming, could affect the global carbon balance and climate change. However, their spatial and vertical distributions remain a challenge to explain and map, even with improved spatial datasets. Previous studies revealed the coupling between organic layer depth and permafrost distribution in Alaska, but one knowledge gap remains in the quantity and controls of soil carbon in deeper mineral soils. We gathered together data from more than 700 soil profiles in Alaska and estimated their carbon content in the 0 to 100 cm of mineral soil as well as their organic horizons. The frozen component of the profiles in the Arctic and Boreal regions was strongly correlated with the profile’s organic layer depth and mean annual temperature. Differences were also found when the profiles were grouped according to their topographic position, parent material and ground cover. For example Rocky Uplands and Sandy Lowlands generally held the lowest frozen mineral carbon in the Boreal region while Silty landforms held the highest. Understanding the distribution of the mineral soil carbon pool in Alaska helps improve our ability to model processes the impacts of the change in mineral soil carbon at larger scales.",

            "abstract": "Clouds are very important in the climatic system. They can affect the atmospheric radiation budget by reflecting the incoming solar radiation and absorbing the outgoing terrestrial radiation. Semitransparent or optically thin cirrus clouds are almost all the time in the tropics region. They are composed by ice crystals. They are related with the dehydration of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. In despite of the importance of the clouds, the understanding of cloud characteristics and their effect on radiation is limited. Climate observations and the models outputs have been indicating cloud properties have changed and continue to change with climate warming.\nInclusion of active remote sensors as Lidar on board satellites has constituted a great advance on the atmospheric remote sensing. This type of instrument is able to retrieve the profile of clouds mainly semitransparent ones determining multiple layers of these cloud types.\nWe present in this paper a study of the cloud optical depth (COD) and the occurrence frequency and frequency profile of clouds in a region around Embrapa measurement site at Manaus (2.89 ºS, 59.97 ºW, 100 masl). For this purpose level 2 version 3 cloud profile data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument on board Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite is used. The studied period extend from June 2006 to June 2014. The cloud optical depth frequency distributions are determined for all cloud types; resulting more frequent the semitransparent cloud types with lowest COD values. The higher COD values correcponding to the opaque cloud types. Mean monthly and hourly behaviors of the occurrence frequency of cloud types are studied. Cirrus transparent is the most frequent cloud type in all months and hours, with a maximum in September and 5 at GMT. Also, are presented and discussed the monthly and hourly frequency profile of all cloud types and the semitransparent cirrus cloud type. These results are compared with cloud optical depth measurements from the ground based Lidar and sun-photometer installed in the Embrapa experimental site.",

            "abstract": "The oxygen isotope ratio (δ18Op) of precipitation at mid-latitudes varies in response to multiple weather and climate influences and is difficult to interpret without constraining each potential influence. This is particularly true in pre-historic records when climate boundary conditions and forcings were different. As an example Middle East (ME) Holocene records have been interpreted in multiple, conflicting ways. We investigate the previous proxy interpretations with an isotope-enabled climate model in order to assess how each atmospheric influence affected the δ18Op record. Two model simulations were conducted with the Isotope-incorporated Global Spectral Modal (IsoGSM): 1) with present-day conditions and 2) with mid-Holocene (MH) conditions. For the MH simulation, changes were made to surface forcing, orbital parameters and greenhouse gas concentrations. The model results show the annual averaged δ18Op 6 kya was lower than modern by 0.3-1‰ within the ME, consistent with published proxy records. Today the δ18Op exhibits lower δ18Op during the winter and higher δ18Op in both fall and spring. Our results show that the primary driver of mean annual δ18Op at mid-latitudes during the MH was variations in the strength and duration of the seasonal precipitation cycle, specifically atmospheric conditions in late spring. Focusing on the late spring, we find that the lower MH δ18Op signal can be explained by a strengthened springtime Cyprus low, resulting in additional moisture transport from the western Mediterranean. This reduces springtime temperatures by bringing colder air from the European continent, and this additional moisture increases seasonal precipitation. Finally, there is lower δ18O of vapor at the upstream moisture source during the MH. Results from IsoGSM suggest that the fractional change in the annual mean δ18Op 6000 years was 60% due to upstream δ18O of vapor changes, 30% to temperature change (-0.7 C), and 10% to precipitation amount change (+10 mm) during the spring. Therefore, δ18O proxy records in the ME are found to be highly sensitive to multiple springtime influences, both local and upstream, and must be carefully evaluated to ensure they are not misinterpreted.",

            "abstract": "Thermoelectric power production at risk, owing to current and projected water scarcity and rising stream temperatures, is assessed for the continental United States (US) at decadal scales. Regional water scarcity is driven by climate variability and change, as well as by multi-sector water demand. While a planning horizon of zero to about thirty years is occasionally prescribed by stakeholders, the challenges to risk assessment at these scales include the difficulty in delineating decadal climate trends from intrinsic natural or multiple model variability. Current generation global climate or earth system models are not credible at the spatial resolutions of power plants, especially for surface water quantity and stream temperatures, which further exacerbates the assessment challenge. Population changes, which are anyway difficult to project, cannot serve as adequate proxies for changes in the water demand across sectors. The hypothesis that robust assessments of power production at risks are possible, despite the uncertainties, has been examined as a proof of concept. An approach is presented for delineating water scarcity and temperature from climate models, observations and population storylines, as well as for assessing power production at risk by examining geospatial correlations of power plant locations within regions where the usable water supply for energy production happens to be scarcer and warmer.\nAcknowledgment: Funding provided by US DOE’s ARPA-E through Award DE-AR0000374.",

            "abstract": "Volcanically erupted mafic enclaves are typically vesicular, with the bubbles forming when the mafic magma cools after it is injected and disaggregated into a cooler silicic magma. This study uses hydrothermal experiments to investigate the kinetics of pre-eruptive bubble nucleation and growth within mafic magmas, focused on the efficiency of nucleation on different minerals, and to quantify the growth rate of bubbles with varying cooling rates. Starting materials are natural mafic enclaves from Southwest Trident, Alaska. Experiments were initially equilibrated with H2O at 85 MPa and 1065 °C for 2 hours, producing a melt with blocky crystals of plagioclase and pyroxene, and spherical bubbles with a mean 30 µm diameter and number density (Nv) of 7.2x104 cm-3. Upon cooling to 1015 °C at 2 °C/h, the mineralogy and Nv did not change (although total crystallinity increased), while the mean bubble diameter increased to 90 µm. Cooling further to 985 °C at 2 °C/h, resulted in the crystallization of Fe-Ti oxides, along with an abrupt Nv increase (3.0x105 cm-3) of bubbles with a mean diameter of 60 µm. This abrupt bubble nucleation event, coinciding with the formation of Fe-Ti oxides, suggests that plagioclase and pyroxene are poor bubble nucleation sites in mafic melts, and that Fe-Ti oxides are good bubble nucleation sites, similar to previous results using rhyolite melts. Additionally, the occurrence of this nucleation event suggests that cooling related diffusive growth of bubbles in mafic enclaves, under magma chamber conditions, is too slow to keep up with increasing volatile saturation in the melt, and that the melt may become supersaturated until nucleation sites for new bubbles become available. Rapid cooling (1065-985 °C at 110 °C/h) produced abundant acicular plagioclase and pyroxene crystals (no Fe-Ti oxides), and bubbles with a nearly identical mean diameter and Nv to experiments equilibrated at 1065 °C. It is therefore likely that bubbles will not nucleate or grow significantly during rapid cooling and crystallization of mafic enclaves until Fe-Ti oxide nucleation sites are available. Overall, these experimental results indicate that cooling and crystallization induced pre-eruptive bubble generation in mafic enclaves is strongly controlled by the availability of Fe-Ti oxide nucleation sites.",

Experiments were carried out under anhydrous conditions. In each experiment, a sample column composed of a sample and alumina pistons was assembled with a boron nitride sleeve and graphite resistance heater into a 6.2-mm edge length cubic pressure medium. Experiments were carried out at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In a run, differential stress and sample displacement were monitored in-situ using synchrotron x-ray diffraction and radiography, respectively. Based on results from this study, the deformation behavior of enstatite under anhydrous conditions has been quantitatively presented in the form of a flow law that describes the dependence of deformation rate on stress, temperature, and pressure. Specifically, data fitting yields the dependence of creep rate on stress with an exponent of n ≈ 1; indicating samples were deformed in the regime of diffusion creep. Experimental results also yield the dependences of creep rate on temperature and pressure with an activation energy of ~250 kJ/mol and activation volume of ~3.5×10-6 m3/mol, respectively.

Natural events and human activities are believed to contribute to this trend. Differentiating natural from anthropogenic forcing on the climate system is one of the major challenges of future climate prediction. For evaluating the natural climate evolution and anthropogenic contribution to the present-day interglacial, it is of extreme importance to compare the Holocene to a large set of older interglacial periods to better understand the natural climate variability. In order to better understand the climatic and productivity conditions during past interglacials we are studying Marine Isotope Stage 19 and 11, in the recently collected SW Iberian margin sequence of Site U1385, the Shackleton site from IODP Expedition 339. Interglacials occurring at 780 ka (MIS 19) and 420 ka (MIS 11) are, in terms of orbital configuration, the closest analogues to the present interglacial, and we expect, therefore, that the understanding of these interglacials instabilities will provide crucial information on the dynamics of the ongoing climate. In this study we present records for the past sea surface temperature based in Uk’37-SST, paleo-productivity derivate from total alkenone and total organic carbon and continental input reconstructions at orbital, millennial and sub-millennial scales. The results show warmest conditions during the oldest interglacials, but similar Ocean Primary Productivity pattern during past and present Interglacial.",

            "abstract": "The circulation structure across Broad Sound, a weakly stratified system was characterized using velocity data from two moorings in late summer/fall of 2013 and velocity and density data from a ship survey conducted over a tidal cycle during the same period. The tidal signal demonstrated a strong lateral gradient in the along-sound flow structure and complex patterns were observed in the intratidal velocity data. Local wind forcing in large part, drove fluctuations at the subtidal time scales. Despite having a triangular bathymetric cross section, the wind-driven circulation was vertically sheared as a result of the relatively deep nature of the sound, reducing the importance of bottom friction and hence bottom bathymetry. In contrast to the slopes, the thalweg had a three-layer response to wind forcing with near-bottom fluctuations being positively correlated with wind. This response is speculated to result from alterations in the density gradient that could arise from downwelling (upwelling) of freshwater (denser) water at the head of the bay. Furthermore, Coriolis force was an important factor in structuring the mean circulation having strong lateral shear with inflow (outflow) over the thalweg and eastern slope (western slope). The qualitative similarities (i.e., lateral and vertical shear structure) to analytical models indicate density-driven circulation is a significant component of the mean circulation.",

            "abstract": "Despite 150 years of investigation of the Bohemian Massif (Central Europe), it is only recently that the investigation of old and new samples displayed the occurrence of tiny portions of crystallized anatectic melt in regional migmatites. These vestiges of magma, called “nanogranites”, are natural probes of the partial melting processes in the crust. Original melt composition and water content can be directly analyzed after piston cylinder re-homogenization. When compared to classic re-melting experiments, nanogranites are ideal “natural” experimental charges of anatectic melt. They are encapsulated in peritectic garnet immediately after production – both phases are products of the same partial melting reaction. Sheltered inside garnet, they remain unaffected by the physico-chemical changes which affected the host migmatites during their slow cooling, unlike leucosomes and anatexis-related plutons.\nFive different case studies of nanogranite-bearing high-grade rocks have been identified so far: three in metapelites from the Moldanubian Zone, and two in metagranitoids from the Granulitgebirge and Orlica–Śnieżnik Dome. Their characterization provides insights into how the continental crust melts at different depths, from shallow levels to mantle depths, during different moments of its metamorphic history (prograde vs. decompressional melting). For example, the investigation and experimental re-melting of nanogranites from Grt+Ky leucogranulites (Orlica–Śnieżnik Dome) recently provided evidence of prograde melting of metagranitoids under eclogite-facies conditions (T≥875°C and P~2.7 GPa), close to the stability field of coesite. The melt generated is granitic, hydrous (6 wt% H2O) and metaluminous (ASI=1.03), and is at the moment the “deepest” glass obtained through re-homogenization of primary polycrystalline inclusions in natural rocks. This work confirms that nanogranites in migmatites 1) are a powerful tool to constrain anatexis in natural rocks, and 2) can be found, re-homogenized and investigated in rocks melted under variable PT conditions, even at mantle depths.",

            "abstract": "What is the best way to foster creative collaborative interdisciplinary research, education and outreach? In the past, proposal solicitations were open-ended, leaving it to the community to assemble relevant expertise and institutions. In several recent solicitations, the National Science Foundation has required inclusion of specific expertise. For example, the Climate Change Education Partnership solicitation stated, “Each CCEP is required to include substantial involvement of representatives from each of the following communities: climate scientists; experts in the learning sciences; and, practitioners from within formal or informal education venues. This combined expertise is intended to foster innovative, trans-disciplinary advances in climate change education … Additional types of expertise are allowed, but these three required areas must form the core partnership.”\nAn Interdisciplinary Collaboration Survey of the Polar Learning and Responding: PoLAR CCEP (http://thepolarhub.org/) implemented by Goodman Research Group, the project’s evaluators, assessed the PoLAR Partnership to determine if the collaboration is effective and to understand how the experience affects the partners themselves. The data showed that the NSF goal of fostering innovative teams is being met: “It has brought me into contact with new people, ideas, and approaches that are on the cutting edge and that can be applied not only to this project …” Expertise is distributed within and across the partners with most working in three to four of the required areas (climate science, learning science, formal and/or informal education), and they seek advice from partners across the four areas. Partners experience both personal and professional benefits, including increased satisfaction with their own current work and research, and they anticipate continued work with this group of colleagues on this, as well as future projects.\nThis analysis of partnership development and implementation advances understanding of how the diverse but complementary backgrounds of our partners are leading to new connections, bridging different academic fields, and positioning the partnership with the critical mass necessary to tackle challenges with innovative, novel approaches.",

            "abstract": "Most thermochronometers provide point constraints on a temperature–time path. Thermochronometers that record a continuous thermal history over a range of temperatures can provide more robust constraints, but only a few have such potential. One such system is multiple diffusion domain (MDD) modeling of 40Ar/39Ar K–feldspar analyses, which is interpreted to record thermal histories between ~150–300°C. Although this approach has been applied in numerous studies, some workers have questioned its accuracy in some applications. This study tests whether MDD K-feldspar modeling produces an accurate thermal history that is calibrated to other thermochronometers. Samples were collected from the Grayback normal fault block in central Arizona and the Gold Butte block in Nevada. Both blocks were exhumed during Oligo–Miocene extension and the timing and pre-extensional paleogeothermal gradient are well constrained from prior work. At the Grayback block, MDD thermal histories from shallow paleodepths show rapid cooling from 55–65 Ma following ~75 Ma pluton emplacement, slow cooling from 27–55 Ma at middle paleodepths, and rapid cooling at deep structural levels after 27 Ma during tectonic exhumation. The start of rapid cooling and residence temperatures at 27 Ma from MDD models match expected results from prior fission track work at all structural levels. In the Gold Butte block, MDD thermal models at moderate paleodepths also record slow cooling throughout the Mesozoic to early Tertiary, with deeper structural levels recording rapid cooling at 17 Ma, identical to previous work. Samples from the deepest paleodepths yield MDD thermal histories that repeat this pattern, suggesting that the Gold Butte block is not intact but cut by at least one normal fault at relatively deep paleodepths, which was not evident from prior thermochronologic data. Taken as a whole, the results provide strong confirmation that MDD modeling of K–feldspar 40Ar/39Ar analyses can provide accurate continuous thermal histories that are calibrated to other thermochronometers. In addition, the identification of a major basement fault using MDD thermochronology highlights the utility of this approach over other thermochronometers in some applications.",

A good understanding of the past atmospheric CO budget is therefore important for climate models attempting to characterize recent changes in the atmosphere. Previous work at NEEM, Greenland provided the first reconstructions of Arctic atmospheric history of CO concentration and stable isotope ratios (δC18O and δ13CO) from firn air, dating to the 1950s. In this new study, firn air was sampled from eighteen depth levels through the firn column at Summit, Greenland (in May 2013), yielding a second, independent record of Arctic CO concentration and isotopic ratios. Carbon monoxide stable isotope ratios were analyzed on replicate samples and using a newly developed system with improved precision allowing for a more robust reconstruction. The new CO concentration and stable isotope results overall confirm the earlier findings from NEEM, with a CO concentration peak around the 1970s and higher δC18O and δ13CO values associated with peak CO. Modeling and interpretation of the data are in progress.",

Nutrient cycling is carried out by microbial communities in nature, and bacteria that degrade cellulose must be able to obtain a source of fixed nitrogen for growth. We used light wavelength selection to enrich for a series of anoxygenic photosynthetic microbial communities from marine and freshwater environments that degrade cellulose and fix nitrogen. This research examines how the communities carry out these processes. We compare community composition and metabolite production measured using high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography over time of growth of the communities. A freshwater community grown at 590nm showed the highest metabolic rates. Acetate and propionate reached maximum concentration at around day 4 and hydrogen concentrations peaked at 5uM on day 6 at stationary phase. There was no methane production by this culture suggesting methanogens were not present or inactive. In contrast, methanogenesis was very active in another freshwater community grown at 760/940nm. This culture showed acetate and propionate accumulation and hydrogen gas concentrations that decreased over time as well suggesting that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was occurring. A similar trend was observed in a marine community grown at 470nm. This work can enable determination of factors important for efficient community nutrient cycling and understanding of community dynamics. Future work will be done to determine the roles of the individual species of bacteria within the communities and to investigate the potential of these communities in biofuel production.",

            "abstract": "Although sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies in the Western Pacific have long been known as part of the classic Southern Oscillation pattern associated with ENSO, there is an unresolved question regarding the dynamics that maintains these. Contrary to traditional studies that assume a single deep baroclinic mode for ENSO response in the tropics, the SLP anomalies in the western Pacific are spatially well separated from the baroclinic signal associated with the tropospheric temperature anomalies in NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, CMIP5 models, and an intermediate complexity model [a quasi-equilibrium tropical circulation model (QTCM)]. Separation of the SLP into its baroclinic and barotropic components indicates that the baroclinic mode SLP contributions are in the central and eastern Pacific (coincident with the temperature anomalies), whereas the western Pacific SLP anomalies arise primarily from barotropic mode contributions.\nIn a set of QTCM experiments, we suppress anomalies in baroclinic-barotropic interaction terms, i.e., anomalies of the barotropic Rossby wave source, over successively wider latitudinal bands in the tropical Pacific, to diagnose their effects on the SLP anomalies in the western Pacific associated with ENSO. In the 15°N-15°S experiment, the pressure signals in the western Pacific are only partly suppressed, whereas in the 30°N-30°S suppression experiment, the anomalies in the western Pacific are almost entirely removed. This suggests the following pathway: interactions with SST anomalies create the baroclinic mode signal in the central and Eastern Pacific, but baroclinic-barotropic interactions, arising substantially in the subtropical Pacific, create a barotropic response that is yields the SLP anomaly pattern in the western Pacific.",

The combination of X-ray micro-focusing with ultrafast area detector techniques permits examination of such complex samples on (sub-)micrometer scale. However, the development of methods of time-efficient and accurate data evaluation is lagging. In particular, the identification of minor minerals or the detection of unknown phases poses challenges. However, it is often such minor or new phases which are of particular interest such as sub-micrometer scale presolar grains or early solar condensates.

            "abstract": "High latitude ecosystem productivity is constrained by cold temperature and moisture limitations to plant growth, while these environmental restrictions may be changing with global warming. Satellite data driven assessments indicate that over the past three decades, rapid warming in the northern high latitudes has resulted in earlier and longer potential growing seasons and widespread greening, due to general relaxation of cold temperature constraints to vegetation productivity. However, warming may have also increased water stress limitations to growth. In this study, we use GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) derived total water storage (TWS), 2-m air temperature (T) from ERA-interim reanalysis, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from MODIS (Collection 5) and satellite data driven vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) estimates as surrogates for vegetation growth, for the period August 2002-December 2013 to evaluate terrestrial water supply controls to vegetation growth changes over the three major river basins of northern Eurasia. We find that during the analyzed period, the apparent growth response follows regional vegetation, moisture and temperature gradients and is spatially complex. In the drier southwest characterized by grassland, vegetation growth is mainly controlled by TWS availability. In the central region, dominated by cold temperature and water limited boreal forest, T is the main control on vegetation growth. In the Lena basin, where vegetation includes both boreal forest and water limited grassland, both T and TWS impact vegetation growth. We suggest that GRACE TWS estimates provide reliable observational constraints on water availability to vegetation that supplement sparse soil moisture observations and satellite precipitation estimates with unknown bias.",

            "abstract": "Snow albedo is known to have a significant impact on energy and water budgets by modulating land-atmosphere flux exchanges. In recent decades, anthropogenic activities that cause dust and soot emission and deposition on snow-covered areas have lead to the alteration of snow albedo. Our study aims to investigate and quantitatively assess the impact of aerosols-in-snow on surface energy and water budgets at a local and regional scale using a recently enhanced regional climate model that has physically based snow processes, including aerosols in snow. We employ NCAR’s WRF-ARW model, which we have previously coupled with a land surface model, Simplified Simple Biosphere version 3 (SSiB-3). We improve the original WRF/SSiB-3 framework to include a snow-radiative transfer model, Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model, which considers the effects of snow grain size and aerosols-in-snow on snow albedo evolution. Furthermore, the modified WRF/SSiB-3 can now account for the deposition and tracking of aerosols in snow. The model is run for 10 continuous years (2000-2009) over North America under two scenarios: (1) no aerosol deposition in snow, and (2) with GOCART dust, black carbon, and organic carbon surface deposition in snow. By comparing the two cases, we can investigate the impact of aerosols-in-snow. We examine the changes in surface energy balance, such as albedo, surface net solar radiation (radiative forcing), and surface air and skin temperature, and how these might interact with, and lead to, changes in the hydrologic cycle, including SWE, runoff, evapotranspiration and soil moisture. We investigate the mechanisms and feedbacks that might contribute to the changes seen across select regions of North America, which are potentially a result of both local and remote effects.",

            "abstract": "The ASCENDS CarbonHawk Experiment Simulator (ACES) is an Intensity-Modulated Continuous-Wave lidar system recently developed at NASA Langley Research Center that seeks to advance technologies and techniques critical to measuring atmospheric column carbon dioxide (CO2) mixing ratios in support of the NASA Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) mission. These advancements include: (1) increasing the power-aperture product to approach ASCENDS mission requirements by implementing multi-aperture telescopes and multiple co-aligned laser transmitters; (2) incorporating high-efficiency, high-power Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs); (3) developing and incorporating a high-bandwidth, low-noise HgCdTe detector and transimpedence amplifier (TIA) subsystem capable of long-duration operation on Global Hawk aircraft, and (4) advancing algorithms for cloud and aerosol discrimination. The ACES instrument architecture is being developed for operation on high-altitude aircraft and will be directly scalable to meet the ASCENDS mission requirements.\nACES simultaneously transmits five laser beams: three from commercial EDFAs operating near 1571 nm, and two from the Exelis oxygen (O2) Raman fiber laser amplifier system operating near 1260 nm. The Integrated-Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) lidar approach is used at both wavelengths to independently measure the CO2 and O2 column number densities and retrieve the average column CO2 mixing ratio. The outgoing laser beams are aligned to the field of view of ACES’ three fiber-coupled 17.8-cm diameter athermal telescopes. The backscattered light collected by the three telescopes is sent to the detector/TIA subsystem, which has a bandwidth of 4.7 MHz and operates service-free using a tactical dewar and cryocooler. Two key laser modulation approaches are being tested to significantly mitigate the effects of thin clouds on the retrieved CO2 column amounts.\nFull instrument development concluded in the spring of 2014. After ground range tests of the instrument, ACES successfully completed six test flights on the Langley Hu-25 aircraft in July, 2014, and recorded data at multiple altitudes over land and ocean surfaces with and without intervening clouds. Preliminary results from these flights will be presented in this paper.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) accounts for a substantial fraction of tropospheric aerosol and has significant impacts on climate and human health. Results from the CARES (Carbonaceous Aerosol and Radiative Effects Study) field mission suggested that isoprene oxidation moderated by anthropogenic emissions plays a dominant role in SOA formation, but current literature isoprene yields and oxidation mechanisms are unable to explain the CARES observations. In this study, we conducted a series of continuous-flow chamber experiments to investigate the yield and chemical composition of SOA formed from isoprene photo-oxidation as a function of NOx concentration. Under low-NOx (< 1ppbv) conditions, we measure SOA mass yields that are significantly larger than previously reported, reaching up to 20%, and the yields are strongly dependent on H2O2 concentrations. The higher yields are likely a result of differences between batch mode and continuous-flow experiments and the photochemical fate of the ISOPOOH intermediate under the high HO2 conditions of the chamber experiments. Online analysis of the SOA using the University of Washington FIGAERO HR-ToF-CIMS instrument shows that a C5H12O6 compound can explain a significant fraction of the mass measured by the AMS. We tentatively identify this compound as a dihydroxy dihydroperoxide produced from the oxidation of ISOPOOH. To our knowledge, we believe this represents the most direct confirmation that such dihydroperoxides form during isoprene oxidation and contribute to SOA. A van Krevelen analysis of HR-AMS data is consistent with hydroperoxide species forming the majority of the SOA. As progressively more NO was added to the system, yields initially increase to a maximum at an NO:isoprene ratio of ~1, and then rapidly decrease, to 3.6% at an NO:isoprene ratio of 4. As NO concentrations increased, alkyl nitrates accounts for an increasing portion of the SOA mass, though hydroperoxides remain significant. These observations of increased yields and the elucidation of isoprene oxidation pathways will allow for more accurate predictions of organic aerosol formation from the photochemical oxidation of isoprene in the ambient atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Essential Principles of Climate Science Literacy states that a climate-literate individual can: “understand the essential principles of Earth’s climate system, assess scientifically credible information about climate change, communicate about climate and climate change in a meaningful way, and make informed and responsible decisions with regard to actions that may affect climate.” We argue that further integration of the social science dimensions of climate change will advance the climate literacy goals of communication and responsible actions. The underlying rationale for this argues: 1) teaching the habits of mind and scientific practices that have synergies across the social and natural sciences can strengthen students ability to understand and assess science in general and that 2) understanding the empirical research on the social, political, and economic processes (including climate science itself) that are part of the climate system is an important step for enabling effective action and communication. For example, while climate literacy has often identified the public’s faulty mental models of climate processes as a partial explanation of complacency, emerging research suggests that the public’s mental models of the social world are equally or more important in leading to informed and responsible climate decisions. Building student’s ability to think across the social and natural sciences by understanding “how we know what we know” through the sciences and a scientific understanding of the social world allows us to achieve climate literacy goals more systematically and completely. To enable this integration we first identify the robust social science insights for the climate science literacy principles that involve social systems. We then briefly identify significant social science contributions to climate science literacy that do not clearly fit within the seven climate literacy principles but arguably could advance climate literacy goals. We conclude with suggestions on how the identified social science insights could be integrated into climate literacy efforts.",

These convectively excited internal waves can transport energy, momentum, and other quantities in a variety of geophysical and atmospherical contexts, including in the Earth's stratosphere, and the radiative zones of stars. To better understand the excitation mechanism, we perform simplified 2D simulations of a recent experiment by Perrard et al. (2013). The simulations are run using the new, very flexible, pseudo-spectral code Dedalus. The experiment and simulations exploit water's density maximum at 4C: a linear temperature profile includes both convectively unstable and stably stratified regions. The simulations and experiment show qualitatively similar excitation spectra. We then test two heuristic models of internal wave excitation by convection, the interface forcing mechanism and the deep excitation mechanism. To test these, we run linear simulations of the simulation. In one case, we solve the linear wave equation, with a boundary condition mimicking the motions of the interface from the simulations. This successfully reproduces the low frequency waves, but overestimates the excitation of high frequency waves. This is because high frequency convective motions are nonlinear, but the interface forcing simulation treats them as linear. Next, we test the deep excitation mechanism by solving the linear wave equation with a source term related to the Reynolds stress in the convective region. This successfully reproduces all waves, and the correlation between the linear model and the full simulation is about 0.95. This suggests that the deep excitation mechanism most accurately explains the wave generation in this system.",

            "abstract": "Measurement of magnetic fields produced by lightning has many advantages over other methods of lightning characterization. Because low frequency magnetic fields produced by lightning decay slowly with distance, magnetic field measurements can be performed at large distances, often in the range of thousands of kilometers. As we have shown previously, coherent time-aligned averaging of similar lightning events can overcome many limiting factors associated with magnetic field measurements at large distances, such as sensitivity, as well as both environmental and sensor noise. Using such a method, it is possible to achieve as broadband noise level of tens of femtotesla, allowing for the detection of signals produced by current moments of a few hundred amp-kilometers. In this work, we present the results of investigation of lightning from four thunderstorms from summer 2013, each located several hundreds of kilometers from the measurement location. Cloud-to-ground (CG) events of both positive and negative polarities are compared between storms, allowing precise, quantitative measurement of flash processes with relatively small current moments, such as continuing currents and leader development. By comparing events from several storms, some conclusions about consistency of processes for both positive and negative CG flashes can be made.",

REX flight equipment augments the NH radio transceiver used for spacecraft communications and tracking. The REX hardware implementation requires 1.6 W and 160 g. This presentation will focus on the final design and the predicted performance of two high-priority observations. First, REX will receive signals from a pair of 70-m antennas on Earth – each transmitting 20 kW at 4.2-cm wavelength – during a diametric radio occultation by Pluto. The data recorded by REX will reveal the surface pressure, the temperature structure of the lower atmosphere, and the surface radius. Second, REX will measure the thermal emission from Pluto at 4.2-cm wavelength during two linear scans across the disk at close range when both the dayside and the nightside are visible, allowing the surface temperature and its spatial variations to be determined. Both scans extend from limb to limb with a resolution of about 10 pixels; one bisects Pluto whereas the second crosses the winter pole. We will illustrate the capabilities of REX by reviewing the method of analysis and the precision achieved in a lunar occultation observed by New Horizons in May 2011. Re-analysis of radio occultation measurements by Voyager 2 at Triton is also under way. More generally, REX objectives include a radio occultation search for Pluto’s ionosphere; examination of Charon through both radio occultation and radiometry; a search for a radar echo from Pluto’s surface; and improved knowledge of the Pluto system mass and the Pluto-Charon mass ratio from a combination of two-way and one-way Doppler frequency measurements.",

Pressure data collected in September 2013 from continuously recording bottom pressure recorders and campaign-style measurements with an ROV indicates that Axial Seamount inflated 1.57 m from April 2011 to September 2013 at an average inflation rate of 61 cm/yr, meaning it had already recovered more than 65% of the deflation from the 2011 eruption within just 2.4 years. The geometry and location of the deformation source is not well constrained by the spatially-sparse pressure data, particularly for the most recent co-eruption deflation and post-eruption inflation signals. Here, we use geodetic data collected in September 2013 to test the fit of multiple numerical models of increasing complexity. We show that for this time period (since April 2011) neither a simple point deformation source (Mogi model) nor an oblate spheroid (penny-shaped crack) provide a good fit to the data. We then use finite element models to build more complex inflation geometries, guided by recent seismically imaged magma reservoirs, in an attempt to understand the source(s) of the observed deformation pattern. The recent seismic data provide good constraints on magma reservoir geometry and show the most robust melt occurs under the southeast part of the caldera at Axial. However, previous geodetic measurements at Axial have consistently shown a deformation source near the caldera center. We use numerical modeling to attempt to reconcile these differences.",

            "abstract": "For the optimal planning and derivation of operation rules for multi-purpose reservoir systems very long time series of daily streamflows are required. Stochastic streamflow models can provide these data. While stochastic generation of monthly time series is state of the art, the synthesis of daily flows at multiple sites is still a challenging task. Recently, nonparametric k - nearest neighbor resampling techniques have been applied successfully for the generation of daily streamflows at multiple sites. The objective of this study to employ k-nn resampling for the simulation of multivariate daily streamflows under changed climate conditions.\nObserved daily streamflows are resampled conditioned on observed and simulated climate variables from regional climate models considering past and future scenarios. The resampling is done in a three step-procedure: 1) seasonal flows for an index station representing the flow sum over all considered gauges are generated; 2) the flow sum is spatially disaggregated by resampling station flow proportions from observed data; 3) the individual seasonal flows for all gauges are temporally disaggregated to daily data by resampling daily flow proportions.\nThe method is applied for a reservoir system in the Harz mountains in Germany comprising five streamflow gauges with long daily observations. Climate data from observations and from the regional climate models REMO and WETTREG are used for conditioning. The method is parsimonious, easy to understand and very fast. It simulates all observed statistics well and provides significant change signals concerning future flows. Problems are the restricted ability of the technique to model values not seen in the observations, which concern on one hand single extreme values and possible future flow sequences not yet observed.",

These classification systems help organize larger geographical areas into areas of similar hydrologic characteristics based on climate, terrain and underlying geology. Such characterization of landscapes into areas of common hydrologic patterning is particularly instructive where site specific hydrologic data is sparse or spatially incomplete. By using broad scale landscape metrics to organize the landscape into discrete, characterized units, natural resources managers can gain valuable understanding of landscape patterning and how locations may be differentially affected by a variety of environmental stressors ranging from land use change to climate change.\nThe heterogeneity of aquatic habitats and undisturbed hydrologic regimes within Bristol Bay are a known principal driver for its overall fisheries stability and the use of hydrologic landscapes offers the ability to better characterize the hydrologic and landscape influences on structuring biotic populations at a regional scale. Here we classify the entire Bristol Bay region into discrete hydrologic landscape units based on indices of annual climate and seasonality, terrain, and geology. We then compared hydrologic landscape units to locations of available long term streamflow for characterization of expected hydrologic behavior where streamflow data was lacking. This demonstration of hydrologic landscapes in Bristol Bay, Alaska shows the utility of using large-scale datasets on climate, terrain and geology to infer broad scale hydrologic patterning within a data poor area.

            "abstract": "There is currently a large demand for high-resolution estimates of inundation extent and flooding for applications in water management, risk assessment and hydrologic modeling. In many regions of the world it is possible to examine the extent of past inundation from visible and infrared imagery provided by sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); however, this is not possible in regions that are densely vegetated or are under persistent cloud cover. As a result of this, there is a need for alternative methodologies that make use of other remotely sensed data sources to inform high-resolution estimates of inundation. One such data source is the AMSR-E/Aqua 37 GHz vertically and horizontally polarized brightness temperature measurements, which have been used in previous studies to estimate the extent of inundated areas and which can make observations in vegetated or cloudy regions. The objective of this work was to develop a decision tree classifier based downscaling methodology by which inundation extent can be obtained at a high resolution, based on microwave brightness temperature measurements and high resolution topographic information.\nUsing a random forest classifier that combined the AMSR-E 37GHz brightness temperatures (~12km mean spatial resolution) and a number of high-resolution topographic indices derived from the National Elevation Dataset for the United States (30m spatial resolution), a high-resolution estimate of inundation was created. A case study of this work is presented for the severe flooding that occurred in Iowa during the summer of 2008. Training and validation data for the random forest classifier were derived from an ensemble of previously existing estimates of inundation from sources such as MODIS imagery, as well as simulated inundation extents generated from a hydrologic routing model. Results of this work suggest that the decision tree based downscaling has skill in producing high-resolution estimates of inundation when informed by the brightness temperature measurements along with high quality training data and can be used to estimate the likelihood of inundation for the region of interest.",

            "abstract": "Aquatic ecosystems across the Arctic are currently experiencing rapid shifts in biotic, chemical, and physical factors in response to climate change. Preliminary data from multiple lakes in southwestern Greenland indicate decreasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations over the past decade. Though several factors may be contributing to this phenomenon, this study attempts to elucidate the potential of heterotrophic bacteria to degrade DOC in the presence of increasing nutrient concentrations. In certain Arctic regions, nutrient subsidies have been released into lakes due to permafrost thaw. If this is occurring in southwestern Greenland, we hypothesized that increased nutrient concentrations will relieve nutrient limitation, thereby allowing heterotrophic bacteria to utilize DOC as an energy source. This prediction was tested using experimental DOC degradation assays from four sample lakes. Four nutrient amendment treatments (control, N, P, and N + P) were used to simulate in situ subsidies. Five time points were sampled during the incubation: days 0, 3, 6, 14, and 60. Total organic carbon (TOC) and parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis were used to monitor the relative concentrations of different DOC fractions over time. In addition, samples for extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) analysis were collected at every time point. Early analysis of fulvic and humic pools of DOC do not indicate any significant change from days 0 to 14. This could be due to the fact that these DOC fractions are relatively recalcitrant. This study will be important in determining whether bacterial degradation could be a contributing factor to DOC decline in arctic lakes.",

            "abstract": "Incoming longwave radiation is an important source of energy contributing to snow and glacier melt. However, estimating the incoming longwave radiation from the atmosphere is challenging due to the highly varying conditions of the atmosphere, especially cloudiness. We analyze the performance of some existing models included a physically-based clear-sky model by Brutsaert (1987) and two different empirical models for all-sky conditions (Lhomme and others, 2007; Herrero and Polo, 2012) at Haig Glacier in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Models are based on relations between readily observed near-surface meteorological data, including temperature, vapor pressure, relative humidity, and estimates of shortwave radiation transmissivity (i.e., clear-sky or cloud-cover indices). This class of models generally requires solar radiation data in order to obtain a proxy for cloud conditions. This is not always available for distributed models of glacier melt, and can have high spatial variations in regions of complex topography, which likely do not reflect the more homogeneous atmospheric longwave emissions. We therefore test longwave radiation parameterizations as a function of near-surface humidity and temperature variables, based on automatic weather station data (half-hourly and mean daily values) from 2004 to 2012. Results from comparative analysis of different incoming longwave radiation parameterizations showed that the locally-calibrated model based on relative humidity and vapour pressure performs better than other published models. Performance is degraded but still better than standard cloud-index based models when we transfer the model to another site, roughly 900 km away, Kwadacha Glacier in the northern Canadian Rockies.",

            "abstract": "Paleoecological proxies, such as charcoal and pollen, are valuable tools for reconstructing previous fire regimes, vegetation change and ecosystem resilience. This study attempts to analyze fire severity and ecosystem response using lake sediments from southeastern Wyoming, during a unique period of time coined the ‘Populus period’ (Carter et al., 2013). The ‘Populus period’ (3,100-4,000 cal yr BP) was a time when vegetation composition changed from a lodgepole pine dominant system to a quaking aspen system. This change in vegetation altered the fire regime from a low frequency regime to a high disturbance regime. This study investigates 12 fire events from 2000-4000 cal yr BP to determine the ecological response associated with the fire events and to identify driver(s) associated with vegetation change and fire regimes. In order to determine fire severity, this study compares high-resolution charcoal and pollen data to peak magnitude data from CharAnalysis (a statistical treatment program). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to set a threshold by which pollen taxa are associated with low or high severity fires. Preliminary LDA results suggest that low severity fires have a peak magnitude lower than 200 particles/cm2/episode and high severity fires have a peak magnitude higher than 200 particles/cm2/episode. Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) will be used to model pollen behavior through fire sample intervals to determine the ecology response associated with each of the 12 fires events. Statistical analysis using LDA and SEA can potentially be used in combination to determine fire severity and thus ecosystem resilience. Long-term reconstructions of fire severity can be beneficial for informing land managers in the 21st century.",

This experiment uses samples from an analogous outcrop to experimentally determine what the consequences of CO2 injection will be. Samples from two potential reservoir zones were quarried from an outcrop south of the drill site in Sun Canyon, Montana. One sample is from a highly porous dolomite. The second sample is from a marginally porous argillaceous carbonate.\nThe purpose of these experiments is to determine whether carbonate minerals (in the marl and dolomite) and susceptible silicate minerals (in the marl) undergo in-situ “weathering” reactions when exposed to the high concentrations of carbonic acid generated by the dissolution of supercritical CO2 in formation water. The reactions of these minerals to carbonic acid has the potential to: 1.) open up pore space through dissolution; 2.) reduce pore space and/or close pore throats by precipitating new minerals, or 3.) cause little change if the reactions take place slowly.\nCores were cut and their physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties analyzed. Mineralogy was determined by thin section analysis, X-ray diffraction, and SEM. Bulk composition was measured by XRF. Experiments exposed the cores to CO2 saturated brine in a flow-through reactor at conditions similar to those found in the subsurface (100C and 15MPa). Changes to the chemical composition of the brine were determined by withdrawing samples at regular intervals during the experiment and analyzing their contents with ion chromatography, spectrophotometry, and ICP-OES. The physical and mineralogical properties of the cores were analyzed after each experiment and compared to the initial conditions.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of plasma speeds inside Saturn's magnetosphere and in the upstream solar wind is important for developing a complete picture of magnetospheric processes at Saturn. Therefore we have developed techniques for extracting plasma speeds from these environments using data from the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) on Cassini. The Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) also measures the plasma speed and other properties, and we rely on CAPS results to validate our approach. However, there are some intervals during which MIMI is oriented more favorably in terms of detecting ambient plasma flows. Furthermore, CAPS operations have ceased, and MIMI provides an alternative way to measure plasma characteristics. In the solar wind, the plasma speed can be determined directly from MIMI's Charge-Energy-Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS) using the easily observable cutoff in He+ pickup ion (PUI) spectra, because there is a well-known relationship between this PUI cutoff and the ambient solar wind speed. PUIs are distributed over a wide angular extent, and thus CHEMS can obtain solar wind speeds at times when CAPS does not see the direct solar wind ions. We present solar wind speeds derived in this way from 2001 to 2004, a period that includes most of the interplanetary cruise preceding the mid-2004 Saturn orbit insertion (SOI) and the long post-SOI loop back into the solar wind. These values show good agreement with CAPS measurements available during the same interval and with a solar wind propagation model. Inside Saturn's magnetosphere, we are using a combination of data from CHEMS and MIMI's Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA) to derive speeds based on anisotropies. CAPS measurements in the magnetosphere are used to validate the MIMI-based speeds, but it is also possible to use our technique for periods when CAPS cannot be used to measure plasma velocities directly. We will present initial results of magnetospheric speeds from 2004 to the present.",

            "abstract": "Crystals and crystal textures contain a wealth of information concerning their host igneous systems (e.g., P-T conditions, age, dynamics). Crystal nucleation and growth occurs in response to supersaturation caused by either cooling or changes in melt composition. Because natural constraints on such kinetic information is rare and difficult to extract, much of our understanding comes from theory and experiments. Using techniques to draw parallels to natural systems has limitations, thus kinetic information extracted from natural systems is noteworthy. Recent work using diffusion modeling to replicate trace element gradients outside of spherulites may provide one method to naturally assess crystallization kinetics in rhyolitic melts. That work constrains spherulite nucleation to an interval of 650 to 500 °C with growth ongoing to temperatures as cool as ~400 °C. Max growth rates were estimated to be ~1 μm hr-1, which exponentially decreased with time. To test those results, we measured the 18O/16O ratios of quartz and alkali feldspar crystals using WiscSIMS (2 S.D. precision was 0.2 to 0.4‰) at targeted positions across spherulites. The spherulites are 500 to 5000 μm in diameter and are internally comprised of radiating, intergrown alkali feldspar and quartz crystals, which decrease in size from core to rim. Isotopic fractionation between quartz and alkali feldspar (∆Qtz-Kfs) is temperature dependent, and is predicted to be ~1‰ at magmatic temperatures and increases with decreasing temperature. If quartz and sanidine indeed crystallized at less than 700 °C, then ∆Qtz-Kfs values should be greater than ~1‰ and increase in crystals nearer spherulite rims. Measured ∆Qtz-Kfs in phenocrysts is 0.6±0.2‰, whereas spherulite cores have ∆Qtz-Kfs of 1.4±0.4‰, which increases to 1.8±0.4‰ near the midpoint of transects, and finally to 2.4±0.3‰ at the spherulite rims (uncertainty is 1 S.D. of Qtz and Kfs populations). Assuming equilibrium fractionation, those values indicate nucleation occurred at 570±100 °C and growth continued to temperatures as cold as 360±50 °C. These estimates imply nucleation was unable to initiate until the melt was undercooled by ~500 °C. Furthermore, crystal growth was able to continue until undercoolings of ~700 °C were reached, at which point slow diffusion likely prohibited growth.",

            "abstract": "Due to their different and complementary sensitivities to structure, multiple seismic observables are often combined to image the Earth’s deep interior. We use a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (rjMCMC) algorithm to incorporate surface wave dispersion, particle motion ellipticity (HZ ratio), and receiver functions into transdimensional, Bayesian inversion for the profiles of shear velocity (Vs), compressional velocity (Vp), and density beneath a seismic station. While traditional inversion approaches seek a single best-fit model, a Bayesian approach yields an ensemble of models, allowing us to fully quantify uncertainty and trade-offs between model parameters. Furthermore, we show that by treating the number model parameters as an unknown to be estimated from the data, we both eliminate the need for a fixed parameterization based on prior information, and obtain better model estimates with reduced trade-offs.\nOptimal weighting of disparate datasets is paramount for maximizing the resolving power of joint inversions. In a Bayesian framework, data uncertainty directly determines the variance of the model posterior probability distribution; therefore, characteristics of the uncertainties on the observables become even more important in the inversion (Bodin et al., 2011). To properly account for the noise characteristics of the different seismic observables, we compute covariance matrices of data errors for each data type by generating realistic synthetic noise using noise covariance matrices computed from thousands of noise samples, and then measuring the seismic observables of interest from synthetic waveforms contaminated by many different realizations of noise. We find large non-diagonal terms in the covariance matrices for different data types, indicating that typical assumptions of uncorrelated data errors are unjustified. We quantify how the use of realistic data covariance matrices in the joint inversion affects the retrieval of seismic structure under different noise conditions, and demonstrate the need for accurate data uncertainty representation in seismic inversions.",

We have designed and built instruments based on the Multi Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) technique and established a network in strategic sites within the Mexico City metropolitan area. Four instruments are now in operation with the aim to study the variability and spatial distribution of key pollutants, which will bring new insight in the current knowledge of transport patterns, emissions as well as frequency and origin of extraordinary events. The instruments measure UV/visible spectra of the sky at different elevation angles in the 280 nm to 510 nm wavelength region along one axis. Currently, 36 measurements constitute a full scan performed from west until East direction (-90 to +90°). The scanning unit, which is installed outdoors, holds a small telescope and the motor control unit. Light is transmitted via an optical fiber to the main box, which holds a compact USB spectrometer and the main control electronics. The spectrometer is accurately temperature controlled and all the spectra of each scan, together with elevation angle and other parameters, are recorded on a compact PC. Post processing of these data with the QDOAS software results in slant column densities (SCD) of the atmospheric gases. This information is then converted to vertical profiles through a process described in a companion presentation. Preliminary results will be presented for formaldehyde, fitted in the region 324-360 nm. The data obtained is useful for the comparison with satellite data for example OMI.",

            "abstract": "The central Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ: New Zealand) has produced numerous large-volume high-silica rhyolite eruptions in the past 1.6 Ma. In this study, we focus on two such eruptions, derived from the same area: the 26.5 ka Oruanui- the most recent supereruption in earth’s history- and the 1.8 ka Taupo- the most recent large, rhyolitic eruption from the TVZ. In order to understand the evolution of these crystal-poor magma bodies and constrain their pre-eruptive residence times in the crust, we use x-ray tomography and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize pumice textures in both Oruanui and Taupo. We obtain crystal size distributions (CSDs) using x-ray tomography for three groups of phases: quartz+feldspar, magnetite+ilmenite, and zircon. Quartz+feldspar size distributions from both eruptions show a shallow-sloped log-linear section describing large crystals (>~200 µm), which we interpret as a pre-eruptive crystal population that grew over time under low supersaturation. Magnetite+ilmenite and zircon size distributions are also log-linear, but have fewer crystals and a smaller maximum crystal size (<200 µm). Taupo quartz+feldspar size distributions are kinked at ~200 µm and show a steep-sloped section describing small crystals (<200 µm), which we interpret to represent a crystal population that nucleated and grew during eruptive decompression. In contrast, Oruanui distributions are not kinked. This difference is supported by EDS compositional maps that show a small (20-50 µm) crystal population in Taupo samples, but not in Oruanui samples. This is consistent with rhyolite-MELTS geobarometry results, which indicate the Taupo magma resided at higher pressures (i.e. greater depth) than did the Oruanui magma. As such, Taupo magma had a longer path to eruption and thus more time for crystal nucleation and growth during decompression. Timescales calculated from CSD slopes of the pre-eruptive crystal populations of magnetite, zircon, and quartz+feldspar indicate residence times on the order of decades to centuries, and at most millennia, for both systems. Timescales calculated for the small crystal population (i.e. the onset of eruptive decompression) indicate a maximum timescale of several years.",

            "abstract": "The interpretation of Sm-Nd systematics for the early Earth relies on knowing the composition of the silicate Earth and the 146Sm decay constant. We have measured both 146Sm-142Nd and 147Sm-143Nd internal systematics of four individual Calcium, Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAIs), the first solids formed in the Solar System [1], from 3 different carbonaceous chondrites from the CV3 group: Allende, Northwest Africa (NWA) 2364 and NWA 6991. Results obtained on NWA 6991 plot on a well-defined mineral and bulk isochron with a Solar System initial 146Sm/144Sm ratio of 0.0070 ±0.0024. This ratio is more consistent with the ratio defined from internal isochrons of differentiated meteorites using the half-life of 103 Ma for 146Sm [2], instead of the value obtained considering the half-life of 68 Ma [3].\nOn the basis of nucleosynthethic anomalies in Sm and Nd isotopes [4], the ordinary (O) and enstatite (E) chondrites remain potential candidates for the Earth’s building blocks. OC have an average deficit of -18±3 ppm relative to modern terrestrial 142Nd/144Nd, whereas EC range from the OC to the terrestrial values [4-6]. Sm stable isotope compositions of the analyzed CAIs indicate that galactic cosmic rays did not affect the 142Nd/144Nd compositions, but deficits are found in the pure p-process 144Sm nuclide (-240 to -290 ppm/ standard). These deficits may translate to 142Nd deficits of a few ppm. NWA 6991 CAI 146Sm-142Nd internal isochron passes through a 142Nd/144Nd ratio of -6 ±6 ppm relative to the terrestrial standard at a chondritic 147Sm/144Nd of 0.1960. We note that this value is identical to the enstatite chondrite average and the 142Nd/144Nd ratio of the lunar mantle, as defined recently by [7] using a chondritic Sm/Nd and Lu/Hf for the bulk Moon. While the determination of the Sm-Nd reference parameters for the bulk Earth is still contentious, the difference in 142Nd/144Nd between modern terrestrial rocks and meteorites analyzed so far is <10ppm.\n[1] Bouvier and Wadhwa (2010) Nat.

            "abstract": "Rivers worldwide are net processors of organic matter(OM), driving the evasive flux of CO2 from inland waters. The Amazon River outgases nearly 0.5PgC/yr, much of which is thought to be driven by the in-situ respiration of terrestrially-derived OM. However, the substrates fueling this respiration and the processes governing it remain fairly unconstrained.\nHere, we chose to examine the roles of in-situ algal and floodplain macrophyte production in fueling respiration in the lower Amazon River. Contrary to the previous assumptions of turbid, tropical rivers, δ18O-O2 data revealed the presence of photosynthetic O2 throughout the main stem of the lower Amazon. This data was used in a steady-state model to estimate the Respiration to Production(R:P) ratio at these sites. This model reveals a low R:P, even at the mouth of the Amazon. Diel O2measurements were made to test this steady-state assumption, revealing little variation over a 24 hour cycle.\nδ18O-O2 and δ13C-DIC data was combined with in-situ, continuous measurements of CO2 and O2 to show spatial trends in respiration and production. The floodplains and adjacent river margins had elevated δ18O(indicating higher photosynthetic input) and δ13C(indicating respiration of C4 macrophytes). Continuous CO2 and O2 measurements revealed that these sites were “hot spots” for respiration, with low O2 saturation and elevated pCO2 fueled by the input of macrophytic OM . Results reveal the importance of spatial dynamics in understanding respiration within large, tidal rivers.",

Interferograms computed from the Italian Space Agency’s COSMO-SkyMed satellites and the German Aerospace Center’s TerraSAR-X satellite show a distinctive triangular pattern of surface deformation that extends to the SE of Kīlauea Caldera starting approximately one month prior to the Kamoamoa eruption. GPS and electronic tilt meter time series for sites in the vicinity of this deformation show that this inflation transient is superimposed on the longer (~4-6 month) summit inflation. We examine and model the spatiotemporal evolution of the summit deformation. InSAR data from ascending and descending tracks are used to constrain models of the transient. To achieve low-levels of atmospheric phase noise required interferograms spanning four months prior to the eruption, thus involving multiple sources within the summit region (see figure). To solve for model parameters we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization approach. First, we model the co-eruption summit deflation to isolate the intra-caldera sources, consisting of a steeply dipping tensile dislocation (D) beneath the western edge of the caldera and a sub-horizontal, NE trending spheroidal pressure source (Y) in the center of the caldera at 1.5 km depth. We use these sources as starting models for the pre-eruption transient, which requires the addition of a sill (S) to explain the deformation that extends to the SE of the caldera. In a third step we add a simplified model for Kīlauea’s rifts and basal detachment system to explain the coupled summit and south flank motion. Modeled at over 3 km beneath the surface, the transient sill source inflates over the month before the eruption and deflates during the four-day eruption. The sill runs parallel to and to the west of upper East Rift Zone (ERZ) seismicity, considered to delineate the primary magma conduit to the ERZ at 3 km depth. The deflation of the sill during the eruption fits with the current standard model for Kīlauea: response to the overall depressurization of the summit and ERZ conduit system due to the Kamoamoa dike intrusion and eruption.",

These include characterization of wild land fire plumes and volcanic ejecta, detailed mapping of lava flows, and inspection of lengthy segments of critical infrastructure, such as the Alaska pipeline and railroad system. Obtaining timely, repeatable, calibrated measurements of these extensive features and infrastructure networks requires localized, taskable assets such as UAVs. The Alaska Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration (ACUASI) provides practical solutions to these problem sets by pairing various IR sensors with a combination of fixed-wing and multi-rotor air vehicles. Fixed-wing assets, such as the Insitu ScanEagle, offer long reach and extended duration capabilities to quickly access remote locations and provide enduring surveillance of the target of interest. Rotary-wing assets, such as the Aeryon Scout or the ACUASI-built Ptarmigan hexcopter, provide a precision capability for detailed horizontal mapping or vertical stratification of atmospheric phenomena. When included with other ground capabilities, we will show how they can assist in decision support and hazard assessment as well as giving those in emergency management a new ability to increase knowledge of the event at hand while reducing the risk to all involved.

At the end of the Proterozoic the assembly of Gondwanaland has placed the Malagasy basement between the Antarctic, Dharwar, Arabo-Nubian and Nubian-Tanzanian cratons. The continental collision processes accompanying the assembly left their mark on the Malagasy basement, currently exposed in the Eastern two thirds of the island, in the form of metamorphic and mineral belts as well as massive ductile shear zones. During the Jurassic Madagascar, India and Seychelles were breaking up from African. Long after the breakaway of India and the Seychelles from Madagascar (Cretaceous time), volcanic activation has occurred in several locations of Madagascar mostly in the central and northern part (Neogene period). The surface traces of assembly and breakup processes have been studied extensively using geological methods in Madagascar but the imprint on the deep structure has so far not been studied in much detail.\nBetween 2012 and 2014, 25 broadband stations were operated in the Southern Madagascar extending from East coast (Mananjary) to West coast (Toliary).

            "abstract": "Early Earth had a higher amount of remaining radiogenic elements as well as a higher amount of leftover primordial heat. Both contributed to the increased temperature in the Earth’s interior and it is mainly this increased mantle potential temperature ΔTp that controls the dynamics of the crust and upper mantle and the style of Early Earth tectonics.\nFor a minor increase in temperature ΔTp < 175 K a subduction-collision style ensues which is largely similar to present day plate tectonics. For a moderate increase in ΔTp = 175-250 K subduction can still occur, however plates are strongly weakened and buckling, delamination and Rayleigh-Taylor style dripping of the plate is observed in addition. For higher temperatures ΔTp > 250 K no subduction can be observed anymore and tectonics is dominated by delamination and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities.\nWe conduct 3D petrological-thermomechanical numerical modelling experiments of the crust and upper mantle under Early Earth conditions and a plume tectonics model setup. For varying crustal structures and an increased mantle potential temperature ΔTp, a thermal anomaly in the bottom temperature boundary introduces a plume. The model is able to self-sufficiently form depleted mantle lithosphere after repeated melt removal. New crust can be produced in the form of volcanics or plutonics. To simulate differentiation the newly formed crust can have a range in composition from basaltic over dacitic to granitic depending on its source rock.\nModels show large amounts of subcrustal decompression melting and consequently large amounts of new formed crust which in turn influences the dynamics. Mantle and crust are convecting separately. Dome-shaped plutons of mafic or felsic composition can be observed in the crust. Between these domes elongated belts of upper crust, volcanics and sediments are formed. These structures look similar to, for example, the Kaapvaal craton in South Africa where the elongated shape of the Barberton Greenstone Belt is surrounded by multiple plutons.",

The North Slope Science Initiative (NSSI) is using scenarios as a tool to identify plausible, spatially explicit future states of resource extraction activities on the North Slope and adjacent seas through the year 2040. The objective of the scenarios process is to strategically assess research and monitoring needs on the North Slope. The participatory scenarios process involved stakeholder input (including Federal, State, local, academic, industry and non-profit representatives) to identify key drivers of change related to resource extraction activities on the North Slope. While climate change was identified as a key driver in the biophysical system, economic drivers related to oil and gas development were also important. Expert-reviewed informational materials were developed to help stakeholders obtain baseline knowledge and stimulate discussions about interactions between drivers, knowledge gaps and uncertainties. Map-based scenario products will allow mission-oriented agencies to jointly explore where to prioritize research investments and address risk in a complex, changing environment. Scenarios consider multidecadal timescales. However, tracking of indicator variables derived from scenarios can lead to important insights about the trajectory of the North Slope social-environmental system and inform management decisions to reduce risk on much shorter timescales. The inclusion of stakeholders helps provide a broad spectrum of expert viewpoints necessary for considering the range of plausible scenarios. A well-defined focal question, transparency in the participation process and continued outreach about the utility and limitations of scenarios are also important components of the scenarios process.",

            "abstract": "Significant improvements in geophysical sensor deployments and rapid response have made it possible to compute a suite of earthquake source models in the first seconds to minutes after rupture initiation. With an example application for the 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku-oki event we present results from kinematic earthquake source inversion of regional geophysical data including strong motion, GPS, buoy, and ocean bottom pressure data. We will show that the time dependent earthquake source models thus derived provide suitable initial conditions for tsunami propagation and inundation modeling. In addition to the time-varying deformation of the sea-floor, the algorithm we present also accounts for the tsunamigenic effects of the horizontal advection of steep bathymetric features. With a detailed comparison to post-event tsunami survey measurements we will show that kinematic earthquake source models from strictly land-based data are a significant improvement over static inversions and provide reasonable estimates of expected tsunami intensity in the near source region. We will then show that adding ocean-based observations dramatically improves the inundation forecast. We will conclude that with current land-based deployments of geophysical sensors it should be feasible to produce rapid estimates of tsunami intensity which are reliable enough and useful for guiding early warning. We also conclude that adding just a few ocean-based sensors into the estimation process can drastically improve the reliability of such forecasts and warnings.",

            "abstract": "The Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP) is impacted by the emission of 7 million vehicles, being 85% light-duty vehicles (LDV), 3% heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDV)s, and 12% motorcycles. About 55% of LDVs burn a mixture of 78% gasoline and 22% ethanol (gasohol), 4% use hydrous ethanol (95% ethanol and 5% water), 38% are flex-fuel vehicles that are capable of burning both gasohol and hydrous ethanol and 3% use diesel (diesel + 5% bio-diesel). The owners of the flex-fuel vehicles decide to use ethanol or gasohol depending on the market price of the fuel. Many environmental programs were implemented to reduce the emissions by the LDV and HDV traffic; the contribution from the industrial sector has been decreasing as the industries have moved away from MASP, due to the high taxes applied to the productive sector. Due to the large contribution of the transport sector to CO2, its contribution is important in a regional scale. The total emission is estimated in 15327 million tons per year of CO2eq (60% by LDV, 38% HDV and 2% motorcycles). Measurements of CO2 performed with a Picarro monitor based on WS-CRDS (wavelength-scanned cavity ringdown spectroscopy) for the years 2012-2013 were performed. The sampling site was on the University of Sao Paulo campus (22o34´S, 46o44´W), situated in the west area of the city, surrounded by important traffic roads. The average data showed two peaks, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon, both associated with the traffic. Correlation analysis was performed between the concentrations and the number of vehicles, as a proxy for the temporal variation of the CO2 emission. The highest concentration was 430 ppm at 8:00am, associated to the morning peak hour of vehicles and the stable condition of the atmosphere. The average concentration was 406 ±12 ppm, considering all measured data. According to official inventories from the Environmental Agency (CETESB), the emission of CO2 has increased 39% from 1990 to 2008, associated to the use of liquid, gaseous and solid fossil fuel. The total number of vehicles presented a 60% increase according to official data. The difference between the two estimative can be related to the recycling of the fleet with the substitution of old cars with by vehicles that consume less fuel.",

            "abstract": "The relative importance of water, lithology, temperature and grain size as controls on lithospheric deformation is not well-understood. Regions that have experienced repeated deformation events often have relatively abundant quartz in the crust (Lowry and Pérez-Gussinyé, 2011), suggesting lithology plays a role, but there are two possible pathways for that to play out. One is a direct pathway: Quartz has the lowest viscosity of any of the common crustal minerals for given temperature and water fugacity, so will deform more readily. The second is an indirect effect on temperature: In crystalline basement, quartz affiliates with granites, which tend to have higher radiogenic isotope concentrations than more mafic rocks. Heat generated by these isotopes thermally insulates the deeper lithosphere, resulting higher temperatures and decreased viscosity of the deep crust and uppermost mantle, and hence more deformation. Here we examine the effect of radiogenic heating from decaying isotopes on crustal deformation. Using data from USArray including crustal thickness estimates from Lowry and Pérez-Gussinyé (2011), we compare Moho temperature estimates derived from Pn-phase velocities by Schutt et al. (in prep) with geotherms modeled using surface heat flow measurements and various assumptions about the distribution of radiogenic heating in the crust. RMS misfits of predicted to measured Moho temperatures are minimized for models that assume low surface radiogenic heat production, small variation with depth, and temperature-dependent thermal conductivity parameters consistent with laboratory measurements of crustal lithologies. Misfit between the model and measurements is dominated by relatively low measured Moho temperature in regions deformed by thick-skin tectonism during the Laramide orogeny. The surface heat-flow model assumes steady-state geothermal conditions, and thermal perturbations introduced more recently than the time required for a conductive thermal pulse to traverse the lithosphere (~100 Myr) would not be observed in surface heat-flow. Hence the temperature discrepancy may reflect thermal perturbation by proposed Laramide flat-slab subduction. Shallow subducted slab would serve both to chill the base of the lithosphere and insulate it from deeper convective heating.",

The albedo used in previous analyses is obtained by dividing I/F, determined from radiometrically calibrated imaging data, by the cosine of the incidence angle. Because of atmospheric aerosols, the albedo calculated from I/F above the atmosphere is not the surface albedo that enters into stability considerations. In order to determine the surface albedo, we interpolate optical depths determined from CRISM EPF measurements to provide estimates of the dust and ice opacities over the RSPC (Wolff et al., 2009) and use these to determine the actual surface albedos from MARCI images using the radiative transport program DISORT (Stamnes et al., 1988). Assuming that dust is the only contributor to atmospheric opacity, the retrieved surface albedos for the longer wavelength MARCI filters in MY 28 and 29 are found to be consistent despite very different dust opacities in the two years (James et al., 2014). However, this model fails to reproduce the short wavelength behavior in early summer. We consider possible modifications of the dust only model that could explain the discrepancy.",

            "abstract": "While the local physics of collisionless magnetic reconnection has been well studied, the consequences for global magnetospheric structure remain largely unexplored.\nIt is well known, for example, that Hall electric fields generate a new system of field-aligned currents propagating from the reconnection site along the magnetic separatrices; but it is not known how these currents contribute to the global region 1 and region 2 current systems or to auroral substorm features.\nIn this presentation, we show that collisionless reconnection has a significant impact on the large scale structure of planetary magnetospheres. Using global Hall MHD simulations, we demonstrate that field-aligned currents generated at the reconnection sites (and carried by whistler or kinetic Alfven waves) extend all the way down to the surface of the magnetized body and must therefore be included in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling physics (e.g., Harang-like discontinuities in the ionospheric convection pattern -- absent in MHD -- are introduced, and the current densities are large enough to produce auroral emission). More surprisingly, ions and electrons pick up magnetic drifts (due to JxB forces in the ion diffusion regions) that significantly alter the global magnetospheric convection pattern. Ions in the plasma sheet drift duskward while electrons drift dawnward, producing large asymmetries in the plasma sheet structure even in the absense of solar wind asymmetry, asymmetric ionospheric conductance or co-rotation. We discuss the implications of these effects for the reconnection-driven magnetospheres of Ganymede, Mercury and Earth.",

            "abstract": "Active evolving rivers are some of the most dynamic and sensitive parts of landscapes. From geologic and geomorphic perspectives, a stable river channel can adjust its width, depth, and slope to prevent significant aggradation or degradation caused by external triggers, e.g., hydrologic events caused by typhoon storms. In particular, the processes of lateral riverbank erosion play a majorly important role in forming horizontal river geomorphology, dominating incised river widens and meanders. Sediment materials produced and mobilized from riverbanks can also be substantial sediment supplying into river channel networks, affecting watershed sediment yield. In Taiwan, the geological and climatic regimes usually combine to generate severely lateral erosion and/or riverbed deposition along river channels, causing the significant change in river width. In the August of 2009, Typhoon Morakot brought severe rainfall of about 2000 mmin Southern Taiwan during three days at the beginning of Aug. 5, leading to significant changes in geomorphic system. Here we characterized river width widening (including Cishan, Laonong, and Ilao Rivers) in the Kaoping River watershed after Typhoon Morakot disturbance interpreted through a power law. On the basis of a temporal pair (2008 and 2009) of Formosat-II (Formosa satellite II) images analysis, the river channels were digitalized within geographic information system (GIS), and river widths were extracted per 100 m along the rivers, then differentiating the adjustment of river width before and after Typhoon Morkot. The river width adjusted from -83 m (contracting) to 1985 m (widening), with an average of 170 m. The noncumulative frequency-magnitude distribution for river width adjustment caused by Typhoon Morakot in the study area satisfies a power-law relation with a determined coefficient (r2) of 0.95, over the range from 65 m to 2373m in the study area. Moreover, the value of the power-law exponent is equal to -2.09. This pattern suggests that river channel widening caused by large, infrequent hydrologic episodes has self-organized criticality. This study can provide useful information to river and watershed management, thereby refining the prevention and mitigation of hazard risks due to the effect of river width widening.",

Research on the lake has included a) periodic profiles of primary productivity, nutrients, temperature, and plankton; b) Secchi depth; c) nutrient limitation experiments; d) analysis of sediment cores; e) radiocarbon dating of underwater in-place tree stumps; g) analysis of long-term temperature trends. Work in its watershed has included a) monitoring of stream discharge, sediment and nutrients at up to 20 stream gaging stations; b) monitoring of urban runoff water quality at selected sites; c) development of a GIS data base, including soils, vegetation, and land use. Based on these studies, we know that a) primary productivity in the lake is limited by phosphorus, and continues to increase; b) the loss of clarity continues, but at a declining rate; c) the lake has been warming since 1970, and its resistance to deep mixing is increasing; d) historically the lake level drops below the outlet elevation about one year in seven; e) 6300 to 4300 yrs BP lake level was below the present outlet elevation long enough for large trees to grow; f) the date of the peak snowmelt runoff is shifting toward earlier dates; g) after accounting for annual runoff, loads of nutrients and suspended sediment have declined significantly in some basin streams since 1980.\nDownscaled outputs from GCM climatic models have recently been used to drive hydrologic models and a lake clarity model, projecting future trends in the lake and watersheds. Results show a) the temperature and thermal stability will likely continue to increase, with deep mixing shutting down in the latter half of this century; b) the lake may drop below the outlet for an extended period beginning about 2085; c) the annual snowpack will continue to decline, with earlier snowmelt and shift from snowfall to rain; d) the climatic water deficit will increase, especially at high elevations that will be most affected by the loss of snow, with likely consequences for existing vegetation and fire frequency.\nHydrologically, Lake Tahoe is intermittently terminal; in a medical sense it is not yet terminal, but its condition—especially its valued clarity and deep blue color--is serious.",

Observational studies have shown that the shape of mirror structures is related to local plasma parameters and distance to the mirror instability threshold. We study the nonlinear evolution of mirror modes using Particle in Cell (PIC) simulations. We change the plasma conditions by artificially enlarging the simulation box over time to resemble the plasma expansion in the vicinity of the magnetopause which leads to changing the plasma conditions toward a more mirror stable state and investigate the final nonlinear state of the mirror structures.",

            "abstract": "Before the large people influx and development of the central part of Brazil in the sixties, due to new capital Brasília, Cerrado, a typical Brazilian savanna-type vegetation, used to occupy about 2 million km2, going from the Amazon tropical forest, in the north, to the edges of what used to be the Atlantic forest in the southeast. Today, somewhat 50% of this area has given place to agriculture, pasture and managed forests. Understanding how Cerrado interacts with the atmosphere and how this interaction will be modified with this land-use change is a crucial step towards improving predictions of future climate-change scenarios.\nCerrado is a vegetation adapted to a climate characterized by two distinct seasons, a wet season (Nov-Mar) and dry season (May-Ago), with April and October being transitions between seasons. Typically, 75% of precipitation happens in the wet-season months and only 5% during dry-season. In this study, it is investigated the potential impacts of the substitution of Cerrado to the eco-hydrological characteristics of the region. The focus here is Eucalyptus plantation which have increased substantially in the last decade due to government incentives. Two eddy-covariance (EC) systems were installed, one in an undisturbed Cerrado Stricto area and other in a recently-established Eucalyptus plantation. The two areas are 1,400m apart and are subjected to the same meteorology and similar edaphic conditions. Besides instrumentation typical of EC towers, a soil-moisture profiling system were installed in each site.\nData from the towers will be used to parameterized a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere (SVAT) model to simulate hydrological and atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) processes in order to understand how the two vegetation cover modulates the exchange of mass and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. Simulations of 30-day dry down from saturation to complete water stress were performed and were analyzed on how ABL respond to soil moisture changes. Preliminary results show that replacing Cerrado for Eucalyptus causes reduction in ABL temperature, increase in ABL water-vapor mixing ratio and slightly reduces ABL height. Consequences of those changes on the hydrology could be most important in the season transition stages.",

            "abstract": "Shipwrecks serve as artificial reefs in the deep ocean. Because of their inherent diversity compared to their surrounding environment and their random distribution, shipwrecks are ideal ecosystems to study pollution impacts and microbial distribution patterns in the deep biosphere. This study provides a comparative assessment of Deepwater Horizon spill impacts on shipwreck and local sedimentary microbiomes and the synergistic effects of contaminants on these communities and the physical structures that support them. For this study, microbiomes associated with wooden 19th century shipwrecks and World War II era steel shipwrecks in the northern Gulf of Mexico were investigated using next generation sequencing. Samples derived from in situ biofilm monitoring platforms deployed adjacent to 5 shipwrecks for 4 months, and sediment collected from distances ranging from 2-200m from each shipwreck were evaluated for shifts in microbiome structure and gene function relative to proximity to the spill, and oil spill related contaminants in the local environment. The goals of the investigation are to determine impacts to recruitment and community structure at sites located within and outside of areas impacted by the spill. Taxonomic classification of dominant and rare members of shipwreck microbiomes and metabolic information extracted from sequence data yield new understanding of microbial processes associated with site formation. The study provides information on the identity of microbial inhabitants of shipwrecks, their role in site preservation, and impacts of the Deepwater Horizon spill on the primary colonizers of artificial reefs in the deep ocean. This approach could inform about the role of microorganisms in establishment and maintenance of the artificial reef environment, while providing information about ecosystem feedbacks resulting from spills.",

            "abstract": "Rare earth element (REE) concentrations of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) were measured in three subterranean estuaries (i.e., Indian River Lagoon, Florida; Pettaquamscutt estuary, Rhode Island; Kona Coast, Hawaii). Using site-specific SGD estimates previously obtained by a variety of techniques (e.g., seepage meters, Ra, and Rn), we estimated SGD-derived fluxes of REEs to the coastal ocean using simple, one-dimensional modeling techniques. Our results indicate that the SGD fluxes of REEs are either of the same magnitude as riverine REE fluxes (Indian River Lagoon; Pettaquamscutt estuary), or far exceed surface runoff sources of REEs to the coastal ocean (Kona Coast). At each site important biogeochemical reactions occurring in the subterranean estuary, such as redox reactions, sediment bioirrigation, mineral dissolution and re-precipitation, and salt-induced mobilization from “nano-colloids”, appear to facilitate release of REEs into solution, which are then advected to the coastal ocean via SGD. Neodymium isotope analysis of SGD and aquifer sediment are consistent with sediment diagenesis and redox transformations of Fe(III) oxides/oxyhydroxides, as well as preferential weathering of REE-bearing minerals like apatite, as being important sources of REEs to coastal seawater. Our investigations demonstrate that geochemical reactions occurring in the studied subterranean estuaries represent a net source of light and middle REEs to coastal seawater, whereas the heavy REEs appear to be sequestered in the subterranean estuary sediment.",

            "abstract": "Citizens living in areas of shale-gas development such as the Marcellus gas play in Pennsylvania and surrounding states are cognizant of the possibility that drilling and production of natural gas -- including hydraulic fracturing -- may have environmental impacts on their water. The Critical Zone is defined as the zone from vegetation canopy to the lower limits of groundwater. This definition is nebulous in terms of the lower limit, and yet, defining the bottom of the Critical Zone is important if citizens are to embrace shale-gas development. This is because, although no peer-reviewed study has been presented that documents a case where hydraulic fracturing or formation fluids have migrated upwards from fracturing depths to drinking water resources, a few cases of such leakage have been alleged. On the other hand, many cases of methane migration into aquifers have been documented to occur and some have been attributed to shale-gas development. The Critical Zone science community has a role to play in understanding such contamination problems, how they unfold, and how they should be ameliorated. For example, one big effort of the Critical Zone science community is to promote sharing of data describing the environment. This data effort has been extended to provide data for citizens to understand water quality by a team known as the Shale Network. As scientists learn to publish data online, these efforts must also be made accessible to non-scientists. As citizens access the data, the demand for data will grow and all branches of government will eventually respond by providing more accessible data that will help the public and policy-makers make decisions.",

            "abstract": "We model ramp compression, shock-free dynamic loading, intended to generate a well-defined equation of state that achieves higher densities and lower temperatures than the corresponding shock Hugoniot. Ramp loading ideally approaches isentropic compression for a fluid sample, so is useful for simulating the states deep inside convecting planets. Our model explicitly evaluates the deviation of ramp from “quasi-isentropic” compression.\nMotivated by recent ramp-compression experiments to 5 TPa (50 Mbar), we calculate the room-temperature isotherm of diamond using first-principles density functional theory and molecular dynamics, from which we derive a principal isentrope and Hugoniot by way of the Mie-Grüneisen formulation and the Hugoniot conservation relations. We simulate ramp compression by imposing a uniaxial strain that then relaxes to an isotropic state, evaluating the change in internal energy and stress components as the sample relaxes toward isotropic strain at constant volume; temperature is well defined for the resulting hydrostatic state. Finally, we evaluate multiple shock- and ramp-loading steps to compare with single-step loading to a given final compression.\nTemperatures calculated for single-step ramp compression are less than Hugoniot temperatures only above 500 GPa, the two being close to each other at lower pressures. We obtain temperatures of 5095 K and 6815 K for single-step ramp loading to 600 and 800 GPa, for example, which compares well with values of ~5100 K and ~6300 K estimated from previous experiments [PRL,102, 075503, 2009]. At 800 GPa, diamond is calculated to have a temperature of 500 K along the isentrope; 900 K under multi-shock compression (asymptotic result after 8-10 steps); and 3400 K under 3-step ramp loading (200-400-800 GPa). Asymptotic multi-step shock and ramp loading are indistinguishable from the isentrope, within present uncertainties. Our simulations quantify the manner in which current experiments can simulate the deep interiors of planetary bodies, including super-giant extra-Solar planets.",

But these are abstract concepts until the consequences of such events are examined at the local level. Further, helping communities come to grips with what this means for building their climate resilience is better understood when multiple factors are considered. This presentation is based on a recent set of case studies about what happened in six communities that experienced one or more extreme events. Multiple interactions affect the outcome of actions taken by a variety of water-related jurisdictions, including those managing drinking water and wastewater utilities, water supply and flood control, and ecosystem and endangered species protection. Two of the case studies will be presented, showing the interdependent and cascading impacts challenging drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater utility managers and others within the watershed. Despite the unique attributes of each region, several common themes emerged from the case studies including how decisions are made, what information was used to inform decisions, what institutional dynamics helped or hindered, and how water resource managers (and their communities) are planning to deal with extreme events in the future.",

            "abstract": "Interest in the geochemistry of tungsten (W) in the environment is on the rise in part due to the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) recent recognition that it represents an emerging contaminant of environmental concern. As such, we undertook a multi-year investigation of W in groundwaters and surface waters to help augment the relatively sparse understanding of the biogeochemistry of W in environmental waters. We quantified W concentrations in natural waters and sediments from a variety of settings, including shallow and deep groundwater flow systems, river waters, estuaries, and marine sediments and associated porewaters. In addition, we measured the equilibrium constants for the formation of thiotungstate ions in laboratory experiments to investigate the possible formation of these thioanions in sulfidic waters. Earlier investigations showed that the chemically similar element molybdenum (Mo) forms thiomolybdate ions in sulfidic waters. Our investigations indicate that pH-related adsorption/desorption reactions and the available quantity of Fe(III) oxide/oxyhydroxide minerals in substrate sediments are important controls on the amount of dissolved W in the environment with higher pH and lower Fe(III) oxide/oxyhydroxide content both favoring greater W mobility. Moreover, W is mobile in oxic, suboxic, and anoxic, including sulfidic waters occurring as the tungstate oxyanion and/or various thiotungstate anions depending of the dissolved sulfide concentrations. Specifically, thiotungstate anions predominate over the tungstate oxyanion for natural waters where dissolved sulfide concentrations attain millimolal levels. Investigation of sediments from a Louisiana salt marsh indicates that W is sequestered into pyrite similar to Mo.",

            "abstract": "High Arctic landscapes are essentially vast cold deserts interspersed with streams, ponds and wetlands. These landscapes may be important consumers and sources of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4), though few measurements exist from this region. To quantify the flux of CH4 (FCH4) between the atmosphere and high Arctic landscapes on northern Ellesmere Island, Canada, we made static chamber measurements over five and three growing seasons at a desert and wetland, respectively, and eddy covariance (EC) measurements at a wetland in 2012. Chamber measurements revealed that, during the growing season, desert soils consumed CH4 (−1.37±0.06 mg− CH4 m−2 d−1), whereas the wetland margin emitted CH4 (+0.22±0.14 mg− CH4 m−2 d−1). Desert CH4 consumption rates were positively associated with soil temperature among years, and were similar to temperate locations, likely because of suitable landscape conditions for soil gas diffusion. Wetland FCH4 varied closely with stream discharge entering the wetland and hence extent of soil saturation. Landscape−scale FCH4 measured by EC was +1.27±0.18 mg− CH4 m−2 d−1 and varied with soil temperature and carbon dioxide flux. FCH4 measured using EC was higher than using chambers because EC measurements incorporated a larger, more saturated footprint of the wetland. Using EC FCH4 and quantifying the mass of CH4 entering and exiting the wetland in stream water, we determined that methanogenesis within wetland soils was the dominant source of FCH4. Low FCH4 at the wetland was likely due to a shallow organic soil layer, and thus limited carbon resources for methanogens. Considering the prevalence of dry soils in the high Arctic, our results suggest that these landscapes cannot be overlooked as important consumers of atmospheric CH4.",

            "abstract": "The popularity and usage of FOSS4G (FOSS for Geoinformatics) has increased drastically in the last two decades with increasing benefits that facilitate spatial data analysis, image processing, graphics and map production, spatial modeling and visualization. The objective of this paper is to use FOSS4G to implement and perform a quantitative analysis of three different unmixing algorithms: Constraint Least-Square (CLS), Unconstraint Least-Square, and Orthogonal Subspace Projection to estimate land cover (LC) fraction estimates from RS data. The LC fractions obtained by unmixing of mixed pixels represent mixture of more than one class per pixel rendering more accurate LC abundance estimates. The algorithms were implemented in C++ programming language with OpenCV package (http://opencv.org/) and boost C++ libraries (www.boost.org) in the NASA Earth Exchange at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Facility. GRASS GIS was used for visualization of results and statistical analysis was carried in R in a Linux system environment.\nA set of global endmembers for substrate, vegetation and dark objects were used to unmix the data using the three algorithms and were compared with Singular Value decomposition unmixed outputs available in ENVI image processing software. First, computer simulated data of different signal to noise ratio were used to evaluate the algorithms. The second set of experiments was carried out in an agricultural set-up with a spectrally diverse collection of 11 Landsat-5 scenes (acquired in 2008) for an agricultural setup in Frenso, California and the ground data were collected on those specific dates when the satellite passed through the site. Finally, in the third set of experiments, a pair of coincident clear sky Landsat and World View 2 data for an urbanized area of San Francisco were used to assess the algorithm. Validation of the results using descriptive statistics, correlation coefficient (cc), RMSE, boxplot and bivariate distribution function indicated that with the computer simulated data, CLS was better than other techniques. With the real world data of an agricultural landscape, CLS was superior to other techniques with a mean absolute error for all four methods close to 7.3%. For the urban setup, CLS demonstrated highest average cc of 0.64 and lowest average RMSE of 0.19 for all the endmembers.",

The major stratigraphic elements in this physiographic domain are Falling Stage Systems Tracts (in the sense of SEPM) linked to 100-ky eustatic cycles. They form wedges pinching out on the middle shelf, and thickening seaward on the outer shelf/upper slope (about 30-40m thick on the outer shelf). Within the uppermost sequence, linked to the last Glacial-Interglacial cycle, internal discontinuities were long described, but they were assigned to autogenic processes such as lobe avulsion or bedform migration. However, careful interpretation of a dense grid of very high resolution seismic data, together with precise chronostratigraphic constraints from borehole data and long piston cores, reveal that distinct parasequences, correlable at the regional scale, correspond to relatively minor sea-level changes linked (a) to Bond Cycles during the end of the Last Glacial, and (b) to an early Melt Water Pulse at the onset of Deglacial sea-level rise. These regressive and transgressive (respectively) parasequences are particularly well preserved in canyon heads, due to better accommodation. We propose that such features are important building blocks of the stratigraphic record, that might be recognized elsewhere on modern continental margins, as well as in the rock record.",

One particular group, the Data Preservation Practices, is defining a set of guidelines to aid data providers in planning both what to submit for archival, and when to submit artifacts, so that the archival process can begin early in the project's life cycle. This has the benefit of leveraging knowledge within the project before staff roll off to other work. In this poster we describe various project archival use cases and identify possible archival life cycles that map closely to the pace and flow of work.\nTo understand \"archival life cycles\", i.e., distinct project phases that produce archival artifacts such as instrument capabilities, calibration reports, and science data products, the workig group initially mapped the archival requirements defined in the Preservation Content Specification to the typical NASA project life cycle. As described in the poster, this work resulted in a well-defined archival life cycle, but only for some types of projects; it did not fit well for condensed project life cycles experienced within airborne and balloon campaigns.\nTo understand the archival process for projects with compressed cycles, the working group gathered use cases from various communities. This poster will describe selected uses cases that provided insight into the unique flow of these projects, as well as proposing archival life cycles that map artifacts to projects with compressed timelines.\nFinally, the poster will conclude with some early recommendations for data providers, which will be captured in a formal Guidelines document - to be published in 2015.",

Coastal wetlands (specifically mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows) have unique characteristics that make them incredibly efficient, natural carbon sinks with most carbon stored belowground in soils. Protecting and restoring these ecosystems around the globe will help maintain all the societal benefits these ecosystems provide including the natural climate mitigation benefits, but also the food security, water quality, and storm protection benefits that enhance coastal communities and economies.\nThis presentation will focus on some emerging policy opportunities including: (1) incorporation of coastal wetland carbon in U.S. national climate, resilience, and conservation efforts; (2) potential steps to incorporate coastal wetlands in national greenhouse gas inventories as suggested by the 2013 International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Wetlands Supplement; and (3) dialogue at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) about blue carbon habitats and their potential for inclusion. The presentation will conclude by highlighting some of the most pressing blue carbon scientific gaps that need to be filled in order to support these developing policies.",

If combined with effective visualisation and monitoring interfaces, these provenance recordings can speed up the validation process of an experiment, suggesting interactive or automated interventions with immediate effects on the lifecycle of a workflow run.\nFor instance, in the field of computational seismology, if we consider research applications performing long lasting cross correlation analysis and high resolution simulations, the immediate notification of logical errors and the rapid access to intermediate results, can produce reactions which foster a more efficient progress of the research.\nThese applications are often executed in secured and sophisticated HPC and HTC infrastructures, highlighting the need for a comprehensive framework that facilitates the extraction of fine grained provenance and the development of provenance aware components, leveraging the scalability characteristics of the adopted workflow engines, whose enactment can be mapped to different technologies (MPI, Storm clusters, etc).\nThis work looks at the adoption of W3C-PROV concepts and data model within a user driven processing and validation framework for seismic data, supporting also computational and data management steering. Validation needs to balance automation with user intervention, considering the scientist as part of the archiving process. Therefore, the provenance data is enriched with community-specific metadata vocabularies and control messages, making an experiment reproducible and its description consistent with the community understandings. Moreover, it can contain user defined terms and annotations.\nThe current implementation of the system is supported by the EU-Funded VERCE (http://verce.eu). It provides, as well as the provenance generation mechanisms, a prototypal browser-based user interface and a web API built on top of a NoSQL storage technology, experimenting ways to ensure a rapid and flexible access to the lineage traces. It supports the users with the visualisation of graphical products and offers combined operations to access and download the data which may be selectively stored at runtime, into dedicated data archives.",

Previous studies have revealed single “nose-like” structures occurring alone and simultaneous nose-like structures (up to three). In this study we also include signatures of new types of ion structure, namely “trunk-like” and “tusk-like” structures. All the ion structures are named after the characteristic shapes of energy bands or gaps in the energy-time spectrograms of in situ measured ion fluxes. They constitute the observational signatures of ion acceleration, transport, and loss in the global magnetosphere. Multi-spacecraft analysis of these structures is important to understand their spatial distribution and temporal evolution. Mass spectrometers onboard Cluster (in a polar orbit) and the Van Allen Probes (in an equatorial orbit) measure energetic hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions near the inner edge of the plasma sheet, where these ion structures are observed. We present a statistical study of the ion structures, using >1-year measurements from the two missions during the Van Allen Probes era. The results provide important details about the spatial distribution (dependence on geocentric distance and magnetic local time), spectral features of the structures (e.g., characteristic energy and differences among species), and geomagnetic and solar wind conditions under which these structures occur.",

            "abstract": "Surface deformation in the form of land subsidence and ground failure in the Chapala Basin has caused serious damage to structures, mostly homes. In this work, the conditions for the occurrence of deformation particularly regarding the physical and mechanical properties of the soil are discussed. In 2012 a maximum land subsidence of 7.16 cm in a short period of 8 months was recorded with maximum velocities of deformation close to 0.89 centimeters per month. Natural conditions of the zone of study include a lacustrine low land with the perennial Chapala Lake, surrounded by ranges formed by volcanic extrusive rocks, mostly basalts and andesites. Two soil cores of 11 meters depth show the predominance of fine soil but with the incrustation of several sandy lenses of volcanic ash. In the first core closer to the piedmont, the volcanic ash presents an accumulated thickness close to three meters, starting at 4.5 meters depth; on the contrary, this thickness in the second core closer to the lake is critically reduced to no more than 50 centimeters. Even though the predominance of fine soil is significant, water-content averages 100 % and the liquid limit is low, suggesting amongst other possibilities, low content of clay or at least low content of smectites or allophanes in the clayey portion. Other properties of the soil are being determined for analyses. The occurrence of three alignments of ground failures in the community of Jocotepec at the west, mostly faults, suggests highly heterogeneous subsoil. The high volumes of groundwater withdrawn from the local aquifers mainly for agriculture are directly contributing to the increase of the effective stress and surface deformation, however, the relationship between level descents and surficial deformation is still not clear.",

            "abstract": "The origin and stability of the continental lithosphere play a fundamental role in plate tectonics and enable the survival of Archean crust over billions of years. Recent advances in seismic data and imaging have revealed a velocity drop with depth within continental cratons too shallow to be interpreted as the lithosphere asthenosphere boundary (Rychert and Shearer 2009). The significance of this “mid lithospheric discontinuity” (MLD) – or multiple MLDs as suggested recently (Lekic & Fischer, 2013) – is not fully understood, and its implications for continental formation and stability are only beginning to be explored. Discrepancies call for both improving the constraints on the nature of the MLD, and relating these observations to tectonic setting and deformation history. The extensive coverage of the EarthScope USArray presents an unprecedented opportunity to systematically map the structure of the continental lithosphere. We use receiver functions (RFs) to isolate converted phases (Ps or Sp) produced across velocity discontinuities beneath a seismometer, and thereby constrain vertical density and seismic velocity variations. We show that at some stations, the apparent velocity contrast across the MLD demonstrates a dependence on seismic wave frequency, being greater at low frequencies than at high frequencies. This suggests that the MLD – at least in certain locations – is distributed across tens of kilometers in depth. The gradient of the MLD fingerprints physical process at play; a weak gradient indicates thermal origin, while an abrupt discontinuity implicates change in composition or partial melting. Furthermore, we map the strength, depth, and ratio of amplitudes of waves converted across the MLD and the Moho throughout the US. Because these receiver function based measurements only reveal relative velocity variations with depth, we combine them with frequency-dependent measurements of apparent incidence angles of P and S waves. Doing so allows us to present new constraints on absolute velocity variations in the crust, and relate them to variations in lithospheric structure.\n",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and partners are transitioning from test-user trials of a demonstration earthquake early warning system (ShakeAlert) to deciding and preparing how to implement the release of earthquake early warning information, alert messages, and products to the public and other stakeholders. An earthquake early warning system uses seismic station networks to rapidly gather information about an occurring earthquake and send notifications to user devices ahead of the arrival of potentially damaging ground shaking at their locations. Earthquake early warning alerts can thereby allow time for actions to protect lives and property before arrival of damaging shaking, if users are properly educated on how to use and react to such notifications.\nA collaboration team of risk communications researchers and earth scientists is researching the effectiveness of a chosen subset of potential earthquake early warning interface designs and messages, which could be displayed on a device such as a smartphone. Preliminary results indicate, for instance, that users prefer alerts that include 1) a map to relate their location to the earthquake and 2) instructions for what to do in response to the expected level of shaking.\nA number of important factors must be considered to design a message that will promote appropriate self-protective behavior. While users prefer to see a map, how much information can be processed in limited time? Are graphical representations of wavefronts helpful or confusing? The most important factor to promote a helpful response is the predicted earthquake intensity, or how strong the expected shaking will be at the user’s location. Unlike Japanese users of early warning, few Californians are familiar with the earthquake intensity scale, so we are exploring how differentiating instructions between intensity levels (e.g., “Be aware” for lower shaking levels and “Drop, cover, hold on” at high levels) can be paired with self-directed supplemental information to increase the public’s understanding of earthquake shaking and protective behaviors.",

            "abstract": "The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) is the largest continuous ecosystem on this planet and is an important regulator of biogeochemical cycling and carbon sequestration. With evidence of its expansion in a warming climate, it is necessary to develop a more complete understanding of the variability in productivity and nutrient dynamics in this important ecosystem through time. We constructed a long-term, high resolution record of bulk record of stable nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon isotopes (δ13C) from multiple proteinaceous deep sea corals around Hawaii extending back ~5300 years with few gaps. Our data confirms the decreasing trend in δ15N since the Little Ice Age (1850s), which matches previously published results in part attributed to anthropogenic climate change (e.g. Sherwood et al. 2014). However, while the rate of change since the Little Ice Age (δ15N declines ~1‰ over ~150yrs) remains by far the most rapid throughout the longer record, there also appear to be longer-term (near-millennial scale) climatic oscillations of even greater magnitude (δ15N shifts ~1.5-2‰ over ~1000yrs). After removal of the Seuss Effect, δ13C values also declined ~1.5‰ since the Little Ice Age. Furthermore, there also appear to be oscillations in δ13C of ~1-2‰ over millennial timescales. These results reveal the existence of previously unrecognized long-term oscillations in NPSG biogeochemical cycles, which are likely linked to changes in phytoplankton species composition, food web dynamics, and/or variability in source nutrients and productivity possibly caused by changes in climate. This study provides insight into nutrient dynamics in the NPSG over the past five millennia, and offers a historical baseline to better analyze the effects of current anthropogenic climate forcing.",

In order to study the reactions and mass movement within multiphase geothermal systems, we have combined geochemical fluid-fluid and fluid-rock modelling with sulfur and carbon isotope fractionation modelling and compared the results with measured carbon and sulfur isotopes in geothermal fluids (water and vapor) for selected low- and high-enthalpy geothermal systems in Iceland. In this study we have focused on δ34S for H2S in vapor and water and SO4 in water as well as δ13C for CO2 in vapor and water phases. Isotope fractionations for CO2 and H2S between vapor and liquid water, upon aqueous speciation and upon carbonate and sulfide mineral formation were revised. These were combined with reaction modelling involving closed system boiling and progressive water-rock interaction to constrain the mass movement and isotope abundance between various phases. The results indicate that for a closed system, carbon and sulfur isotope abundance is largely dependent on progressive fluid-fluid and fluid-rock interaction and the initial total δ34S and δ13C value of the system. Initially, upon progressive fluid rock interaction the δ34S and δ13C values for the bulk aqueous phase approach that of the host rocks. Secondary mineral formation may alter these values, the exact isotope value of the mineral and resulting aqueous phase depending on aqueous speciation and isotope fractionation factor. In turn, aqueous speciation and mineral saturation depends on progressive fluid-rock interaction, fluid-fluid interaction, temperature and acid supply to the system. Depressurization boiling also results in isotope fractionation, the exact isotope value of the vapor and aqueous phase depending on aqueous speciation and isotope fractionation fractor. In this way, carbon and sulfur isotopes may be used combined with measured values for natural fluids to constrain mass movement upon fluid-fluid and fluid-rock interaction in geothermal systems.",

Although disturbances and vegetation change can alter soil-water retention and conductivity relations, hydrologic models relying on traditional soil-texture based pedotransfer functions would not be able to capture the disturbance impact on infiltration and soil-moisture storage. Therefore, in-situ estimates of characteristic curves of soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity relations are needed to understand and predict hydrologic impacts of land cover change. We present a method for in-situ estimates of effective characteristic curves that capture hysteretic soil-water retention properties at the plot scale. We apply this method to two different forest treatments and in urban settings to investigate the impact of land-use disturbances on soil-hydraulic properties. We compare our in-situ estimation method to results for simple pedotransfer functions to illustrate how this approach can improve understanding of disturbance impacts on hydrologic processes and function.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, the capability to monitor and quickly respond to remote detection of volcanic activity has been greatly improved through use of advanced techniques and semi-automatic software applications installed in most of the 24h control rooms devoted to volcanic surveillance. Ability to monitor volcanoes is being advanced by new technology, such as broad-band seismology, microphone networks mainly recording in the infrasonic frequency band, satellite observations of ground deformation, high quality video surveillance systems, also in infrared band, improved sensors for volcanic gas measurements, and advances in computer power and speed, leading to improvements in data transmission, data analysis and modeling techniques. One of the most critical point in the real-time monitoring chain is the evaluation of the volcano state from all the measurements. At the present, most of this task is delegated to one or more human experts in volcanology. Unfortunately, the volcano state assessment becomes harder if we observe that, due to the coupling of highly non-linear and complex volcanic dynamic processes, the measurable effects can show a rich range of different behaviors. Moreover, due to intrinsic uncertainties and possible failures in some recorded data, precise state assessment is usually not achievable. Hence, the volcano state needs to be expressed in probabilistic terms that take account of uncertainties. In the framework of the project PON SIGMA (Integrated Cloud-Sensor System for Advanced Multirisk Management) work, we have developed an expert system approach to estimate the ongoing volcano state from all the available measurements and with minimal human interaction. The approach is based on hidden markov model and deals with uncertainties and probabilities. We tested the proposed approach on data coming from the Mt. Etna (Italy) continuous monitoring networks for the period 2011-2013. Results show that this approach can be a valuable tool to aid the operator in volcano real-time monitoring.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, use of engineered micromodels to investigate pore-scale fluid flow and transport phenomena to better understand and model field-scale observables has steadily increased. Micromodels are thin porous structures in which flow is restricted to two-dimensions and have become common since they are effective, relatively inexpensive tools for visualizing and quantifying complex flow phenomena. We describe a unique micromodel experimental system recently developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The system consists of a pressure chamber, which allows us to conduct experiments at geologic conditions. The maximum working pressure and temperature is 1500 psig and 80° C, respectively, allowing for supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) to be used as a working fluid. Additionally, we have developed micromodels fabricated in geomaterials (e.g., shale and Portland cement), whereas typical micromodels are fabricated in engineered materials such as glass or silicon. The use of geomaterial micromodels allows us to better represent the fluid-rock interactions including wetting angles and chemical reactivity at conditions representative of natural subsurface environments.\nIn this work, we present experimental results in simple fracture systems (e.g., straight channels, pore doublets) with applications to hydrocarbon mobility in hydraulically fractured shale. We use both shale and glass micromodels, allowing for a detailed comparison between flow phenomena in different materials. In the straight channel micromodels, we investigate interfacial velocities and compare the results with theoretical models. In the pore doublet micromodels, we investigate mobilization of oil blobs and contrast the effectiveness of water and scCO2 in the extraction of hydrocarbon from fracture networks. Next, we present experimental results in complex fracture network patterns derived from 3D x-ray tomography images of actual fractures created in shale rock cores. We discuss preliminary analysis aimed at developing quantitative relationships between fluid mobility and interfacial phenomena and the effectiveness of scCO2 as a working fluid.",

            "abstract": "Although ESA’s Earth Explorer Mission Swarm is primarily dedicated to measure the Earth’s magnetic field, it may also serve as a gravity field mission. Equipped with GPS receivers, accelerometers, star-tracker assemblies and laser retro-reflectors, the three Swarm satellites are potentially capable to be used as a high-low satellite-to-satellite tracking (hl-SST) observing system, following the missions CHAMP (first single-satellite hl-SST mission), GRACE (twin-satellite mission with additional ultra-precise low-low SST and GOCE (single-satellite mission additionally equipped with a gradiometer). GRACE, dedicated to measure the time-variability of the gravity field, is the only mission still in orbit, but its lifetime will likely end before launch of its follow-on mission GRACE-FO in August 2017 primarily due to aging of the onboard batteries after meanwhile more than 12 years of operation. Swarm is probably a good candidate to provide time-variable gravity field solutions and to close a potential gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO. Consisting of three satellites, Swarm also offers to use inter-satellite GPS-derived baselines as additional observations. However, as of today it is not clear if such information will substantially improve the gravity field solutions. Nevertheless, the properties of the Swarm constellation with two lower satellites flying in a pendulum-like orbit and a slightly differently inclined third satellite at higher altitude still represent a unique observing system raising expectations at least compared to CHAMP derived time-variable gravity field solutions. Whatever processing method will be applied for Swarm gravity field recovery, its success strongly depends on the quality of the Swarm Level 1b data as well as the quality of the derived Swarm orbits. With first Level 1b data sets available since mid of May 2014 (excluding accelerometer data), first results for Swarm orbits and baselines, as well as Swarm gravity field solutions are presented here. The latter are also compared to GRACE GPS hl-SST solutions based on the same amount of data and processing methods.",

            "abstract": "This study identifies anthropogenically disturbed areas and barren playa surfaces as the two primary dust source types that repeatedly contribute to dust storm events in the eastern Great Basin of western Utah, U.S.A. Further, dust samples were found to be distinctally different elementally compared to soil samples in this region. This analysis used MODIS and USDA Land cover data to identify 4 major and 5 secondary source areas for dust in this region, which produce dust primarily during the spring and fall months and during moderate or greater drought conditions. The largest number of observed dust plumes (~ 60% of all plumes) originated from playas (ephemeral lakes) and are classified as barren land cover with a silty clay soil sediment surface. Anthropogenic disturbance is necessary to produce dust from the vegetated landscape in the eastern Great Basin, as evidenced by the new dust source active from 2008 to 2010 in the area burned by the 2007 Milford Flat Fire; this fire was the largest in Utah's history due to extensive cover of invasive cheatgrass along with drought conditions. Dust and soil samples contain similar enrichments of major soil elements, however, dust samples were significantly more enriched in Na derived from the surface salts of the Sevier Dry Lake. Trace elements were generally more enriched in dust samples and had larger enrichment values than seen in previous studies. Further, for dust and soil samples, the fine fraction (<2.5 µm) was more enriched in trace elements than the coarse fraction (2.5 to 10 µm). Composition of dust transported has influences on human health, ecosystem functioning, and biogeochemical cycling. Dust storms in the eastern Great Basin negatively impact air quality and transportation in the populated regions of Utah; this study details an improved forecasting protocol for dust storm events that will benefit transportation planning and improve public health.",

Through careful multidisciplinary research and with great insight, he pioneered many aspects of paleomagnetism which continue to be actively researched. Irving was convinced of the reality of continental drift by 1954 and provided compelling arguments for its support in his classic 1964 textbook, but thought it would take the rest of his career to convince the rest of the scientific community. With the acceptance of plate tectonics in the late 1960s, he then applied his paleomagnetic tools to study young rocks (mid-ocean ridges), old rocks (the Laurentian shield), and mobile belts (the Appalachians and the Cordillera). In this poster we highlight recent work on several of his methods, results and ideas. Topics will include spherical statistics and paleosecular variation, the geomagnetic polarity time scale and the Kiaman superchron, paleoclimatic tests of paleogeography, compilation of paleomagnetic poles and the definition of apparent polar wander paths, and the paleogeography of cratons (e.g., Pangea) and mobile belts (e.g., Baja BC).",

            "abstract": "The paper concerns with the nonlinear properties of geomagnetic variations recorded in different geomagnetic latitudes, in the years of solar maximum and minimum. For the study, we use the geomagnetic time-series recorded by some of the stations of the EMMA quasi-meridional magnetometer network, established for pulsation study, in September 2001. The stations are located approx. along the magnetic meridian of 100 degree, and the sampling frequency of the series is 1 Hz. It is argued that the geomagnetic field exhibits nonlinear intermittent fluctuations in certain temporal scale range. For quantitatively investigating the scaling ranges and the variation of intermittent properties with latitude and time, we analyse the higher order moments of the time records (probability density function or structure function analyses). The multifractal or self-similar scaling of the fluctuations is investigated via the fitting of the P model to structure function scaling exponents. We also study the power-law behaviour of the power-spectral density functions of the series in order to evaluate the possible inertial frequency (and temporal) range of the geomagnetic field and compare them with the scaling ranges of structure functions. The range where intermittent geomagnetic variation is found falls typically between 100 and 20.000 s, i.e. covers the temporal range of the main phases of geomagnetic storms. It is shown that the intensity of intermittent fluctuations increases from solar minimum to solar maximum. The expected increase in the level of intermittency with the geomagnetic latitude can be evidenced only in the years of solar minimum.\nThe research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme ([FP7/2007-2013]) under grant agreement n° 313038/STORM.",

            "abstract": "Climate change-induced sea level rise and the potential for more intense, more frequent storms to occur in the future, will threaten the vitality of barrier islands by lowering their relative elevation and altering the frequency of overwash thereby leading to island narrowing and/or migration. High-density development (e.g., homes, condominiums, hotels, etc.) on many barrier islands may further increase island vulnerability by restricting delivery of sand to the subaerial island via overwash. To explore the potential future response of barrier islands to these factors, we analyzed state-wide pre and post-storm LiDAR surveys of New Jersey and North Carolina conducted in response to Hurricane Sandy (2012) and Nor’Ida (2009) to assess the influence of humans on storm-driven delivery of sand. We compared natural and developed environments of various foundational properties (commercial, residential - slab and residential - piling) by extracting and analyzing shore-perpendicular profiles. We tabulated overwash extent and thickness along each profile to determine the characteristic effects of different types of development in comparison to natural areas. We then used data derived from this profile analysis to inform the overwash component of a 2D barrier island model. Using this model, we assess the long-term (decadal to centurial) impacts of the interruption of sand delivery by anthropogenic structures on barrier island evolution. Through multiple numerical experiments we address a range of scenarios for sea level rise and changes in storminess. Early results suggest that commercial zones having a large frontage area pose the greatest threat to barrier island survivability under scenarios of rapid sea level rise.",

The polar-orbiting DMSP spacecraft cover the entire Earth from +85 to -85 degrees latitude. Their orbits are fixed in local time, but because of the rotation of the Earth, all longitudes are covered by their observations. Meanwhile the C/NOFS spacecraft is in a 13 degree inclination equatorial orbit which enables it to make observations at all local times and longitudes combined. Combining these two data sets allows us to make observations of the climatological averages of the midlatitude and equatorial ionospheres. We present climatological work on selected overlapping periods of DMSP and CINDI-C/NOFS data between +60 and -60 degrees latitude during the solar maximum period of 2012-2013. This work shows systematic variations in these ion parameters, specifically the ion flows, as a function of longitude along with variations based on altitude and season. Ultimately this work will serve as a baseline model against which observations from storm-time disturbances can be compared.",

            "abstract": "Lg waveforms recorded by EarthScope's Transportable Array (TA) are used to estimate Lg Q in the Western United States (WUS). Attenuation is calculated based on Lg spectral amplitudes filtered at a narrow band from 0.5 to 1.5 Hz with a central frequency of 1 Hz. The two-station and reverse two-station techniques were used to calculate Qo values. 398 events occurring from 2005 to 2009 and ranging from magnitude 3 to magnitude 6 were used in this study. The geometric spreading term can be determined by using a three-dimensional linear fit of the amplitude ratios versus epicentral distances to two stations. The slope of this line provides the geometric spreading term we use to calculate Lg Qo values of WUS. The results show high Q regions (low attenuation) corresponding to the Colorado Plateau (CP), the Rocky Mountains (RM), the Columbia Plateau (COP), and the Sierra Nevada Mountains (SNM). Regions of low Q (high attenuation) are seen along the Snake River Plain (SRP), the Rio Grande Rift (RGR), the Cascade Mountains (CM), and in east and west of the Basin and Range (BR) where tectonic activity is more active than the central part of the BR. A positive correlation between high heat flow, recent tectonic activity and Q was observed. Areas with low heat flow, thin sediment cover, and no recent tectonic activity were observed to have consistently high Q. These new models use two-station and reversed two-station methods and provide a comparison with previous studies and better constrain regions with high attenuation. This increase in detail can improve high frequency ground motion predictions of future large earthquakes for more accurate hazard assessment and improve overall understanding of the structure and assemblage of the WUS.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation in Earth's subtropics is characterized by large zonal asymmetries, especially during summer. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to relate precipitation contrast between deserts and monsoon regions, for instance the planetary Rossby wave mechanism of Rodwell and Hoskins (1996) or the ventilation mechanism of Chou et al. (2001). Yet, little has been done to quantify seasonal or centennial changes in the precipitation contrast between deserts and monsoon regions. Moreover, the relevance of stationary circulations to seasonal or centennial changes in the hydrology over subtropical dry zones remains unclear, for instance when compared to the influence of storm tracks or Hadley cells.\nUsing reanalysis data for past decades, we quantify the effect of stationary circulations on precipitation and evaporation over dry regions throughout seasonal cycle. We then quantify the sensitivity of dry zones to changes in the strength and extent of stationary (zonally asymmetric) circulations with global warming, using a hierarchy of GCMs. We relate changes in precipitation over monsoon regions to that over dry regions using a simple mechanism for stationary circulation changes we devised and successfully tested in idealized GCM simulations over a wide range of climates. This mechanism is based on fundamental dynamical principles of the tropical atmosphere. It predicts stationary circulations to strengthen with a deepening of the tropical troposphere or with enhanced near-surface thermal zonal asymmetries. We test this mechanism in reanalysis data of present-day climate and in comprehensive GCM simulations of global warming scenarios. Seasonal or centennial changes in precipitation contrast between deserts and monsoon regions are then related to fundamental thermodynamic properties of the surface and atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "A goal of geophysical monitoring is to detect and characterize alterations in the subsurface induced by natural and anthropogenic processes that affect local fracture geometry and local fluid flow. Recently, we demonstrated that a key seismic signature of a fracture (specific stiffness) is related to its hydraulic properties if the aperture distributions have only weak spatial correlations. An open challenge remains to determine if this relationship holds for correlated aperture distributions and whether this relationship differs for fractures altered only by stress or also for those altered by reactive flow and stress.\nA finite-size scaling analysis was performed on fractures to determine the effect of correlated aperture distributions with and without chemical alteration on the fundamental scaling relationship between fracture stiffness and fracture flow behavior. Computational models were used to analyze fluid flow through a fracture undergoing deformation and chemical alteration. The numerical methods included a stratified percolation approach to generate pore-scale fracture void geometry, a combined conjugate-gradient method and fast-multipole method for determining fracture deformation, and a network model for simulating fluid flow through a fracture. Fracture apertures were chemically eroded based on the local flux field through the fracture.\nFor correlated aperture distributions without chemical alteration, fracture stiffness captures the deformation of the fracture void geometry that includes both changes in contact area and aperture. This enabled a collapse of the numerical flow-stiffness data, from multiple length scales, to a single scaling function. When fracture apertures were slightly eroded, the flow-stiffness relationship exhibited the same functional form as the unaltered case, but the scaling of flow depended on the aperture of the critical neck.\nThese results suggest that geophysical methods that characterize fracture stiffness have the potential to estimate relative flow among stressed and eroded fractures.\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported by the U.S. Dept. of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Geosciences Research Program under Award Number (DE-FG02-09ER16022) and by the Geo-mathematical Imaging Group at Purdue University.",

A challenge to the application of these models to large areas is that the response can be spatially heterogeneous, and the choice of a local spatial covariance model and a large scale spatial trend model in the parameters of the Bayesian regression may not be intuitively obvious. We consider a multilevel modeling structure for exploring homogeneity of response in such data sets, through a multi-component mixture model. The approach allows the reduction of uncertainties through partial pooling of parameters across automatically chosen subsets of the data. Applications to a synthetic data set and to extreme precipitation data for the continental USA from the HADEX2 data set is presented considering trends and selected climate indices as potential predictors. The effect of changing the number of components in the mixture is demonstrated through the changing spatial membership and trends in the data.",

Here we present a new wave speed model of the eastern North American margin from full-wave ambient noise tomography with the USArray data. Transitions in lithosphere thickness occur at the intersection of the North American craton to the west and the Atlantic Ocean basin. We observe a continuous low wave speed feature at the edge of the continent between depths of 120 and 190 km into the Earth. The dramatic change in lithosphere thickness at this boundary may drive asthenosphere upwelling along the edge of the continent. Edge driven convection is hypothesized as the result of induced mantle convection due to plate motions and abrupt thickness changes in the lithosphere. Additionally, the insulating effect of large continents has been hypothesized to result in the formation of “hot” convection cells along their boundaries. Localized higher amplitude slow anomalies are seen adjacent to Maryland and Virginia and offshore of South Carolina and Georgia; these may be the locales of enhanced edge driven convection that exploits weaknesses in the lithosphere from past episodes of volcanism. Additionally, a large slow wave speed anomaly beneath New England continues offshore aligned with the New England Seamount chain, and is possibly a remnant of the Monteregian hot spot active 100 - 120 Ma. Slow wave speeds extending to depths greater than 50 km reflect thickened continental crust in the Appalachians.",

            "abstract": "There is considerable concern about water availability to support energy production in Texas, particularly considering that many of the shale plays are in semiarid areas of Texas and the state experienced the most extreme drought on record in 2011. The Eagle Ford shale play provides an excellent case study. Hydraulic fracturing water use for shale gas extraction in the play totaled ~ 12 billion gallons (bgal) in 2012, representing ~7 – 10% of total water use in the 16 county play area. The dominant source of water is groundwater which is not highly vulnerable to drought from a recharge perspective because water is primarily stored in the confined portion of aquifers that were recharged thousands of years ago. Water supply drought vulnerability results primarily from increased water use for irrigation. Irrigation water use in the Eagle Ford play was 30 billion gallons higher in the 2011 drought year relative to 2010. Recent trends toward increased use of brackish groundwater for shale gas extraction in the Eagle Ford also reduce pressure on fresh water resources. Evaluating the impacts of natural gas development on water resources should consider the use of natural gas in power generation, which now represents 50% of power generation in Texas. Water consumed in extracting the natural gas required for power generation is equivalent to ~7% of the water consumed in cooling these power plants in the state. However, natural gas production from shale plays can be overall beneficial in terms of water resources in the state because natural gas combined cycle power generation decreases water consumption by ~60% relative to traditional coal, nuclear, and natural gas plants that use steam turbine generation. This reduced water consumption enhances drought resilience of power generation in the state. In addition, natural gas combined cycle plants provide peaking capacity that complements increasing renewable wind generation which has no cooling water requirement. However, water savings related to power generation is not collocated with water used for shale gas extraction. Analysis of drought impacts on water energy interdependence should consider both water for energy extraction and power generation to assess net impacts.",

Despite this insight, the state of practice for a hydrologic investigation follows this sequence: data collection, conceptual model development, numerical model development, and finally decision making based on model projections. This approach, based on relatively unconsidered design of data collection, may result in uninformative data. As a result, it is commonly repeated several times to resolve critical uncertainties. We present a novel two step multi-model approach to optimizing data collection to aid decision making, risk analysis. Here, we describe the application this approach (Discrimination Inference to Reduce Expected Cost Technique - DIRECT) for a contaminant transport problem. DIRECT has 7 steps. First, outcomes of concern were defined explicitly. Next a probabilistic analysis of the outcomes was conducted that incorporated multiple conceptual and parametric realizations. The likelihood of each model was assessed based on goodness of fit to existing data. A cost function was developed and used to define the projected costs based on the model-predicted outcomes of concern. Data collection was then optimized to identify the data that could test the models of greatest concern (cost) against the other models in the ensemble. Finally a field program was conducted that included gathering lithologic, hydrologic, and chemical data from 22 new wells that were drilled in projected high value locations. The additional data reduced the expected cost of model projections to an acceptable level for defining new site compliance conditions.",

Merging paleoclimatic information with observational and model data, however, involves important technical considerations associated with data and model uncertainties and the employed drought metric. Here we evaluate the interpretation of different PDSI formulations in various paleoclimatic, observational, and modeling contexts. Potential biases in tree-ring reconstructed PDSI are evaluated using Thorthwaite, Penman-Montieth, and Self-Calibrating Penman-Montieth PDSI as reconstruction targets in three diverse regions of the United States and tree-ring chronologies from the North American Drought Atlas (NADA). Minimal differences are found between the three PDSI reconstructions and all compare favorably to independently reconstructed Thornthwaite-based PDSI from the NADA. Reconstructions also compare well with model-derived estimates of PDSI (Thornthwaite and Penman-Montieth formulations), and near-surface and full-column soil moisture over the 20th century in two collections of model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 database. Model-derived Thornthwaite and Penman-Monteith PDSI closely track modeled soil moisture (near-surface and full column) during the 20th century, with differences only emerging in 21st-century projections. These differences confirm the tendency of Thorntwaite-based PDSI to overestimate drying when temperatures exceed the range of its normalization interval; the more physical moisture-balance accounting of Penman-Montieth PDSI compares much better with modeled soil moisture in the projection interval. Remaining regional differences in the secular behavior of projected soil moisture and Penman-Montieth-based PDSI are interpreted in terms of underlying physical processes and temporal sampling. Results demonstrate the continued utility of PDSI as a metric of surface moisture balance and provide a framework for refining assessments of drought risks using a collection of paleoclimatic, observational, and model data.",

            "abstract": "A 2011 paper by a group from the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory established that a long- and widely-used method for projecting evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff from the land portions of the Great Lakes basin exhibited severe deficiencies in terms of conservation of energy at the land surface, and consequent errors in projected runoff and lake levels. The key component of this older method is known as the Large Basin Runoff Model (LBRM). A simple alternative method was developed to better account for energy conservation, and this was run for two different general circulation model (GCM) datasets, in order to demonstrate the corresponding discrepancies in terms of ET, runoff, and lake water level. In the Third National Climate Assessment, the regional chapter on the Midwest acknowledged these results, while Appendix 3 (Climate Science Supplement) expressed less credence, with the lead authors of that appendix maintaining that the models needed to be run with more GCMs as input. We will report on the results of runs using more than 40 GCM realizations from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 5 class. In addition to the previously-used method of adjusting future potential evapotranspiration (PET) according to changes in net radiative energy available at the surface, we introduce one that additionally estimates the air temperature dependence term of the Penman-Monteith formulation, and one in which PET varies in proportion to the Clausius-Clapeyron relation (i.e. PET increases by about 7% per degree C, in contrast to LBRM, in which PET typically increases by 30-50% per degree C).",

Constraints on current rates of surface deformation in 1-, 2- or 3-dimensions can be obtained by examining sets of GPS and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations, both alone and in combination. Contributions to the observed signal often include motion along faults, seasonal cycles of subsidence and recharge associated with aquifers, anthropogenic extraction of hydrocarbons, and variations in atmospheric water vapor and ionospheric properties.\nHere we examine methods for extracting time-varying ground deformation signals from combinations of InSAR and GPS data, real and synthetic, applied to Southern California. We show that two methods for combining the data through removal of a GPS-constrained function (a plane, and filtering) from the InSAR result in a clear tradeoff between the contribution from the two datatypes at diffferent spatial scales. We also show that the contribution to the secular rates at GPS sites from seasonal signals is large enough to be a significant error in this estimation process, and should be accounted for.",

The main objectives for the site were to (1) determine background air pollutant concentrations and trends, (2) support air quality modelling validation and development, (3) complement the high elevation background monitoring site at Whistler and other regional monitoring initiatives, and (4) conduct chemical process studies in the marine boundary layer. During the initial evaluations of the collected data (e.g., O3, PM2.5, NOx, and SO2) and its comparison to other marine background sites, periods were observed that are clearly representative of background air, continental background air, and those clearly influenced by ship and boat traffic in the region.\nOn the basis that the individual pollutants observed are closely related to emissions observed by underway marine vessels, certain observational periods in the collected dataset were associated with ship plumes. Utilizing the data provided by marine vessel movements, CALPUFF emission inputs were generated for dispersion modelling of ship pollutants. CALPUFF model output data were subsequently compared to measured data in order to better characterize impacts from marine vessel traffic.",

            "abstract": "Climate change has the potential to exacerbate reliability concerns for the power sector through changes in water availability and air temperatures. The power sector is responsible for 41% of U.S. freshwater withdrawals, primarily for power plant cooling needs, and any changes in the water available for the power sector, given increasing competition among water users, could affect decisions about new power plant builds and reliable operations for existing generators. Similarly, increases in air temperatures can reduce power plant efficiencies, which in turn increases fuel consumption as well as water withdrawal and consumption rates. This analysis describes an initial link between climate, water, and electricity systems using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) electricity system capacity expansion model. Average surface water runoff projections from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) data are applied to surface water available to generating capacity in ReEDS, and electric sector growth is compared with and without climate-influenced water availability for the 134 electricity balancing regions in the ReEDS model. In addition, air temperature changes are considered for their impacts on electricity load, transmission capacity, and power plant efficiencies and water use rates. Mean climate projections have only a small impact on national or regional capacity growth and water use because most regions have sufficient unappropriated or previously retired water access to offset climate impacts. Climate impacts are notable in southwestern states, which experience reduced water access purchases and a greater share of water acquired from wastewater and other higher-cost water resources. The electric sector climate impacts demonstrated herein establish a methodology to be later exercised with more extreme climate scenarios and a more rigorous representation of legal and physical water availability.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide has surpassed CFC-12 to become the third largest contributor to radiative forcing. When climate impacts for equal emitted masses of N2O and CO2 are integrated over 100 years, N2O impacts are about 300 times greater than those of CO2. Increasing the atmospheric burden of N2O also decreases the abundance of O3 in the stratosphere. With reductions in emissions of ODSs as a result of the Montreal Protocol, N2O now has the largest ODP-weighted emissions of all gases. Given its long lifetime of about 130 years, today's emissions will impact climate and stratospheric O3 for a long time. Because emission rates are very small and spread over enormous areas, the detailed N2O budget has large uncertainties. It also means measurement requirements on precision and accuracy are stringent, especially for the background atmosphere. The Carbon Cycle Group of NOAA ESRL's Global Monitoring Division began measuring N2O in discrete air samples collected as part of its global cooperative air sampling network in 1998. Data from about 60 air sampling sites provide important constraints on the large-scale budget of N2O and provide boundary conditions for continental and regional-scale studies. This presentation will briefly describe the procedures used to ensure the data are of sufficient quality to meet scientific demands, and describe remaining limitations. Although sampling is infrequent (weekly), the data are quite useful in N2O budget studies. Examples will be given of large scale constraints on N2O's budget, including the global burden, trends in the burden, global emissions, spatial distributions, vertical gradients, and seasonal patterns.",

            "abstract": "The thermosphere-ionosphere system is a highly dynamic, non-linearly coupled interaction that fluctuates on a daily basis. Many models exist to attempt to quantify the relationship between the two atmospheric layers, and each approaches the problem differently. Because these models differ in the implementation of the equations that govern the dynamics of the thermosphere-ionosphere system, it is important to understand under which conditions each model performs best, and under which conditions each model may have limitations in accuracy. With this in consideration, this study examines the ability of two of the leading coupled thermosphere-ionosphere models in the community, TIE-GCM and GITM, to reproduce thermospheric and ionospheric quantities observed by the CHAMP satellite during times of differing geomagnetic activity. Neutral and electron densities are studied for three geomagnetic activity levels, ranging form high to minimal activity. Metrics used to quantify differences between the two models include root-mean-square error and prediction efficiency, and qualitative differences between a model and observed data is also considered. The metrics are separated into the high- mid- and low-latitude region to depict any latitudinal dependencies of the models during the various events. Despite solving for the same parameters, the models are shown to be highly dependent on the amount of activity level that occurs and can be significantly different from each other. In addition, in comparing previous statistical studies that use the models, a clear improvement is observed in the evolution of each model as thermospheric and ionospheric\nconstituents during the differing levels of activity are solved.",

            "abstract": "In many snow-covered landscapes, snow tends to be shallow or deep in the same locations year after year. As snowmelt progresses in spring, areas of shallow snow become snow-free earlier than areas with deep snow. This pattern (Sturm and Wagner 2010) could likely be used to inform or improve modeled snow depth estimates where ground measurements are not collected; however, we must be certain of their utility before ingesting them into model calculations. Do patterns, as we detect them, have a relationship with earlier measured snow distributions? Second, are certain areas on the landscape likely to yield patterns that are influenced too highly by melting to be useful? Our Imnavait Creek Study Area (11 by 19 km) is on Alaska’s North Slope, where we have examined a vast library of spring satellite imagery (ranging from mostly snow-covered to mostly snow-free). Landsat TM Imagery has been collected from the early 1980s-present, and the temporal and spatial resolution is roughly two weeks and 30 m, respectively. High resolution satellite imagery (WorldView 1, WorldView 2, IKONOS) has been obtained from 2010-2013 for the same area with almost daily- to monthly-temporal and at 2.5 m spatial resolutions, respectively. We found that there is a striking similarity among patterns from year to year across the span of decades and resolutions. However, the relationship of pattern with observed snow depths was strong in some areas and less clear in others. Overall, we suspect spatial scaling, spatial mismatch, sampling errors, and melt patterns explain most of the areas of pattern and depth disparity.",

Validation of the data assimilation system (DAS) has been done for historical data from the past 400 years by comparing differences between observations and forecasts (O-F) at the CMB. However, this approach is limited by the lack of knowledge about the accuracy of the observations, which come from geomagnetic field models (GFM). But we can also use geomagnetic data assimilation to estimate upper limits on GFM uncertainty by making some simplifying assumptions. We show that large forecast biases, which degrade the optimality of the assimilation, can be easily removed. This leaves just the much smaller random component of the forecast uncertainty and the remaining (O-F) from which it is much easier to the extract a maximum value for the observation uncertainty.",

We evaluate the impact of the spatial distribution in ice sheet mass balance on the inferred regional sea level pattern. Based on the results, we derive requirements on the spatial scale of mass loss needed to resolve the regional pattern of sea level change. In the calculation of the water and ice mass changes over land, we also need to restore the amplitude of the GRACE signal before calculating the regional sea level pattern. Here, we describe an improved scaling factor method that comprises both a seasonal and a long-term component. We discuss the impact of these components on the retrieved regional sea level pattern. Using the SLF, we identify the sources of observed sea level variations. We show that the cumulative SLF describe a large portion of the trend and annual amplitude of the observed sea level variations at both the global and basin scales. When comparing the cumulative SLF with observations of sea level change from steric corrected altimetry, we find an excellent agreement at the global and basin scales. We discuss differences in sea level pattern between the last decade and the prior 40 years.

The receiving system is 234 km southeast from the transmitting radar and its line of sight to the mesosphere above Tromso has an elevation angle of 21 degrees implying an aspect angle of the scattered signals in that direction of 69 degrees. This is the first time that a truly bistatic configuration has been employed to measure the angle dependence of the scattering mechanism of PMSE which otherwise has been measured only in monostatic configurations. The bistatic configuration is unencumbered by drawbacks of the monostatic configuration that cannot reach angles greater than about 20 degrees due to antenna beam pattern degradation and the use of models to extrapolate the angle dependence of the scattered signals. Strong scattering was observed over prolonged periods on several days by the demonstrator array in July of 2011. These measurements are at variance with previous aspect angle measurements that have reported aspect angles no greater than about 15 degrees. These results indicate that the turbulent irregularities that produce the scattering have a high degree of isotropy, which is more in line with Kolmogorov's hypothesis of a universal scaling of turbulence based on the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy in the inertial regime of turbulence which applies also to the Batchelor regime (due to large Schmidt numbers) believed to be the case for PMSE.",

            "abstract": "Central American gyres (CAGs) are broad (~1000 km diameter) low-level cyclonic circulations that organize over Central America during the tropical cyclone (TC) season. While CAGs have rarely been studied, prior work on similar circulations has been conducted on monsoon depressions (MDs) and monsoon gyres (MGs), which possess spatial scales of 1000 – 2500 km in the west Pacific basin. A key difference between MDs and MGs is related to the organization of vorticity around the low-level circulation. MDs possess a symmetrical vorticity pattern where vorticity accumulates near the circulation center over time, occasionally developing into a large TC. In contrast, MGs possess asymmetrical vorticity, organized in mesovorticies, which rotate cyclonically along the periphery of the MG circulation. Small tropical cyclones (TCs) occasionally develop from these mesovorticies. Interaction and development of TCs within CAGs are also common, as noted by a CAG identified during the 2010 PREDICT field project, which involved the interaction of TC Matthew and the development of TC Nicole within the larger CAG. This project is motivated by the lack of prior research on CAGs, as well as the complex scale interactions that occasionally occur between TCs and CAGs.\nThis presentation focuses on the mutual interaction of vortices embedded in the larger-scale cyclonic flow comprising the CAG circulation. Case studies will be presented using a circulation framework to illustrate the relationship between different scale vorticity elements within the CAG. Some of these case studies resemble a MD-like evolution, where a large TC develops through the accumulation of symmetrical vorticity around the CAG (e.g. TC Opal 1995, TC Frances 1998). Other instances resemble a MG-like evolution, where smaller mesovorticies rotate around a common circulation center (e.g. TC Florence 1988). The circulation analysis framework aids in the diagnosis of interaction between different scale cyclonic vortices, and can be used in other complex TC environment interaction scenarios (e.g. Fujiwara interaction, trough – TC interaction). Observational analyses of TC – CAG interaction are then used to build gyre conceptual models that can be beneficial in forecasting these complex events.",

            "abstract": "Existing satellite gravity data, along with publicly available single beam bathymetry, multibeam bathymetry, and shipboard and satellite magnetic anomalies were compiled to make an updated map of tectonic features of the Cocos Plate offshore Mexico and the conjugate crust on the Pacific Plate. The area includes the northern Cocos plate as far south as the Tehuantepec Ridge, and Pacific plate crust on both sides of the Mathematician Rise. This thus includes the modern East Pacific Rise (EPR), the submarine rift margins that bound it – Moctezuma and Manzanillo Troughs - and features previously identified such as the Orozco and O’Gorman Fracture Zones near the Middle America Trench (MAT). The goal was to use existing data to evaluate the likely features that may have existed on the now subducted Cocos Plate crust north of the Clarion Fracture Zone-Tehuantepec Ridge. This can then be compared to seismic imaging of the downgoing slab and geochemical variations along the Mexican Volcanic Arc.\nBathymetric slopes were computed automatically from multibeam data gridded at 200 m, 300 m, and 400 m pixel size, and processed to remove signals of circular features such as seamounts, and regions of low slope, while emphasizing higher slopes controlled by linear abyssal hill fabric and fracture zones. Tectonic fabrics at all 3 scales are generally similar. In the resulting tectonic fabric map, the domain of modern East Pacific Rise spreading is clearly visible, truncating older fabrics at the Manzanillo Trough on the east and the Moctezuma Trough on the west. The Orozco Fracture Zone lies entirely within the young part of this crustal province and does not reach the Manzanillo Trough or the MAT. Hence, it is not a feature of the downgoing Cocos Plate and should not be used to explain variations in geochemistry of the arc or geometric variations in the subducted plate. A zone of E-W to ENE-WSW oriented abyssal hills and lineated magnetic anomalies in a bathymetric low between the Moctezuma Trough and the Mathematician Rise forms a separate crustal province, truncated by the Moctezuma Trough. There is a possible conjugate fragment of this older province preserved east of the Manzanillo Trough, next to the MAT. Thus, features of the downgoing Cocos Plate appear to be more complicated than has been envisioned in most previous interpretations.",

            "abstract": "Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles are coupled in terrestrial ecosystems through multiple processes including photosynthesis, tissue allocation, respiration, N fixation, N uptake, and decomposition of litter and soil organic matter. Capturing the constraint of N on terrestrial C uptake and storage has been a focus of the Earth System modelling community. Here we explore the trade-offs and sensitivities of allocating C and N to different tissues in order to optimize the productivity of plants using a new, simple model of ecosystem C-N cycling and interactions (ACONITE). ACONITE builds on theory related to plant economics in order to predict key ecosystem properties (leaf area index, leaf C:N, N fixation, and plant C use efficiency) based on the optimization of the marginal change in net C or N uptake associated with a change in allocation of C or N to plant tissues. We simulated and evaluated steady-state and transient ecosystem stocks and fluxes in three different forest ecosystems types (tropical evergreen, temperate deciduous, and temperate evergreen). Leaf C:N differed among the three ecosystem types (temperate deciduous < tropical evergreen < temperature evergreen), a result that compared well to observations from a global database describing plant traits. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) estimates compared well to observed fluxes at the simulation sites. A sensitivity analysis revealed that parameterization of the relationship between leaf N and leaf respiration had the largest influence on leaf area index and leaf C:N. Also, a widely used linear leaf N-respiration relationship did not yield a realistic leaf C:N, while a more recently reported non-linear relationship simulated leaf C:N that compared better to the global trait database than the linear relationship. Overall, our ability to constrain leaf area index and allow spatially and temporally variable leaf C:N can help address challenges simulating these properties in ecosystem and Earth System models. Furthermore, the simple approach with emergent properties based on coupled C-N dynamics has potential for use in research that uses data-assimilation methods to integrate data on both the C and N cycles to improve C flux forecasts.",

            "abstract": "Transient bright features, popularly referred to as Titan’s Magic Island, were observed in Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of the northern sea, Ligeia Mare, in July 2013 (Hofgartner et al., 2014, Nature Geosci. 7, 493). Images obtained prior and subsequent to the July 2013 detection do not include these bright features. The features are not consistent with ambiguities, scalloping, gain control or edge effects and are not considered to be standard SAR image artifacts. We compared the measured radar cross-sections from the region of the anomalies to a suite of quasi-specular plus diffuse backscatter models and found that this class of models for a permanent structure can be ruled out to 88% confidence. Thus we conclude that the appearance of the features is the result of a transformation and the subsequent non-detections indicate that they were transient. The observational constraints do not permit tides and/or sea level change to be the dominant cause of the transient expression. We suggest that ephemeral phenomena such as surface waves, rising bubbles, and suspended or floating solids best explain these features. Local meteorology could stimulate or enhance these phenomena, but we are unable to constrain its role in the appearance of these transients. These enigmatic features and the waves reportedly detected in Punga Mare (Barnes et al., 2014, Planetary Science, accepted) are likely the first glimpses of dynamic processes that are commencing in the northern lakes and seas as summer nears in the northern hemisphere. It is plausible that they are an expression of the changing seasons and as Titan’s northern hemisphere continues transitioning toward summer they may occur with increased frequency. Ligeia Mare, including the region of the transients, will be observed again during the Cassini Titan flyby on August 21, 2014 and this observation could be diagnostic of the nature of these features. For example, if the transients are waves and waves are detectable at the 12 degrees incidence of the upcoming radar measurements, the predicted increase in wind speeds should result in a higher spatial density of these features.",

            "abstract": "Seasonal Ice Zone Reconnaissance Surveys (SIZRS) of the Beaufort Sea aboard U.S. Coast Guard Arctic Domain Awareness flights were made monthly from May 2012 to October 2012, June 2013 to August 2013, and June 2014 to October 2014. In 2012 sea ice extent reached a record minimum and the SIZRS sampling ranged from complete ice cover to open water; in addition to its large spatial coverage, the SIZRS program extends temporal coverage of the seasonal ice zone (SIZ) beyond the traditional season for ship-based observations, and is a good set of measurements for model validation and climatological comparison. The SIZ, where ice melts and reforms annually, encompasses the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Thus SIZRS tracks interannual MIZ conditions, providing a regional context for smaller-scale MIZ processes.\nObservations with Air eXpendable CTDs (AXCTDs) reveal two near-surface warm layers: a locally-formed surface seasonal mixed layer and a layer of Pacific origin at 50-60m. Temperatures in the latter differ from the freezing point by up to 2°C more than climatologies. To distinguish vertical processes of mixed layer formation from Pacific advection, vertical heat and salt fluxes are quantified using a 1-D Price-Weller-Pinkel (PWP) model adapted for ice-covered seas. This PWP simulates mixing processes in the top 100m of the ocean. Surface forcing fluxes are taken from the Marginal Ice Zone Modeling and Assimilation System MIZMAS. Comparison of SIZRS observations with PWP output shows that the ocean behaves one-dimensionally above the Pacific layer of the Beaufort Gyre.\nDespite agreement with the MIZMAS-forced PWP, SIZRS observations remain fresher to 100m than do outputs from MIZMAS and ECCO.2. The shapes of seasonal cycles in SIZRS salinity and temperature agree with MIZMAS and ECCO.2 model outputs despite differences in the values of each. However, the seasonal change of surface albedo is not high enough resolution to accurately drive the PWP. Use of ice albedo observations to scale shortwave radiation and salt fluxes improves agreement between observations and PWP outputs. Sensitivity analyses suggest that these are the two most impactful surface parameters on PWP output and that better knowledge of their seasonal changes—as well as better characterization of horizontal Pacific inflow—is imperative for future modeling.",

The primary objective of this research is to determine the spatial extent and magnitude of a possible regolith temperature contribution to the Moon's epithermal leakage flux as a function of topography. Ongoing research has suggested that there exists a widespread preferential bias in hydrogen concentrations towards the Moon’s poleward-facing slopes as evidenced by a localized 1-2% suppression of the lunar epithermal leakage flux relative to equivalent equator-facing slopes (McClahanan et al., Under Review 2014). Monte Carlo neutron modeling results by (Lawson et al., 2000; Little et al. 2002) found that the epithermal neutron leakage flux may be slightly enhanced ~1% with regolith temperature in lunar conditions. Contrasting temperature conditions on poleward-facing and equator-facing slopes may at least partially explain the observation of biased concentrations of hydrogen towards poleward-facing slopes. To isolate any temperature contribution, LEND night observations are mapped and correlated with temperature maps from LRO's Diviner radiometer and terrain and illumination models derived from the Lunar Observing Laser Altimeter. Night and day results are contrasted to illustrate both the magitude and latitude extent of putative temperature effects and spatial hydrogen distributions.",

            "abstract": "The Guatemala Suture Zone is the fault-bound region in central Guatemala that contains the present North American–Caribbean plate boundary. This major composite geotectonic unit contains a variety of ophiolites, serpentinite mélanges, and metavolcano-sedimentary sequences along with high-grade schists, gneisses, low-grade metasediments and metagranites thrusted north and south of the active Motagua fault system (MFS). The North Motagua Mélange (NMM) outcrops north of the MFS and testifies the emplacement of exhumed subduction assemblages along a collisional tectonic setting. The NMM is composed of a serpentinite-matrix mélange that contains blocks of metabasites (subgreenschist facies metabasalt, grt-blueschist, eclogite, grt-amphibolite), vein-related rocks (jadeitite, omphacitite, albitite, mica-rock), and metatrondhjemites.\nOur new detailed petrographic and thermobarometric study on the garnet-bearing metabasites reveals a complex polymetamorphic history with multiple tectonic events. Eclogites show a classical clockwise PT path composed of (a) prograde blueschist/eclogite facies within garnet cores, (b) eclogite facies metamorphic peak at ~1.7 GPa and 620°C, (c) post-peak blueschist facies, (d) amphibolite facies overprint, and (e) late stage greenschist facies. Two types of garnet amphibolite blocks can be found, the first consist of (a) a relict eclogite facies peak at ~1.3 GPa and 550°C only preserved within anhedral garnet cores, and (b) surrounded by a post-peak amphibolite facies. In contrast, the second type displays a prograde amphibolite facies at 0.6-1.1 GPa and 400-650°C.\nThe eclogites metamorphic peak suggests formation in a normal subduction zone at ~60 km depth, a subsequent exhumation to the middle section of the subduction channel (~35 km), and a later metamorphic reworking at lower P and higher T before its final exhumation. The first type of garnet amphibolite shows a similar trajectory as the eclogites but at warmer conditions. In contrast, the second type of garnet amphibolite recorded a single prograde evolution along a hotter thermal gradient. These different PT paths suggest multiple metamorphic events that may be related to subduction initiation, partial exhumation and storage of HP–LT rocks, subduction of buoyant crust, final exhumation and obduction.",

In this presentation we describe interannual variations in the clouds as measured by the AIM Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) instrument, and relate these to measurements of temperature and water vapor from the NASA Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instruments. Overall, interannual variability is larger in the SH than in the NH. In both hemispheres, there is significant variability from season to season in the season onset, with somewhat less variability in the season end. There is about a 20-day spread in the season onset dates in the NH; the NH 2013 season was the earliest, and began a week earlier than any other NH season. In mid-season the NH PMC frequencies were generally highest in 2011, 2013 and 2014, and lowest in 2007 and 2009, but with substantial day-to-day variations that increase with decreasing latitude. In the SH, the earliest season onsets occurred in 2009-2010, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014, which started about a month earlier than 2010-2011 and 2011-2012. The SH 2009-2010 season continued to show more PMCs than any other season throughout the summer, whereas PMC frequencies in the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 seasons dropped to average values in mid-January. These results will be discussed in terms of teleconnections and solar cycle effects.",

            "abstract": "Real-time measurements from increasingly dense Global Navigational Satellite Systems (GNSS) networks located throughout the western US offer a substantial, albeit largely untapped, contribution towards the mitigation of seismic and other natural hazards. Analyzed continuously in real-time, currently over 600 instruments blanket the San Andreas and Cascadia fault systems of the North American plate boundary and can provide on-the-fly characterization of transient ground displacements highly complementary to traditional seismic strong-motion monitoring. However, the utility of GNSS systems depends on their resolution, and merged solutions of two or more independent estimation strategies have been shown to offer lower scatter and higher resolution. Towards this end, independent real time GNSS solutions produced by Scripps Inst. of Oceanography and Central Washington University (PANGA) are now being formally combined in pursuit of NASA’s Real-Time Earthquake Analysis for Disaster Mitigation (READI) positioning goals. CWU produces precise point positioning (PPP) solutions while SIO produces ambiguity resolved PPP solutions (PPP-AR). The PPP-AR solutions have a ~5 mm RMS scatter in the horizontal and ~10mm in the vertical, however PPP-AR solutions can take tens of minutes to re-converge in case of data gaps. The PPP solutions produced by CWU use pre-cleaned data in which biases are estimated as non-integer ambiguities prior to formal positioning with GIPSY 6.2 using a real time stream editor developed at CWU. These solutions show ~20mm RMS scatter in the horizontal and ~50mm RMS scatter in the vertical but re-converge within 2 min. or less following cycle-slips or data outages. We have implemented the formal combination of the CWU and SCRIPPS ENU displacements using the independent solutions as input measurements to a simple 3-element state Kalman filter plus white noise. We are now merging solutions from 90 stations, including 30 in Cascadia, 39 in the Bay Area, and 21 from S. California. Six months of merged time series demonstrate that the combined solution is more reliable and can take advantage of the strengths of the individual solutions while mitigating their weaknesses. The merging can be easily extended to three or more independent analysis strategies, which may be considered in the future",

The study deals with a sediment core raised on the HOTRAX 2005 expedition from the Northwind Ridge, western Arctic Ocean. By comparison with an earlier reported stratigraphy (Polyak et al., 2013), the core dates back to estimated ca. 1.5 Ma. A suite of paleobiological, lithological, and geochemical proxies will be utilized to reconstruct paleoceanographic environments in the early Pleistocene part of the record. In contrast to most Arctic Ocean sediment cores, calcareous microfossils occur in abundance to ca. 1.2 Ma. This enables the use of microfaunal assemblages as proxies for sea-ice conditions, which control the seasonal organic production. Physical properties such as sediment density, grain size, and sediment fabric (based on XCT imagery) will be employed to determine the impact of glaciations on sedimentation. By reconstructing sea-ice history and glacial cycles, we will gain insights into poorly understood controls on the Arctic environments during the early Pleistocene and Mid-Pleistocene Transition.",

It has a number of geology courses, and recently opened a planetary science course as the first upper division astronomy course after many years of offering freshman astronomy.\nAstronomy 310, Planetary Science, focuses on the physics of the Solar System and allows the study of planetary astronomy in a deeper way than what is offered in a freshman course. With a mathematically based approach, it looks at the planets and smaller bodies such as meteoroids, asteroids and comets found in our own solar neighbourhood. It provides an understanding of the basic physics and equations needed for studies of planetary science and looks at the formation of the principal bodies in the Solar System. It investigates the interiors of planets and planetary surface phenomena such as cratering, volcanism and tectonics, and examines the atmospheres of planets, including how they originated and whether planets can keep an atmosphere. As a new course, it has grown rapidly.\nGeology 415, Earth’s Origin and Early Evolution, explores the evidence for the various processes, events, and materials involved in the formation and evolution of Earth. The course provides an overview of objects in the Solar System, including the Sun, the planets, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Earth’s place in the Solar System is examined and physical laws that govern the motion of objects in the universe are looked at. Various geochemical tools and techniques used by geologists to reveal and interpret the evidence for the formation and evolution of bodies in the Solar System as well as the age of Earth are also explored. After looking at lines of evidence used to reconstruct the evolution of the Solar System, processes involved in the formation of planets and stars are examined. The course concludes with a look at the origin and nature of Earth’s internal structure. GEOL415 is a senior undergraduate course and enrols about 15-30 students annually.\nThe courses are delivered online via the Moodle Learning Management System and student evaluation is conducted through assignments and invigilated examinations.",

            "abstract": "A complete characterization of field-aligned ionospheric irregularities responsible for the scintillation of satellite signals includes not only their spectral properties (power spectral strength, spectral index, anisotropy ratio, and outer-scale) but also their horizontal drift velocity. From a system impacts perspective, the horizontal drift velocity is important in that it dictates the rate of signal fading and also, to an extent, the level of phase fluctuations encountered by the receiver. From a physics perspective, studying the longitudinal morphology of zonal irregularity may lead to an improved understanding of the F region dynamo and regional electrodynamics at low latitudes. The irregularity drift at low latitudes is predominantly zonal and is most commonly measured by cross-correlating observations of satellite signals made by a pair of closely-spaced antennas. The AFRL-SCINDA network operates a small number of VHF spaced-antenna systems at low latitude stations for this purpose. A far greater number of GPS scintillation monitors are operated by AFRL-SCINDA (25-30) and the Low Latitude Ionospheric Sensor Network (35-50), but the receivers are situated too far apart to monitor the drift using cross-correlation techniques.\nIn this paper, we present an alternative approach that leverages the weak scatter scintillation theory (Rino, Radio Sci., 1979) to infer the zonal irregularity drift from single-station GPS measurements of S4, sigma-phi, and the propagation geometry alone. Unlike the spaced-receiver technique, this technique requires assumptions for the height of the scattering layer (which introduces a bias in the drift estimates) and the spectral index of the irregularities (which affects the spread of the drift estimates about the mean). Nevertheless, theory and experiment show that the ratio of sigma-phi to S4 is less sensitive to these parameters than it is to the zonal drift, and hence the zonal drift can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. In this talk, we first validate the technique using spaced VHF-antenna measurements of zonal irregularity drift from the AFRL-SCINDA network. Next, we discuss preliminary results from our investigation into the longitudinal morphology of zonal irregularity drift using the AFRL-SCINDA and LISN networks of GPS scintillation monitors.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of the atmosphere on Mars is one of the most intriguing problems in the exploration of the Solar System, and the climate of Mars may have evolved from a warmer, wetter early state to the cold, dry current state. Because CO2 is the major constituent of Mars’s atmosphere, its isotopic signatures offer a unique window to trace the evolution of climate on Mars. Here we use a box model to trace the evolution of the carbon reservoir and its isotopic signature on Mars, with carbonate deposition and atmospheric escape as the two sinks and magmatic activity as the sole source. We derive new quantitative constraints on the amount of carbonate deposition and the atmospheric pressure of Mars through time, extending into the Noachian, ~3.8 Gyr before present. This determination is based on recent Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) isotopic measurements of Mars’s atmosphere, recent orbiter, lander, and rover measurements of Mars’s surface, and a newly identified mechanism (photodissociation of CO) that efficiently enriches the heavy carbon isotope. In particular, we find that escape via CO photodissociation on Mars has a fractionation factor of 0.6 and hence, photochemical escape processes can effectively enrich 13C in the Mars’s atmosphere during the Amazonian. As a result, modest carbonate deposition must have occurred early in Mars’s history to compensate the enrichment effects of photochemical processes and also sputtering, even when volcanic outgassing up to 200 mbar occurred during the Hesperian. For a photochemical escape flux that scales as the square of the solar EUV flux or more, at least 0.1 bar of CO2 must have been deposited as carbonates in the Noachian and Hesperian. More carbonate deposition would be required if carbonate deposition only occurred in the Noachian or with low fractionation factors.",

However, the geometry and the processes of the Taiwan orogenic belt are still under debate. Here we present results of recent seismic activities that the current Taiwan orogenic belt shows the geometry of a doubly-vergent wedge. Numerical models with the doubly-vergent geometry also fit present-day surface velocities derived from geodetic observations. Thermochronology data can provide insights into long-term deformation history of the Central Range and Hsueshan Range.

            "abstract": "If science is for everyone, then it needs to be taught in environments that are welcoming to people who may not feel at home in a traditional classroom. A team of scientists and educators at the American Museum of Natural History have developed a new course, Our Earth’s Future, which prepares participants to contribute intelligently and fluently to informal “cocktail party” conversations about climate and climate change. The course, taught after hours at the museum, culminates in an actual cocktail party in one of the museum's halls where participants can practice their skills. Participants’ knowledge of climate change and attitudes towards climate change were quantitatively and qualitatively assessed before and after the two five-week course sessions.\nClimate literacy can also be included in existing events that are not obviously science-focused. Venues such as festivals, galleries, and underground art parties may be willing to broaden their definition of culture to include science - but only if they are asked. Given the increase in public discourse around the topic of climate change, there is an opportunity to reach people who wouldn’t attend a formal science lecture, but might attend a film screening or a fundraiser that had some scientific content. Qualitative audience assessments done after the annual “Mermaid Lagoon,” a fundraiser for ocean related causes that includes a scientific segment along with dance and theatrical performances, show increased enthusiasm and support for climate science when it is presented in a relevant, fun, and non-intimidating manner.",

            "abstract": "One way humans affect the Earth is by clearing lands and building cities, a process intricately coupled with population growth. The transformation of terrestrial environments by urbanization has been accelerating during the past 30 years. China, for instance, has experienced urbanization at an unprecedented rate, with the urban population increasing from ~20% to 50% between 1980 and 2010. This urban expansion has resulted in a range of environmental and socioeconomic consequences, such as released carbon, reduced habitats, and threatened biodiversity. Improved information on historical and future urbanization is essential to understand these environmental effects, and to promote a sustainable urbanization in China. Supported by urban maps derived from nightlights remote sensing data and socio-economic drivers, we developed an integrated modeling framework to project future urban expansion in China by integrating a top-down macro-scale statistical model with a bottom-up urban growth model (three examples in Figure 1). With the models calibrated and validated using historical data, we explored annual urban growth at the province level and urban sprawl at the grid level (1-km) over the next two decades under a number of socio-economic scenarios. The results of this study will be of great value with practical implications for a sustainable urbanization (e.g. mitigation of urban heat island).",

            "abstract": "One of the most important uncertainties in climate change is the positive feedback mechanism associated with the melting Arctic. As the Arctic permafrost destabilizes, labile carbon stored in the permafrost is subject to respiration and methanogenesis, producing greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4. Understanding the timing and rate of this release is paramount to our long-term understanding of the global climate structure, yet the remote location of the North Slope logistically precludes widespread tower measurements, necessitating airborne measurements. Presented are 12C and 13C CO2 concentration flux measurements taken via an aircraft at a height of 10-30m during mid to late August 2013 from the north slope of Alaska. The data show different regimes for CO2 vs δ-13C over regions within a roughly 100km box, indicating heterogenous landscape with differing dominant biological processes. The data are compared to CH4 measurements that were taken simultaneously, showing highly varying concentrations of CH4 with several different archetypical relationships to the total CO2 regimes. The relationship between CO2, δ-13C CO2, and CH4 concentrations provide further insight into the biological processes occurring in the melting Arctic permafrost. The data show that the dominant uptake and emission processes change by time of day and location. While the CO2 and isotopologue data alone indicates whether a region is dominant in respiration or photosynthesis, combining the data with CH4 measurements provides insight into the provenance of the CH4 as well as methanogenic biological pathways active on the North Slope, while mass balance between CH4, CO2 or δ-13C CO2 determines whether the methane signature is from methanogenesis, natural hydrocarbon seeps, or methane flaring. The data show few if any cases for which increases in methane concentrations are accompanied by a deviation in CO2 or δ-13C CO2 that would indicate incomplete methane flaring or natural seeps.",

            "abstract": "Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a method that allows researchers to map elevations, analyze surface deformation and even detect ground water level changes. The InSAR phase measurements are wrapped between 0 and 2π and therefore have to be unwrapped to reveal the full scale of the observations. Even though there are algorithms for finding discrete irrotational fields among neighboring pixels in two-dimensions, a three dimensional unwrapping approach is important as it can constrain the solution of our data to a more robust and accurate state. We developed a 3-D unwrapping algorithm based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that is capable of simultaneously filtering, unwrapping and inverting multiple interferograms to obtain a DEM or deformation map. The method is based on a path-following algorithm that unwraps the dataset starting from a reference point and moves to the next-highest quality neighboring point. The EKF algorithm allows us to better resolve unwrapping problems, especially in vegetated areas, which tend to be decorrelated, and hence obtain more accurate results.\nIn this study we apply our 3-D EKF unwrapping algorithm to North Anatolian and San Andreas fault zones in order to detect interseismic crustal movement across these two major fault systems. For the North Anatolian Fault we processed 37 Envisat scenes that covers the Ismetpasa segment of the fault, and generated 237 interferograms. The generated interferograms are used with both EKF and SBAS algorithms to estimate the deformation in the area. Our previous study of this segment based on the SBAS technique revealed that the Ismetpasa segment creeps at a rate of 8 mm/yr. For the San Andreas Fault (SAF) we processed 37 descending Envisat ASAR scenes acquired between November 2005 and October 2010. Our area of interest includes the central SAF near its intersection with the Garlock Fault. Initial results show deformation across the fault but the results have low fit to the data and further work is needed. In this presentation, we will also present the results from the SAF using SBAS and EKF.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenically forced projected changes in seasonal precipitation by the latter 21st century vary in magnitude and sign across the western US. Within a subregion, projections also vary widely among global climate models (GCMs), where only a fraction of this variability can be attributed to internal unforced variability. To aid in determining the cause(s) of this variability, we decompose CMIP5 projections of precipitation change (as change in latent heat release) into changes in short-wave and long radiative fluxes, sensible heat flux, air flux and stability (the latter two quantified in terms of the divergence of dry static energy, H). In both winter and summer, change in H is the primary control on the spatial pattern of precipitation change across the western US, though in summer the change in sensible heat flux modulates the pattern. Within the northwestern US, changes in H also explain most of the variability in precipitation changes among GCMs, again with sensible heat playing a secondary role in summer. Moreover, the dynamic component of the change in H, proxied by the change in 500hPa vertical velocity (omega, in units of pressure/time) appears to be a substantially larger control than the thermodynamic component of the change in H. These results imply that a GCM's ability to accurately reproduce regional wind patterns and regional convergence/divergence may be a useful metric for determining which GCMs are providing more plausible projections of regional precipitation change.",

A simulation using observed 1932-1938 sea surface temperature and sea ice distributions reveal drier and warmer conditions in the central U.S. Adding the influence of 1930s anthropogenic aerosols exacerbates the drying and warm conditions (0.2 °C increase over mid-west continental US, and a decrease of -0.1 mm/day of precipitation).

            "abstract": "The amount and timing of water release from snowpack sets the potential and pace for human and ecological systems residing in or near snowy topography. Warming will likely increase the snowline elevation and reduce the amount of the landscape that develops a significant snowpack. Because mountain catchments are topographically complex, understanding their sensitivity to warming and snowpack loss remains challenging. Previous research indicates that elevation is a dominant control on broad-scale snow accumulation. Thus, at the intermediate watershed scale (50 km2 < drainage area < 500 km2), a catchment’s elevation distribution should be a robust predictor of its susceptibility to snowpack loss. We present a simple framework that captures the climate and elevation-based sensitivity of mountain catchments to warming-driven snowpack loss. Framework development is based on the characterization of ~3,200 watershed elevation distributions in the northern Rocky Mountains, U.S. and is coupled with estimates of increase in snow water equivalent (SWE) with elevation for a variety of climatic types. Potential catchment-wide snowpack loss is modeled across a range of warming scenarios using a hypsometric approach and a sigmoidal function that can be easily adjusted to reflect warming-based alterations in how SWE increases with elevation. Monte Carlo simulations and regression analyses for 20,000 synthetic elevation distributions suggest that location, scale, and shape parameters that quantify distribution characteristics can be used to model SWE loss. Our model shows that similar amounts and patterns of SWE loss can occur even when catchments are centered in different elevation bands, suggesting that simple multi-parameter estimates of sensitivity may prove useful. We identify critical thresholds where different elevation distribution types exhibit unique responses to warming and discuss possible implications for mountain forests and carbon and nitrogen cycling.",

            "abstract": "The heartland of Russia has many enigmatic deep lakes. Shallow lakes have a more obvious origin, perhaps as kettle lakes, oxbow lakes or subsidence features. Deep lakes, particularly round lakes with partial or complete rims are more problematic. Traditionally, round or nearly round lakes with rims are candidates for Holocene age impact structures. The problem is that there are too many such lakes in the Russian heartland- a minimum of 15 deep, round lakes with diameters between 0.2 and 3 km. Even with a possibly increased impact rate during the Holocene, these deep lakes would represent the entire budget of Holocene impacts concentrated in one small region of the Earth. We examine here Lake Smerdyachie, a previously proposed impact lake. Smerdyachie is perfectly round with a raised rim. It has a diameter of about 350 meters and a maximum water depth of over 30 m. The basement at Smerdyachie is at~40 meters depth. It consists of Carboniferous age carbonate rock with fossils of brachiopods, crinoids and gastropods. The overlying material consists of unconsolidated, sand and silt-sized, quartz-rich sediments. We found clasts of brachiopod, crinoid and gastropod-bearing Carboniferous carbonate rock up to 32 cm in diameter on the SE rim of Smerdyachie. These clasts are present over about 1/3 of the total circumference of the lake. We also made panned concentrates of the sediment on the rim. To the NW, the concentrated sediment has a negative magnetic susceptibility (-0.07 to -0.03 cgs units), consistent with a higher concentration of pulverized limestone. To the SE, the sediment has a positive magnetic susceptibility (0.06 to 0.35 cgs units). The areas of positive magnetic susceptibility lie on the SE two-thirds of the rim of the lake. The highest susceptibility value is from the sample taken closest to the lake shoreline on the SE rim. This spatial distribution of susceptibility could mean that there is a higher concentration of iron rich material on the SE side of the lake. To test this hypothesis, we plan to remove the calcium carbonate from our previously measured samples and then to remeasure their magnetic susceptibility. We will then examine the material with the highest magnetic susceptibility for possible impactor fragments.",

This ULVZ was detected and characterized from Sdiff waveform observations from western Pacific earthquakes, at USArray stations and 3D forward modelling using the spectral element method. These waveforms, filtered in the 10-30 s range, showed the presence of a prominent postcursor, separated from the main phase by up to 50 s in certain azimuth ranges. Reproducing these post-cursors and their behavior in travel time and amplitude required an ULVZ with velocity reduction of ~20% in shear velocity and about 25 km in height above the core-mantle boundary (with some trade-offs). This ULVZ is below the detection of global tomographic approaches, although it is located at the base of the Hawaiian plume, as imaged in our recent mantle tomographic model (SEMUCB-wm1, French and Romanowicz, 2014, in revision).\nOn the other hand, the low shear velocity PERM anomaly at the base of the mantle (Lekic et al., 2012), which has a similar spatial extent, extends several hundred km into the mantle, with apparently a less reduced velocity contrast (about -7%) and it is detected in most global tomographic models.\nHere, we have assembled an augmented dataset of S and Sdiff phases illuminating both anomalies from different directions, and illustrate their contrasting and frequency dependent effects on waveforms, in order to better constrain the difference in the nature of the two velocity bodies.",

            "abstract": "Hypersaline laminated cyanobacterial mats are excellent model systems for investigating photoautotrophic contributions to biogeochemical cycling on a millimeter scale. These self-sustaining ecosystems are characterized by steep physiochemical gradients that fluctuate dramatically on hour timescales, providing a dynamic environment to study microbial response. However, elucidating the distribution of energy from light absorption into biomass requires a complete understanding of the various constituents of the mat. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which can be composed of proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and DNA are a major component of these mats and may function in the redistribution of nutrients and metabolites within the community. To test this notion, we established a model mat-building culture for comparison with the phylogenetically diverse natural mat communities. In these two systems we determined how proteins and glycans in the matrix changed as a function of light and tracked nutrient flow from the matrix. Using mass spectrometry metaproteomics analysis, we found homologous proteins in both field and culture extracellular matrix that point to cyanobacterial turnover of amino acids, inorganic nutrients, carbohydrates and nucleic acids from the EPS. Other abundant functions identified included oxidative stress response from both the cyanobacteria and heterotrophs and cyanobacterial structural proteins that may play a role in mat cohesion. Several degradative enzymes also varied in abundance in the EPS in response to light availability, suggesting active secretion. To further test cyanobacterial EPS turnover, we generated isotopically-labeled EPS and used NanoSIMS to trace uptake of this labeled EPS. Our findings suggest Cyanobacteria may facilitate nutrient transfer to other groups, as well as uptake of their own products through degradation of EPS components. This work provides evidence for the essential roles of EPS for storage, structural cohesion and protection, with active light-dependent turnover by both Cyanobacteria and the heterotrophic community.",

An extended series of coordinated airborne and ground-based measurements were recently conducted from New Zealand’s South Island to investigate gravity wave forcing during the winter months when strong North-Westerly winds are known to generate gravity waves capable of penetrating well into the stratosphere. As part of this collaborative effort the Atmospheric Imaging Lab at Utah State University (USU) deployed and operated an Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM) at the National Institute for Water and Atmosphere (NIWA) Lauder research station, NZ (45°S 169°E). In the lee of the Southern Alps, Lauder is well positioned for measuring a broad spectrum of gravity waves launched from south island orography and from other meteorological sources. The AMTM is uniquely capable of mapping the wave-induced temperature perturbations to investigate the two-dimensional gravity wave field with high temporal ( ̴10 sec) and high temperature precision ( ̴1-2 K in 30 sec). High-quality infrared image measurements of the OH (3,1) band emission layer (altitude ̴ 87 km) were made nightly from May 31 to July 22, 2014. The DEEPWAVE program has been a resounding success and over 42 nights of data were obtained at Lauder with distinct mesospheric mountain wave signatures recorded there in OH intensity, and in temperatures for the first time.

            "abstract": "In analyzing pumping tests on unconfined aquifers, the impact of the unsaturated zone is often neglected. Instead, desaturation at the water table is often treated as a free-surface boundary, which is simple and allows for relatively fast computation. Richards’ equation models, which account for unsaturated flow, can be compared with saturated flow models to validate the use of Darcy’s Law.\nIn this presentation, we examine the appropriateness of using fast linear steady-periodic models based on linearized water table conditions in order to simulate oscillatory pumping tests in phreatic aquifers. We compare oscillatory pumping test models including: 1) a 2-D radially-symmetric phreatic aquifer model with a partially penetrating well, simulated using both Darcy’s Law and Richards’ Equation in COMSOL; and 2) a linear phase-domain numerical model developed in MATLAB. Both COMSOL and MATLAB models are calibrated to match oscillatory pumping test data collected in the summer of 2013 at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS), and we examine the effect of model type on the associated parameter estimates. The results of this research will aid unconfined aquifer characterization efforts and help to constrain the impact of the simplifying physical assumptions often employed during test analysis.",

            "abstract": "Olivine crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) is the main cause for the seismic anisotropy observed in the upper mantle. Numerical models of texture evolution are frequently used to interpret seismic anisotropy or to predict the seismic anisotropy generated by a particular pattern of mantle flow. However, the relationship between mantle flow and seismic anisotropy is non-trivial in regions with complex deformation kinematics, for example along subduction-zones and mid-oceanic ridges. Here we examine the effect of deformation history on the process of texture and seismic anisotropy development from both experiments and numerical models.\nSamples from the Åheim dunite, which has a relatively strong pre-existing CPO, were deformed in axial compression using a Griggs apparatus at T = 1200°C, P ~1 GPa. Three different sample orientations were investigated, with the compression axis perpendicular, oblique, or parallel to the foliation plane. Olivine preferred orientation was determined by EBSD and quantified using three elements of texture: strength, symmetry, and orientation. We have found that that the evolution of olivine CPO depends strongly on the initial sample orientation. In addition, none of these experiments show the development of a clear steady-state texture and mechanical behavior.\nThe experimental results are compared to numerical models of texture development using the viscoplastic self consistent approach (VPSC). In these models we used the initial texture measured from the Åheim dunite rotated into three different orientations, to reproduce the starting conditions of the laboratory experiments. We find some similarities between the model and the experiments, although there are subtle and important differences. Future modeling work will attempt to define a set of parameters that allow numerical models of texture evolution to reproduce more precisely experimental results.",

            "abstract": "The AmeriFlux network collects long-term carbon, water and energy flux measurements obtained with the eddy covariance method. In order to attribute fluxes to specific areas of the land surface, flux source calculations are essential. Consequently, footprint models can support flux up-scaling exercises to larger regions, often based on remote sensing data. However, flux footprints are not currently being routinely calculated; different approaches exist but have not been standardized. In part, this is due to varying instrumentation and data processing methods at the site level. The goal of this work is to map tower footprints for a future standardized AmeriFlux product to be generated at the network level.\nThese footprints can be estimated by analytical models, Lagrangian simulations, and large-eddy simulations. However, for many sites, the datasets currently submitted to central databases generally do not include all variables required. The AmeriFlux network is moving to collection of raw data and expansion of the variables requested from sites, giving the possibility to calculate all parameters and variables needed to run most of the available footprint models. In this pilot study, we are applying state of the art footprint models across a subset of AmeriFlux sites, to evaluate the feasibility and merit of developing standardized footprint results.\nIn addition to comparing outcomes from several footprint models, we will attempt to verify and validate the results in two ways: (i) Verification of our footprint calculations at sites where footprints have been experimentally estimated. (ii) Validation at towers situated in heterogeneous landscapes: here, variations in the observed fluxes are expected to correlate with spatiotemporal variations of the source area composition. Once implemented, the footprint results can be used as additional information within the AmeriFlux database that can support data interpretation and data assimilation. Lastly, we will explore the expandability of this approach to other flux networks by collaborating with and including sites from the ICOS and NEON networks in our analyses. This can enable utilizing the footprint model output to improve network interoperability, thus further promoting synthesis analyses and understanding of system-level questions in the future.",

            "abstract": "Integrated assessment models project the future electricity generation mix under different policy, technology, and socioeconomic scenarios, but they do not directly address site-specific factors such as interconnection costs, population density, land use restrictions, air quality, NIMBY concerns, or water availability that might affect the feasibility of achieving the technology mix. Moreover, since these factors can change over time due to climate, policy, socioeconomics, and so on, it is important to examine the dynamic feasibility of integrated assessment scenarios “on the ground.” This paper explores insights from coupling an integrated assessment model (GCAM-USA) with a geospatial power plant siting model (the Capacity Expansion Regional Feasibility model, CERF) within a larger multi-model framework that includes regional climate, hydrologic, and water management modeling. GCAM-USA is a dynamic-recursive market equilibrium model simulating the impact of carbon policies on global and national markets for energy commodities and other goods; one of its outputs is the electricity generation mix and expansion at the state-level. It also simulates water demands from all sectors that are downscaled as input to the water management modeling. CERF simulates siting decisions by dynamically representing suitable areas for different generation technologies with geospatial analyses (informed by technology-specific siting criteria, such as required mean streamflow per the Clean Water Act), and then choosing siting locations to minimize interconnection costs (to electric transmission and gas pipelines). CERF results are compared across three scenarios simulated by GCAM-USA: 1) a non-mitigation scenario (RCP8.5) in which conventional fossil-fueled technologies prevail, 2) a mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) in which the carbon price causes a shift toward nuclear, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), and renewables, and 3) a repeat of scenario (2) in which CCS technologies are made unavailable—resulting in a large increase in the nuclear fraction of the mix.",

            "abstract": "The outer part of Saturn's A ring contains five sharp edges: the inner and outer edges of the Encke Gap and of the Keeler Gap (which contain the moons Pan and Daphnis, respectively), and the outer edge of the A ring itself. Four of these five edges are characterized by structure at moderate to high spatial frequencies, with amplitudes ranging from 2 to 30 km (Tiscareno et al. 2005, DPS). Only the outer edge of the Keeler Gap is reasonably smooth in appearance (Tiscareno et al. 2005, DPS), with occultations indicating residuals less than 1 km upon a possibly non-zero eccentricity (R.G. French, personal communication, 2014).\nSuperposed upon the relatively smooth outer edge of the Keeler Gap are a system of \"wisps,\" which appear to be ring material protruding inward into the gap, usually with a sharp trailing edge and a smooth gradation back to the background edge location on the leading side (Porco et al. 2005, Science). The radial amplitude of wisps is usually 0.5 to 1 km, and their azimuthal extent is approximately a degree of longitude (~2400 km). Wisps are likely caused by an interplay between Daphnis (and perhaps other moons) and embedded moonlets within the ring, though the details remain unclear.\nWe will present a catalogue of wisp detections in Cassini images. We carry out repeated gaussian fits of the radial edge location in order to characterize edge structure (see Figure, which compares our fitted edge to the figure presented by Porco et al. 2005) and visually scan those fitted edges in order to detect wisps. With extensive coverage in longitude and in time, we will report on how wisps evolve and move, both within an orbit period and on longer timescales. We will also report on the frequency and interpretation of wisps that deviate from the standard morphology. We will discuss the implications of our results for the origin and nature of wisps, and for the larger picture of how masses interact within Saturn's rings.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric chemistry models must include a large number of processes to accurately describe the temporal and spatial behavior of atmospheric composition. They require a wide range of chemical and physical data (parameters) that describe elementary gas-phase and heterogeneous processes. The review and evaluation of chemical and physical data has, therefore, played an important role in the development of chemical models and in their use in environmental assessment activities. The NASA data panel was originally established in 1977 by the NASA Upper Atmosphere Research Program Office to provide a critical evaluation of kinetic and photochemical data for use in laboratory studies and in atmospheric modeling of stratospheric ozone. Today, the NASA data panel evaluations have a broader atmospheric focus and include Ox, O(1D), singlet O2, HOx, NOx, Organic, FOx, ClOx, BrOx, IOx, SOx, and Na reactions, three-body reactions, equilibrium constants, photochemistry, aqueous chemistry, heterogeneous chemistry and processes, and thermodynamic parameters. The 2011 evaluation (JPL 10-6 available at\nhttp://jpldataeval.jpl.nasa.gov.\n) includes the comprehensive coverage of ~670 bimolecular reactions, 75 three-body reactions, 24 equilibrium constants, 215 photochemical species, 355 aqueous and heterogeneous processes, thermodynamic parameters for 590 species, and over 4000 literature citations. Each evaluation includes (1) recommended values (e.g. rate coefficients, absorption cross sections, and uptake coefficients) with estimated uncertainty factors and (2) a note describing the available experimental and theoretical data and explanation for the recommendation. As new studies have become available over the years the recommendations are critically reviewed and updated as warranted (the next evaluation is scheduled for release in early 2015).\nThis presentation provides an overview of the NASA data panel evaluation process and the methodology used to estimate uncertainties. Examples on the current use of a 2-D model to help set evaluation priorities will be illustrated. Evaluation users are encouraged to discuss/suggest potential improvements in analysis and the communication of the evaluation results to the modeling community.",

            "abstract": "In late August of 2012 Voyager 1 evidently crossed the heliopause at 121.6 AU near the nose of the heliosphere and entered the local interstellar medium (LISM). Since that time Voyager 1 has been in a relatively stable, but not steady-state region. Low-energy ion and electron intensities measured by the LECP instrument on Voyager 1 continue to be down by factors of 103 to 104 for major ion species compared to those in the heliosheath, with no evidence of anomalous cosmic rays upstream. The anisotropy of galactic cosmic ray protons >211 MeV, which reached a maximum ≈9% in April 2013, persisted for about one year after Voyager 1 entered the LISM, suggesting a transition region upstream of the heliopause of ≈4 AU. However, the increase in anisotropy has resumed, suggesting that influence of the heliosphere persists to distances ≈7 AU. In addition, small (≈1%) increases in the angular-averaged GCR proton intensities, the most recent occurring in mid-April of 2014 (at 127.5 AU), have been attributed to large disturbances due to solar activity and are also associated with activity in the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave instrument [Gurnett et al. 2014, this session]. Voyager 2 is now at 106 AU and still firmly in the heliosheath, with the lower-energy ion intensities having increased by a factor ≈3 since reaching a minimum in early 2013. Although the intensities of low-energy heliosheath ions and electrons continue to increase, they remain variable on short time scales. The spectral hardening of low-energy ions observed at Voyager 1 beginning about ≈1.5 years before its crossing of the heliopause is totally absent at Voyager 2. Hence, it appears highly unlikely that Voyager 2 is approaching the heliopause in the near future.",

            "abstract": "Spacecraft observations in the magnetotail show that O+ ions can dominate the pressure and density during storm-time substorms. In this study, we use a 2D version of an implicit Particle-in-Cell simulation (iPIC3D) in the presence of H+ and O+ ions to investigate O+ heating and bulk acceleration processes during collisionless reconnection. In the simulations, a 2D Harris current sheet without a guide field is used for the initial condition. Open boundary conditions are used. Considering O+/H+ = 1:1, we compare the diffusion regions for H+ and O+ and analyze the energy gains of O+ at different locations with respect to the inflow and outflow boundaries, the X-point, the separatrices and dipolarization fronts (DFs). We also calculate the field energy variation and O+ velocity distribution functions at these locations to investigate the heating and acceleration process. The results show that the diffusion regions are not limited near the X-point, but also extend along the separatrices up to 10s of dH (H+ inertial length) away from the X-point. The proton diffusion region along a separatrix is about ~24 dH and that of oxygen is about ~40 dH. Strongly positive J·E is shown near the DF for both species, while there is a weakly negative J·E at the slightly upstream of DF for protons, which does not appear for oxygen. Proton heating is mainly near the X-point and downstream of the separatrices, while oxygen heating extends into the inflow and outflow regions near the X-point and concentrates in the region slightly upstream of the DF. The study of the ion acceleration by reconnection is one of the scientific objectives of the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) onboard the upcoming Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission and these results are directly related to the expected observations by MMS.",

            "abstract": "Increasing surface melting on the Greenland ice sheet and rising sea level have heightened the need for understanding the complex pathways transporting meltwater from the ice sheet surface to the ice edge and the ocean. Satellite images show supraglacial rivers abundantly covering the western ablation zone throughout the melt season, transporting large volumes of meltwater into moulins and to the ice edge, yet these rivers remain poorly studied. Here, a GIS modeling framework is developed to estimate supraglacial river discharge by spatially adapting Manning’s equation for use with remotely sensed imagery and is applied to supraglacial rivers on the Greenland Ice Sheet. This framework incorporates high-resolution visible/near-infrared WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite imagery, the Greenland Ice Mapping Project (GIMP) DEM, and a field-calibrated WV2 river bathymetry retrieval algorithm and channel roughness parameter. Orthogonal cross-sections are simulated along river centerlines to extract cross-sectional discharge using Manning’s equation for open channel flow. A total of 1,629,502 reach-averaged points were retrieved over 465 river networks of western Greenland in 2012, including attributes of width, depth, velocity, slope, wetted perimeter, hydraulic radius, and discharge. This work provides a method for producing spatially extensive, high-resolution estimates of supraglacial meltwater flux in river networks and into the ice sheet.",

            "abstract": "Data collected by in situ subglacial probes has been used to guide a series of geotechnical tests on till. The testing provides an opportunity to develop a process-based understanding of movement patterns observed in the subglacial environment. The probes were deployed by the \nGlacsweb\n project at Skalafellsjökull, Iceland, in 2008 and 2012. They were emplaced in till below 80 m of ice and recorded a number of variables including pore pressure, case stress, movement and conductivity. During the winter of 2008-2009 cyclic pressure changes were recorded in the till. Repeated pore pressure increases of up to 20% occurred over a variable period of one to eight weeks. Each rise was followed by a sharp drop in pore pressure lasting up to a few days.\nA back pressure shear box was used to replicate the pore pressure changes whilst maintaining a constant horizontal shear stress and normal total stress to examine effects on deformation and strain rate. Till was collected for testing from the ice margin close to the probes in 2012 and remoulded for use in the back pressure shear box. General characterisation of the till was performed to benchmark it against previous work and then a series of pore pressure re-inflation tests were undertaken. These approximated the pore pressure variations observed in the field by linearly increasing pore pressure and so decreasing normal effective stress. The till displayed dilatancy-induced episodic increases in strain rate. These were regulated by consolidation that increased shear strength and so reduced strain rate. Strain rate variations were similar to ice velocity variations recorded by differential GPS deployed on the ice surface above the probes.",

            "abstract": "Since the late 1960s, temperature profile data have been collected every 10-12 days at Lake Tahoe, USA. Past analyses have shown an overall warming of the lake at all depths, attributable to measured climate warming. The annual average, volume-weighted lake water temperature of the upper 400 m has increased at a rate of 0.011 deg. C/year since 1969 – 2014. There has been a concurrent evolution in the nature of the thermal stratification. While the maximum value of lake stability has not increased in the last 45 years, the length of time the lake remains stratified has been increased by 22 days, mostly occurring as a result of an earlier onset of spring stratification Using statistically downscaled GCM outputs for two different carbon emission scenarios, 1-D numerical simulations of the lake thermal structure over a 100-year period were performed. The results suggest a continuation and intensification of the already observed trends. Depending on the carbon emission scenario assumed, the length of the stratified season will increase by between 65 and 52 days by 2098 over the 1968 value. Most of the future increase will take place at the end of the season with a delay in the onset of winter. The observed impacts of stratification change on past ecosystem and water quality conditions will be presented, and possible future changes will be discussed. Plausible future states could range from climatic eutrophication to climatic oligotrophication.",

            "abstract": "Pulse-decay permeability measurements on a Marcellus shale sample at a constant differential pressure of 12.4 MPa [1800 psi] demonstrate minor hysteresis in permeability behavior. Permeability measured at the same confining and pore pressure conditions over 90 days do not decline significantly suggesting that creep also plays a minor role. The sample has ~3% porosity. Permeability measurements were made in two repeated cycles. In each cycle, the sample is first held at a high confining and pore pressure—27.6 MPa [4000 psi] and 15.2 MPa [2200 psi], respectively—where we complete multiple permeability tests to analyze creep behavior. We then incrementally decrease confining and pore pressure to 13.8 MPa [2000 psi] and 1.4 MPa [200 psi], respectively, while completing three to five permeability tests prior to reaching the final pressure. During the first creep stage, the permeability decreases from 4.7×10-21 m2 [4.7 nd] to 4.2×10-21 m2 [4.2 nd] over a two week period while during the second creep stage permeability remains constant at ~3.4×10-21 m2 [3.4 nd]. We observe hysteresis in permeability values between the two cycles. The permeability decreases from 13.2×10-21 m2 [13.2 nd] to 8.7×10-21 m2 [8.7 nd] during the first cycle at the lowest confining and pore pressure condition, but decreases only marginally to 7.7×10-21 m2 [7.7 nd] at the end of the second cycle. A better understanding of how permeability changes as stress evolves may illuminate production behavior of these gas shales.",

Because participants make the voicemails themselves, FutureCoast opens up creative ways for people to think about possibly climate-changed futures and personal ways to talk about them. FutureCoast is a project of the\nPoLAR Partnership\nwith a target audience of informal adult learners primarily reached via mobile devices and online platforms.\nScientists increasingly use scenarios and storylines as ways to explore the implications of environmental change and societal choices. Stories help people make connections across experiences and disciplines and link large-scale events to personal consequences. By making the future seem real today, FutureCoast’s framework helps people visualize and plan for future climate changes.\nThe voicemails contributed to FutureCoast are spread through the game’s intended timeframe (2020 through 2065). Based on initial content analysis of voicemail text, common themes include ecosystems and landscapes, weather, technology, societal issues, governance and policy. Other issues somewhat less frequently discussed include security, food, industry and business, health, energy, infrastructure, water, economy, and migration. Further voicemail analysis is examining: temporal dimensions (salient time frames, short vs. long term issues, intergenerational, etc.), content (adaptation vs. mitigation, challenges vs. opportunities, etc.), and emotion (hopeful, resigned, etc. and overall emotional context).\nFutureCoast also engaged audiences through facilitated in-person experiences, geocaching events, and social media (Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube). Analysis of the project suggests story-based games such as FutureCoast can serve as effective, accessible tools for engaging diverse audiences in thinking and talking about future “what if?” scenarios related to climate change and its impacts.",

Newly developed algorithms will be applied to mature ESDRs of Chlorophyll a and SST available from NASA, to generate maps of SSN and NnP. Our proposed ESDRs offer the potential of greatly improving our understanding of the role of the oceans in global carbon cycling, earth system processes and climate change, especially for regions and seasons which are inaccessible to traditional shipboard studies. They also provide an innovative means for validating and improving coupled ecosystem models that currently rely on global maps of nitrate generated from multi-year data sets. To aid in our algorithm development efforts and to ensure that our ESDRs are truly global in nature, we are currently in the process of assembling a large database of nutrients from oceanographic institutions all over the world. Once our products are developed and our algorithms are fine-tuned, large-scale data production will be undertaken in collaboration with NASA's Ocean Biology Processing Group (OPBG), who will make the data publicly available first as evaluation products and then as mature ESDRs.",

            "abstract": "Characterization of COHN species in silicate melts [1-10] is required to understand the role of reduced volatiles in planetary and early Earth processes, including partitioning between planetary cores, mantles, and atmospheres during early differentiation. Vibrational spectroscopy has been used to examine volatile speciation, but for a number of absorptions there is uncertainty as to whether they relate to species containing N, C, or both [1,3]. In particular, an IR band at 3370 cm-1 is commonly attributed to N-H stretching [1,4,5,7], but associated Raman bands near 3280 cm-1 have also been attributed to alkyne (C-H) bonds [8-10]. The 3370 cm-1 IR band appears even in nominally N-free experiments owing to trapped air and is accompanied by a feature at 1615 cm-1 which could be caused by C=O or N-H bonds [1,3,8]. We sought to determine whether N and C were responsible for various IR bands by dissolving different isotopes of N and C in basaltic melts at high pressure and temperature and observing the shift in position of the resulting absorptions. Experiments were conducted at 1.2 GPa and 1400 oC and volatiles were added to a basaltic oxide mix in the form of unlabeled, 13C labeled, and 15N labeled urea [(NH2)2CO]. The resulting glasses were analyzed using FTIR and the theoretical band shifts were predicted based on a classical approximation of a diatomic molecule. Relative to isotopically normal glasses, bands at both 3370 cm-1 and 1615 cm-1 decrease by 4-8 wavenumbers for 15N and not at all for 13C, consistent with origination by N-H bonds in amines or metal-ammine complexes.

Whole air samples were collected at three different sites during the study period for volatile organic compound (VOC) measurements. The main sampling location was the north unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park (THRO), where one daytime and one nighttime sample were collected each day throughout the campaign period. Daytime samples were also collected every second day at the Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site (FOUS) and once a week at the Medicine Lake National Wildlife Refuge, MT. A signature of elevated nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) mixing ratios was observed throughout the campaign at all three sites; THRO and FOUS had the highest levels as they are located in high well density areas. Moreover, the C2-C5 alkane mixing ratios were approximately an order of magnitude greater than regional background levels. Light alkane mixing ratios at THRO, the most impacted site, were similar to those at urban sites influenced by petrochemical industry emissions, with ethane and propane reaching maximums of 95 ppbv and 164 ppbv, respectively. The i-pentane to n-pentane ratio for all sites was ~0.75, clearly demonstrating the widespread impact from oil and gas production emissions throughout the region. Alkanes dominated the hydroxyl radical reactivity, and their overall influence on regional air quality will be explored.",

            "abstract": "In order for Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) to gain wide acceptance as a method for mitigating atmospheric CO2 concentrations, schemes must be devised to ensure that potential leakage is detected. New regulations from the US Environmental Protection Agency require monitoring and accounting for Class VI injection wells, which will remain a barrier to wide scale CCUS deployment until effective and efficient monitoring techniques have been developed and proven. Monitoring near-surface CO2 at injection sites to ensure safety and operational success requires high temporal resolution CO2 concentration and carbon isotopic (δ13C) measurements. The only technologies currently capable of this rapid measurement of δ13C are optical techniques such as Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy (CRDS). We have developed a comprehensive remote monitoring approach using CRDS and a custom manifold system to obtain accurate rapid measurements from a large sample area over an extended study period. Our modified Picarro G1101-i CRDS allows for automated rapid and continuous field measurement of δ13CO2 and concentrations of relevant gas species. At our field site, where preparations have been underway for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) operations, we have been able to measure biogenic effects on a diurnal scale, as well as variation due to precipitation and seasonality. Taking these background trends into account, our statistical treatment of real data has been used to improve signal‑to‑noise ratios by an order of magnitude over published models. Our system has proven field readiness for the monitoring of sites with even modest CO2 fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Dispersion simulations were conducted for the Atmospheric Studies in Complex Terrain (ASCOT) experiment using the newly developed inline model framework in which HYSPLIT, a Lagrangian dispersion model, was coupled (inline) to the WRF-ARW meteorological model. ASCOT comprised a series of field tracer experiments designed to study transport and dispersion of pollutant associated with nocturnal drainage flows in mid-September of 1980. A perfluorcarbon tracer was released for 1 hour at the Anderson Creek valley in northern California and more than 50 sampling sites were placed in an area of 10 by 10 km southeast from the release site. The dispersion calculation was run inline the WRF-ARW calculation taking advantage of the fine spatial scale (333.3 m for horizontal grid and ~14 m thickness for the 1st model layer) and the higher temporal frequency (in second interval) of the meteorological variables, as well as using the same vertical coordinate as the meteorological model. The results were evaluated by comparing inline and offline model simulations with measured tracer concentrations from the controlled tracer experiments. The rank, a cumulative statistical score, of the inline dispersion simulations was better than offline runs in four out of five releases during the ASCOT campaign. The inline version showed better spatial coverage of the plumes but a larger difference between the cumulative concentration distributions than the offline approach. The inline coupling system is especially beneficial for this type of application because the drainage flow occurred over an area of complex terrain area, over a short time period (less than 10 hours), and in fine spatial resolution, which required a very detailed depiction of changes in the wind vectors and mixing parameters to accurately model the tracer’s transport and dispersion. The improvement of the inline calculation is attributed to the elimination of temporal and vertical interpolation of the meteorological data when compared to the offline version.",

            "abstract": "Ongoing climate warming has the potential to affect terrestrial ecosystems and the services they provide to local and regional communities, particularly in high latitude regions. Rising temperatures have increased permafrost vulnerability to thawing. In boreal region, ice-rich permafrost degradation may result in the subsidence of the ground surface and the transition from permafrost plateau forest to wetland ecosystems, with dramatic changes in ecosystem structure and function, e.g. vegetation composition, energy balance, and carbon and nutrient cycles. However, this disturbance is poorly represented in existing ecosystem models. A state-and-transition model, the Alaska Thermokarst Model (ATM), is being developed to predict thermokarst initiation and expansion and to keep track of the associated vegetation transitions in boreal and arctic regions. The drivers of these transitions in the boreal region are highly related to climate, topography, fire disturbance and forest fragmentation. In this study, we applied the ATM in a large wetland complex in Interior Alaska (the Tanana Flats) to predict changes in land cover associated to thermokarst from 2009 to 2100. Preliminary simulations over a 10 km x 10 km area of the Tanana Flats suggests that permafrost plateau forests will decrease by 34.9% and collapse scar fens and bogs will increase by 88.3% in this region. After further testing and refinement of the ATM, a next step will be to couple the ATM with a process-based ecosystem model to evaluate the effects of thermokarst dynamics on carbon dynamics.",

Methodologies based on Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) have been developed capable of delivering δ13C measurements with a precision greater than 0.12 permil for CO2 and 0.4 permil for CH4 (1 hour window, 5 minute average). Here we present a method to further improve this measurement’s stability. We have developed a two point calibration method which corrects for δ13C drift due to a dependance on carbon species concentration. This method calibrates for both carbon species concentration as well as δ13C. We go on to show that this added stability is especially valuable when using carbon isotope data in linear regression models such as Keeling plots, where even small amounts of error can be magnified to give inconclusive results. This method is demonstrated in both laboratory and ambient atmospheric conditions, and we demonstrate how to select the calibration frequency. ",

            "abstract": "Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of natural sources and sinks and anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are crucial to predict climate change and develop transparent accounting policies to contain climate forcing. Remote sensing technologies are beginning to monitor CO2 and CH4 from ground and space (OCO-2 and GOSAT) with solar spectroscopy enabling direct MRV. However, current ground based coverage is sparse due to the need for large and expensive high-resolution spectrometers that are part of the Total Column Carbon Observing Network (TCCON, Bruker 125HR). This limits our MRV and satellite validation abilities, both regionally and globally. There are striking monitoring gaps in Asia, South America and Africa where the CO2 emissions are growing and there is a large uncertainty in fluxes from land use change, biomass burning and rainforest vulnerability. To fill this gap we evaluate the precision, accuracy and stability of our new compact, affordable and easy to use low-resolution spectrometer (Bruker EM27SUN) by comparing it with the much larger high-resolution TCCON instruments for column CO2, CH4, H2O and HOD. Results from Four Corners, Los Alamos, Caltech and Dryden-Armstrong sites show that our EM27SUN captures the variability of the aforementioned constituents very well, but has low and high offsets for CO2 and CH4, respectively. These off-the-shelf spectrometers should dramatically expand the coverage of regional column CO2 and CH4 observations, particularly in gap regions that include the rainforest. We will present opportunities that we are exploring to help enable transparent and reliable MRV and measurement of the coupled water-carbon cycle in tropical ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate that the high-frequency acceleration spectral level ao of an ω-square source spectrum is directly proportional to the average slip of the earthquake ∆u divided by the travel time to the station r/β\nao = 1.37 Fs (β/r) ∆u\nand multiplied by the radiation pattern Fs. This simple relation is robust but depends implicitly on the assumed relation between the corner frequency and source radius, which we take from the Brune (1970, JGR) model.\nWe use this relation to estimate average slip by fitting spectral ratios with smaller earthquakes as empirical Green’s functions. For a pair of Mw = 1.8 and 1.2 earthquakes in Parkfield, we fit the spectral ratios published by Nadeau et al. (1994, BSSA) to obtain 0.39 and 0.10 cm. For the Mw= 3.9 earthquake that occurred on Oct 29, 2012, at the Pinnacles, we fit spectral ratios formed with respect to an Md = 2.4 aftershock to obtain 4.4 cm. Using the Sato and Hirasawa (1973, JPE) model instead of the Brune model increases the estimates of average slip by 75%.\nThese estimates of average slip are factors of 5-40 (or 3-23) times less than the average slips of 3.89 cm and 23.3 cm estimated by Nadeau and Johnson (1998, BSSA) from the slip rates, average seismic moments and recurrence intervals for the two sequences to which they associate these earthquakes. The most reasonable explanation for this discrepancy is that the stress release and rupture processes of these earthquakes is strongly heterogeneous. However, the fits to the spectral ratios do not indicate that the spectral shapes are distorted in the first two octaves above the corner frequency.",

            "abstract": "Accurately quantifying precipitation in both space and time is a central challenge in hydrologic modelling. Data products from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) are commonly used as precipitation forcings in many models. TRMM provides 3-hr precipitation estimates at a near-global scale (-50◦ S to 50◦N) with a 0.25 degree spatial resolution. However, when applied in regional scale hydrologic models, the spatial resolution of the TRMM is often too coarse limiting our ability to simulate relevant hydrologic processes.This study focuses on addressing the science question: can we improve the spatial resolution of the TRMM using statistical downscaling with environmental variables derived from finer scale remote sensing data? The goal is to downscale the TRMM resolution from 0.25 degrees (25 km) to 0.05 degrees (about 5 km). In our approach, we first identify environmental variables (i.e., vegetation cover, topography, and temperature) that are related to the formation of or result from precipitation by exploring their statistical relationships with TRMM precipitation at varying temporal scales (i.e., daily, monthly, and yearly) using an analysis of variance in multiple regression. The MODIS vegetation index, MODIS leaf area index, and SPOT vegetation are examined as a proxy for vegetation. To represent the topography, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) is used. MODIS land surface temperature are used for temperature. Second, we characterize a residual component, which cannot be explained by the statistical relationship between precipitation and environmental variables, to improve the accuracy of the downscaling results. For example, recent studies have shown that approximately 30-40% of the variability in annual precipitation cannot be explained by vegetation and elevation characteristics. According for this unexplained variability in statistical downscaling methods is a significant challenge. Here, we use a data assimilation technique to interpolate the residual component and generate the downscaled precipitation. Results are presented for the Ohio River Basin. The final downscaled TRMM is evaluated by comparing with the National Center for Environmental Predication (NCEP) Stage VI precipitation and rainfall gauge data.",

Calculations of the energy loss due to vortex shedding and the pneumatic extraction efficiency of the OWC chamber are two challenging issues. Direct measurement of the energy loss due to vortex shedding is difficult. The pneumatic extraction efficiency is often calculated by using a one-point measurement method, in which one pressure senor is used to measure the air pressure variation and one wave gauge is used to measure the instantaneous surface displacement inside the OWC chamber. This method is simple, but a systematic error may be introduced, especially for shorter waves. Based on our recent laboratory and theoretical studies of a pile-supported OWC device, we present a method for estimating the energy loss due to vortex shedding and improving the accuracy in the calculation of pneumatic extraction efficiency using one-point method. The method in this study is designed for an OWC device whose chamber has a circular cross section, but can be extended to other cases where development of an analytical theory is possible.",

The generation mechanism of magnetic holes has been investigated and multiple theories have been proposed. There are two popular theories: magnetic holes are the product of the mirror instability (Southwood and Kivelson 1993) or the product of the shear instability in the tail of the magnetosphere (Balikhin et al 2012). These theories are contingent on instabilities on the MHD scale. This study investigates THEMIS electric field and electron temperature observations of small magnetic holes in the bursty bulk flow region. An analysis of these observations indicate that smaller magnetic holes ( < ion Larmor radius) require a physical mechanism on the kinetic scale. We propose that these particular holes are maintained by a current carried by electrons, which are in turn generated by a self –consistent potential drop within the magnetic hole.",

Little is known about the impacts that the seasonality of precipitation have had on fire and vegetation throughout the region, especially extending into the early Holocene and Pleistocene. Fire regimes and ciénega processes, as indicate by loss on ignition, magnetic susceptibility, and charcoal data, appear to be controlled by the amount of precipitation to the region and groundwater levels. This study will analyze seasonality of precipitation based on certain taxa that are associated with summer wet or winter wet moisture patterns. Preliminary pollen analysis shows that when summer-wet taxa are more prevalent on the landscape, winter-wet taxa declines. Based on existing ENSO and NAM data, we know that the influences of both phenomena have changed in their intensities and spatial boundaries throughout time. Our study sites (Ciénega Chimeneas, 32o 14’ N and 116 o 06’ W, and Ciénega San Faustino, 32° 12’ 30.4” N 116° 09’ 55” W, spanning the last ~45,000 cal yrs BP) are located in a region that can help define when and where changes in the seasonality of precipitation have occurred since the late Pleistocene.

            "abstract": "In order to identify the glacial–interglacial changes in South Atlantic as cause of variation in oceanic denitrification and its response of nutrients transport towards the low latitudes, we used stable isotopes (δ13C and δ18O) of benthic and planktonic foraminifera and organic geochemistry (δ13Corg, δ15N, Corg and Norg) in a sediment core located on the continental slope off Northeast Brazil. Here we show that during the LGM occurred a reduction on denitrification rates (decrease on the δ15N signal) due the reduction in nutrients influx, which can be seen though the high benthic δ13C values. This might be related to a higher intake of nutrients in high latitude south that reduce the nutrient input into the thermocline toward lower latitudes. The interglacial period showed an opposite trend, with an increase in δ15N signal and a decrease in surface to deep gradient (Δδ13C), promoting an increased of oceanic ventilation and nutrient flux in the lower latitudes. However, the cold substages (H1 and YD) showed a drastic decrease in the denitrification rate as a result of Atlantic Overturning Circulation collapse and an increase of terrigenous input (high C/N and Corg values and low δ13Corg signal) as a consequence of the southward displacement of Intertropical Convergence Zone, which promoted an increase in the moisture at Northeast Brazil. Thus, we argue that the high latitude south have a large influence in nutrient influx within the thermocline toward the low latitudes and these variations could be associate with the ocean ventilation and terrigenous input during climate changes.",

            "abstract": "Land cover changes associated with both human activities and global change processes (such as drought, fire and invasive species) can lead to changes in byophisical processes that support hydrological processes in watersheds, leading to potential changes in longterm streamflow regimes. Traditional hydrological approaches have successfully associated stremaflow regimes to watershed physical attributes such as area via hydrological scaling. Yet, such approaches preclude the incorporation of biophysical processes, such as land cover changes, into the statistics of streamflow and scaling approaches. In this work, we test the hypothesis that mean and extreme riverflows in a watershed should scale not only with surface area, but also with leaf area. To test this hypothesis, we use a dataset consisiting of daily stremflow observations for 87 sub-basins of the Amazon basin, covering a range of watershed sizes from 1,617 km2 to 4,680,000 km2. We developed scaling relations of the type E[Qr]= aAb or E[Qr]= c(LA)d between the order r statistical moments of the probability distribution functions of mean and extreme riverflows (E[Qr]) and both the watershed area (A) and the leaf area (LA) - which we define as ecohydrological scaling. Our results show that our proposed ecohydrological scaling represents the statistics of streamflow as well as traditional hydrological scaling relationships. However, ecohydrological scaling allows the assessment of the effects of land use-land cover changes on hydrological regimes. We used previously developed scenarios of Amazon deforestation to assess these effects and found maximum reductions of the order of 35% in the longterm mean and extreme riverflows as a result of deforestation. The approach that we propose uses the simplicity of hydrological scaling and improves it by incorporating ecohydrological processes into physical scaling. We illustrate its potential by applying it to future vegetation cover scenarios but highlight how, when combined with more sophisticated ecosystem and atmospheric models, ecohydrological scaling can become a powerful predictive tool. In summary, we present a new, ecohydrological scaling approach that combines biological and hydrological scaling approaches to assess the regional effects of global-change type processes.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is especially pronounced in the Arctic, and regions on permafrost are at the frontier of these changes. Increasing air temperatures affect the extent, type, and characteristics of permafrost which is critical to many natural phenomena and northern infrastructure. In areas of discontinuous permafrost certain land cover types are indicative of permafrost conditions making satellite imagery an important tool for assessing environmental change in these remote areas. In arctic environments remote sensing can be particularly challenging due to consistently high cloud cover, data gaps, and landscape heterogeneity. However, there has been success at dealing with such challenges in lower latitude regions using the emerging dense time stack methodology. In place of using an anniversary date for land cover comparisons from different years, this methodology includes scenes from all seasons in addition to imagery normally rejected due to data gaps and high amounts of cloud cover. The incorporation of all available data creates a “dense time stack” which provides both a more complete dataset and more nuanced spectral signatures for classification. This work applied the dense time stack method to mapping five drainage basins in the close vicinity of the city of Igarka, Russia using both Landsat and Quickbird satellite imagery. The resulting map series proved this method to be effective within the Arctic for multiscalar mapping both temporally (annual and seasonal) and spatially (at the resolutions of Landsat and Quickbird). The time series of observed land cover changes produced allowed areas of permafrost degradation to be identified. These maps will be applied in the future to ongoing hydrological research in the region investigating the sources of increased run off and its relation to permafrost degradation.",

            "abstract": "High latitude methane fluxes represent between 5 – 20% of the total methane budget. This large range in methane emissions estimates are due to poor knowledge of wetland extent, dependency of emissions to temperature and water, the seasonal cycle of freezing and thawing, and a poor measurement network. In turn, these uncertainties limit our ability to predict future methane fluxes in response to a warming climate. Temperature and rainfall at high-latitudes changed dramatically between 2009 and 2010, likely in response to variations in ENSO and the Arctic Anomaly. We might therefore expect that high-latitude methane fluxes significantly changed between 2009 and 2010 because these methane fluxes primarily depend on these environmental parameters. In this study, we implement several wetland models and their corresponding methane fluxes for 2009 and 2010 into the GEOS-Chem global chemistry model. We evaluate whether satellite measurements such as total column measurement from GOSAT or TROP-OMI can distinguish between these models, allowing for better estimates of the magnitude and timing of wetland fluxes and improved process understanding of high-latitude methane emissions.",

            "abstract": "The Bagley Fire burned about 19,000 hectares on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in the late summer of 2012, with soil burn severities of 11% high, 19% moderate and 48% low. Two strong storms in November and December followed the fire. The first storm had a recurrence interval of about 2 years, and generated runoff with a return interval of 10-25 years, causing many road stream crossing failures in parts of the fire. The second storm had a recurrence interval of 25-50 years, and initiated more severe erosion throughout the fire area. Erosional processes were dominated by sheet, rill and gully erosion, and landslides were uncommon. A model predicted high potential for debris flows, but few were documented, and though most stream channels exhibited fresh scour and deposition, residual deposits lacked boulder levees or other evidence of debris flow. Rather, deposits were stratified and friable, suggesting a sediment laden flood flow rather than debris flow origin. The resulting sediment was rich in gravel and finer particles, and poor in larger rock. Soil loss was estimated at 0.5-5.6 cm on most hillslopes. A high resolution DEM (LiDAR) was used to measure gullies, small landslides, and stream scour, and also to estimate sedimentation in Squaw Creek, and Shasta Lake. A soil erosion model was used to estimate surface erosion. Total erosion in the Squaw Creek watershed was estimated at 2.24 million metric tons, which equates to 260 metric tons/hectare. Of this, about 0.89 million metric tons were delivered to the stream system (103 metric tons/hectare). Nearly half of this sediment, 0.41 million metric tons, was temporarily stored in the Squaw Creek channel, and around 0.33 million metric tons of fine sediment were carried into Shasta Lake. Squaw Creek also delivered about 0.17 million metric tons of sand, gravel and cobbles to the lake. This estimate is very tenuous, and was made by measuring the volume of a delta in Shasta Lake from a tributary to Squaw Creek and extrapolating to the entire watershed. LidAR measurements of gully and landslide volume were considered the most reliable values, followed by estimates of channel scour and deposition in Squaw Creek and tributaries. The soil erosion model outputs were calibrated with data from a small debris basin. The most uncertain estimates were those for Shasta Lake sedimentation.",

            "abstract": "The sulfur cycle is linked to the carbon and oxygen cycles by the anoxygenic respiration of organic carbon during bacterial sulfate reduction and the oxidative weathering of reduced sulfur on land. Understanding carbon and oxygen cycles over geological time requires an understanding of the evolution of the sulfur cycle, which can be accomplished by reconstructing the concentration and isotopic composition of sulfate in seawater. Sulfate concentration records are problematic because they are predominantly based on the composition of fluid inclusions found in evaporites, which cannot provide a continuous record through time [1]. Carbonate Associated Sulfate (CAS) and barite are routinely used to reconstruct the isotopic composition of seawater sulfate. The sulfate content of the foraminifer Orbulina universa grown in culture has previously been shown to correlate with the concentration of sulfate in seawater [2]. CAS in foraminifera could potentially be used to build a continuous record of seawater sulfate concentrations that could be directly correlated to the sulfur isotopic record.\nTo understand the influence of seawater chemistry variation on the CAS content of foraminifers during the Cenozoic, we have conducted experiments to quantify the influence of seawater sulfate concentration, pH and Mg/Ca ratios on the CAS in Orbulina universa grown in the laboratory. Juvenile specimens were collected from the San Pedro Basin off Santa Catalina Island Southern California and grown through gametogenesis in artificial seawater at constant temperature (22°C) in a controlled 12h:12h light:dark cycle. We changed the sulfate concentration or the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater by mixing in different proportions ambient seawater with either a sulfate free artificial seawater or a seawater with Mg/Ca ~0.5. The pH was changed by adding HCl or NaOH to ambient seawater, covering a range from 7.85 to 8.6. Additionally, we compare these experimental results to data from shells collected in plankton tows at the same location and core-tops from close locations to document how early diagenesis affects the CAS content of the shells.\n[1] Horita et al., 2002, GCA 66-21, 3733-3756\n[2] Paris et al., 2014, Geochem.

            "abstract": "We present model results of hydrate dynamics that show the development of a gas chimney at three-phase equilibrium where gas flows through the marine hydrate stability zone and vents into the ocean during transient adjustment to imposed warming. Previous studies show venting occurs at the seaward retreating up-dip boundary of the hydrate stability zone during warming, whereas our results are the first to provide a mechanism for temporary gas venting vertically through the hydrate stability zone during warming. Transient behavior records the combined effect of hydrate dissociation from seafloor warming and secondary hydrate formation from gas produced by hydrate dissociation. We perform simulations of seafloor warming with a 1-d, unsteady, multiphase, fluid-flow model of methane hydrate dynamics. We assume an initial hydrate layer 6o meters thick with 10% pore volume saturation with seawater occupying the remaining domain above and below. We apply an instantaneous temperature increase at the seafloor. The temperature increase propagates downward through the deposit and initiates hydrate dissociation at the base of the deposit. Gas sourced from dissociation migrates upward and re-solidifies as hydrate to a maximum saturation set by a three-phase equilibrium salinity constraint. Additional gas migrates further upward to repeat the process. A chimney defined by dissociation at the bottom, secondary hydrate formation at the top, and maintained at three-phase equilibrium on the interior propagates to the seafloor in 10 kyr. Gas and salt then exit the system by venting into the ocean until dissociation stops producing new gas. Elevated salinities then diffuse to background seawater values. A shorter, shoaled hydrate deposit remains after ~100 kyr. This result shows that temporary venting can potentially occur anywhere along the hydrate stability zone during seafloor warming while retaining a hydrate deposit at steady state.",

Demands for these resources are escalating rapidly because of increases in populations and changes in lifestyles. Therefore intensive demand for those resources makes conflicts between resources. Securities of water, energy, and food are treated separately, however they should be considered as one integrated matter, because water-energy-food are connected and it makes nexus and tradeoff. Security in terms of self-production, diversity of alternatives, and variability are evaluated for water, energy and food for thirty two countries in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe water and energy nexus includes water consumption for the cooling of power plant systems, water use for hydro power generation, and energy consumption for water allocation and pumping. The water and food nexus consists of water consumption for agriculture and aquaculture. The energy and food nexus includes energy consumption for food production and biomass for energy. Analyses of 11 countries within the Asia- Pacific region show that energy consumption for fish is the largest among foods in Japan, Philippines, and Peru, while energy consumption for cereals is the largest among foods in Canada, US, Indonesia, and others. Water consumption for different types of food and energy are also analyzed, including nexus ratio to total water consumption.\nThe water-energy-food nexus at a local level in the Asia Pacific region are examined by the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature project “Human environmental security in Asia Pacific Ring of Fire”. Themes including geothermal power plants for energy development and hot springs as water, shale gas for energy development and water consumption/contamination, aquaculture for food and water contamination are used to evaluate the water-energy-food nexus in the Asia-Pacific region.",

Through the CoopEUS EU-US cooperation project, a number of environmental research infrastructures have come together to coordinate efforts on environmental challenges; this tsunami case study tackles one such challenge.\nThere is a mutual need of tsunami event field data and modeling to deepen our experience in testing methodology and developing real-time data processing. Tsunami field data are already available for past events, part of this use case compares these for compatibility, gap analysis, and model groundtruthing. It also reviews sensors needed and harmonizes instrument settings. Sensor metadata and registries are compared, harmonized, and aligned. Data policies and access are also compared and assessed for gap analysis. Modelling algorithms are compared and tested against archived and real-time data. This case study will then be extended to other related tsunami data and model sources globally with similar geographic and seismic scenarios (e.g. DONET, ONC).",

Precipitation projections from AOGCMs participating in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are downscaled to a high resolution (0.25°× 0.25°) grid covering the contiguous USA and used to derive multiple descriptors of 21st century precipitation climate. Projections for the Northeast, Pacific Northwest and the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains are characterized by increases in total annual precipitation, with the magnitude of the increase highly dependent on the level of radiative forcing. Parts of the southern USA are projected to experience moderate precipitation decreases under all forcing scenarios. Increases in total annual precipitation are associated primarily with changes in cold season precipitation and with the precipitation intensity process. Significant precipitation decreases are projected for parts of the southern USA in all seasons except autumn and are associated primarily with the precipitation occurrence process. Many locations in the eastern USA are projected to experience longer extreme dry spells and longer extreme wet spells, reflecting an increase in the serial correlation of precipitation. Many western locations, on the other hand, are projected to experience shorter dry spells and wet spells, reflecting a decrease in the serial correlation of precipitation. Most US locations are projected to experience an increase in extreme precipitation, reflected in increases in the mean annual single-day maximum precipitation and the number of heavy (>10mm) and very heavy (>20mm) precipitation days.",

            "abstract": "Artisanal miners in the Peruvian Amazon, especially in the Madre de Dios region, are targeting fluvial deposits along riverbanks as part of a modern-day gold rush. These miners often use mercury, causing Hg pollution and ecological damage. Research on the environmental consequences of these mines has focused primarily on the fate of Hg, and to date little work has considered whether mining river sediments affects the release and cycling of other trace metals. This project measures trace metal concentrations in soil and vegetation samples developed on fluvial sediments at one mine site and two non-mine (control) sites across gradients in natural plant succession and riverbank composition. Some metals, including Pb and Mo, showed leachable metal concentrations (determined using EPA Method 2050B and ICP-MS analysis) that were lower in mine site soils than control site soils, but higher in mine site vegetation than control site vegetation. These results held across all gradients in natural plant succession and soil composition. This suggests that metals may be preferentially mobilized from the soil and taken up by surrounding vegetation as a result of mining activities. Soils were also treated with a sequential leach to separate metals that are exchangeable, bound to carbonates, bound to Fe and Mn oxides, bound to organic matter and in the residual phase. Initial data shows that trace metal concentrations are generally lower in all phases from mine soils vs. control soils, across all gradients in natural plant succession and soil composition. Trace metal mobilization due to mining is facilitated by changing pH or redox conditions – e.g., by exposing buried minerals to water and oxygen. Fluvial sediments at these studied sites were already exposed during their erosion and transport, but anoxic conditions following deposition may allow a build-up of metals that are mobilized once sediments are re-worked by mining. It is also possible that Hg affects the mobility of other metals, like through almagation and/or changing acidity, since Hg acts as a Bronsted-Lowry acid when speciated in water. The results of this study indicate that Hg-intensive fluvial gold mining may facilitate trace metal pollution and hopes to inspire further research into the mechanisms and consequences behind illegal gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon.",

The system suffers from the development of poor infiltration area from near surface clogging layer and functions at about 25% of its predicted capacity. Since streaming potential created by the infiltration of water into aquifer is related with the conductivity distribution, underwater self-potential (SO) survey are taken to map pathways.\nWe first built a 3D synthetic Comsol model which honors the geometric layout of the site to test the validity of this hypothesis. Underwater SP data were generated as measurements from the synthetic model, and then inverted to obtain the distribution of hydraulic conductivity. The results indicate that hydraulic conductivity near the surface can be effectively characterized. Deep aquifer has little impact on the recovery system, and cannot be characterized with the underwater data which is essential taken on the surface of the aquifer. In the end, SP data from the field were inverted to map the infiltration pathways. We found a low conductivity zone in the surface layer at the south of system which was verified by a muddy layer on the surface from visual inspection.",

            "abstract": "Transient rip currents on alongshore uniform beaches develop from the coalescence of surf zone eddies, exchanging tracers between the surf zone and the potentially stratified inner shelf. The interaction of stratification and transient rip currents has not yet been investigated. Surf zone eddies responsible for transient rip currents are generated by short-crested wave breaking, a process included in wave-resolving (WR) Boussinesq models. However, WR models are depth-integrated and cannot account for stratification and vertically sheared flows. Wave-averaged (WA) models can simulate these processes, but cannot create surf zone eddies. A combination of WR and WA models is required to accurately simulate surf zone-inner shelf exchange.\nHere, WR depth-integrated Boussinessq model funwaveC is coupled to the stratification and depth-resolving WA Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) modeling system. The surf zone eddy generation forcing is extracted from a funwaveC simulation of normally incident waves on a planar beach, and provided to COAWST as a depth-uniform surf zone force. COAWST model simulations resolving the surf zone to mid-shelf are conducted with surf zone eddy forcing, idealistic surface heating/cooling, stratification, and Coriolis effects. These simulations provide three-dimensional evolution of velocity and temperature, diagnosed to quantify the role of surf zone eddy forcing in surf zone-inner shelf exchange. The impact of stratification on rip currents and exchange is studied by varying the stratification. Funded by the Office of Naval Research.",

            "abstract": "Examining the temporal and spatial relationship between basaltic volcanism and extensional faulting can help delineate the influence of faulting on the location of source vents and distribution of subsequent lava flows. Young extensional environments offer a unique opportunity to resolve the interdependence of faulting and volcanism as faults have not yet been buried and precise ages can be acquired on volcanic rocks. The Larkspur Hills, located along the northwestern margin of the Basin and Range in northeastern California preserve flow-on-flow basalt sequences exposed in the footwalls of numerous normal faults. The eruption of these 3 to 8 Ma flows was coeval with the development and progression of extensional faulting, but the detailed relationship was not clear. Although several flows have previously been dated using 40Ar/39Ar geochronology, individual flows cannot easily be identified in outcrop or geochemically. Paleomagnetic analyses have allowed us to differentiate individual flows possessing unique remanence directions, and to correlate flow sequences. Nearly 1,300 paleomagnetic core samples from 167 flows were collected within the Larkspur Hills. Generalized magnetostratigraphy and detailed remanent magnetic directions were analyzed in conjunction with the existing geochronology to correlate flows and constrain the relative timing of faulting and volcanism. Results indicate that volcanic activity occurred during four distinct episodes between 3 to 8 Ma, and suggest that contemporaneous faulting likely influenced the distribution of subsequent flows by producing topographic barriers or pathways to the flows. In addition, when compared to the expected reference direction for stable North America, the paleomagnetic data indicate that the region has undergone 11.9 ± 4.5˚ of clockwise rotation. This result agrees favorably with studies that have inferred appreciable rotation of our study area associated with clockwise rotation of the Oregon coastal block.",

All lesson plans designed and taught by the graduate Fellows must include one or more connections to their research, and these connections must be demonstrated to the students during the lessons. International research partnerships with Australia, the Bahamas, England, and Poland provide valuable opportunities for graduate Fellows to conduct field work abroad and allow our partner teachers to have authentic research experiences that they can bring back to their classrooms. Program effectiveness has been examined using pre- and post-year attitudinal surveys, formal lesson plan documents, Fellow and teacher journals, focus group meetings with a project evaluator, and direct observation of Fellow-led classroom activities. Analyses of data gathered during the past four years of the partnership will be presented that examine the diversity in approaches taken by Fellows to communicate big ideas, changes in the ability of Fellows to find connections between their research and classroom lessons while keeping them aligned with state and national standards, and the quality of the mentorship provided to the Fellows by our partner teachers.

            "abstract": "Isotopic analyses of the calcite or aragonite shells of aquatic organisms are often used in the study of the environmental conditions in which they grow; however, this approach is less straightforward in the terrestrial realm, where environments may be more heterogeneous. In such terrestrial localities, the bioapatite of vertebrate teeth comprises the typical archival material for isotopic analyses. The calcitic eggshells of birds and other reptiles may provide suitable material for isotopic analyses that are aimed at studying their physiology and ecology. Here we apply a novel thermometer, carbonate clumped isotopes (Δ47), to test for endothermy in extinct non-avian dinosaurs in the context provided by eggs of modern reptiles and birds. These Δ47-derived temperatures should reflect the temperature of shell formation, which in endothermic animals such as birds should represent the mother’s internal body temperature. In ectothermic animals, the same is true although their body temperatures are more affected by the external environment and thus Δ47 temperatures could more accurately describe local environmental temperatures during eggshell formation.\nFossil eggshells represent appropriate material for reconstructing internal body temperatures of extinct non-avian dinosaurs since they mineralized within the mother’s body, and fragments of eggshell are commonly recovered from dinosaur-bearing fossil deposits. The dimensions of these fragments provide sufficient material for the relatively large sample required for clumped isotope analysis (~20mg). Fossil eggshell samples from several taxa of Late Cretaceous non-avian dinosaurs were analyzed using Δ47 paleothermometry. Textural inspection was used as a first test for diagenetic alteration of the original calcite, and histological indicators were used for broad taxonomic identifications. Preliminary results of Δ47-derived body temperature estimates from eggshells are consistent with previous body temperatures estimates from bioapatite Δ47 analyses performed on non-avian dinosaur teeth.",

The non-hydrostatic coastal model, NHWAVE, was able to reproduce those features as the computational grid was refined to ~10 m. Model results indicate that large amplitude Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are generated in association with an internal hydraulic jump, which forms as the plume moves over bathymetric sills, and with location and orientation controlled by a lateral boundary inclined to the plume front. Simulation results indicate that the Kelvin-Helmholtz billows have sufficiently large amplitudes to interrupt the water surface, causing prominent linear features on the surface as indicated in thermal images. The current field in the interrupted region is modulated by the frontal structures, indicated by the vorticity field calculated from both the numerical model and data measured by the microASAR.",

            "abstract": "Airborne photogrammetry is undergoing a renaissance. Lower-cost equipment, more powerful software, and simplified methods have lowered the barriers-to-entry significantly and now allow repeat-mapping of cryospheric dynamics that were previously too expensive to consider.  The current state-of-the-art is the ability to use an airborne equipment package costing less than $20,000 to make topographic maps on landscape-scales at 10 cm pixel size with a vertical repeatability of about 10 cm. Nearly any surface change on the order of decimeters can be measured using these techniques through analysis of time-series of such maps. This presentation will discuss these new methods and their application to cryospheric dynamics such as the measurement of snow depth, coastal erosion, valley-glacier volume-change, permafrost thaw, frost heave of infrastructure, river bed geomorphology, and aufeis melt. Because of the expense of other airborne methods, by necessity measurements of these dynamics are currently most often made on the ground along benchmark transects that are then extrapolated to the broader scale. The ability to directly measure entire landscapes with equal or higher accuracy than transects eliminates the need to extrapolate them and the ability to do so at lower costs than transects may revolutionize the way we approach studying change in the cryosphere, as well as our understanding of the cryosphere itself.",

            "abstract": "Streamer corona formation and propagation is an important process in the development of lightning. In order to understand its dynamics, the streamer front velocity is calculated in a 1D model with curvature. We show that streamers may only propagate only the presence of mechanisms such as electron drift, electron diffusion and photoionization. The results indicate, in particular, that: (1) the effect of photoionization on the streamer velocity for both positive and negative streamers is mostly determined by the photoionization length, with a weaker dependence on the amount of photoionization; (2) the electron drift may increase the velocity of the negative streamers but has an opposite effect on the positive streamers; (3) the contributions of photoionization and electron diffusion to the velocity are decreased for positive curvature, i.e., convex fronts, while the contribution of electron drift is independent of curvature. These results are used in a fractal model in which the front propagation velocity is simulated as the cluster growth probability [Niemeyer et al, 1984, doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.52.1033]. In the case when the photoionization is the main mechanism which determines the streamer propagation, the emerging transverse size of the streamers is of the order of the photoionization length, and at the larger scale the streamer structure is a fractal similar to the one obtained in a diffusion-limited aggregation system.",

Today, the suite of collections includes the lunar samples from the Apollo missions, cosmic dust particles falling into the Earth’s atmosphere, meteorites collected in Antarctica, comet and interstellar dust particles from the Stardust mission, asteroid particles from Japan’s Hayabusa mission, solar wind atoms collected during the Genesis mission, and space-exposed hardware from several missions. To support planetary science research on these samples, JSC’s Astromaterials Curation Office hosts NASA’s Astromaterials Curation digital repository and data access portal [http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/], providing descriptions of the missions and collections, and critical information about each individual sample. Our office is designing and implementing several informatics initiatives to better serve the planetary research community. First, we are re-hosting the basic database framework by consolidating legacy databases for individual collections and providing a uniform access point for information (descriptions, imagery, classification) on all of our samples. Second, we continue to upgrade and host digital compendia that summarize and highlight published findings on the samples (e.g., lunar samples, meteorites from Mars). We host high resolution imagery of samples as it becomes available, including newly scanned images of historical prints from the Apollo missions. Finally we are creating plans to collect and provide new data, including 3D imagery, point cloud data, micro CT data, and external links to other data sets on selected samples. Together, these individual efforts will provide unprecedented digital access to NASA’s Astromaterials, enabling preservation of the samples through more specific and targeted requests, and supporting new planetary science research and collaborations on the samples.",

            "abstract": "We present results demonstrating seasonal variations in the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) at high-latitude seismic stations. We analyze data from two sites at Poker Flat Research Range, near Fairbanks, Alaska. From the first site, we analyze 3 stations installed by Sandia National Labs (SNL) in a valley with marshy summer conditions. We also analyze the PASSCAL Instrument Center station PIC2, which is installed on rock approximately 3.2 km from the SNL stations. These stations continuously record data at 125 (SNL) and 200 (PIC2) samples per second. Seasonal changes in HVSR at high frequencies (> 20 Hz) appear to be caused by impedance contrasts between frozen and thawed ground. Thawed active layers are known to have slower shear-wave velocities than frozen layers or bedrock. An estimate of active layer thickness at each station is obtained from the quarter-wavelength approximation. We verify the accuracy of this technique by obtaining ground-truth measurements at the sites for both thickness and shear-wave velocity. We use physical probing for the thickness measurements and active-source Refraction-Microtremor (ReMi) surveys for the shear-wave velocities.

The relative lack of knowledge of the coronal vector magnetic field is a major handicap for the progress in coronal physics. This makes the development of measurement methods of coronal magnetic fields a high priority in solar physics. The Hanle effect in the UV and IR spectral lines is a largely unexplored diagnostic. Here we use magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to study the magnitude of the signal to be expected for typical coronal magnetic fields for selected spectral lines in the UV and IR wavelength ranges, namely the H I Lyman series (i.e., α, β, and γ), O VI 103.2 nm line, and the He I 1083 nm line. We show that the selected lines may be useful for the diagnostic of coronal magnetic fields. We also show that the combination of polarization measurements of spectral lines with different sensitivities to the Hanle effect may be most appropriate for the interpretation of the data. We propose that UV coronal magnetic field mapper should be a central part of the science payload of any future spacebased solar observatory.",

The magnetopause standoff position prediction and response time to the solar wind changes will then be compared to results from available empirical models (e.g. Shue et al. 1997), and to Cluster and the Geotail missions magnetopause crossing observations. Rigorous analysis/comparison of observations and empirical models is critical in determining magnetosphere dynamics for model validation. We will identify solar wind conditions that affect the model predictions significantly and lead to differences between the models. Preliminary results show that the magnetopause standoff position takes about 4/3 of an hour to respond to the simulataneous increase in dynamic pressure and IMF Bz changes at the March 24, 2001 event.",

Rigorously testing select configurations and evaluating the performance for specific applications is necessary due to the flexibility offered by the system. The Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) performed extensive testing and evaluation with the Advanced Research WRF (ARW) dynamic core for two physics suite configurations with a goal of assessing the impact that the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme had on the final forecast performance. The baseline configuration was run with the Air Force Weather Agency’s physics suite, which includes the Yonsei University PBL scheme, while the second configuration was substituted with the Asymmetric Convective Model (ACM2) PBL scheme.\nThis presentation will focus on assessing the forecast performance of the two configurations; both configurations were run over the same set of cases, allowing for a direct comparison of performance. The evaluation was performed over a 15 km CONUS domain for a testing period from September 2013 through August 2014. Simulations were initialized every 36 hours and run out to 48 hours; a 6-hour “warm start” spin-up, including data assimilation using the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation system preceded each simulation. The extensive testing period allows for robust results as well as the ability to investigate seasonal and regional differences between the two configurations. Results will focus on the evaluation of traditional verification metrics for surface and upper air variables, along with an assessment of statistical and practical significance.",

            "abstract": "We have developed an inexpensive, permanent seafloor benchmark to increase the longevity of seafloor geodetic measurements. The benchmark provides a physical tie to the sea floor lasting for decades (perhaps longer) on which geodetic sensors can be repeatedly placed and removed with millimeter resolution. Global coordinates estimated with seafloor geodetic techniques will remain attached to the benchmark allowing for the interchange of sensors as they fail or become obsolete, or for the sensors to be removed and used elsewhere, all the while maintaining a coherent series of positions referenced to the benchmark. The benchmark has been designed to free fall from the sea surface with transponders attached. The transponder can be recalled via an acoustic command sent from the surface to release from the benchmark and freely float to the sea surface for recovery. The duration of the sensor attachment to the benchmark will last from a few days to a few years depending on the specific needs of the experiment. The recovered sensors are then available to be reused at other locations, or again at the same site in the future.\nThree pins on the sensor frame mate precisely and unambiguously with three grooves on the benchmark.\nTo reoccupy a benchmark a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) uses its manipulator arm to place the sensor pins into the benchmark grooves. In June 2014 we deployed four benchmarks offshore central Oregon. We used the ROV Jason to successfully demonstrate the removal and replacement of packages onto the benchmark. We will show the benchmark design and its operational capabilities.\nPresently models of megathrust slip within the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) are mostly constrained by the sub-aerial GPS vectors from the Plate Boundary Observatory, a part of Earthscope. More long-lived seafloor geodetic measures are needed to better understand the earthquake and tsunami risk associated with a large rupture of the thrust fault within the Cascadia subduction zone. Using a ROV to place and remove sensors on the benchmarks will significantly reduce the number of sensors required by the community to monitor offshore strain in subduction zones.",

Recent studies have highlighted the relative importance of temperature, ice volume and ocean circulation changes during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition at ~900 ka (Elderfield et al., 2012, Pena and Goldstein, 2014). Reconstructing the history of global deep water mass propagation and its carbon content is important for fully understanding the ocean’s role in amplifying Milankovich changes to cause glacial-interglacial transitions.\nA new foraminiferal-coating Nd isotope record from ODP Site 1123 on the deep Chatham Rise is interpreted as showing glacial-interglacial changes in the bottom water propagation of Atlantic-sourced waters into the Pacific via the Southern Ocean during the last 1 million years. This is compared to globally-distributed bottom water Nd isotope records; including a new deep western equatorial Atlantic Ocean record from ODP Site 929, as well as published records from ODP 1088 and Site 1090 in the South Atlantic (Pena and Goldstein, 2014), and ODP 758 in the deep Indian Ocean (Gourlan et al., 2010). Atlantic-to-Pacific gradients in deep ocean neodymium isotopes are constructed for key time intervals to elucidate changes in deep water sourcing and circulation pathways through the global ocean. Benthic carbon isotopes are used to estimate deep water nutrient contents of deep water masses and constrain locations and modes of deep water formation.\n",

The solar wind can have an influence on the modulation of the GCR, e.g. when the fast solar wind (~ 750 km/s) interacts with the slow solar wind (~ 400 km/s) at so-called Stream Interaction Regions (SIRs) resulting in an enhancement of the local magnetic field which could affect the shielding of GCRs. SIRs often occur periodically as Co-rotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) which may-be observed at Mars as a decrease in the radiation data measured by MSL/RAD. Considering the difference of the Earth-Mars orbit, we correlate these in-situ radiation data at Mars with the solar wind properties measured by spacecrafts at 1 AU, with the aim to eventually determine the solar wind properties at Mars based on MSL/RAD measurements.",

The reactions produce a dissolution pattern that follows the ascending fluids's interface where the largest concentration gradients and maximum mixing are found. Contrary to other chemical systems, the mixing history engraved by the dissolution does not map out the fingering geometry of the unstable flow. The temporal scaling of the mixing Χ and the reaction rate r are explained by a stretching-diffusion model of the interface between the fluids. The model accurately reproduces the three observed regimes: a diffusive regime at which Χ, r ~ t-1/2; a convective regime of at which the interface contracts to the Batchelor scale resulting in a constant Χf and r independent of the Rayleigh number; and an attenuated convection regime in which Χ and r decay faster than diffusion as t-3/2 and t-1, respectevely, because of the decompression of the interface and weakened reactions caused by the accumulation of dissolved fluid below the interface.",

            "abstract": "The slip history of the San Andreas Fault (SAF) on the San Francisco peninsula is not well determined, and paleoseismic investigations to date yield inconsistent results, possibly because previous measurements were made on differing near-surface traces of the SAF. Furthermore, ground-shaking modeling requires accurate shallow-depth S-wave velocities across the fault zone and accurate fault dips; the existing Bay Area 3-D velocity models lack such measurements. To locate all near-surface traces of the SAF within 150 m of the 1906 surface rupture, to determine near-surface shear-wave velocities (VS30 to VS100), and to determine the fault dip, the USGS acquired a set of 300-m-long, high-resolution, P- and S-wave seismic imaging profiles across the SAF near Woodside, California, centered on the 1906 surface rupture zone. Sources (seisgun and hammer) and receivers (40-Hz P-wave and 4.5-Hz S-wave) were spaced at 3-m intervals. We developed independent P- and S-wave tomographic velocity models to depths of ~ 120 m (P-waves) and 80 m (S-waves). P-wave velocities vary widely from near the surface (Vp = 800 m/s, Vs = 250) to 100 m depth (Vp > 3000 m/s, Vs > 500 m/s). The 1906 surface rupture zone forms P- and S-wave low-velocity zones (Vp = 1600 to 1800 m/s; Vs = 250 to 350 m/s) within the fault zone relative to outside the fault zone (Vp = 2000 to 2200 m/s; Vs = 300 to 400 m/s). Vp/Vs ratios range from about 2.8 to about 5.7, with higher ratios on either side of the 1906 surface rupture zone and on the uphill (southwest) side. Southwest-dipping Vp/Vs contours suggest a 60o-southwest dip for one of the fault traces. However, a CDP reflection stack shows a near-vertical dip of the main 1906 rupture zone to 1.2 km depth, and the stack shows evidence for multiple fault traces. Collectively, these new data show a complex fault structure and highly variable velocities across the fault zone, which should aid paleoseismic investigations and improve existing ground-shaking models.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution repeat multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES) surveys of the Lower Missouri River in Missouri, USA demonstrate sand bedform movement at a variety of scales over a range of discharges. Understanding dune transport rates and the temporal and spatial variability in sizes across the channel has implications for how sediment transport measurements are made and for understanding the dynamics of habitats utilized by benthic organisms over a range of life stages. Nearly 800 miles of the Lower Missouri River has been altered through channelization and bank stabilization that began in the early 1900’s for navigation purposes. Channelization of the Lower Missouri River has created a self-scouring navigation channel with large dunes that migrate downstream over a wide range of discharges. Until the use of MBES surveys on the Missouri River the spatial variability of dune forms in the Missouri River navigation channel was poorly understood. MBES surveys allow for visualization of a range of sand bedforms and repeat measurements demonstrate that dunes are moving over a wide range of discharges on the river. Understanding the spatial variability of dunes and dune movement across the channel and in different channel settings (bends, channel cross-overs, near channel structures) will inform emerging methods in sediment transport measurement that use bedform differencing calculations and provide context for physical bedload sediment sampling on large sand-bedded rivers. Multiple benthic fish species of interest including the endangered pallid sturgeon utilize Missouri River dune fields and adjacent regions for migration, feeding, spawning, early development and dispersal. Surveys using MBES and other hydroacoustic tools provide fisheries biologists with broad new insights into the functionality of bedforms as habitat for critical life stages of large river fish species in the Missouri River, and similar sand-bedded systems.",

            "abstract": "Seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle is considered to be caused by crystallographic preferred orientation of olivine. The seismic anisotropy rapidly decreases below 200 km depth, which is attributed to the fabric transition from A-type to B-type with pressure demonstrated by deformation experiments. However, stress and strain-rate conditions in the deformation experiments are by orders of magnitude higher than in the upper mantle, which may cause misinterpretation. Hence the observed fabric transition has to be examined by an independent technique.\nA- and B-type fabrics should be produced by the dominant slip systems of [100](010) (a-slip) and [001](010) (c-slip), respectively. Therefore, the fabric transition may indicate a larger decrease in dislocation mobility with pressure in a-slip system than in c-slip system. To examine this hypothesis, we have determined mobility of [100](010) edge (a-dislocation) and [001](010) screw (c-dislocation) dislocations at pressures of 0 to 12 GPa and temperatures of 1470 to 1770 K by the dislocation recovery technique, in which dislocation mobility is determined from dislocation annihilation rates under quasi-hydrostatic conditions. The a- and c-dislocations were produced in [100](010) and [001](010) simple shear geometries. TEM observations showed that the dislocations produced in these geometries are by 79-90 % a- and c-dislocations, respectively. Dislocation density was measured on (001) plane by the oxidation decoration technique.\nThe followings are a summary of the experimental results. (1) The mobility of a-dislocations is almost identical to or up to 0.5 orders of magnitude lower than that of c-dislocations at ambient pressure. (2) The activation energies of both dislocations are comparable, 400(100) kJ/mol. (3) The activation volumes of both dislocations are also comparable, about 3.5(9) cm3/mol.\nThe comparable activation energies and volumes suggest that a- and c-dislocations move in the same mechanisms. Olivine creep in a- and c-slips will be driven by movement of a- and c-dislocations in the [100] direction. The fabric transition of A-type to B-type simply by pressure and/or temperature is unlikely. The rapid decrease in seismic anisotropy below 200 km will be due to decrease in flow rate in this depth.",

These benefits can best be achieved if the satellite data are well utilized and interpreted, such as model inputs from satellite, or extreme event (such as volcano eruption, dust storm, …etc) interpretation from satellite. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, despite the abundance and relative maturity of numerous satellite data products provided by NASA and other organizations. One way to help users better understand the satellite data is to provide data along with ‘Images’, including accurate pixel-level (Level 2) information, pixel coverage area delineation, and science team recommended quality screening for individual geophysical parameters.\nGoddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) always strives to best support (i.e., Software-as-a-service, SaaS) the user-community for NASA Earth Science Data. In this case, we will present a new visualization tool that helps users exploiting Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level 2 data. This new visualization service utilizes Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard-compliant Web Mapping Service (WMS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) calls in the backend infrastructure. The functionality of the service allows users to select data sources (e.g., multiple parameters under the same measurement, like NO2 and SO2 from OMI Level 2 or same parameter with different methods of aggregation, like NO2 in OMNO2G and OMNO2D products), defining area-of-interest and temporal extents, zooming, panning, overlaying, sliding, and data subsetting and reformatting. The interface will also be able to connect to other OGC WMS and WCS servers, which will greatly enhance its expandability to integrate additional outside data/map sources (such as Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS)).",

            "abstract": "The thickness and seismic velocity structure of sediments of the Aleutian Basin were mapped during a 2011 multichannel seismic (MCS) cruise of the R/V Langseth. Combined with legacy MCS, sonobuoy, and scientific drilling data, the Langseth observations allowed us to study the history of sedimentation in this area. Semblance velocity analyses from common-depth-point gathers of the 8-km-long streamer data were conducted at-sea every 6.25 km. Post-cruise, these semblance analyses were refined and supplemented with new analyses where significant basement topography is present. The flat-lying nature of both the seafloor and the within-sediment reflectors allowed determination of interval velocity and thickness values with high precision using the Dix equation. Two prominent bottom-simulating reflections (BSRs) are common within the sediment column: a shallower one inferred to represent the base of gas hydrate stability, and a deeper one inferred to represent the diagenetic transformation from opal-A to opal-CT. This latter transition was reached by the one deep hole (Site 190, DSDP Leg19) drilled into the Aleutian Basin, where the lithologic contrast prevented further penetration. The gas hydrate BSR is associated with subvertical velocity-amplitude anomalies, and the opal A/CT transition is associated with a large decrease in reflector amplitudes beneath it, indicating the decrease in acoustic impedance contrasts associated with diagenetic dewatering. Seismic interval velocities range from 1600 m/sec at the top of the sediment column to 2800-3500 m/sec at its base. The largest step in interval velocity occurs at the opal A/CT transition. Interval velocities are laterally continuous over many tens of kilometers, and this continuity allows the generation of seismic travel-time vs. sediment thickness relationships across the basin. A second-degree polynomial relationship between time and thickness, developed by regression of all of the semblance velocity analyses from the Langseth cruise, yields a relationship that is statistically identical to one devised in the late 1970’s by analysis of sonobuoy records. Small deviations from this single relationship are systematic and suggest that changes in the sediment provenance may be inferred from these careful MCS velocity analyses.",

Land surface models (LSMs) have long been used to simulate such a dynamic system given the forcing input. The question here is whether, how much, and how the soil moisture and runoff (output) data can be used to recover rainfall (input) information or help improve our existing rainfall estimates. This is essentially to perform an inverse estimation of LSM. Such an inverse operation can help us optimally combine information (e.g. remote sensing observations) gathered across both input and output variables and improve our quantification of different components of the land surface hydrologic system and the consistency among them.\nHowever, this is seemingly and indeed no easy task and some consider it more “wishful thinking” than practically meaningful, given the extremely complicated structure and behavior of the land surface hydrologic system. Here we explore two methods for solving the inverse LSM estimation problem (1) the Wiener Filter (WF) based deconvolution approach where the land surface is treated as a stationary linear system with fixed Impulse Response Function (IRF) w.r.t rainfall input and (2) the Particle Filter (PF) based Bayesian approach. The results suggest that while there is a limit of how much such inverse estimation can do under different conditions it is possible to recover a very significant amount of rainfall information from soil moisture and runoff.",

The geochemical disequilibrium between the injectant water composition and the target aquifer can potentially drive a range of water-sediment interactions that must be clearly understood and quantified in order to anticipate and manage future water quality changes at both the local and regional scale.\nIn this study, we use a multi-scale geochemical characterisation of a proposed reinjection site in combination with geochemical/reactive transport modeling to understand and predict the long-term fate of arsenic; and explore means for suitably mitigating an undesired increase of naturally occurring arsenic concentrations. We use a series of arsenic sorption experiments with the aquifer material from an injection trial site in Queensland, Australia to quantify As sorption/desorption from mineral surfaces in response to changes in site-specific geochemical conditions.\nBatch experiments with arsenite were performed under anoxic conditions to replicate the highly reducing in-situ conditions. The results showed significant arsenic mobility at pH >8. Competitive sorption effects with phosphate and the impact of varying temperatures were also tested in batch mode. A site-specific general composite (GC) surface complexation model (SCM) was derived through inverse geochemical modeling, i.e., selection of appropriate surface complexation reactions and optimization of sorption constants. The SCM was subsequently tested and further improved during the interpretation of data from column flow-through experiments and from a field injection trial. Eventually the uncertainty associated with estimates of sorption constants was addressed and the effects of this uncertainty on field-scale model predictions were analyzed.",

            "abstract": "Downslope travel distance concepts for interflow moving over a leaky restricting layer allow dynamic interflow modeling starting from the bottom of the slope and modeling only the active contributing area as opposed to the normal approach that models the entire slope from the ridgetop no flow boundary. In watersheds featuring deep groundwater and a low conductivity layer laying under permeable topsoil, interflow contributing areas expand and shrink based on the thickness of the perched layer, the topographic slope, and the ratio of hydraulic conductivity of topsoil to that of the impending layer. In this work, we present the development and application of two dynamic interflow models that implemented a mobile boundary condition to track flow from each of contributing cells starting from the edge of stream reaches extending upslope and constrained by downslope travel distance. Both analytical models are based on Boussinesq assumptions with percolation while one is continuous and the other is event-based. The continuous interflow model incorporates a two layer soil moisture accounting water balance analysis, pedotransfer function, percolation, and evaporation routines. The event rain based analytical solution generates interflow time series based on dynamically updated distribution function of downslope travel distances of contributing cells. We applied both modeling approaches in an intensively instrumented headwater basin in the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina. Both models showed good agreement with observed perched water depth, interflow discharge and soil moisture observations from 110m long open interflow interception trench whose 5.6 hectares of contributing hillslope were fitted with nested piezometers, soil moisture sensors, and series of V-notch weir boxes.",

Increased atmospheric CO2 and rising temperatures are expected to adversely affect rice yields by the end of the 21st century. In addition, different crop management practices affect methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice paddies antagonistically warranting a review of crop management practices such that farmers can adapt to the changing climate and also help mitigate climate change.\nThe Daily DayCent is a biogeochemical model that operates on a daily time step, driven by four ecological drivers, i.e. climate, soil, vegetation, and management practices. The model is widely used to simulate daily fluxes of various gases, plant productivity, nutrient availability, and other ecosystem parameters in response to changes in land management and climate.\nWe employed the DayCent model as a tool to optimize rice cropping practices in Peninsular India so as to develop a set of farming recommendations to ensure a triple win (i.e. higher yield, higher profit and lower GHG emissions). We applied the model to simulate both N2O and CH4 emissions, and crop yields from four rice paddies in three different agro-ecological zones under different management practices, and compared them with measured GHG and yield data from these plots. We found that, like all process based models, the biggest constraint in using the model was input data acquisition. Lack of accurate documentation of historic land use and management practices, missing historical daily weather data, and difficulty in obtaining digital records of soil and crop/vegetation parameters related to our experimental plots came in the way of our execution of this model. We will discuss utilization of estimates based on available literature, or knowledge-based values in lieu of missing measured parameters in our simulations with DayCent which could prove to be a solution to overcome data limitations in modeling with DayCent and other process based models for developing regions of the world.",

We review the traditional attachment efficiency approaches, which are based on packed column experiments and mean field parameters that define the colloid-collector interactions, and contrast them with a discrete heterogeneity approach. This new correlation equation was developed to capture prediction from a trajectory model that quantitatively explains directly observed colloid retention in an impinging jet system under unfavorable conditions via incorporation of discrete zones of attraction (nanoscale heterodomains). In order compare of observed and simulated retention in the impinging jet with granular porous media, we developed a linkage between the jet and Happel sphere unit-cell geometries. We demonstrate that attachment efficiency can be mechanistically explained by near surface trajectory analysis and well represented by three terms: 1) Maxwell distribution of colloids in the near surface fluid domain, 2) Spacing and size distribution of heterodomains on the collector relative to colloid size, and 3) Torque and force balance of the colloid in contact with heterodomains. These results indicate that a traditional empirical approach can be improved to a theoretical framework that, from basic principles, is able to predict colloid retention under unfavorable conditions.",

With this objective, two sets of simulations were carried out: the soil moisture is coupled with the atmosphere for both current and future periods in the first set of simulations, while climatological values of soil moisture (obtained from the first set) are prescribed for current (1981-2010) and future (2071-2100) periods for the second set of simulations. Each set consists of 4 simulations, driven by two different GCMs (MPI and CanESM2) for two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Associated with the decrease of soil moisture in the future climate, the projected soil moisture-temperature coupling regions extend beyond the Great Plains in to the Canadian Prairies. Results also indicate that the land surface plays a significant role in the projected change of extreme temperature events (e.g. number of hot days) over parts of North America. It is noted that the impact of land-atmosphere coupling is stronger on the changes in the variability than on the mean and these changes are co-located with areas where the reduction of soil moisture is intense.",

While the latter is an essential predictor of power output, wind speed information in other parts of the vertical profile, as well as additional atmospheric variables, are also important determinants of power. The goal of this work was to determine the gain in predictive ability afforded by adding wind speed information at other heights, as well as other atmospheric variables, to the power prediction model. Using data from a wind farm with a moderately complex terrain in the Altamont Pass region in California, we trained three statistical models, a neural network, a random forest and a Gaussian process model, to predict power output from various sets of aforementioned predictors. The comparison of these predictions to the observed power data revealed that considerable improvements in prediction accuracy can be achieved both through the addition of predictors other than the hub-height wind speed and the use of statistical models.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric blocks and amplified midlatitude planetary waves can lead to weather extremes such as heat waves, cold spells, droughts and heavy precipitation events. While assessing the influence of climate change on extreme weather events is of significant scientific and societal importance, how blocks and wave amplitude respond to changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation is not well-understood. For example, whether the weakened midlatitude westerlies and Z500 meridional gradient, caused by a reduced midlatitude-to-pole near-surface temperature difference in the Northern Hemisphere (associated with Arctic Amplification), lead to an increase in atmospheric blocking events and wavier jet streams remains unclear, despite a number of recent studies addressing this issue using observation and comprehensive GCMs.\nHere we address the question of how blocks and wave amplitude respond to changes in the midlatitude-to-pole near-surface temperature difference using an idealized dry GCM with a simple setup as described in Held and Suarez (1994). Quasi-stationary long-lived blocks that split or substantially displace the jet are common in simulations made with this model, which is free of topography and zonally asymmetric forcing. Reducing the pole-to-equator surface temperature difference in the forcing of this model leads to a mean-state with smaller midlatitude-to-pole near-surface temperature difference and Z500 meridional gradient, smaller variances of temperature and Z500, and slower jet streams, which are consistent with changes expected from Arctic Amplification. Using long high-resolution simulations, we find a robust decline in blocked area and wave amplitude as the pole-to-equator surface temperature difference in the forcing is reduced. These findings are insensitive to numerical resolution, strength of hyperdiffusion, and parameters used in the blocking and wave amplitude indices. Statistical and dynamical diagnoses are used to investigate the underlying physics of these responses.\nWith the limitations of an idealized approach borne in mind, our findings provide a complement to the ongoing studies with a hierarchy of GCMs and observations examining the response of blocks and wave amplitude to changes in the large-scale atmospheric forcing arising from climate change.",

Intermittent exposures along ~9 km of exposure reveal a northward decrease in thickness of tuff from 7 to 1 m.\nHillhouse and others (2010) identified a 7.0 m thick, partially welded, and crystallized ignimbrite with distinctive inclination as the PST. They inferred a clockwise vertical-axis rotation of ~56° relative to the Colorado Plateau based on declination of remanent magnetization. About 3.2 km north is a 3.3 m thick, zeolitically altered ignimbrite that when structurally restored has a declination of 33.4°, inclination of 76.8°, and clockwise vertical-axis rotation of ~45°. About 5.8 km northwest is a 1.5 m thick, nonwelded, argillically altered ignimbrite with no measureable paleomagnetic direction.\nPetrographic features and electron microprobe analyses of sanidine and plagioclase compare well with 3640 analyses from widespread sites of PST, and differ from three other tuffs (Buesch, 1993, unpublished data). Textural classification includes grains with attached glass, in pumice, or mantled feldspar or crystal clots as “magmatic”, “xenolithic”, or non-diagnostic “grains”. Samples from the three sections are 2 (of 7) m, 2 (of 3.3) m, and 0.7 (of 1.5) m above the base. Variations in feldspar endmenbers (Or, Ab, An) in magmatic and non-diagnostic grains from the two thicker sections are consistent with lower parts of PST measured sections from elsewhere. The 1.5 m-thick section is petrographically similar to other sections, but with more xenolithic grains. Tephrostratigraphic and paleomagnetic similarities support correlation with the PST, and local facies in the tuff (including welding, crystallization, alteration, and incorporation of locally derived clasts) support deposition across a broad area of low-relief, such as medial to distal alluvial fan and lacustrine environments, as described in Buesch (2014).\nThe PST in the Alvord Mountain area (1) expands distribution of the tuff, (2) enables interpretations of pyroclastic flow processes, (3) constrains stratigraphic facies at 18.78 Ma, and (4) provides a framework for tectonic deformation.",

Wide coverage of spatial and temporal measurements of precipitation are key for regional water budget analysis and hydrological operations which themselves are valuable tool for water resource planning and management. Rain gauge measurements are usually reliable and accurate at a point. They measure rainfall continuously, but spatial sampling is limited. Ground based radar and satellite remotely sensed precipitation have wide spatial and temporal coverage. However, these measurements are indirect and subject to errors because of equipment, meteorological variability, the heterogeneity of the land surface itself and lack of regular recording. This study seeks to understand precipitation uncertainty and in doing so, lessen uncertainty propagation into hydrological applications and operations. We reviewed, compared and evaluated the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) precipitation products, NOAA’s (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) monthly precipitation dataset, PRISM (Parameter elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model) data and data from individual climate stations including Cooperative Observer Program (COOP), Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS), Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) and Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations. Though not yet finalized, this study finds that the uncertainty within precipitation estimates datasets is influenced by regional topography, season, climate and precipitation rate. Ongoing work aims to further evaluate precipitation datasets based on the relative influence of these phenomena so that we can identify the optimum datasets for input to statewide water budget analysis.",

            "abstract": "Time-lapse seismic monitoring (4D) is currently the primary technique available for tracking sequestered CO2 in a geologic storage reservoir away from monitoring wells. The main seismic responses to injection are those due to direct fluid substitution, changes in differential pressure, and chemical interactions with reservoir rocks; the importance of each depends on reservoir/injection properties and temporal/spatial scales of interest. As part of the Big Sky Carbon Sequestration Partnership, we are monitoring the upcoming large scale (1 million ton+) CO2 injection in Kevin Dome, north central Montana. As part of this research, we predict the relative significance of these three effects, as an aid in design of field surveys. Analysis is undertaken using existing open-hole well log data and cores from wells drilled at producer and injector pads as well as core experiments. For this demonstration site, CO2 will be produced from a natural reservoir and re-injected down dip, where the formation is saturated with brine.\nEffective medium models based on borehole seismic velocity measurements predict relatively small effects (less than 40 m/s change in V¬p) due to the injection of more compressible supercritical CO2. This is due to the stiff dolomite reservoir rock, with high seismic velocities (Vp~6000 m/s, Vs~3000 m/s) and fairly low porosity (<10%). Assuming pure dolomite mineralogy, these models predict a slight increase in Vp during CO2 injection. This velocity increase is due to the lower density of CO2 relative to brine; which outweighs the small change in modulus compared to the stiff reservoir rock.\nWe present both room pressure and in-situ P/T ultrasonic experiments using core samples obtained from the reservoir; such measurements are undertaken to access the expected seismic velocities under pressurized injection. The reservoir appears to have fairly low permeability. Large-volume injection is expected to produce large local pore pressure increases, which may have the largest immediate effect on seismic velocities. Increasing pore pressure lowers the differential pressure due to confining stress, which decreases seismic velocities by opening cracks. The magnitude of this effect depends both on rock microstructure and fracture at the field scale; core scale measurements will help separate these effects.",

            "abstract": "Biological productivity in many ocean regions is controlled by the availability of the nutrient phosphorus (P), including the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Aerosol deposition is a key source of P in the Mediterranean. Understanding the composition of this P is critical for determining its solubility and therefore potential bioavailability. We investigated aerosol P composition in European and North African air masses, the main sources of aerosol deposition to the Mediterranean Sea, using Phosphorus Near Edge X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (P-NEXFS). We show that European aerosols are a significant source of soluble P to the Mediterranean Sea. The traditionally studied North African sourced air masses carry more total P to the Mediterranean Sea than European sourced air masses and contain mostly apatite, a largely insoluble calcium phosphate mineral. However, European aerosols deliver P that is on average 3.5 times more soluble than North African aerosols and furthermore are dominated by organic P compounds. The increased solubility of European aerosols leads to comparable amounts of soluble P by mass delivered to the Mediterranean Sea by both air masses. The ultimate origin of organic P does not stem from common primary emission sources, such as coal fly ash and diesel emissions. Rather, P associated with bacteria best explains the presence of organic P in Mediterranean aerosols. The soluble organic nature of the P in European sourced air masses underscores the need to examine aerosols from this region as a source of P to the Mediterranean Sea. This study also demonstrates that synchrotron-based techniques are effective tools for characterizing aerosols and gaining new insights.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies of SKS splitting beneath the eastern United States have produced evidence for complex and laterally variable anisotropy, including regions that are dominated by null SKS arrivals and those that include multiple layers of anisotropy. One key question is to what extent SKS splitting reflects anisotropy due to present-day flow in the asthenospheric mantle, fossilized anisotropy in the mantle lithosphere due to past deformation processes, or a combination of the two. The broadband station coverage in the eastern US has historically been sparse, but the arrival of the EarthScope USArray Transportable Array (TA) in the eastern US provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe upper mantle anisotropy in detail. Here we present a set of ~3800 SKS splitting measurements at ~380 TA stations east of ~85°W. We identify predominantly null (that is, non-split) SKS arrivals at eastern US stations, with many stations (particularly in the southeastern US) exhibiting clear null arrivals over a wide range of backazimuths. Stations located in the Appalachian Mountains tend to exhibit well-resolved splitting, with typical delay times of ~1 sec and fast directions that are generally parallel to the strike of the mountain range. In the northern part of the study area, we observe more split arrivals, with laterally variable fast directions. Splitting patterns at many individual stations exhibit backazimuthal variations that are consistent with multiple layers of anisotropy, suggesting contributions from both the lithosphere and asthenosphere. Comparisons between fast splitting directions and indicators such as topography, magnetic and gravity anomalies, upper mantle structure derived from tomography, and absolute plate motions reveal that the relative contributions from lithospheric and asthenospheric anisotropy likely vary laterally beneath the eastern US.",

Although these products represent the same measure, they are produced at different spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions using different algorithms. The different approaches used to retrieve the temperatures and emissivities result in discrepancies and inconsistencies between the different products.\nNASA has identified a major need to develop long-term, consistent, and calibrated data and products that are valid across multiple missions and satellite sensors.

The unified Emissivity ESDR will be produced globally at 5km in mean monthly time-steps and for 12 bands from 3.6-14.3 micron and extended to 417 bands using a PC regression approach.

            "abstract": "This study examines connections between mean sea level (MSL) variability and diurnal and semidiurnal tidal constituent variations in the western tropical Pacific Ocean, a region showing anomalous MSL rise over the last 20 years and strong inter-annual variability. MSL fluctuations are found to be correlated to tidal amplitude and phase fluctuations at 13 of 17 open-ocean and 7 of 9 continental shelf tide gauges, after de-trending the time series. Twenty statistically significant tidal anomaly trends (TATs) in both phase and amplitude are found for the two largest tidal constituents, K1 (diurnal) and M2 (semidiurnal). Smaller constituents (O1 and S2) show significant trends at nearly half of all gauges. MSL fluctuations are concurrent with shifts in tidal amplitudes and phases, and both positive and negative relations are observed. Changing overtides suggest TATs are influenced by changing shallow water friction over the equatorial Western Pacific and the eastern coast of Australia (especially near the Great Barrier Reef). At stations around the Solomon Islands, a strong connection is observed between semidiurnal TATs and changes in thermocline depth, overtide generation, and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). TATs for O1, K1, and M2 are related to each other in a manner that is consistent with resonant triad interactions. Since the response of tides to MSL variability is spatially complex and frequency dependent; short-term responses may not predict long-term behavior.",

A leveling survey was performed, conforming to 1st order, class II specifications. A GPS survey was performed using 24 to 48 hour occupations. Absolute gravity, relative gravity, and gravity gradient measurements were also collected during the survey. In addition, deflections of the vertical were acquired at 200 eccentric survey benchmarks using the Compact Digital Astrometric Camera (CODIAC) camera. This paper presents the preliminary results of the survey, including the accuracy analysis of the leveling data, GPS ellipsoidal heights, and the deflections of the vertical which serves as an independent data set in addition to the GPS/leveling implied geoid heights.",

            "abstract": "Methane is the third most reduced environmentally relevant electron donor for microbial metabolisms after organic carbon and hydrogen. In anoxic ecosystems, the major sink for methane is anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mediated by syntrophic microbial consortia that couple AOM to reduction of an oxidized electron acceptor to yield free energy. In marine sediments, AOM is generally coupled to reduction of sulfate despite an extremely small amount of free energy yield because sulfate is the most abundant electron acceptor in seawater. While AOM coupled to Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction (Fe- and Mn-AOM) is 10-30x more thermodynamically favorable than sulfate-AOM, and geochemical data suggests that it occurs in diverse environments, the microorganisms mediating Fe- and Mn-AOM remain unknown. Lake Matano, Indonesia is an ideal ecosystem to enrich for Fe- and Mn-AOM microbes because its anoxic ferruginous deep waters and sediments contain abundant Fe(III), Mn(IV) and methane, and extremely low sulfate and nitrate. Our research aims to isolate and characterize the microbes mediating Fe- and Mn-AOM from three layers of Lake Matano sediments through serial enrichment cultures in minimal media lacking nitrate and sulfate. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of sediment inoculum revealed the presence of the Fe(III)-reducing bacterium Geobacter (5-10% total microbial community in shallow sediment and 35-60% in deeper sediment) as well as 1-2% Euryarchaeota implicated in methane cycling, including ANME-1 and 2d and Methanosarcinales. After 90 days of primary enrichment, all three sediment layers showed high levels of Fe(III) reduction (60-90 µM Fe(II) d-1) in the presence of methane compared to no methane and heat-killed controls. Treatments with added Fe(III) as goethite contained higher abundances of Geobacter than the inoculum (60-80% in all layers), suggesting that Geobacter may be mediating Fe(III) reduction in these enrichments. Quantification of AOM rates is underway, and will be used to estimate the plausibility of metal-AOM as a thermodynamically favorable methane sink in anoxic ecosystems of both the modern and ancient Earth.",

            "abstract": "Particle-based numerical simulations allow detailed investigations of small-scale processes and mechanisms associated with fault initiation and slip, which emerge naturally in such models. This study investigates the evolving mechanical conditions and associated micro-mechanisms during transient slip on a weak decollement propagating beneath a growing contractional wedge (e.g., accretionary prism, fold and thrust belt). The models serve as analogs of the seismic cycle, although lacking full earthquake dynamics. Nonetheless, the mechanical evolution of both decollement and upper plate can be monitored, and correlated with the particle-scale physical and contact properties, providing insights into changes that accompany such stick-slip behavior. In this study, particle assemblages consolidated under gravity and bonded to impart cohesion, are pushed at a constant velocity above a weak, unbonded decollement surface. Forward propagation of decollement slip occurs in discrete pulses, modulated by heterogeneous stress conditions (e.g., roughness, contact bridging) along the fault. Passage of decollement slip resets the stress along this horizon, producing distinct patterns: shear stress is enhanced in front of the slipped decollement due to local contact bridging and fault locking; shear stress minima occur immediately above the tip, denoting local stress release and contact reorganization following slip; more mature portions of the fault exhibit intermediate shear stress, reflecting more stable contact force distributions and magnitudes. This pattern of shear stress pre-conditions the decollement for future slip events, which must overcome the high stresses at the fault tip. Long-term slip along the basal decollement induces upper plate contraction. When upper plate stresses reach critical strength conditions, new thrust faults break through the upper plate, relieving stresses and accommodating horizontal shortening. Decollement activity retreats back to the newly formed thrust fault. The cessation of upper plate fault slip causes gradual increases in upper plate stresses, rebuilding shear stresses along the decollement and enabling renewed pulses of decollement slip. Thus, upper plate deformation occurs out of phase with decollement propagation.",

In situ measurements capture variability over very short time intervals, but with limited spatial coverage, and at significant cost and risk to deploy. Conversely, airborne and satellite remote sensing is capable of measuring changes over large spatial extents but at limited temporal resolution. Here we use a near-situ approach to observing dynamic glacier behavior. Terrestrial LiDAR Scanning (TLS) combines the rapid acquisition capabilities of in situ measurements with the broad spatial coverage of traditional remote sensing, and can be carried out from a safe off-ice location. Repeat (30 min) high-resolution, long-range (6-10km) TLS surveys were conducted at Helheim Glacier, southeast Greenland, during July 9-14, 2014, and coincident in situ global positioning system (GPS) observations were acquired close to the glacier terminus. Analysis of these data allows for independent estimates of flow displacement and verification of 3D analytic techniques for quantifying vector motion. These techniques will enable the automated processing of large volumes of repeat scanning data to be collected during planned the deployment of an autonomous version of our LiDAR scanning system.",

            "abstract": "Much of Equatorial Asia is currently undergoing extensive burning from agricultural fires and rapid land-use conversion to oil palm plantations, with substantial consequences for air quality and health. In June 2013, Singapore experienced severe smoke levels, with surface particulate matter concentrations greater than ten times average. Unlike past haze events in Singapore (e.g. September 1997 and October 2006), the June 2013 pollution event occurred during El Nino-neutral conditions. Using a combination of observations and chemical transport modeling, we examine relationships between sea surface temperatures, wind fields, fire patterns, and aerosol optical depth during the June 2013 haze event. We find reasonable agreement between satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the MODIS and MISR instruments and in-situ measurements from the AERONET stations across Equatorial Asia for 2005-2010 (MODIS R2 = 0.39, bias = -1.6%; MISR R2 = 0.27, bias = -42%). However, AOD observations fail to capture the Singapore pollution event of June 2013. Simulations with the GEOS-Chem model suggest that anomalously high dust concentrations during June 2013 may have impaired the ability of MODIS to monitor the haze over Singapore. In contrast, we show that the OMI Aerosol Index can effectively capture these smoke events and may be used to monitor future haze episodes in Equatorial Asia. We find that the June 2013 haze in Singapore may be attributed to anomalously strong westerlies carrying smoke from Riau Province in Indonesia. These westerlies, 5 m s-1 faster than the 2005-2010 mean June winds, are consistent with the phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) crossing the Maritime Continent at that time. These westerlies may have been further enhanced by a negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), an east-west gradient in sea surface temperature anomalies across the Indian Ocean, with cold sea surface temperature anomalies (-3 C°) off the Arabian coast and warm anomalies (+2 C°) in the East. These conditions appear to provide an important meteorological pathway by which land-use change fires in Indonesia may affect the health of large populations. Our work suggests that this pathway should be taken into account in the development of strategies to curb fire-related air pollution and health effects in Indonesia.",

            "abstract": "The idea of reading and understanding scientific articles can be daunting to beginning geology students. A student driven question “How do I read a scientific paper?” became the catalyst for a 1-unit special topic course, specifically devoted to the process of reading scientific articles. Five students participated in the course, which focused on research articles pertaining to an upcoming field study in Death Valley. The course was divided into four main portions: locating articles, reading and understand scientific articles, applying of articles in the field, and creating an abstract. Articles were located electronically through the Palomar College library. The first step was to teach students how to navigate databases for the desired material. Part Two was the most challenging and time consuming: the process of reading, analyzing, and comprehending scholarly articles. What made the course interesting was the student driven approach to the articles. Under guidance of an instructor, students worked as a group, navigating two different articles while developing their own strategies to obtain the basic concepts of the article. Each student then had to analyze an additional two articles of their choosing. During this time observations were made on student confidence, methods developed to assist in understanding articles, student challenges and successes.\nInformation gained from the articles was then applied during a five day field course in Death Valley. Each student gave a brief presentation about the two articles read independently, applying them to various settings in the Death Valley region. Upon returning from the trip, students were tasked with contacting an author from one of the papers. The final portion of the special topic course was for students to produce their own abstracts, requiring them to condense a semester’s worth of work into a short amount of words. From this 1-unit course, students learned there is no one way to read a scientific article, and never is reading an article just once ever enough. It takes multiple readings and multiple analyses before a reader fully comprehends what the writer of the article is discussing. In conclusion this course gave students a foundation in understanding how to read scientific articles.",

            "abstract": "Extreme El Niño events and warming conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific have been linked to pronounced spatial displacements of the South Pacific Convergence Zone known as “zonal SPCZ” events.. Using a global dataset of Lagrangian back trajectories computed with the FLEXPART model for the period 1980-2013, comprehensive analysis of the 3D circulation characteristics associated with the SPCZ is undertaken. Ten days history of along-trajectory specific humidity, potential vorticity and temperature are reconstructed for zonal SPCZ events as well as other states,, with differences related to El Niño intensity and development stage as well as the state of the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool. How zonal events influence precipitation over the Eastern Tropical Pacific is examined using back trajectories, reanalysis, TRMM precipitation, and additional satellite derived cloud information. It is found that SPCZ displacements are associated with enhanced convection over the Eastern Tropical Pacific in good agreement with prior work. The connection between intensification of precipitation over the eastern Tropical Pacific during zonal events and suppression of rainfall over the Maritime continent is also described.",

            "abstract": "The recent boom in production of natural gas from unconventional reservoirs has generated a substantial increase in the volume of produced brine that must be properly managed to prevent contamination of fresh water resources. Produced brine, which includes both flowback and formation water, is often highly saline and may contain elevated concentrations of naturally occurring radioactive material and other toxic elements. These characteristics present many challenges with regard to designing effective treatment and disposal strategies for shale gas produced brine.\nWe will present results from a series of batch experiments where crushed samples from two shale formations in the Michigan Basin, the Antrim and Utica-Collingwood shales, were brought into contact with synthetic hydraulic fracturing fluids under in situ temperature and pressure conditions. The Antrim has been an active shale gas play for over three decades, while the Utica-Collingwood formation (a grouped reservoir consisting of the Utica shale and Collingwood limestone) is an emerging shale gas play. The goal of this study is to investigate the influence of water-rock interactions in controlling produced water quality.\nWe evaluate toxic element leaching from shale samples in contact with model hydraulic fracturing fluids under system conditions corresponding to reservoir depths up to 1.5 km. Experimental results have begun to elucidate the relative importance of shale mineralogy, system conditions, and chemical additives in driving changes in produced water quality. Initial results indicate that hydraulic fracturing chemical additives have a strong influence on the extent of leaching of toxic elements from the shale. In particular, pH was a key factor in the release of uranium (U) and divalent metals, highlighting the importance of the mineral buffering capacity of the shale. Low pH values persisted in the Antrim and Utica shale experiments and resulted in higher U extraction efficiencies than that observed in the presence of the carbonate-rich Collingwood limestone. In addition to assessing U leaching, we also measured the activity of 226Ra and 228Ra via high-resolution gamma ray spectroscopy. Laboratory results will be compared to observations from a complimentary field sampling campaign of Antrim produced brine.",

            "abstract": "Arctic soils contain a large pool of terrestrial C and are of great interest because of their potential for releasing significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Few attempts have been made, however, to derive quantitative budgets of CO2 and CH4 budgets for high-latitude ecosystems. Therefore, this study used naturally occurring geochemical and isotopic tracers to estimate production pathways and transformations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC = Σ (total) dissolved CO2) and dissolved CH4 in soil pore waters from 17 locations (drainages) in Barrow, Alaska (USA) in July and September, 2013; and to approximate a complete balance of belowground C cycling at our sampling locations. Results suggest that CH4 was primarily derived from biogenic acetate fermentation, with a shift at 4 locations from July to September towards CO2 reduction as the dominant methanogenic pathway. A large majority of CH4 produced at the frost table methane was transferred directly to the atmosphere via plant roots and ebullition (94.0 ± 1.4% and 96.6 ± 5.0% in July and September). A considerable fraction of the remaining CH4 was oxidized to CO2 during upward diffusion in July and September, respectively. Methane oxidization produced <1% of CO2 relative to alternative production mechanisms in deep subsurface pore waters. The majority of subsurface CO2 was produced from anaerobic respiration, likely due to reduction of Fe oxides and humics (52 ± 6 to 100 ± 13%, on average) while CO2 produced from methanogenesis accounted for the remainder (0 ± 13% to 47 ± 6%, on average) for July and September, respectively. Dissolved CH4 and dissolved CO2 concentrations correlated with thaw depth, suggesting that Arctic ecosystems will likely produce and release a greater amount of greenhouse gasses under projected warming and deepening of active layer thaw depth under future climate change scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Cryospheric environments, such as ice sheets and glaciers, are particularly sensitive to perturbations in radiative forcing due to climate change. In recent decades, research in Arctic regions has revealed unique local-scale chemistry related to the greenhouse gas ozone and chemical interactions with snow and ice surfaces. Additionally, these remote regions are often impacted by long range transport events that bring atmospheric pollutants, including both gases and atmospheric particles, from anthropogenic sources and biomass burning; these pollutants can reduce visibility, change absorption and/or scattering of solar radiation, and lead to reductions in snow albedo (e.g., through deposition of black carbon). Both ozone and black carbon particles have consequences on radiative forcing and can lead to increased snow ablation and glacier recession. The Juneau Icefield is a temperate tidewater glacier network located east of Juneau, Alaska. In July 2014, as part of the Juneau Icefield Research Program, we conducted a pilot study including measurements of ozone, size-resolved atmospheric particles, and atmospheric black carbon, in conjunction with snowpack black carbon, inorganic ion, and albedo measurements. Here, we present the initial findings from this study and discuss local-scale atmospheric composition and impacts of long-range transport on snow albedo.",

            "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of climate change in recent decades has been the dramatic warming of the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), whereas the Eastern AIS (EAIS) has experienced a slight, and insignificant cooling trend. Here we examine the extent to which this spatial asymmetry in Antarctic surface air temperature (SAT) trends might be a response to anthropogenic climate forcings, such as greenhouse gas emissions and ozone depletion, or rather the manifestation of large natural climate variability.\nWe compare the observed annual mean Antarctic SAT over the 1960-2005 and 1979-2005 time periods to SAT data from 40 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical integrations. We find that the CMIP5 multi-model mean shows near-homogeneous warming throughout Antarctica, i.e. it lacks the observed spatial asymmetry between WAIS and EAIS. As the multi-model mean is, by construction, the forced response, we conclude that the observed spatial asymmetry in Antarctic SAT results from natural variability, which acts to mask the anthropogenic warming in the EAIS region, while amplifying the WAIS warming.\nIn addition, contrasting historical (i.e., forced) and pre-industrial (i.e., control) integrations from these same 40 CMIP5 models, we show that the observed total Antarctic and EAIS SAT trends fall well within the distribution of trends arising naturally in the system, and that the forced response in the models is small compared to the natural variability. In contrast, we do find that the WAIS SAT trend is more likely driven by anthropogenic forcings.",

            "abstract": "In order to understand how the climate responds to variations in forcing, one necessary component is to understand the full distribution of variability of exchanges of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and ocean. Surface heat and moisture fluxes are critical to the generation and decay of many coupled air-sea phenomena. These mechanisms operate across a number of scales and contain contributions from interactions between the anomalous (i.e. non-mean), often extreme-valued, flux components. Satellite-derived estimates of the surface turbulent and radiative heat fluxes provide an opportunity to assess results from modeling systems. Evaluation of only time mean and variability statistics, however only provides limited traceability to processes controlling what are often regime-dependent errors. This work will present an approach to evaluate the representation of the turbulent fluxes at the air-sea interface in the current and evolving Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model. A temperature and moisture vertical profile-based clustering technique is used to identify robust weather regimes, and subsequently intercompare the turbulent fluxes and near-surface parameters within these regimes in both satellite estimates and GEOS-driven data sets. Both model reanalysis (MERRA) and seasonal-to-interannual coupled GEOS model simulations will be evaluated. Particular emphasis is placed on understanding the distribution of the fluxes including extremes, and the representation of near-surface forcing variables directly related to their estimation. Results from these analyses will help identify the existence and source of regime-dependent biases in the GEOS model ocean surface turbulent fluxes. The use of the temperature and moisture profiles for weather-state clustering will be highlighted for its potential broad application to 3-D output typical of model simulations.",

Water vapor plumes have been observed emanating from the southern hemispheres of Enceladus and Europa (Hansen et al. 2011, Roth et al. 2014), and N2plumes carrying ice and ark particles on Triton (Soderblom et al. 2009).\nThe gas and ice grain distributions in the Enceladus plume depend on the subsurface gas properties and the geometry of the fissures e.g., (Schmidt et al. 2008, Ingersoll et al. 2010). Of course the fissures can have complex geometries due to tidal stresses, melting, freezing etc., but directly sampled and inferred gas and grain properties for the plume (source rate, bulk velocity, terminal grain velocity) can be used to provide a basis to constrain characteristic dimensions of vent width and depth. We used a 2-dimensional Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique to model venting from both axi-symmetric canyons with widths ~2 km and narrow jets with widths ~15-40 m. For all of our vent geometries, considered the water vapor source rates (1027­ – 1028 s-1) and bulk gas velocities (~330 – 670 m/s) obtained at the surface were consistent with inferred values obtained by fits of the data for the plume densities (1026 – 1028 s-1, 250 – 1000 m/s) respectively. However, when using the resulting DSMC gas distribution for the canyon geometries to integrate the trajectories of ice grains we found it insufficient to accelerate submicron ice grains to Enceladus’ escape speed. On the other hand, the gas distributions in the jet like vents accelerated grains > 10 μm significantly above Enceladus’ escape speed. It has been suggested that micron-sized grains are ejected from the vents with speeds comparable to the Enceladus escape speed.\nHere we report on these results including comparisons to results obtained from 1D models as well as discuss the implications of our plume model results. We also show preliminary results for similar considerations applied to Europa.\n",

Flank vents and flank eruptions have been documented and studied on a number of terrestrial volcanoes and to a lesser degree on Mars. The distribution of volcanic vents about a central caldera can provide information on radial dikes and tectonic stresses acting on the volcano, and can constrain models involving the emplacement and flexure of the edifice (e.g. Nakamura, 1976; McGovern and Solomon, 1993). In the absence of spectral data (due to optically thick dust cover) and in situ observations, morphology is a powerful tool for ascertaining the eruptive and tectonic history of Olympus Mons. Approximately 190 high-resolution CTX (Context Camera) images covering Olympus Mons have been mosaicked together. The analysis of a CTX mosaic reveals Mars’s largest shield volcano in stunning detail and allows for a thorough analysis of the targeted features.\nPreliminary results show numerous flank vents some of which produce leveed channels on the slopes of Olympus Mons. Some vents display varying morphologies, suggesting that the style of volcanism has evolved over time. Flank vents are observed to occur over a range of elevations, although a paucity of vents is observed on the lower flank. Analyses are ongoing and include mapping the spatial and elevation distribution of flank vents on the shield. Once mapped, the distribution of flank vents will define the orientation of tectonic stresses acting on Olympus Mons and help determine whether they are influenced by underlying topography, regional scale processes or a combination of both. In addition, these vents act as a window into the subsurface which can help characterize dike emplacement within the shield. Furthermore, the morphology of flank vents will provide information on the evolution of their eruptive styles. All of this information is crucial to help understand the volcanic history of Olympus Mons and similar constructs on Mars.\n",

            "abstract": "Urban development has radically transformed landscapes, and along with it, how our cities and suburbs cycle energy and water. One unfortunate outcome of urbanization is the production of massive volumes of uncontrolled runoff volume. Our civic infrastructure is sometimes marginally capable of handling even dry-weather fluxes without wastewater system overflows, much less the challenges of wet-weather events. The predominance of runoff volume in urban water balance has had serious ramifications for regulatory activity, municipal financial matters, and public health. In the interest of protecting human health and the environment, my group’s research has primarily addressed the integration of social equity, economic stabilization, and environmental management to underpin the development of sustainable urban water cycles. In this talk, I will present on: 1) the Shepherd Creek Stormwater Management project wherein an economic incentive was used to recruit citizen stormwater managers and distribute parcel-level, green infrastructure-based stormwater control measures; and 2) our urban soil pedologic-hydrologic assessment protocol that we use as a way of understanding the capacity for urban soils to provide ecosystem services, and in cities representing each of the major soil orders.",

This method involves the mapping of both the potential from the ionosphere and the perpendicular magnetic field from the inner magnetosphere to the ghost cells of the computational domain. The single fluid Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) model is used to verify this method. The comparisons of simulations using the standard hardwall boundary conditions of the LFM model and the flux-conserving boundary conditions show that the method reported here improves the transparency of the boundary for the flow of low-frequency (essentially DC) electromagnetic energy flux along field lines. As a consequence, the field-aligned DC Poynting flux just above the boundary is very nearly equal to the ionospheric Joule heating, as it should be if electromagnetic energy is conserved.",

            "abstract": "Simulation models are widely employed to make probability forecasts on seasonal to annual time-scales and increasingly on decadal scales. While simulation models based on physical principles are often expected, in principle, to outperform purely empirical models, that claim must be established empirically for any given generation of models; direct comparison of the forecast skill of simulation models and empirical models provides information on progress toward that goal which is not available in model-model intercomparisons. More importantly, the blending of forecasts from both sources can lead to better operational forecasts. Direct comparison can also reveal the space and time scales on which simulation models exploit their physical basis effectively, perhaps indicating the origins of their weaknesses. The skill of seasonal and decadal probabilistic hindcasts for global and regional mean temperatures from the ENSEMBLES project and CMIP5 are interpreted in this context. Physically inspired empirical models are shown to display probabilistic skill comparable to that of today’s state-of-the-art simulation models as well as to that of the multi-model ensemble. The inclusion of empirical models (blending) with simulation models is shown to significantly improve forecasts. Inasmuch as the cost of building or running empirical models is negligible comparing to large simulation models, it is suggested that the direct comparison of simulation models with empirical models become a regular component of large model forecast evaluations, that rank order evaluations include empirical models whenever the timescales allow, and that blending simulation models with empirical models becomes a regular component of seasonal and decadal forecasting.",

            "abstract": "The North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ), spanning over 1200 km from Karliova in eastern Turkey to the Aegean Sea, defines complex active fault zone. The zone consists of network of subfaults, each of varying geometry, and associated failure properties. The Erzincan basin, one of a series basins along the NAFZ, is active basin surrounding bedrock which is Mesozoic and Tertiary units. Available geophysical data constrain the total thickness of Pliocene and Quaternary sediments in the Erzincan basin to more than 2 km. The basin was affected by the 1992 March 13 Erzincan earthquake (Ms=6.8) showing weakly developed surface ruptures.\nWe excavated 6 paleoseismic trenches along the southeastern termination of the 1992 rupture in Üzümlü area. A total of trenches is 294 m long and trends N20°-30°E. Exposed lithology in trenches is made up of alluvial fan deposites and fluvial facies with rare flood-plain sediments, which are characterized by stratified and/or lens-shaped pebble gravel to coarse-grained sand, silt, and clay. Our preliminary interpretation of trenches reveals evidence of 1992 earthquake features. Trench logs showing structural elements including normal faults, which are parallel to the strike of the trace of the NAFZ and dipping 40°-75° to the northeast and the southwest, and network of almost vertical fractures with a few centimeters displacement. Some of trenches contain well-developed flame structures, suggesting liquefaction of water-saturated sediments during earthquake.\nSeismic velocity (VP and VP/VS) images obtained from the 3-D local earthquake tomography using the arrival time data of aftershocks of the 13 March 1992 Erzincan earthquake show several anomalies related to geological features of the Erzincan basin. The tomographic results indicate that (1) the major fault zones control the regional tectonics and the geometry of the Erzincan basin, (2) sediments of the basin show low seismic velocity, and (3) The high velocity units characterized by ophiolitic and metamorphic rocks in the north and carbonate rocks in the south bordering the basin.\nWe conclude that surface rupture of the 1992 Erzincan earthquake is much longer than surface ruptures shown in maps and 3-D VP and 3-D VP/VS anomalies represent the lithology and structure of the Erzincan basin, respectively.",

Here we present the first results of HCHO retrievals from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS). We apply an innovative principal component analysis (PCA) retrieval algorithm to extract a set of principal components (PCs) from OMPS-measured radiances between 325.0 and 356.5 nm over presumably clean oceanic regions. Since the background loading of HCHO due to methane oxidation is very small over these areas, the leading PCs (that explain the most variation in radiances) represent spectral features associated with various physical processes (e.g., ozone absorption, rotational Raman scattering) and measurement details (e.g., wavelength shift) other than those related to HCHO absorption. The vertical column density of HCHO is then derived by fitting the PCs and HCHO Jacobians calculated with a radiative transfer model to OMPS-measured radiance spectra. Our retrievals highlight the diverse nature of HCHO sources. Summertime maxima in HCHO detected over the eastern U.S. are likely due to biogenic emissions, while seasonal hot spots observed over West and Central Africa and Russia are mainly attributed to biomass burning emissions. Efforts have also been made to distinguish between anthropogenic and biogenic precursors of HCHO. Finally, the OMPS PCA HCHO retrievals are compared to OMI HCHO data produced with different Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) algorithms, in an effort to understand and reconcile the differences between various satellite HCHO datasets.",

Neutrons are produced by the rover's Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) and by interactions of high energy galactic cosmic rays (GCR) within the atmosphere and regolith. As these neutrons propagate through the subsurface, their energies can be moderated by interactions with hydrogen nuclei. More hydrogen leads to greater moderation (thermalization) of the neutron population energies. The presence of high thermal neutron absorbing elements within the regolith also complicates the spectrum of the returning neutron population, as shown by Hardgrove et al. DAN measures the thermal and epithermal neutron populations leaking from the surface to infer the amount of water equivalent hydrogen (WEH) in the shallow regolith. Extensive modeling is performed using a Monte Carlo approach (MCNPX) to analyze DAN passive measurements at fixed locations and along rover traverse segments. DAN passive WEH estimates along Curiosity's traverse will be presented along with an analysis of trends in the data and a description of correlations between these results and the geologic characteristics of the surfaces traversed.",

            "abstract": "Porphyry copper deposits commonly occur in arc-related settings where ore-metals are transported by magmas from the mantle wedge to shallow depths, and subsequently partition into the exsolving volatile phase. The partitioning of Cu between crystallizing silicate, oxide and sulfide minerals, sulfide melts and magmatic volatiles will determine the efficiency of Cu transfer into the magmatic-hydrothermal system. Understanding the Cu partitioning behavior between crystallizing mineral phases and silicate melt during crystallization fractionation is therefore fundamentally important. Among the crystallizing phases, amphibole is stable across a wide pressure (P) - temperature (T) range in hydrous arc magmas. Therefore, if the partition coefficients of Cu between amphibole and silicate melts are well constrained, the measured variation of Cu concentrations in natural amphibole crystals can be used to reconstruct the evolution of the Cu concentration in the silicate melt.\nIn this study, a series of experiments were conducted by piston cylinder apparatus over a wide range of melt compositions (andesitic to rhyolitic) to determine the amphibole/melt partition coefficient of Cu. The experiments were run at T = 740 - 990 °C, P = 0.7 GPa, and oxygen fugacity (fO2) between NNO +0.75 and NNO +2. The metal activities were imposed by using Au97Cu3 and Au92Cu8 alloy capsules. The apparent Cu solubilities in both the silicate melt and amphibole phases decrease with decreasing temperature. The Cu concentrations in a dacite melt increase approximately by factor of 3 while fO2 increases from NNO +0.75 to NNO +2. However, the amphibole/melt partition coefficient of Cu remains nearly constant at a value of 0.067 ± 0.013 (1 σ), indicating that the partitioning of Cu is not significantly affected by melt composition, fO2 and water concentrations. Therefore, determination of Cu concentrations in amphiboles may be a suitable tool to monitor the evolution of the Cu budget of ore-related magma reservoirs during magma evolution in porphyry cooper systems. In addition, our results showed that Cu is always incompatible in amphibole; therefore, occasionally measured high Cu concentrations in amphibole are likely an artifact of the presence of submicroscopic sulfide inclusions.",

DOC, as an important composition of the carbon cycling, leaches from the terrestrial watersheds is a large source of marine DOC.\nThe Penobscot River basin in north-central Maine is the second largest watershed in New England, which drains in to Gulf of Maine. Approximately 89% of the watershed is forested (Griffith and Alerich, 1996).Studying temporal and spatial changes in DOC export can help us to understand terrestrial carbon cycling and to detect any shifts from carbon sink to carbon source or visa versa in northern latitude forested ecosystems.Despite for the importance of understanding carbon cycling in terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemistry, the Doc export, especially the combination of DOC production from bio-system and DOC transportation from the terrestrial in to stream has been lightly discussed in most conceptual or numerical models.\nThe Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), which has been successfully applied in many study sites, is a physical process based terrestrial model that has the ability to simulate both the source and transportation of DOC by combining both hydrological and ecological processes.\nThe focus of this study is on simulating the DOC concentration and flux from the land to the water using RHESSys in the Penobscot watershed. The simulated results will be compared with field measurement of DOC from the watershed to explore the spatial and temporal DOC export pattern. This study will also enhance our knowledge to select sampling locations properly and also improve our understanding on DOC production and transportation in terrestrial forest ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "The vertical transport by gravity waves and turbulent mixing plays a fundamental role in establishing the thermal and constituent structures of the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region. By using the high resolution Na Doppler Lidar measurements, located at Andes Lidar Observatory, Cerro Pechón, Chile (30.00S, 71.00W), direct measurements of vertical fluxes of heat and constituent induced by dissipating but non-breaking gravity waves are derived from vertical wind, temperature and sodium density profiles between 85 and 100 km. Furthermore, estimate of eddy heat and constituent fluxes of the turbulent mixing generated by breaking gravity waves can also be made by using the upgraded ultra-high resolution Na Doppler Lidar. Additionally, the associated eddy diffusion coefficients (kH and kzz) are calculated for the first time. The results show that the vertical transport velocities of mesospheric Na and heat caused by turbulent mixing are comparable with dynamical and chemical transport velocities by dissipating GWs. These observations will certainly benefit the parameterization of GW models and help us understand of the vertical transport better in the MLT region.",

Records of εNd across the last deglaciation (Termination 1, T1) provide valuable information about water mass mixing that has improved our understanding of the ocean dynamics relevant to the process of deglaciation. However, questions remain concerning end-member source characteristics and regional hydrographic processes. Here we present a high resolution record of εNd derived from fish debris from ODP site 1063 across Termination 2. The different external and internal forcing (e.g. insolation versus freshwater) applicable to T2 make this a useful comparator for studies focused on T1. Accordingly we find large (up to 4 εNd units) fluctuations across T2 that can be related to high latitude climate changes as recorded by ice cores and other high resolution climate archives. We also identify periods of extremely negative values that require new explanations for changing end-member compositions. Our results have important implications for understanding North Atlantic deep water formation processes during critical climate transitions.",

            "abstract": "Arctic ecosystems are experiencing rapid change associated with amplified rates of climate warming. A general increase in vegetation productivity has been among the expected responses for terrestrial ecosystems in the Arctic. However, recent evidence from satellite derived productivity metrics has revealed a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in the magnitude, and even the direction, of productivity trends in recent decades. Declines in productivity may seem counterintuitive in what are traditionally thought to be temperature limited ecosystems. However a warmer and drier atmosphere in conjunction with changing permafrost conditions may impose hydrologic stresses on vegetation as well. Many Siberian ecosystems receive annual precipitation inputs characteristics of arid and semiarid regions. Boreal forests persist because permafrost acts as an aquatard trapping water near the surface and because historically cool growing season temperatures have kept atmospheric evaporative demand relatively low. As climate change simultaneously warms the atmosphere and deepens the active layer it is likely that vegetation will experience a higher degree of hydrologic limitation, perhaps necessitating the reallocation of resources. Here we use sap flux observations of canopy transpiration to understand the influence of atmospheric and permafrost conditions on the function of an arctic boreal forest in northeastern Siberia. We find that individual trees exhibit stronger responses to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D) as the growing season progresses. Further, the magnitude of this response appears to be positively correlated with changes in the depth of permafrost thaw. These results imply that arctic boreal forests will need to adapt to increasing hydrologic stress in order to benefit from what are typically thought of as increasingly favorable growing conditions with continued climate change.",

            "abstract": "The volcanically-active Galapagos Islands are constructed upon a broad platform, with the westernmost islands being the most active, marking the present-day position of the Galapagos hotspot (mantle plume). This volcanic platform overlies relatively young oceanic lithosphere (<15 Myr) and exhibits unique morphologic features along its boundaries. The most spectacular of these features is a system of stepped terraces on the southwestern escarpment, with very large vertical relief (>3 km), and contrasting with relatively gentle slopes off the eastern platform edge toward the Carnegie ridge. Considering the horizontal lithostatic pressure differences associated with this bathymetric relief, along with the high temperatures within this young, hotspot-affected oceanic lithosphere and crust; it is likely that lower crustal flow contributes significantly, perhaps even dominantly, to lithospheric and crustal deformation within the Galapagos Platform. Using 2D numerical models that invoke a thin-sheet approximation for the Stokes' equation for a Newtonian fluid with space- and time-dependent viscosity, and assuming isostatic conditions, we show that: (1) the pronounced bathymetric rim along the Eastern platform region (where gravimetric studies indicate Airy isostasy) near Española Island may be the expression of a mature stage of a lower crustal flow front evolving asymptotically during the last ~3 Myr; (2) the spectacular system of stepped terraces along the southwestern edge of the platform may be explained by lower crustal flow-associated backward tilting of the bathymetric surface that, even with small amounts of angular change (~0.1 deg) and potentially occurring in non-isostatic regimes, effectively hinders the horizontal flow of lava. This process of backward-tilting may have been largely restricted to the last ~1 Myr of platform growth, and hence may be a unique event that may involve horizontal extrusion of large lava sheets from within the southwestward-marching lower-crustal flow front.",

Additionally, surfaces such as arid land, deserts and snow cover have brightness temperatures characteristics similar to precipitation Ongoing work by NASA’s GPM microwave radiometer team is constructing databases for the GPROF algorithm through a variety of means, however, there is much uncertainty as to what is the optimal information needed for the wide array of sensors in the GPM constellation, including examination of regional conditions. The at-launch database focuses on stratification by emissivity class, surface temperature and total precipitable water (TPW). We’ll perform sensitivity studies to determine the potential role of environmental factors such as land surface temperature, surface elevation, and relative humidity and storm morphology such as storm vertical structure, height, and ice thickness to improve precipitation estimation over land, including rain and snow. In other words, what information outside of the satellite radiances can help describe the background and subsequent departures from it that are active precipitating regions? It is likely that this information will be a function of the various precipitation regimes. Statistical methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be utilized in this task. Databases from a variety of sources are being constructed. They include existing satellite microwave measurements of precipitating and non-precipitating conditions, ground radar precipitation rate estimates, surface emissivity climatology from satellites, surface temperature and TPW from NWP reanalysis.  Results from the analysis of these databases with respect to the microwave precipitation sensitivity to the variety of environmental conditions in different climate regimes will be discussed.  ",

            "abstract": "The Santa Monica Mountains of Southern California have undergone moderate urbanization since 1960. Many of the riverine systems in the Santa Monica Mountains were intermittent just a few decades ago, and many are now perennial. The transition to perennial streams has led many policy makers to conclude that urban runoff from landscape watering accounts for continuous flows during the lengthy dry season. Transition to perennially flows allows expansion of habitat for exotic and harmful species, raising arguments for controls on urban runoff during the dry season. Major segments of the Santa Monica Mountains depend entirely on State Project Water imported from Northern California. Stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen show that imported water is isotopically distinct from local precipitation, providing a useful tool for tagging source flows in Santa Monica Mountain streams. In previous isotope investigations from 2006 to 2009, we performed detailed analysis of dry weather flows in major streams in the Santa Monica Mountains. These creeks transition from open space, through city, and back through open space obtaining most of their flow along the urban reach. Our studies showed that most creeks are dominantly fed by locally sourced, groundwater baseflow during dry weather. Streams contain small percentages of imported waters (~15%) and consequently small percentages of urban runoff. Updated monitoring during serious drought conditions from 2012 to 2014 provide similar results. We postulate that perennial flow in urban streams is probably a result of removal of riparian vegetation and deepening of channels along urban corridors, and not as much a result of urban runoff. These findings have important ramifications on policy decisions regarding stream restoration and mandatory controls on urban runoff.",

            "abstract": "The Central segment of the San Andreas Fault (CSAF) is characterized by a nearly continuous right-lateral aseismic slip. Geodetic observations of surface deformation along CSAF indicate interseismic strain accumulation with a rate of about 10 mm/yr. The creep rates obtained using Characteristic Repeating Earthquakes (CRE) show pulses of creep affecting most of the CSAF, suggesting spatiotemporal variability of seismic hazard. Therefore, a high resolution time-dependent model of creep on the CSAF can greatly enhance the knowledge of aseismic and seismic faulting processes as well as the seismic hazard estimates. \nWe used InSAR surface deformation time series in conjunction with observations of fault creep obtained from CRE. The SAR data set includes C-band scenes acquired by the ERS-2 and Envisat during period 2003-2011, comprising 46 images, resulted in about 150 interferograms. Within the same observation period, the CRE data set includes more than 630 repeating sequences. Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of creep, we implement a time-dependent modeling scheme, allowing us to jointly invert the surface deformation time series and CRE estimates of the fault creep.\nThe distribution of obtained creep rate on the CSAF includes features similar to that reported in earlier works. The map of long-term slip rate reveals that fastest creep rate occurs at the central part of CSAF with an average rate of 27 mm/yr, which is less than the long-term shearing rate. Moving northwestward, the slip rate gradually drops to less than half of its long-term rate. The spatiotemporal map of the creep includes unique features such as afterslip due to the 2004 Parkfield earthquake affecting the southeastern part of the CSAF and the clear evidence of creep pulsing along strike and depth of the CSAF with a period of 1.5 to 2 years. Considering 34.5 mm/yr as the long-term shearing rate, the zone of afterslip is characterized by relaxation time of about 16.35 years. The moment accumulation rate due to slip deficit is between 4.34 x 1017 and 4.51 x 1017 Nm/yr, which is equivalent to a magnitude 5.6-5.7 earthquake. Considering the contribution of afterslip due to the 2004 Parkfield earthquake in releasing the moment on the CSAF, the moment deficit drops to between 3.62 x 1017 and 3.82 x 1017 Nm/yr, equivalent to a magnitude 5.6 earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Rifted margin geometry is too complex and diverse to be explained by simple kinematic models. Instead, we consider the effects of strain localization and the growth of necking instabilities as they apply to rifted margins. The intrinsic layering of the lithosphere will affect the growth rate of necking instabilities, leading to depth-dependent extension. In addition, continents are far from homogeneous after multiple cycles of collision, strike-slip motion and rifting. The resulting inherited heterogeneities may serve to localize strain and initiate necking instabilities.\nWe use 2D finite element models containing embedded finite weak zones in the crust and/or mantle as well as a vertical lithospheric boundary across which lithospheric layering changes resulting in an overall strength contrast. We show that there are two controls on the style of rifting: Control 1, the stiff/pliable nature of the lithospheric layers and; Control 2, the distribution of the background strain rate in the lithosphere. Control 1 depends on the lithospheric rheology, such that necking instabilities grow faster in a stiff, dominantly plastic, layer than in equivalent layers with a pliable, mostly viscous, rheology. Control 2 is important where a strength contrast at a lithospheric boundary influences the distribution of the background strain rate. Necking is a mechanism that amplifies the background strain rate, which implies faster necking in parts of the lithosphere where background strain rates are highest. In a laterally homogeneous lithosphere, the background strain rate will be uniform in each layer and Control 1 will dominate giving necking in stiff layers. However, juxtaposed lithospheres with different strengths will distribute strain giving the weaker lithosphere the higher strain rate, implying the fastest necking may occur under Control 2 in pliable layers with the higher strain rate. An end-member case is where strong lithosphere acts as a rigid block. Here, no necking instability will develop, although inherited weaknesses may be present (Control 2). This has implications for the preservation of cratons, which are cold and strong, and probably stiff. Even though they contain inherited weak heterogeneities, they are protected by Control 2, provided they are surrounded by weakling lithospheres such as younger orogens.",

This allowed the longest vibroseismic traverse with continuous data acquisition in Antarctica, along a route from the Ekströmisen over the grounding line onto the ice sheet. We covered about 500 km distance within three weeks including 407 km seismic profile. 110 km of 6-fold data were acquired with 125 m shot spacing and 25 km of 3-fold data with 250 m shot spacing. The remaining distance was covered with 1-fold data.\nThe operational vibroseismic system consists of a vibroseis Buggy ‘EnviroVibe’ in combination with a 1.5 km long snow streamer towed behind a Pistenbully. The vibroseis on Mattracks was set onto a polyethylene sled to distribute the load of the vibroseis on the surface and allow flexibility on rough surfaces. The highest production was reached for an operation speed of 6 km/h ensuring minimal damage to the 1.5 km streamer, consisting of 60 channels with 8 geophones each. Still the setup allowed for the measurement of 20 km of seismic 6-fold data per day or 40 km/day for 1-fold data.\nThis survey allowed covering the bathymetry below the Ekströmisen, the bed topography within the catchment area of the Ekstömisen as well as englacial features. It was possible to map the ice shelf bottom and produce a clear image of the sea bed. The production speed allowed for high fold-coverage increasing image quality compared to 1-fold seismic data. Especially, the imaging of deepenings within the bed topography and their steep sidewalls shows the advantages and the additional information that can be gained from these seismic surveys compared to airborne or ground-penetrating radar data.\nWe present the overall characteristics of the different vibroseis sources and mounting set-ups investigated over the last six years and provide recommendation which set-up to use for which scientific questions and areas of interest. Our surveys demonstrate the potential to image englacial layering and sub-ice features and, thus, help increase our understanding of subglacial and englacial properties by the application of such an operational vibroseismic system.",

            "abstract": "Slip in subduction zones produce a range of events including typical seismicity, slow slip events, and non-volcanic tremor. Understanding the nature of the transition between these different types of slip is an important area of study in order to advance our understanding of the conditions required for the spectrum of slip. The portion of the Middle America subduction zone underneath Oaxaca, Mexico is an ideal place to study this relationship because a local land based seismic and geodetic network lies above a large portion of the seismogenic zone to capture large and small magnitude earthquakes. This is also an area with slow slip events, non-volcanic tremor, and evidence for an ultra slow velocity layer near the downdip transitional region. In order to study the earthquakes at the downdip transition, we use a catalog of small magnitude (M < 5.5) locally recorded events from 2006 to 2012, prior to the 2012 Mw 7.4 Ometepec, Mexico earthquake. For each downdip event in the catalog, we compute first motion focal mechanisms using a standard community algorithm, FocMec. We see significant heterogeneity in our focal mechanism solutions. Our results show a lack of thrust events in an area with a known megathrust seismic gamp updid and prominent slow slip events observed downdip. We also find an abundance of thrust events in an area with an ultra slow layer and east of the slow slip events. Further analysis of stress drop will be used to study temporal patterns relative to the slow slip events as well as the Ometepec event.",

            "abstract": "Using an online trajectory analysis tool NASA, ArcGIS, Satellite and EPA in situ data, we assess whether high pollution events in Texas are primarily sourced locally or remotely. We focus satellite data that exemplify high O3 and NO2 over Texas’s lower troposphere. Four day back trajectory analyses of all dates show that upper-, mid-, and lower-tropospheric air over Texas, containing high O3, is transported from the Gulf of Mexico, Southeast USA, Midwest USA, Northeast USA, the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Mexico, etc. Only day showed air at 1 km is sourced within Texas. Satellite data show O3 enhancements in the boundary layer and O3 and NO2 enhancements via tropospheric column profiles. These enhancements complement four-day trajectory analysis. This study provides a viable basis for more quantifiable and accurate information for developing effective air quality State Implementation Plans.\nSTEM Impact: (i) D.

Yet, few studies have examined forest canopy structural connections to soil microbial communities (SMCs), and none have measured how this affects SMC N functions. The maritime Quercus virginiana Mill. (southern live oak) forests of St Catherine’s Island, GA, USA provide an ideal opportunity to examine canopy structural alterations to SMCs and their functioning, as their throughfall varies substantially across space due to dense Tillandsia usneoides L. (spanish moss) mats bestrewn throughout. To examine the impact of throughfall variability on SMC N functions, we examined points along the canopy coverage continuum: large canopy gaps (0%), bare canopy (50-60%), and canopy of heavy T. usneoides coverage (>=85%). Five sites beneath each of the canopy cover types were monitored for throughfall water/ions and soil leachates chemistry for one storm each month over the growing period (7 months, Mar-2014 to Sep-2014) to compare with soil chemistry and SMC communities sampled every two months throughout that same period (Mar, May, Jul, Sep). DGGE and QPCR analysis of the N functioning genes (NFGs) to characterize the ammonia oxidizing bacterial (AOB-amoA), archaea (AOA-amoA), and ammonification (chiA) communities were used to determine the nitrification and decomposition potential of these microbial communities. PRS™-probes (Western Ag Innovations Inc., Saskatoon, Canada) were then used to determine the availability of NO3-N and NH4+N in the soils over a 6-week period to evaluate whether the differing NFG abundance and community structures resulted in altered N cycling.",

            "abstract": "Iron(II) was determined at sea on the US GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT), by chemiluminescence, along with total dissolved iron determined independently. Very high concentrations of Fe(II) (up to 25nM) were observed at all shelf stations, and constituted up to 100% of the total dissolved iron. West of the shelf, a subsurface maxima in Fe(II) coincident with the secondary nitrite maximum persisted as far as 950 W. Surprisingly, the largest subsurface plume of dissolved Fe was below the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), in the deep waters. Fe(II) does not appear to be responsible for the magnitude of that deep plume, although it probably contributes to high Fe observed within the OMZ. Further west, a large plume of dissolved Fe was observed that was derived from hydrothermal activity along the east Pacific Rise. There was no Fe(II) present, even at the station closest to the origin of the plume, indicating that Fe(II) declines rapidly under these oxygenated conditions despite reports that Fe(II) persists in particles of hydrothermal origin. The only exception was very near the seafloor along the ridge axis, where Fe(II) benthic fluxes were sampled directly. But this sampling was not conducted at actual vent sites. The absence of any Fe(II) signal within the main plume, where total dissolved and particulate Fe was high, provides confidence that the method does not have a significant Fe(III) interference. These results suggest that while Fe(II) plays an important role in benthic sources of both of the major deep sea Fe plumes observed on the cruise, their persistence is likely due to other factors, such as organic complexation.",

            "abstract": "LITES (Limb-imaging Ionospheric and Thermospheric Extreme-ultraviolet Spectrograph) is a compact imaging spectrograph for remote sensing of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. The instrument has been designed and built, and is undergoing testing and integration to prepare for flight aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the Space Test Program STP-H5 mission. With a passband in the extreme-ultraviolet from 60 to 140 nm, LITES will be able to image several key spectral lines as it observes Earth’s limb, such as the 61.7 and 83.4 nm O+ lines to probe the daytime ionosphere, and the 91.1 nm continuum and 135.6 nm neutral oxygen lines to remotely sense the nighttime ionosphere. LITES is one part of a comprehensive ionospheric instrument suite along with the GPS Radio Occultation and Ultraviolet Photometry-Colocated (GROUP-C) experiment which comprises a nadir-viewing UV photometer and a GPS receiver to measure radio occultation. Combined these experiments will provide unprecedented tomographic views of nighttime ionospheric structures on a global scale. We show how LITES observations will be complemented by ground-based data from an international network of digisondes, visible spectrographs, and imagers. These observatories will provide ground-truth for the LITES measurements which will span the globe and fill in the 70% of the Earth where no ground-based measurements are possible. We also present modeled LITES data highlighting improvements in sensitivity, bandwidth, and cadence from earlier-generation observatories. These improvements will allow for advanced studies of longitudinal variability in the low-latitude ionosphere and its transient structures such as ionospheric bubbles.\nThis work was supported by NSF 1145166 and ONR N00014-13-1-0266 grants.

Future and continued collaborations with other large research networks with complementary expertise will not only strengthen the Critical Zone Network, but also expand the breadth and depth of understanding of the role of the critical zone in global-scale phenomena. Two examples of key networks include the US National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the US and International Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER).

From the regional hydrology perspective, interactions between lakes and rivers are important as streamflow patterns can be significantly modified by lake storage, while lake levels can be modified by streamflows. In this study, using a suite of experiments performed with the fifth generation of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5), we try to assess the interactions between lakes and rivers and their impact on the atmosphere, over north-east Canada; in these simulations lakes are represented by the Hostetler model, while rivers are modelled using the modified WATROUTE scheme, including interflow. Comparison of CRCM5 simulations with and without lakes suggests big differences in winter/summer precipitation and winter temperature. CRCM5 simulations performed with and without lake-river interactions suggest improved representation of streamflows when lake storage is taken into account. Introduction of interflow shows some streamflow increases during summer and fall seasons, for majority of the rivers, and some impacts on the land atmosphere interactions via modified soil moisture.",

            "abstract": "During the last decade, several major storms have impacted the US Atlantic coast, including tropical storm Sandy in 2013 and tropical storms Irene and Lee in 2012. These storms, in particular, had major impacts on the watershed of the Hudson River Estuary, resulting in changes in the delivery and distribution of sediments. While Sandy generated a large storm surge that mostly effected the lower estuary, Irene and Lee caused significant flooding in the upper estuary that delivered ~2.7 million tons of sediment to the Hudson River Estuary, which according to USGS estimates is an amount equal to three times the annual load of ~700,000-800,000 metric? tons (Wall et al. 2008; Ralston et al., 2013).\nHere we report results from high-resolution Chirp subbottom surveys conducted in selected areas of the Hudson River in 2014. Areas were selected with the goal of investigating changes in the sediment deposition and storage in the Hudson River as a result of these events. The new survey lines were acquired following the tracks of earlier subbottom profiles that were collected as part of the Hudson River Benthic Mapping Project in the early 2000s, i.e. before the storms of 2012 and 2013, in a dense grid of subbottom profiles. We then compared these co-located profiles to determine changes between the profiles and to map out the spatial distribution of increased deposition in the selected areas. In several places, the data show clear increases of the thickness of depositional layers of over 0.25 m while in other areas these changes are less clear. Changes based on sub-bottom data will be compared to results obtained on sediment cores taken from the same areas. Preliminary analysis of the sediment cores indicates clear layers of recent sediments in some areas that correspond to the results of the subbottom analysis.",

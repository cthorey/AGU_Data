            "abstract": "Mesospheric temperature anomalies associated with Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) have been observed extensively in the polar regions. However, observations of these anomalies at midlatitudes are sparse. The very dense 11-year data set, collected between 1993–2004, with the Rayleigh-scatter lidar at the Atmospheric Lidar Observatory (ALO; 41.7°N, 111.8°W) at the Center for Atmospheric and Space Sciences (CASS) on the campus of Utah State University (USU), has been carefully examined for such anomalies. The temperatures derived from these data extend over the mesosphere, from 45 to 90 km. During this period extensive data were acquired during seven major SSW events. In this work we aim to determine the characteristics of the midlatitude mesospheric temperatures during these seven major SSWs. To do this, comparisons were made between the temperature profiles on individual nights before, during, and after the SSW events and the corresponding derived climatological temperature profiles (31-day by 11-year average) for those nights. A consistent disturbance pattern was observed in the mesospheric temperatures during these SSWs. A distinct shift from the nominal winter temperature pattern to a pattern more characteristic of summer temperatures was seen in the midlatitude mesosphere close to when the zonal winds in the polar stratosphere (at 10 hPa, 60° N) reversed from eastward to westward. This shift lasted for several days. This change in pattern included coolings in the upper mesosphere, comparable to those seen in the polar regions, and warmings in the lower mesosphere.",

            "abstract": "This work examines the largely unexplored role of clay spatial patterns in dictating Cr(VI) sorption using column experiment and numerical simulations. We investigate the impacts of permeability contrasts, correlation lengths, and column lengths.\nExperiments were carried out using columns (10 cm) packed with the same total mass of illite and quartz sand however different spatial patterns and permeability contrast (kratio). Higher kratio with low permeability and flow-parallel illite pattern minimize the water flow through the illite zone, leading to more than one orders of magnitude lower sorption capacity compared to those with well mixed illite and quartz grains. Two-dimensional reactive transport models that explicitly incorporate the mineral distribution were used to reproduce the data and to understand the mechanism. Both kratio and transverse dispersivity aT are essential in determining the mass transport between the illite and quartz zones and therefore the total sorption amount mst. For flow-parallel patterns where the illite-sand interface lies in parallel to the main flow, larger aT values lead to higher mst. For the flow-transverse 2 zones pattern where the main illite-sand interface is perpendicular to the main flow, larger kratio leads to lower mst.\nTwo sets of spatial patterns, with one high log hydraulic conductivity variances of 7.95 (High-K) and another low of 0.76 (Low-K), were created using sequential gaussian simulation (SGS) under different correlation lengths (l) and column lengths (L). The mst decreases linearly with connectivity and , until reaches a critical value of 1.1 cm, after which the mst remains its minimum. With the same l and L values, the mst of the High-K patterns are lower than that of the Lower-K patterns due to the mass transport limitation. This work provides a mechanistic and quantitative understanding on the role of mineral distribution patterns in determining the reactive transport of contaminants.",

            "abstract": "Northern boreal ecosystems along the southern limit of permafrost comprise a mosaic of forests with permafrost, and permafrost-free peatland and lake ecosystems. The proportion of permafrost-free areas has rapidly increased over the last decades due to increasingly warmer air temperatures. This change in land cover causes changes in vegetation composition and structure affecting land surface characteristics such as albedo and surface roughness with important implications for the land surface energy balance and thus regional climate. For example, a decrease in sensible heat flux potentially cools the atmosphere and thus constitutes a negative feedback to the climate system. Changes in latent heat fluxes alter regional water vapour dynamics and thus may affect precipitation patterns. To better understand the land surface energy balance under the influence of degrading permafrost, we measured sensible and latent heat fluxes with two eddy covariance systems, one at 15 m and one at 2 m above the ground surface, along with net radiation and soil heat flux at Scotty Creek, a watershed in the discontinuous permafrost zone in the southern part of the Northwest Territories, Canada. The flux footprint of the 15 m-eddy covariance system covers an area equally covered by black spruce forests and permafrost-free, treeless peatlands whereas the flux footprint of the adjacent 2 m-eddy covariance system covers a single bog within the footprint of the 15 m system.\nPeak sensible heat fluxes at the bog were up to 200 W m-2 smaller than the landscape-scale fluxes between April and July 2014. During the snow free period, peak latent heat fluxes at the wet bog were about 50 W m-2 higher than the landscape-scale fluxes. Albedo of the forest was generally smaller compared to the bog except for the immediate post-melt period when the bog was affected by widespread surface flooding. This difference in albedo leads to higher net radiation at the forest site, particularly during the snow cover period. Our nested tower measurements indicate that with further permafrost degradation sensible heat and latent heat fluxes are likely to decrease and increase, respectively. This shift in the land surface energy balance could attenuate the regional positive air temperature trend and favour increased summer precipitation in the northern boreal zone.",

            "abstract": "Most aerosol mass spectrometers rely on measuring the terminal velocity that the particles acquire in the introduction of the air sample into vacuum to determine the particle size (aerodynamic diameter). This is done by measuring the time-of-flight between two defined points in the particle beam path. In the Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer, a chopper with a narrow slit (typically 2% throuput for acceptable size resolution) is used to gate the incoming particle beam and record a velocity distribution as the particles hit the vaporizer/ionization chamber. The low duty cycle of the chopper leads to low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for rapidly changing conditions and/or low aerosol concentrations, as well as the need to alternate between a total mass mode (with typically a 60% duty cycle) and size-segregated mode.\nA new chopper assembly has been constructed and tested that uses a multi-slit pattern with a particle throughput of 50%. Using an inversion method that has successfully been used previously in ion time-of-flight spectrometry (Hadamard transform), a full particle velocity spectrum can be acquired with both high S/N and very good resolution (equivalent to a traditional 1% chopper wheel).\nWe have shown that this method retrieves realistic particle size distributions regardless of aerosol volatility and that the S/N improvements are consistent with the increase in duty cycle. These can be improved even further by using noise filtering techniques. We have deployed the new chopper at two field campaigns (SOAS and SEAC4RS) and confirmed the performance of the new technique with ambient aerosol.\nThe increased duty cycle also means that both total mass and size-segregated measurements can be taken at once within the same (uninterrupted) datastream, greatly increasing the overall data coverage in both modes. Both ambient and chamber data will be presented to demonstrate this new AMS acquisition mode.",

            "abstract": "The persistence of pyrogenic materials (hereafter referred to as char) in terrestrial ecosystems is of interest both from a carbon cycle modelling perspective and a climate change mitigation standpoint. However, the fate of newly introduced char in soils remains unclear. Recent reviews attempting to summarize trends in char decomposition have come to differing conclusions, further stressing the complexity of factors dictating char stability in soils. The current dataset specifically addresses the stability of char additions to a tropical clay-rich soil, possible priming effects, and interactions among char, microbial communities and the mineral matrix. 13C- and 15N-labeled Acer rubrum(red maple) wood was combusted at 400°C and added to surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (20-30 cm) soils from the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. Soils were incubated for 13 and 345 days at 26°C. Following incubation, intact microaggregates were frozen and cryosectioned into thin sections of approximately 5 µm thickness and mounted on gold-coated quartz slides. Thin sections were examined by synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR-FTIR), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), and high resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS). The combination of these µm to nm scale techniques allowed us to create corresponding spatial maps of native organic matter, char, and mineral phase distribution, track spatial variability in organic matter molecular structure, and dispersion of 13C and 15N isotopic labels. We present preliminary results indicating a high degree of stability of char in these wet tropical soils throughout the incubation period, suggesting that applied char may persist for long periods of time in similar soils.",

            "abstract": "Urban- and agriculturally-impacted streams face widespread water quality challenges from excess nutrients, metals, and pathogens from nonpoint sources, which the hyporheic zone (HZ) can capture and treat. However, flow through the HZ is typically small relative to stream flow and thus water quality contributions from the HZ are practically insignificant. Hyporheic exchange is a prominent topic in stream biogeochemistry, but growing understanding of HZ processes has not been translated into practical applications. In particular, existing HZ restoration structures (i.e. cross-vanes) do not exchange water efficiently nor control the residence time (RT) of downwelling streamwater.\nHere we present subsurface modifications to streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) to drive efficient hyporheic exchange and control RT, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the HZ. Coordinated high K (i.e. gravel) and low K (i.e. concrete, clay) modifications are termed Biohydrochemical Enhancement structures for Streamwater Treatment (BEST). BEST can simply use native sediments or may also incorporate reactive geomedia to enhance reactions.\nThe contaminant mitigation potentials of BEST were estimated based on hyporheic flow and RT outputs from MODFLOW and MODPATH models and reported nutrient, metal, and pathogen removal rate constants from literature for specific porous media. Reactions of interest include denitrification and removal of phosphate, metals, and E. coli.\nSimulations showed that BEST structures in series can substantially improve water quality in small streams along reaches of tens of meters. The model results are compared to observed data in tank and constructed stream experiments. Preliminary results with BEST incorporating woodchip geomedia demonstrate rapid denitrification exceeding model predictions. These experiments should establish BEST as a novel stream restoration structure or Best Management Practice (BMP) option to help practitioners achieve stormwater compliance.",

            "abstract": "Mixing processes control spatial and temporal patterns of water quality in large rivers. Studies of mixing at river confluences have mainly been limited either to laboratory junctions or to field investigations at small confluences. Detailed studies of mixing downstream from confluences in large rivers are difficult due to the expense and effort required to conduct such studies. The objectives of this research are: 1) to demonstrate the value of remote sensing for exploring the problem of mixing downstream of large river confluences, 2) to develop an empirically based model, based on spectral reflectance information, for predicting total suspended solids concentrations (SSCs) at and downstream of confluences, and 3) to use the predicted values of SSCs to better understand the dynamics of mixing downstream from confluences. The study site for our research is the Mississippi River at and downstream of its confluence with the Missouri River. Data consist of SSCs measured by the USGS in the Mississippi River between 1988 and 2003 and atmospherically corrected imagery obtained by Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 satellites during the same period. Data on spectral reflectance for pixels with measured sediment concentrations are used in a RandomForest regression tree analysis to develop a predictive model relating spectral reflectance to SSCs. This model is used to estimate SSCs downstream of the confluence for different dates of imagery. Cross-channel patterns of SSCs illustrate the degree of transverse mixing at various distances downstream from the confluence and are useful for ascertaining how changes in channel characteristics influence rates of transverse mixing. Preliminary results indicate that the magnitude of differences in SSCs between the two rivers, the momentum flux ratio between the rivers, and changes in channel width are important factors controlling rates of transverse mixing. These results advance our understanding of mixing in large rivers and help inform water quality management practices for such rivers.",

In this study, Yp is estimated and projected using regional climate models (RCM) and a process-based crop model over the Southwestern United States. High-resolution (8km grid spacing at the inner domain) climate variables are obtained using dynamical downscaling with two RCMs (WRF and OLAM) driven by boundary conditions from a GCM (GFDL-ESM2M) in the 5th phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archives. 20 years of the high-resolution and bias-corrected climate data from the two RCM runs (historical (1981-2000) and future (2031-2050)) are employed on the process-based crop model, Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (ASPIM) to assess the climate change impact on maize Yp. The potential maize yield in the future period under the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentrations pathways shows that the yields are significantly changed when compared to the historical period. In the generally rising temperature regime, the projected Yp shows strong geospatial variations according to the regional climate characteristics in the high-resolution RCM projections.",

Everyone can explore physical models with real-time visualization in the educational simulator Universe Sandbox ² (\nuniversesandbox.com/2\n), which includes basic climate simulations on planets. I have implemented a time-dependent, one-dimensional meridional heat transport energy balance model to run and be adjustable in real time in the midst of a larger simulated system. Universe Sandbox ² is based on the original game - at its core a gravity simulator - with other new physically-based content for stellar evolution, and handling collisions between bodies. Existing users are mostly science enthusiasts in informal settings. We believe that this is the first climate simulation to be implemented in a professionally developed computer game with modern 3D graphical output in real time.\nThe type of simple climate model we’ve adopted helps us depict the seasonal cycle and the more drastic changes that come from changing the orbit or other external forcings. Users can alter the climate as the simulation is running by altering the star(s) in the simulation, dragging to change orbits and obliquity, adjusting the climate simulation parameters directly or changing other properties like CO2 concentration that affect the model parameters in representative ways. Ongoing visuals of the expansion and contraction of sea ice and snow-cover respond to the temperature calculations, and make it accessible to explore a variety of scenarios and intuitive to understand the output. Variables like temperature can also be graphed in real time. We balance computational constraints with the ability to capture the physical phenomena we wish to visualize, giving everyone access to a simple open-ended meridional energy balance climate simulation to explore and experiment with.\nThe software lends itself to labs at a variety of levels about climate concepts including seasons, the Greenhouse effect, reservoirs and flows, albedo feedback, Snowball Earth, climate sensitivity, and model experiment design. Climate calculations are extended to Mars with some modifications to the Earth climate component, and could be used in lessons about the Mars atmosphere, and exploring scenarios of Mars climate history.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the effect of the October 2012 Mw 7.8 Haida Gwaii earthquake on aftershock nodal planes and the neighboring Queen Charlotte Fault (QCF) through Coulomb modeling and directivity analysis. The Haida Gwaii earthquake was the largest thrust event recorded in this region and ruptured an area of ~150 by 40 km on a gently NE-dipping fault off the west coast of Moresby Island, British Columbia. It is particularly interesting as it is located just to the west of the QCF, the predominantly right-lateral strike-slip fault separating the Pacific and North American plates. The QCF was the site of the largest recorded earthquake in Canada: the 1949 Ms 8.1 strike-slip earthquake whose rupture extended as far south as this 2012 event and roughly as far north as an Mw7.5 strike slip event at Craig, Alaska, which occurred just two months later in January 2013. The 75 km long portion of the QCF south of the 1949 rupture has not had a large (M ≥ 7) earthquake in over 116 years, representing a significant seismic gap.\nCoulomb stress transfer analysis is performed using finite fault models which incorporate seismic and geodetic data. Static stress changes are projected onto aftershock nodal planes and the QCF, including an inferred southern seismic gap. We find up to 86% of aftershocks are consistent with triggering, and as high as 96% for normal faulting events. The QCF experiences static stress changes greater than the empirically-determined threshold for triggering, with positive stress changes predicted for roughly half of the seismic gap region. Added stress from the mainshock and a lack of post-mainshock events make this seismic gap a likely location for future earthquakes. Empirical Green's function and directivity analyses are also performed to constrain rupture kinematics of the mainshock using systematic azimuthal variations in relative source time functions. Results indicate rupture progressed mainly to the northwest within 15o of the direction of the 2013 Craig epicenter, with at least two sources of significant moment release. These results explain observed surface wave amplification at Alaskan seismic stations and support the idea that strong surface wave shaking may be linked to the possible delayed triggering of the Mw 7.5 Craig event, through an unknown intermediate mechanism that accounts for the two-month hiatus.",

            "abstract": "Developing a predictive understanding of how hydrological variations impact biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial environments is challenging due to the wide range of processes occurring across vast spatiotemporal scales and due to the uncertainty associated with future climate conditions. In this study, we develop a multi-scale time series model to estimate groundwater dynamics at a floodplain site using historical hydrological data and climate information. Our study is focused at Rifle, CO, where the US DOE Sustainable Systems 2.0 project is developing a genome-to-watershed reactive transport simulation capability and where snowmelt annually delivers a hydrological pulse to the floodplain system that significantly influences the water table and subsurface cycles of carbon and nitrogen. Although long-term predictions of biogeochemical cycling at the site require estimates of hydrological conditions, hydrological data include only a few years of groundwater elevation measurements, with river gage data available from a station located approximately 26 miles upstream.\nTo project future hydrological conditions at the site, we developed a multi-scale statistical model to combine both datasets. We first analyzed 47 years of hydrological data from the gage station to identify multi-frequency temporal patterns in the river stage and its relationship to climate factors (e.g., precipitation or temperature). We then developed empirical models to downscale the estimated hydrological information to daily discharge and subsequently transform them to groundwater dynamics at the downstream floodplain site. Our model provides a probabilistic estimation that is conditioned to the multi-scale hydrological and climate information. With the developed approach, we retrospectively estimate groundwater dynamics at the site for the past five decades as well as the associated uncertainty. Based on Colorado River Basin climate projections, we also predict mean and extreme hydrological conditions at the floodplain site over the next five decades. The projections are being used as input to watershed reactive transport models to predict how hydrological perturbations influence biogeochemical cycles from the genome through watershed scales.",

            "abstract": "Most river basins of the world lack dense networks of precipitation gauges that produce high-quality precipitation data. In these basins, it is difficult to ensure systematic, unbiased hydrological modeling without relying on other sources of precipitation data. Although especially useful for data-scarce river basins, satellite-based precipitation still contains uncertainties that could propagate through hydrological modeling into simulated results, such as flow and stage. One of the main sources of uncertainty is the gridding process itself, typically associated with geo-statistical adjustments/calibrations founded on various interpolation schemes and ground-based measurements. Thus, the accuracy of a satellite precipitation product is inversely related to its resolution, both spatially and temporally. This also holds true for most gridded global/regional data sets.\nThis study presents a method that integrates area-conservative regridding with fraction-redistribution to correct the satellite-based CMORPH data set (~8-km resolution and 30-minute time step) using rain-gauge-based APHRODITE (0.25 degree resolution and daily time step). This method can be broadly applied for refining any pairs of gridded data at different resolutions containing complementary information. Inter-comparison of modeled flow between the usage of the prior- and post-corrected CMORPH, APHRODITE, and gauge data is conducted spanning several orders of magnitude for catchments in Southeast Asia.",

Agricultural land management changes are widespread across the US Midwest, and here we investigate whether historical land cover and land use changes can explain observed reductions in daily maximum temperatures across the region. We find cooling is most pronounced for the hottest temperatures, with intensively cropped regions showing a 2ºC cooling in the 95th percentile of late summer temperatures (1998-2012 relative to 1911-1950). We examine changes in total cropland area, changes in irrigated area, and intensification of crop production (represented as the change in crop NPP) as candidate mechanisms and show that only the latter significantly corresponds to the observed cooling of temperature extremes. These findings are consistent with agricultural intensification leading to a greater capacity for evapotranspiration that manifests most clearly on the hottest days, a hypothesis we further investigate using a one-dimensional energy balance model driven by hourly data from the Illinois Water and Atmospheric Resources Monitoring Program. Intensification of agriculture in the Midwest may itself lead to more favorable growing conditions, but with the major exception that the moderating effects of evapotranspiration will be lost during drought conditions.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic applications of paleomagnetism rely upon establishment of paleohorizontal at the time of magnetization. Paleohorizontal can be established in sedimentary rocks and volcanics, but is poorly constrained in plutonic rocks and areas that have experienced regional remagnetizations. This study will explore another latitudinal-dependent property of the geomagnetic field- elongation of elliptical distributions of directional data- to evaluate whether the combination of elongation and inclination can be used to constrain effects of tilt or other paleohorizontal uncertainties in paleomagnetic datasets. This work is inspired by the application of the E-I relationship proposed by Tauxe and Kent (2004) to evaluate effects of inclination error in sedimentary rocks.\nThe first example is from the Blue Mountains of eastern OR. Remagnetized Permian-Jurassic sedimentary rocks (Hillhouse et al, 1982, Harbert et al, 1995, Housen, 2007, Kalk, 2008) have magnetizations that match those of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous plutons (Wilson and Cox, 1980, Housen, 2007). Directions from 64 sites of these rocks yields a mean of D = 33°, I = 64°, k= 26, α95 = 3.7°. The E-I method can be used to determine the effects of calculated paleohorizontal errors by finding an optimal paleohorizontal error that results in the best agreement between E and I for a set of data. For the Blue Mountains rocks, the optimal E-I relationship yields a corrected inclination of I = 65° (+7°/-4°), and estimated paleolatitude of 47°N (42° to 57°).\nThe second example is from the Cretaceous Mt Stuart batholith in the North Cascades of central WA- these 95-88 Ma plutonic rocks have well defined magnetizations (Housen et al, 2003). Directions from 89 samples have a mean of D = 350°, I=44°, k=50, α95 = 2.1°. The E-I relationship suggests a corrected mean inclination of I=46° (+12°/-3°), and estimated paleolatitude of 27°N (25° to 39°).\nFor the Blue Mountains, this comparison indicates that the plutons and remagnetized rocks have a mean I and E that agree well and suggest little paleohorizontal error. For the Mt Stuart batholith- the E/I corrected inclination suggests only moderate tilt is likely- and agrees well with the inclination of these rocks corrected independently using barometry to estimate paleohorizontal (I= 51°).",

            "abstract": "Variations in crustal surface velocities obtained from GPS stations provide key constraints on physical models that predict surface deformation in response to earthquake cycle loading processes. Vertical GPS velocities, however, are highly susceptible to short scale (<10’s km) variations in both magnitude and direction induced by local changes in water-storage, pore pressure, precipitation, and water runoff. These short-wavelength spatial variations both dominate and contaminate vertical GPS velocity measurements and often mask coherent long-wavelength deformation signals. Because of these complications, vertical GPS velocities, like those provided by EarthScope’s Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), have traditionally been omitted from crustal deformation models. Here we attempt to overcome these obstacles by first eliminating GPS velocities influenced by non-tectonic deformation sources based on high-resolution InSAR data. Second, we employ model selection, a statistical technique that provides an objective and robust estimate of the velocity field that best describes the regional signal without overfitting the highly variable short-wavelength noise. Spline-based interpolation techniques are also used to corroborate these models. We compare these results to published physical models that simulate 3D viscoelastic earthquake cycle deformation and find that the statistical PBO vertical velocity model is in good agreement (0.55 mm/yr residual) with physical model predictions of vertical deformation in Southern California. We also utilize sources of disagreement as a tool for improving our physical model and to further inspect non-tectonic sources of deformation. Moreover, these results suggest that vertical GPS velocities can be used as additional physical model constraints, leading to a better understanding of faulting parameters that are critical to seismic hazard analyses.",

            "abstract": "Interdisciplinary work has become a cornerstone in research across the environmental sciences. Our work does so by evaluating biogeochemical cycling, specifically methane, in the context of landscape hydrology. Atmospheric methane is a greenhouse gas 27 times more potent than carbon dioxide and has been increasing at an unprecedented rate. This drastic increase in atmospheric methane has been attributed to anthropogenic activities such as burning of fossil fuels, ruminants, and rice cultivation, which together constitute approximately 67% of global methane sources. Characterizing CH4 flux in natural systems has remained difficult due to complex relationships among environmental variables (e.g. soil temperature and soil water content). To address this, we focus on how the redistribution of water in complex terrain influences the magnitude and direction of flux in upland and riparian soils. Distilling this complex behavior and scaling these observations is complicated by interacting feedback loops and uncertainties associated with global scale modeling. However, progress is critical given that predicting future climate is necessary to forecasting the quantity and distribution of available fresh water, and understanding how ecosystem processes, and energy/food production will be affected. Water sciences and environmental science as a whole must improve communication to a range of audiences, and advocate for researchers, policy makers, and business leaders to work together for a more sustainable future. A crucial step in this process is to optimize the appropriate level of information to convey that is both memorable and meaningful given the complexity of environmental systems. The challenge also extends to artists and filmmakers to present the subject in compelling ways that inspire audiences to take action in their own communities. True integration of professionals across environmental, social, political, and economic disciplines while motivating local involvement will be necessary for development and success of innovative solutions for improving the trajectory of climate change.",

            "abstract": "JPSS is a next generation satellite system that is planned to be launched in 2017. The satellites will carry a suite of sensors that are already on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite. The NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Algorithm Integration Team (AIT) works within the Algorithm Development Library (ADL) framework which mimics the operational JPSS Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS). The AIT contributes in development, integration and testing of scientific algorithms employed in the IDPS. This presentation discusses cryosphere related activities performed in ADL. The addition of a new ancillary data set – NOAA Global Multisensor Automated Snow/Ice data (GMASI) – with ADL code modifications is described. Preliminary GMASI impact on the gridded Snow/Ice product is estimated. Several modifications to the Ice Age algorithm that demonstrates mis-classification of ice type for certain areas/time periods are tested in the ADL. Sensitivity runs for day time, night time and terminator zone are performed and presented. Comparisons between the original and modified versions of the Ice Age algorithm are also presented.",

            "abstract": "Predictions of soil temperature changes are as critical to policy development and climate change adaptation as predictions of air temperature, but have received comparatively little attention. Soil temperature determines seed germination and growth of wild and agricultural plants, and impacts climate through both geophysical and carbon-cycle feedbacks. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment Report does not report soil temperature predictions, but focuses instead on surface air temperatures, despite the fact that mean annual soil temperatures and mean surface air temperatures are often different from each other. Here we aim to fill this important knowledge gap by reporting soil temperature and moisture predictions for 15 earth system models (ESMs) that participated in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison 5 Project (CMIP5). Under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emissions scenarios, soil warming is predicted to almost keep pace with soil air warming, with about 10% less warming in soil than air, globally. The slower warming of soil compared to air is likely related to predictions of soil drying, with drier soils having reduced soil heat capacity and thermal conductivity. Mollisol soils, which are typically regarded as the most productive soil order for cultivating cereal crops, are anticipated to see warming in North America of 3.5 to 5.5 °C at the end of the 21st century (2080-2100) compared to 1986-2005. One impact of soil warming is likely to be an acceleration of germination timing, with the 3°C temperature threshold for wheat germination anticipated to advance by several weeks in Mollisol regions. Furthermore, soil warming at 1 m depth is predicted to be almost equivalent to warming at 1 cm depth in frost-free regions, indicating vulnerability of deep soil carbon pools to destabilization. To assess model performance we compare the models’ predictions with observations of damping depth, and offsets between mean annual soil and air temperature for the historic period. We find ESMs generally predict warmer mean annual air temperature than soil, whereas observations show air temperatures are cooler or similar to soil temperatures in many locations. To improve future assessments of soil carbon, it is important to benchmark soil-air temperature linkages of global land models.",

            "abstract": "Convectively induced turbulence (CIT) is commonly listed as a cause or factor in weather-related commercial aviation accidents. In-cloud CIT is generated in part by shears between convective updrafts and downdrafts. Total lightning is also dependent on a robust updraft and the resulting storm electrification. The relationship between total lightning and turbulence could prove useful in operational aviation settings with the use of future measurements from the geostationary lightning mapper (GLM) onboard the GOES-R satellite. Providing nearly hemispheric coverage of total lightning, the GLM could help identify CIT in otherwise data-sparse locations.\nFor a severe thunderstorm case on 7 June 2012 in northeast Colorado, in-cloud eddy dissipation rate estimates from the NCAR/NEXRAD Turbulence Detection Algorithm were compared with cloud electrification data from the Colorado Lightning Mapping Array and radar products from the Denver, Colorado WSR-88D. These comparisons showed that high concentrations of very high frequency (VHF) source densities emitted by lightning occurred near and downstream of the storm’s convective core. Severe turbulence was also shown to occur near this area, extending near the melting level of the storm and spreading upward and outward. Additionally, increases/decreases in VHF sources and turbulence volumes occurred within a few minutes of each other; although, light turbulence was shown to increase near one storm’s dissipation. This may be due to increased shear from the now downdraft dominate storm. The 3D wind field from this case, obtained by either a dual-Doppler or a Variational Doppler Radar Assimilation System (VDRAS) analysis, will also be examined to further study the relationships between total lightning and thunderstorm kinematics. If these results prove to be robust, lightning may serve as a strong indicator of the location of moderate or greater turbulence.",

            "abstract": "Releases of hydrocarbons from oil spills can have large environmental impacts in both the ocean and atmosphere. While evaporation of oil following a spill is mainly modeled simply as a mass loss mechanism, the resulting production of atmospheric pollutants can also be a major concern, particularly for continental releases, such as wrecks of train-tanker or river barges, and near-shore rig releases. Both may occur near population centers. The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 presented a unique opportunity to observe significant secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production due to a large oil spill. Following on these observations, we have conducted a series of measurements on evaporation of oil while explicitly accounting for changes in chemical composition occurring as a function of evaporation time. In this work we use GC×GC-VUV-HRTOFMS to achieve unprecedented characterization of oil composition from the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, and how it changes with time following release. Roughly 75% of the total mass of the alkane mixture comprising the oil was classified according to degree of branching, number of cyclic rings, aromatic character, and molecular weight. Such detailed and comprehensive characterization of the DWH oil allows for bottom-up estimates of the relationship between oil volatility and composition. We developed an evaporative model, based solely on our composition measurements and thermodynamic data (vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization), rather than common boiling point parameterizations, which is in excellent agreement with published mass evaporation rates and allows for prediction of potential SOA production as a function of both wind speed (evaporation rate) and oil composition. Our measurements yield different oil volatility distributions than previously inferred; this suggests accurate prediction of SOA formation requires detailed oil composition measurements. A wind tunnel was used to verify model predictions. Sustained SOA yields on the order of a gram m-2 day-1 are predicted under calm sea conditions.",

            "abstract": "Studies of the bilateral asymmetry recorded in Hawaii, and other Pacific hotspots, have been used to infer the structure and origin of their underlying mantle source(s). Recent models suggest that isotopic signatures carried to the surface in plumes can be used to infer the isotopic structure of the deep mantle. In this study we use numerical modelling framework, Fluidity, to test if these conclusions may be extended to heterogeneous zones with distinct density and rheology. To reduce computational requirements, we utilise Fluidity's adaptive mesh capability, allowing mesh resolution to vary with the solution complexity. We explore the parameter space over which bilateral asymmetry in Pacific hotspots can (and cannot) be explained by large-scale structures at the base of the mantle by varying the density and viscosity of such features. The existence of large-scale chemical structure in the mantle has traditionally been supported by seismic observations that define two Large Low Shear-wave Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) beneath Africa and the Pacific. Therefore, we include in our parameter search the range of values predicted for LLSVPs as possible long-lived, chemically distinct 'piles'. This study has implications for: (i) the interpretation of isotopic patterns at hotspot locations; (ii) the thermal and compositional structure of mantle plumes and; (iii) our ability to relate the geochemistry of hotspot lavas to the nature of their deep mantle source.",

            "abstract": "Pressure sensitive paints (PSP) have been largely used in aerodynamic applications to measure pressure distributions on complex bodies such as aircraft. One common family of PSPs employ fluorescent pigments that are quenched in the presence of oxygen, yielding an inverse relationship between fluorescence intensity and oxygen concentration that is used to measure pressure in aerodynamic applications through the partial pressure of oxygen. These PSPs offer unexplored potential for visualizing dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration distributions on surfaces underwater. PSP was used to measure dissolved oxygen concentrations in streambed sediments in a laboratory flume. Two PSP-coated 2.5 cm diameter spheres were emplaced in a bed of similar material, and imaged under varying DO concentrations. Calibration curves relating fluorescence intensity to dissolved oxygen concentration were developed on a pixel-by-pixel basis, enabling spatial patterns of oxygen to be resolved in the sediment bed. This method of measuring dissolved oxygen concentration is advantageous because of its fast response time and ability to measure heterogeneous oxygen distributions in sediments. Future work will explore the combined effects of stream flow and biofilm growth on oxygen distributions in streambed sediments.",

            "abstract": "Performing realistic simulations of solar eruptions and validating those simulations with observations are important goals in order to achieve accurate space weather forecasts. Here, we perform and analyze results of a global magnetohydrodyanmic (MHD) simulation of the fast coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on 2011 March 7. The simulation is made using the newly developed Alfven Wave Solar Model (AWSoM), which describes the background solar wind starting from the upper chromosphere and expands to 24 Rs. Coupling of AWSoM to an inner heliosphere (IH) model with the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) extends the total domain beyond the orbit of Earth. Physical processes included in the model are multi-species thermodynamics, electron heat conduction (both collisional and collisionless formulations), optically thin radiative cooling, and Alfven-wave pressure that accelerates the solar wind. The Alfven-wave description is physically consistent, including non-WKB reflection and physics-based apportioning of turbulent dissipative heating to both electrons and protons. Within this model, we initiate the CME by using the Gibson-Low (GL) analytical flux rope model and follow its evolution for days, in which time it propagates beyond 1 AU. A comprehensive validation study is performed using remote as well as in-situ observations from SDO, SOHO, STEREOA/B, and OMNI. Our results show that the new model can reproduce many of the observed features near the Sun (e.g., CME-driven EUV waves, deflection of the flux rope from the coronal hole, \"double-front\" in the white light images) and in the heliosphere (e.g., CME-CIR interaction, shock properties at 1 AU). The CME-driven shock arrival time is within 1 hour of the observed arrival time, and nearly all the in-situ parameters are correctly simulated, which suggests the global MHD model as a powerful tool for the space weather forecasting.",

Our procedure involves three components: (1) constructing a finite-element, unstructured hexahedral mesh, (2) performing seismic wavefield simulations, and (3) quantifying differences between seismograms. We consider three different structural models: homogeneous, layered, and realistic 3D variations. For each structural model we produce a mesh with and without topography. For each of these meshes we produce a finer version in order to demonstrate the minimum resolvable period for the coarser meshes. The target regions is southern California which exhibit large topographic variations and also have abundant seismic stations that allow for comparisons with recorded data. We selected 137 events ranging from Mw 3.4 to 5 in addition to our initial Mw 7.6 point source to have a station and source specific analysis. Our simulations shows that the topography has the strongest effects on surface waves, whereby a phase shift of the main arrival occurs due to the different thickness of the uppermost layer (which includes the topography or not). Scattered waves are visible in the coda due to surface wave reflections that occur off the direct source-station path. Our analysis emphasizes seismograms with periods ≥ 1 s, with the motivation to understand the topographic signatures that may influence measurements used within adjoint-based tomographic inversions with earthquake data.",

However, understanding the full range of emissions, and the fate of these organic compounds following their oxidation in the atmosphere is currently a major quantitative challenge. We looked closer to investigate emission, oxidation, and deposition of VOCs in a forested region of the South East US as part of the SOAS summer 2013 campaign.\nFluxes and concentration of gas-phase VOCs were measured at 10 Hz by a PTR-ToF-MS which was coupled to a 10 Hz RM Young sonic anemometer at the top of the Centreville SEARCH tower located in a mixed deciduous forest near Brent, Alabama. Investigations of BVOC oxidation pathways were also explored in the CalTech chamber during the FIXIT study. The combination of laboratory oxidation studies and concentrations and fluxes measured in the field provides a broader dynamic picture of the physical and chemical processes behind effective oxidation yields which can improve understanding of BVOC oxidation compound fates and thus the accuracies of SOA formation estimates.\nWe investigate the relative contribution of individual VOCs, and classes of VOCs distinguished by the number of oxygen they include, to the mixing ratio, emission and deposition flux burdens. We also investigate how the exchange velocities of VOCs differ during the day and highlight the bidirectional character of the fluxes occurring for a large fraction of observed organic ions.",

            "abstract": "We review and discuss the capability of novel configurations of global community (WACCM-X and TIME-GCM) and planned-operational (WAM) models to support current and forthcoming space-borne missions to monitor the dynamics and composition of the Ionosphere-Thermosphere-Mesosphere (ITM) system. In the specified meteorology model configuration of WACCM-X, the lower atmosphere is constrained by operational analyses and/or short-term forecasts provided by the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) of GMAO/NASA/GSFC. With the terrestrial weather of GEOS-5 and updated model physics, WACCM-X simulations are capable to reproduce the observed signatures of the perturbed wave dynamics and ion-neutral coupling during recent (2006-2013) stratospheric warming events, short-term, annual and year-to-year variability of prevailing flows, planetary waves, tides, and composition. With assimilation of the NWP data in the troposphere and stratosphere the planned-operational configuration of WAM can also recreate the observed features of the ITM day-to-day variability.\nThese “terrestrial-weather” driven whole atmosphere simulations, with day-to-day variable solar and geomagnetic inputs, can provide specification of the background state (first guess) and errors for the inverse algorithms of forthcoming NASA ITM missions, such as ICON and GOLD. With two different viewing geometries (sun-synchronous, for ICON and geostationary for GOLD) these missions promise to perform complimentary global observations of temperature, winds and constituents to constrain the first-principle space weather forecast models. The paper will discuss initial designs of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE) in the coupled simulations of TIME-GCM/WACCM-X/GEOS5 and WAM/GIP. As recognized, OSSE represent an excellent learning tool for designing and evaluating observing capabilities of novel sensors. The choice of assimilation schemes, forecast and observational errors will be discussed along with challenges and perspectives to constrain fast-varying dynamics of tides and planetary waves by observations made from sun-synchronous and geostationary space-borne platforms. We will also discuss how correlative space-borne and ground-based observations can evaluate OSSE results.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation interception by forest canopies can significantly influence regional hydrological processes, however, accurate measurement of interception over large areas and across heterogeneous forests can be difficult. Lidar has emerged as an effective tool to measure forest structure, and may be used to model large-scale forest processes such as precipitation interception. We developed a non-linear regression model from first principals to predict the percent of precipitation interception from forest canopies using lidar. To find the best parameters for the model, we measured throughfall of rain (n = 21), fresh snow (n = 21), and old snow (n = 26) on plots in the boreal forest of the upper Eklutna Valley, Alaska. The valley contains heterogeneous forest structure, with open and closed deciduous, needleleaf, and tall shrub stands. For each plot we calculated a set of twelve lidar metrics, and found the combined metric of mean height * cover to be the lidar metric most highly correlated to ln(throughfall) for rain (r = -0.81), fresh snow (r = -0.79), and old snow (r = -0.73). Using mean height * cover in the precipitation interception model we created a 15 m resolution spatial model of interception across the vegetated portions of the upper Eklutna Valley. Using this model, we calculated the mean interception for rainfall (20% ± 3%), fresh snow (29% ± 4%), and old snow (20% ± 3%) across the modeled region. These results suggest lidar can be an effective tool to predict both rain and snow interception across structurally varied forests.",

            "abstract": "In-situ observation of dust grains from various origins is continuously performed by space missions equipped with radio instruments. These measurements consist in observations of voltage pulses, or their spectral signature. It has for long been proposed that one of the mechanisms able to produce these pulses is the recollection by the spacecraft of electric charges generated by impact ionization.\nHere for the first time, on the basis of this charge recollection assumption, a complete theoretical model of how pulses are generated is proposed. This model makes it possible to reproduce the precise shape of a voltage pulse, including the sometimes observed \"voltage undershoot\" following the pulse, knowing the local plasma parameters.\nWe use the data provided by S/WAVES and show that it strongly supports the model proposed. Even though other processes may be responsible for radio pulses generation, we show here that recollection process is unambiguously observed.\nThe model proposed is an important step forward, in that it enables us to reproduce the shape, timescales and amplitudes of pulses generated by dust impacts in various space environments. Such a model can be used to infer the dust-detection abilities of different radio instruments onboard different spacecraft, including future missions Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus.",

We present multi-year time series of wave height and ice draft from moorings at two locations in the Beaufort Sea, as well as wavelength and direction estimated from high-resolution satellite imagery. In situ wave and ice data are used to examine large-scale spatial and temporal patterns of waves in the previously ice-covered Arctic Ocean. In particular, we investigate the dependence of waves on ice-controlled fetch, and wave physics in partial ice cover in the Beaufort Sea. These results are compared with WaveWatch III hindcasts to evaluate the model’s accuracy in the marginal ice zone. We will expand on the approach of Thomson and Rogers (2014), who found that the energy of waves in the Arctic is directly correlated with open water distances. Incorporating new (2014) data collected throughout the marginal ice zone, we will examine adjustments to conventional fetch scaling laws in the presence of partial ice cover.",

            "abstract": "We are presenting the latest development in multi-sensors observations of short-term pre-earthquake phenomena preceding major earthquakes. We are exploring the potential of pre-seismic atmospheric and ionospheric signals to alert for large earthquakes. To achieve this, we start validating anomalous ionospheric /atmospheric signals in retrospective and prospective modes.\nThe integrated satellite and terrestrial framework (ISTF) is our method for validation and is based on a joint analysis of several physical and environmental parameters (Satellite thermal infrared radiation (OLR), electron concentration in the ionosphere (GPS/TEC), VHF-bands radio waves, radon/ion activities, air temperature and seismicity patterns) that were found to be associated with earthquakes. The science rationale for multidisciplinary analysis is based on concept Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling (LAIC) [Pulinets and Ouzounov, 2011], which explains the synergy of different geospace processes and anomalous variations, usually named short-term pre-earthquake anomalies. Our validation processes consist in two steps: (1) A continuous retrospective analysis preformed over two different regions with high seismicity- Taiwan and Japan for 2003-2009 The retrospective tests (100+ major earthquakes, M>5.9, Taiwan and Japan) show OLR anomalous behavior before all of these events with no false negatives. False alarm ratio for false positives is less then 25%. (2) Prospective testing using multiple parameters with potential for M5.5+ events. The initial testing shows systematic appearance of atmospheric anomalies in advance (days) to the M5.5+ events for Taiwan and Japan (Honshu and Hokkaido areas).\nOur initial prospective results suggest that our approach show a systematic appearance of atmospheric anomalies, one to several days prior to the largest earthquakes That feature could be further studied and tested for advancing the multi-sensors detection of pre-earthquake atmospheric signals.",

While bottom-up estimates of State-annual total ffCO2 emissions are expected to be accurate to ~ 5-10% (68% confidence), net CO2 exchange at smaller spatial and temporal scales (and emissions of other GHGs) are likely less certain. Here, we report initial results of a Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) pseudo-data inversion study combining simulated total and radiocarbon CO2 sampling from a 10-site ground-based tower network with OCO2 satellite column CO2 retrievals. Fossil and biosphere CO2 signals are computed for tower and OCO2 observations across urban and rural areas of California including the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB), Central Valley, and San Francisco Bay Area using the WRF-STILT transport model simulations coupled with prior fluxes from VULCAN (ffCO2) and CASA (bioCO2) fluxes respectively. Nominal uncertainties are assigned to the prior ffCO2 fluxes and estimated for the model-measurement differences including WRF and STILT model uncertainties and background subtraction. Reductions in posterior uncertainties for regional ffCO2 emissions are estimated for the tower pseudo-data using Bayesian inversions for monthly periods in multiple seasons. Ongoing work will include incorporation of OCO2 pseudo-data to estimate additional uncertainty reductions obtained for ffCO2 and bioCO2 exchange signals across California’s urban and rural regions.",

            "abstract": "We present a theoretical study of the fracture of two-dimensional disc-shaped samples due to the penetration of a projectile focusing on the dynamics of fracturing and on the geometrical structure of the generated crack pattern. The penetration of a cone is simulated into a plate of circular shape using a discrete element model of heterogeneous brittle materials varying the speed of penetration in a broad range. As the cone penetrates a destroyed zone is created from which cracks run to the external boundary of the plate. Computer simulations revealed that in the low speed limit of loading two cracks are generated with nearly straight shape. Increasing the penetration speed the crack pattern remains regular, however, both the number of cracks and their fractal dimension increases. High speed penetration gives rise to a crack network such that the sample gets fragmented into a large number of pieces. We give a quantitative analysis of the evolution of the system from simple cracking through fractal cracks to fragmentation with a connected crack network. Simulations showed that in the low speed limit of loading the growing cracks proceed in discrete jumps separated by periods when the crack tips are pinned. The statistics of the size of jumps and of the waitng times shows scale free behaviour, i.e. power law distributions are obtained with universal exponents. Dependence on the loading speed was pointed out only for the cutoffs of the distributions. In the high speed limit of loading the sample falls apart forming a large number of fragments. The size of fragments proved to be power law distributed where dependence on the loading speed is observed only for the cutoffs. The value of the exponent has good agreement with experiments.",

            "abstract": "Tropical peat forests in Southeast Asia have been experiencing climatic and anthropogenic disturbances in the form of drought, fire, deforestation and drainage at an increasing pace and with an increasing extent throughout the past two decades. In this project we aim to improve our understanding of the structural dynamics of tropical peat swamps and the effect of deforestation on the forest structure by (i) characterizing the forest structural parameters (stem density, stem height, crown area, crown roughness, gap size and frequency) of an intact peat dome and (ii) comparing with those from a nearby deforested peat dome. Both are located in Northwestern Borneo. We combine field sampling of 0.8 hectare of forest in 2014 and 84km2 of airborne, small footprint, discrete returns LiDAR acquired in 2010 to extract the parameters of interest. We first process LiDAR data to produce to a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and a Canopy Height Model (CHM) of the area. Individual canopy stems are extracted through local maxima filtering with varying size and shape of search windows. Canopy crowns are segmented from the CHM via K-means clustering using stem positions as fixed cluster centroids. Canopy crown height and stem density are calibrated with field survey in order to upscale stem density to the whole peat dome. Crown roughness is defined as standard deviation of each cluster (crown). Finally, gaps were delineated from the CHM with 30m as vertical threshold and 40m2 as minimum area. The entire procedure is then repeated for the deforested peat dome.\nAcross the intact peat dome, we find an increase in stem density but a decrease in canopy stem height, canopy crown area and canopy crown roughness as a function of a 5m elevational change. Gap size frequency follows a Gamma distribution with higher variance in gap percentage for areas closer to the dome center. As a function of canopy stem height, aboveground biomass decreases towards the dome center. For the deforested peat dome, deforestation removes the canopy trees, masking away the trends of increasing stem density but decreasing stem height and crown area against dome elevation. Canopy roughness is higher at the deforested site as a result of regrowth. Deforestation also results in higher number of smaller gaps, created by felling trees, with diffuse spatial pattern throughout the forest.",

            "abstract": "Rivers, their profiles and network reflect the integration of multiple processes and forces that are part of the fundamental controls on the relief structure of mountain belts. The motivation of this study is to understand active tectonic processes in the forearc region of subduction zones, by distinguishing evidence of active deformation using the river network and topography. To this end, morphotectonic and structural studies have been conducted on fifteen drainage basins on the mountain front, parallel to the Mexican subduction zone, where the Cocos plate underthrusts the North American plate. The southwest – northeast Cocos plate subduction stress regime initiated ca. 20 MA. NE-SW to NNE-SSW normal faults as well as sub-latitudinal to NW-SE strike-slip faults (both dextral and sinistral) constitute the majority of mesofaults recorded in the field within the studied drainage basins. Occasionally dextral N-S strike-slip faults also occur. The stress tensor reconstruction suggests two main evolution stages of these faults: 1) the older is dominated by a NW-SE to WNW-ESE extensional regime and 2) the younger is a transcurrent regime, with NNE-SSW σ1 axis. The drainage pattern is strongly controlled by tectonic features, whereas lithology is only a subordinate factor, with only one exception (Petatlán river). Generally, major rivers flow from north to south mainly through NE-SW and NNE-SSW normal faults, and/or sub-longitudinal dextral (also locally sinistral) strike-slip faults. In the central and eastern part of the studied area, rivers also follow NW-SE structures, which are generally normal or sinistral strike-slip faults (rarely reverse). In most cases, local deflections of the river main courses are related to sub-latitudinal strike-slip faults, both dextral and sinistral. Within the current stress field related to the active Cocos subduction, both normal and strike-slip fault sets could be reactivated. Our analysis suggests that strike-slip faults, mainly left lateral, are probably active because they are offsetting the main stream courses of the largest river basins; however only few focal mechanisms are associated to these faults. We hypothesize that these faults are active, perhaps experiencing slow events or associated fault creep. Further studies are needed to solve this problem.",

            "abstract": "Regional cap and trade programs have been in operation since the 1970’s to reduce environmental externalities (NOx and SOx emissions) and have been shown to be beneficial. Air quality and water quality limits are enforced through numerous Federal and State laws and regulations while local communities are seeking ways to protect regional green infrastructure and their ecosystems services. Why not combine them in a market approach to reduce many environmental externalities simultaneously?\nIn a multi-permit market program reforestation (land offsets) as part of a nutrient or carbon sequestration trading program would provide a means to reduce agrochemical discharges into streams, rivers, and groundwater. Land conversions also improve the quality and quantity of other environmental externalities such as air pollution. Collocated nonmarket ecosystem services have societal benefits that can expand the crediting system into a multi-permit trading program. At a regional scale it is possible to combine regulation of water quality, air emissions and quality, and habitat conservation and restoration into one program. This research is about the economic feasibility of a Philadelphia regional multi-permit (cap and trade) program for ecosystem services.\nInstead of establishing individual markets for ecosystem services, the assumption of the spatial portfolio approach is that it is based on the interdependence of ecosystem functions so that market credits encompasses a range of ecosystem services.

            "abstract": "Assimilative techniques for obtaining complete maps of ionospheric electric potential (and related parameters) from sparse radar and satellite observations greatly facilitates studies of magnetosphere/ionosphere coupling. While there is much scientific interest in studying interhemispheric asymmetry in ionospheric convection at both large and small scales, current mapping procedures rely on spherical harmonic expansion techniques, which produce inherently large-scale analyses. Due to the global nature of the spherical harmonics, such techniques are also subject to various instabilities arising from sparsity/error in the observations which can introduce non-physical patterns in the inferred convection. We present a novel technique for spatial mapping of ionospheric electric potential via a multi-resolution basis function expansion procedure, making use of compactly supported radial basis functions which are flexibly located over geodesic grids; the coefficients are modeled via a Markov random field construction. The technique is applied to radar observations from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), whereupon careful comparison of interhemispheric differences in mapped potential is made at various scales.",

            "abstract": "Human civilizations around the globe have been influenced by abrupt climate change throughout the Holocene. The paucity of high-resolution palaeoclimate data from the “Cradle of Civilization” in West Asia, however, has limited our ability to evaluate the potential role of Holocene climate variability on early societies. We present a high-resolution, multi-proxy reconstruction of aeolian input and palaeoenvironmental conditions based on a 13-kyr record of ombrotrophic (rain fed) peat from Neor Lake in Northwest Iran. Variations in relative abundances of major and trace elements, total organic carbon (TOC), stable carbon isotopes of TOC (δ13CTOC) and compound-specific leaf wax hydrogen isotope (δD) compositions suggest dry and dusty conditions prevailed during the Younger Dryas, and a substantial increase in atmospheric dust loading and decrease in moisture availability occurred between the early and late Holocene. In addition, variations in radiogenic Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition and REE anomalies in samples from Neor peat core indicate significant shifts occurred in source contributions of eolian material to the study area between the Younger Dryas, early and late Holocene. Time-series analysis of aeolian input to NE Iran reveals periodicities at 540, 1050 and 2940 years that correspond with solar variability and internal climate feedbacks identified in other records of Holocene climate change from the northern hemisphere. Transitions in major Mesopotamian and Persian civilizations, including the collapse of the Akkadian empire at 4,200 yr BP, the fall of the Ur III empire at 3,955 yr BP, the fall of Elam empire at 2,500 yr BP and the demise of the Achaemenids around 2,280 BP overlap with major dust events from this study. Several other episodes of enhanced atmospheric dust, however, are not reflected in historical or archaeological accounts of the late Holocene. This indicates either abrupt climate change was not the sole driver of societal changes in the region, or that historical records of these events are incomplete.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the clouds of the north Atlantic trade-wind region as represented in climate models. We focus on an area near Barbados, a site with long-term cloud observations. We begin by asking whether the annual cycle of cloud cover is properly represented in models compared to satellite observations and reanalysis. The models robustly overestimate the amplitude of the annual cycle in cloud cover compared to satellite estimates, but qualitatively capture the phase of the annual cycle with the cloudiest months in the summer wet season in association with deeper convection and higher clouds. We show that the wet season biases are associated with biases in the large-scale circulation, in particular the location of the ITCZ. During the dry season, however, cloud cover is underestimated. Comparison of simulated cloud fraction with the expected cloud-controlling factors shows only weak relationships and little correspondence between the models and observation-based estimates. We infer that the cloud cover variations within the dry season are controlled at least as much by local factors as large-scale ones; these local factors are determined by parameterized physics in the climate models. Like the cloud cover, the vertical structure of the the simulated clouds varies tremendously across models. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the shortwave cloud radiative effect (SWCRE) is relatively well-captured by the models during the dry season, signaling a common compensating bias among the models and reaffirming the ''too few, too bright'' error. Conditioning on dry season and SWCRE shows that models diverge as to the cause of SWCRE variation, some having more influence from shallow cumulus cloud variation while others show more dependence on middle and upper-level clouds. These higher clouds are usually considered unimportant for the overall cloudiness and the shortwave radiation budget in the trades, but this does not appear to be the case at least for some models. Since shortwave cloud feedback in trade-wind regions is a leading contributor to the spread in climate sensitivity, a better understanding of these differing cloud distributions and how they compare to observations could shed light on models' cloud feedbacks and provide an observational constraint with the potential to narrow the spread in climate sensitivity.",

Modulation of the ENSO effect on Indian summer monsoon rainfall by the EHP effect was also explored. In the pre-monsoon season (April to May), rainfall during a La Nina phase is reduced over the expansive desert region from western Asia, including the Middle East, to northern India and thereby the La Nina effect provides abundant aerosols that are necessary to work the EHP effect in the northern India. Thus, the EHP effect due to abundant absorbing aerosols during a La Nina phase is strongly associated with atmospheric warming, increased moisture transport from the Indian Ocean to the Bay of Bengal, and enhanced pre-monsoon (May-June) rainfall over northern India. This finding suggests that the EHP effect plays an important role in amplifying the La Nina effect on Indian summer monsoon.",

            "abstract": "We define geoengineering (GE) as the intentional use of technology to change the planet’s climate. Many people believe GE is different in kind rather than degree from any other organized activity in human history. In fact, humans caused changes in the planet’s climate long before the industrial age, and all organisms engineer their environments directly or indirectly. The relevant difference between this cumulative and generally inadvertent activity and GE is the presence of intention. Now that science has revealed the extent to which humans can change the climate, however, even the continuance of Business as Usual (BAU) is, in effect, a form of intentional GE, albeit one that will cause significant climate harm, defined as effects such as sea level rise that will impact human well-being. But as with all forms of engineering, the devil is in the details: what forms of GE should be tried first? Some methods, such as large-scale afforestation, are low risk but have long-term payoffs; others, such as aerosol injection into the stratosphere, could help buy time in a warming crisis but have unknown side-effects and little long-term future. Climate change is a world-wide, inter-generational tragedy of the commons. Rational choice theory, the spatial and temporal extension of the problem, poorly fitted moral frameworks, and political maneuvering are all factors that inhibit solutions to the climate tragedy of the commons. The longer that such factors are allowed to dominate decision-making (or the lack thereof) the more likely it is that humanity will be forced to resort to riskier and more drastic forms of GE. We argue that this fact brings an additional measure of urgency to the search for ways to engineer the climate differently so as to avoid climate harm in the most lasting and least risky way.",

            "abstract": "Two recent studies have uncovered corroborating spectral evidence for talc in Nili Fossae on Mars using the CRISM spectrometer on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Inspired by fieldwork in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, Brown et al. (2010) suggested talc was present in some locations where saponite had been identified in the earlier study by Ehlmann et al. (2009). Viviano et al. (2013) then found an identifying marker for talc vs. saponite which confirmed the presence of talc and mapped the locations of the mineral signature using this spectral feature .\nTalc is an important mineral for identifying processes of hydrothermal alteration in ultramafic sequences in the Archean greenstone belts on Earth. As an alteration mineral of Mg-olivine it is likely to play the same role on Mars, where cumulate overturn has been suggested to have left a highly magnesian upper mantle (Elkins-Tanton et al. 2005).\nEarly Mars and Earth had hotter mantles in their early stages of formation, following overturn of their respective magma oceans, when life began on Earth and may have started on Mars (Russell et al. 2014). In this presentation, we will show how talc (particularly in combination with carbonate) is an important indicator mineral for identifying the hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic sequences, and as such may lead the way to astrobiologically critical regions on Mars and specifically in Nili Fossae.\n",

We present synoptic estimates of elevation change based on judicious combinations of these data. Two sets of techniques yield complementary results: Combining laser-derived elevations with SP DEMs gives an elevation-change map covering most outlets with near-annual resolution between 2003 and the present, while combining Cryosat data with SP DEMs gives a database of radar elevations with improved ambiguity resolution that we process to estimate surface elevation changes between mid 2010 and the present. Firn and accumulation models help reduce the effects of accumulation variability on the derived elevation rates, allowing estimates of steady-atmosphere (“dynamic”) mass-change rates. These data reveal variable but increasing mass loss from Thwaites and Haynes glaciers, continuing mass loss from the glaciers draining into the Dotson and Crosson ice shelves, and significant losses on Alison ice stream and Ferrigno glacier on the Bellingshausen coast. There is also evidence for a recent hiatus in strong elevation change in parts of the grounding zone of Pine Island glacier, after nearly a decade of accelerating losses there. We discuss these findings in the context of measured surface speed changes and model estimates of ocean temperature variations.",

Both deployments employ three identical hydrophones spaced about 70 cm apart at the end of a 700 m long cable attached to a surface buoy that houses electronics, communications, and a GPS location package. The maiden voyage occurred October 8, 2012, in Exuma Bay, Bahamas and returned 25 hours of acoustic data. A second deployment is to take place in September 2014, with near-immediate data relay via Iridium modem. The experimental setup is different from the MERMAID instrument, which sinks to a midcolumn depth and surfaces to transmit waveforms when an event detection algorithm is triggered. MERMAIDs have recorded hundreds of seismic traces from 18 active floats in the Indian and Mediterranean Oceans with a signal-to-noise ratio suitable for global tomography. As with earthquake early-warning studies, both Son-O-Mermaid and MERMAID benefit from rapid and accurate event detection, discrimination, and measurement technology. With this triple purpose in mind we continue to improve methods (in the time-domain, via spectrogram analysis and using wavelets) that we illustrate on the latest and some of the older data, as well. While hydroacoustic data have numerous other applications beyond seismology (whale calls, ice calving, weather patterns, and so on) the Son-O-Mermaid and MERMAID instruments may potentially revolutionize seismic data collection in the oceans. Moreover, in the near future they will be fitted with more or different instruments, becoming multipurpose and multidisciplinary platforms for all types of scientific research in and of the oceans. In seismology we envision a future when the world’s oceans are populated by a permanent array of hundreds of passively drifting Son-O-Mermaid and MERMAID floats, recording and transmitting data, being to ocean-bottom seismometers what a US Flexible Array is to the Backbone Array: lesser data in some sense, but much more abundant, more reliably recovered - and all that at a much lower-cost.",

            "abstract": "While we are aware of the extent and distribution of strain at the surface near the Pacific-North America plate boundary at the San Andreas Fault (SAF) system in California, at depth, our understanding is poor. Recent seismic observations suggest a narrow shear zone throughout the lithosphere corresponding to the narrow plate boundary at the surface. Surrounding the SAF in California, measurements of seismic anisotropy demonstrate orientations which vary depending on the location relative to the fault. Specifically, in northern California, the orientations align along the fault in its proximity, and in the east-west direction elsewhere. We investigate how the finite-strain ellipsoid (FSE) evolves for tracers in a 3D model of the lithosphere and asthenosphere beneath the SAF. The top surface of the mesh has a right-lateral strike-slip velocity boundary condition, and the bottom, a uniform asthenospheric flow velocity condition perpendicular to the strike-slip fault. We calculate the orientations of the FSE for various ratios of strike-slip to asthenospheric velocity and viscosity stratification. The two classes of models which we investigate simulate an asthenospheric channel beneath a uniform-thickness lithosphere and a variable-depth lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). In an isoviscous fluid beneath a uniform-thickness lithosphere, strain rates, and thus FSE orientations, are constant throughout the channel, dependent on the ratio of the velocities but not the viscosity. For a two-layered asthenospheric channel of a higher-viscosity layer overlying a lower-viscosity layer, FSE orientations align with the strike-slip boundary in the upper layer and the drag in the lower layer. When we emulate a lithosphere of variable thickness across the fault by increasing the viscosity of the upper layer, we observe asymmetric FSE orientations across the step in the LAB. The direction of lithospheric thickening across the strike-slip fault govern these orientations. Following these investigations, we interpret the direction of maximum strain of the FSE as the preferred direction of a-type anisotropy in the region of the SAF system and analogous strike-slip fault systems.",

            "abstract": "To investigate atmospheric processing of urban emissions, we deployed an oxidation flow reactor with measurements of size-resolved chemical composition of submicron aerosol during CalNex-LA, a field study investigating air quality and climate change at a receptor site in the Los Angeles Basin. The reactor produces OH concentrations up to 4 orders of magnitude higher than in ambient air, achieving equivalent atmospheric aging of hours to ~2 weeks in 5 minutes of processing. The OH exposure (OHexp) was stepped every 20 min to survey the effects of a range of oxidation exposures on gases and aerosols. This approach is a valuable tool for in-situ evaluation of changes in organic aerosol (OA) concentration and composition due to photochemical processing over a range of ambient atmospheric conditions and composition. Combined with collocated gas-phase measurements of volatile organic compounds, this novel approach enables the comparison of measured SOA to predicted SOA formation from a prescribed set of precursors.\nResults from CalNex-LA show enhancements of OA and inorganic aerosol from gas-phase precursors. The OA mass enhancement from aging was highest at night and correlated with trimethylbenzene, indicating the importance of relatively short-lived VOC (OH lifetime of ~12 hrs or less) as SOA precursors in the LA Basin. Maximum net SOA production is observed between 3-6 days of aging and decreases at higher exposures. Aging in the reactor shows similar behavior to atmospheric processing; the elemental composition of ambient and reactor measurements follow similar slopes when plotted in a Van Krevelen diagram. Additionally, for air processed in the reactor, oxygen-to-carbon ratios (O/C) of aerosol extended over a larger range compared to ambient aerosol observed in the LA Basin. While reactor aging always increases O/C, often beyond maximum observed ambient levels, a transition from net OA production to destruction occurs at intermediate OHexp, suggesting a transition from functionalization/condensation at low-to-moderate OHexp to fragmentation/evaporation dominating at very high OHexp. A traditional SOA model with mostly aromatic precursors underpredicts the amount of SOA formed in the reactor by an order-of-magnitude, which is consistent with model evaluations for ambient air at many polluted locations.",

Here, we report results from measurements of soil respiration that occurred during the experiment from 1999 to 2008. In order to better understand this flux, we compare changes in soil respiration to the effects of CO2 and O3 on net primary productivity (NPP), fine root biomass, and leaf litter production.\nElevated CO2 enhanced soil respiration by an average of 28%. This stimulation of soil respiration varied from +19% to +44%, but did not change consistently during the 10 year measurement period (r2 = 0.04). The effect of elevated O3 on soil respiration was dynamic. In year two of the experiment (1999), elevated O3 decreased soil respiration by 7%. However, soil respiration consistently increased through time under elevated O3 (r2 = 0.71) and was 9% greater than under ambient O3 in the final year of the experiment (2008). Overall, elevated O3 had no meaningful effect on soil respiration (+0.3%). The annual effects of elevated CO2 on soil respiration were not correlated with NPP or fine root biomass, but was positively correlated with leaf litter production (r = 0.57). Annual leaf litter production was also related to the annual effects of elevated O3 on soil respiration (r = 0.78), but relationship was tighter between annual O3 effects on NPP and soil respiration (r = 0.83).",

            "abstract": "Powerful explosive volcanic eruptions inject ash high into the atmosphere, which spreads as an intrusion to form characteristic umbrella-shaped clouds. An enigmatic feature of a number of recent eruption clouds (e.g. Popocatepetl, 2012; Soufriere Hills, 2010; Mt. St. Helens, 1980 and Puyehue, 2011) is that they are constructed of multiple layers (Figure 1, left). How such layering emerges within an advancing gravity current of initially well-mixed ash is unclear. Potential major controls include the strength and structure of the atmospheric density stratification, the particle size distribution within the ash cloud and the entrainment of ambient atmosphere into the rising plume. Accordingly, we conduct analog experiments in which saltwater jets with mono- and bi-disperse suspensions of fine and coarse silica particles are injected into a saltwater tank with a linear density stratification. Whereas classical umbrella clouds are produced for strong jets (low source Richardson number, -Ri0) under all particle-loading conditions, multiply layered clouds emerge for weak jets (high -Ri0) and relatively concentrated bi-disperse and coarse mono-disperse suspensions. In particular, at high -Ri0 coarse particles inhibit entrainment and enhance the partial collapse of rising jets to form gravity currents that intermittently descend along the jet margin and spread at varying neutral buoyancy heights to form layers. For high concentrations of coarse sand gravity currents can reach the tank floor. Collapse and compaction of this material to form a deposit expels buoyant interstitial fluid that rises to form additional layers below and within the overlying multiply layered cloud. One layer and multiply layered clouds have distinct depositional patterns and present unique risks to air traffic.",

            "abstract": "Particles constitute a significant portion of the flux weathered material from continents to ocean basins but little is understood about their seasonal dynamics particularly in subsurface and headwater stream environments. At the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory, located near the headwaters of the South Fork Eel River in the Angelo Coast Range Reserve (Northern California), groundwater from weathered bedrock and stream waters are sampled at a frequency of one to three days from three wells (Well 1 down-slope, Well 3 mid-slope, Well 10 upper-slope) and Elder Creek. Approximately one thousand samples collected by automated ISCO Gravity Filtration System (GFS; Kim et al. 2012, EST) since 2011 have been filtered through 0.45 μm 25 mm diameter Supor filters. Filters imaged under controlled lighting are analyzed for red, green, and blue optical density (OD) to enable rapid assessment of sample loading and color as a prelude to and selection aid for more labor-intensive ICP-MS and Scanning Electron Microscopic analysis. For example, samples with lower red OD relative to green and blue may correspond to samples high in Mn/Fe oxides. Optical imaging of the loaded filters provides a time-series over three years and color anomalies in these filters along with chemical analysis of dissolved and particulate filtrate is used to establish a method for calibrating optical data to interpret chemical composition of water and particles. Results are interpreted within a framework of environmental data such as rainfall, stream discharge and turbidity, and water table depth measured at the heavily monitored forested hillslope. Data from the four locations range up to 0.6 OD units with a typical detection limit of better than 0.01 OD units. At Well 10, wet season filter samples exhibit highest particle loading (OD ~ 0.3) with values rapidly decreasing during the dry season (OD < D.L.) water table recession. At Well 1, particle loads instantaneously reflect intense rain events. Applied at a larger scale, this method - if proven - may be used to estimate basin level particulate flux with an estimation of chemical composition in a highly efficient manner.",

            "abstract": "The concentrations of atmospheric species vary on hourly to decadal timescales, driven by a range of chemical and physical processes. Using spectral analysis it is possible to decompose a time series into a set of cycles with differing frequency, amplitude and phase. Traditional Fourier analysis is inappropriate as it is susceptible to artifacts due to gaps in typical atmospheric observational datasets; instead we use the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram, allowing spectral analysis of gapped data. We exploit this method to construct metrics for the evaluation of atmospheric chemistry models.\nSpectral analysis of global surface ozone observations from networks of ground-based instruments (GAW (global), EMEP (Europe), CASTNET (USA) etc.) reveal characteristic patterns of influence on ozone, at turbulent, synoptic and macro-weather timescales, and significant periodicity at the diurnal, semi-annual and annual timescales. We sample archived hourly surface ozone fields from a chemistry transport model (GEOS-Chem; driven by observed weather) and a chemistry-climate model (GFDL CM3; generates its own weather) at the location of the measurements, and evaluate them with the observation-derived power spectra. Unsurprisingly, given their temporal and spatial resolution, the models underestimate power on the turbulent timescale but demonstrate skill on the synoptic and macro-weather scales. The distinct diurnal, semi-annual and annual periodicities in the observations are evident in the models also, but with varying degrees of accuracy.\nThe use of spectral analysis in model analysis forms a novel method for the systematic and quantitative evaluation of Chemical Transport / Earth System Models on a range of timescales, and may prove useful for evaluating multi-model simulations coordinated under the Chemistry Climate Modeling Initiative.",

This would impact the quantity and seasonality of river flow into a proposed hydroelectric dam, if it were to be built. The upper Susitna Basin catchment area is 13,289 km², ranging from 450-4000 m a.s.l. It is 4% glacierized and is characterized by sparse vegetation, discontinuous permafrost, and little human development. We present field measurements and results from hydrological modeling.\nWe present new field data from spring and fall 2014 along with field measurements from the 1980’s, 2012, and 2013. These data are used to calibrate and validate the hydrological model. Traditional glacier mass balance measurements show that the glaciers lost more mass in 2012 and 2013 than in 1981, 1982, or 1983. Springtime snow radar surveys of the glaciers allow us to extrapolate from point measurements of snow depth to the whole glacier area. Snow depth measurements at tundra sites as well as tundra vegetation and soil characterizations help us choose appropriate model parameters for the tundra portions of the basin. Meteorological data (temperature, humidity, and precipitation) from over 20 stations in the basin show the summertime temperature lapse rate to be smaller over glacier surfaces compared to ice-free surfaces. Precipitation is highly variable across the basin. Energy balance measurements from two meteorological stations, one located on West Fork Glacier and one on a nunatak near Susitna Glacier, are used for more detailed modeling of summertime glacier melt and runoff.\nWe run a physically-based hydrological model to project 21st century river discharge: Water Flow and Balance Simulation Model (WaSiM). Climate inputs come from a CCSM CMIP5 RCP6.0 scenario downscaled to a 20km-5km nested grid using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. From 2010-2029 to 2080-2099 the basin-wide mean-annual temperature will rise 2.5 degrees and total precipitation will rise 2%, with a 13% decrease in snowfall and a 20% increase in rainfall. Preliminary WaSiM runs indicate that glaciers will retreat, evapotranspiration will increase, and permafrost will thaw. Annual runoff will remain relatively steady, but the timing of the peak spring runoff will shift to an earlier date.",

            "abstract": "Due to their importance as both GCS reservoir rocks and seals, the geochemical behavior of carbonates, such as limestones and dolomites, in acidic environments is relatively well-studied topic. However, the feedbacks between dissolution processes and permeability are not fully understood, particularly for fractured carbonates at in-situ stress conditions. A key open problem is the evolution of fracture aperture (and therefore permeability) for induced fractures in low permeability carbonates. We present the results of a dynamic synchrotron X-ray microtomography (SXR-μCT) experiment investigating changes in fracture aperture in a dolomite sample during dissolution induced by CO2 saturated water. The dolomite sample used for the experiment was sourced from the Duperow formation of North central Montana, and consisted of a 3/8” cylindrical sample, 7/8” long, with a single vertical fracture. CO2 bearing solution was flowed through the the sample in a μCT high pressure vessel for ~ one week at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min under 1400 psi pore pressure and 1700 psi confining pressure. XR tomographic scans were taken at different time steps to follow the evolution of fracture apertures. Results show that the evolution of the fracture is extremely complex: the calcite fraction present in the sample (~5%) dissolves readily showing a prompt retreat in the fragments contacting the fracture surface. In contrast, dolomite zones develop a leached layer ~250 μm thick, rich in micropores along the surfaces of the fracture. With the evolution of the system, a wormholing effect becomes more evident with the development of channels of preferential dissolution along the paths of maximum fluid velocity, where the leached layer becomes less evident and faster bulk dissolution of the dolomite is observed. The main aperture of the fracture remains fairly constant during dissolution; even after an increase in confining pressure (2300 psi), no closure was observed. This highlights how the weakening of the contact points, under these experimental conditions, is not as strong as some models might suggest. Likewise, these observations indicate that reactive fracture models may require inclusion of a porous altered zone in the near-fracture region to adequately represent feedbacks between dissolution and permeability.",

At Cornell University and the Museum of the Earth in Ithaca, NY, researchers and outreach staff tackled these challenges together through a 2013 temporary museum exhibition: Moving Carbon, Changing Earth.\nMoving Carbon, Changing Earth introduced visitors to the world of carbon and its effect on every part of our lives. The exhibit was the result of the broader impacts portion of an NSF grant awarded to Natalie Mahowald, Professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University, who has been working with a team to improve simulations of regional and decadal variability in the carbon cycle. Within the exhibition, visitors used systems thinking to understand the distribution of carbon in and among Earth’s systems, learning how (and how quickly or slowly) carbon moves between and within these systems, the relative scale of different reservoirs, and how carbon’s movement changes climate and other environmental dynamics. Five interactive stations represented the oceans, lithosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, and a mystery reservoir. Puzzles, videos, real specimens, and an interview with Mahowald clarified and communicated the complexities of the carbon cycle.\nIn this talk we’ll present background information on Mahowald’s research as well as photos of the exhibition and discussion of the components and motivations behind them, showing examples of innovative ways to bring a complex topic to life for museum visitors.",

            "abstract": "The continental shelf along the northeastern Gulf of Mexico is transected by the critical latitude (30°N) for inertial motions. At this latitude the inertial period is 24 hours and diurnal surface current oscillations can amplify due to resonance with diurnal wind and tidal forcing. Tidal amplitudes are relatively small in this region although K1 tidal currents can be strong over the shelf west of the DeSoto Canyon where the K1 tide propagates onshore as a Sverdrup wave. Other sources of diurnal motions include internal tidal currents, Poincaré waves, and basin resonance. It is therefore very difficult to separate inertial wind-driven motions from other diurnal motions.\nSpatiotemporal surface currents were measured using hourly 6 km resolution HF radar data collected in June 2010 during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and July 2012 during the Grand Lagrangian Deployment (GLAD). Surface currents were also measured using GLAD GPS-tracked drifters. NDBC buoy wind data were used to determine wind-forcing, and OSU Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS) were used to predict tidal currents.\nThe relative spatiotemporal influence of diurnal wind and tidal forcing on diurnal surface current oscillations is determined through a series of comparative analyses: phase and amplitude of bandpassed timeseries, wavelet analyses, wind-driven inertial oscillation calculations, and tidal current predictions. The wind-driven inertial ocean response is calculated by applying a simple “slab” model where wind-forcing is allowed to excite a layer of low-density water riding over high density water. The spatial variance of diurnal motions are found to be correlated with satellite turbidity imagery indicating that stratification influences the sea surface inertial response to wind-forcing. Surface dispersion is found to be minimized in regions of high diurnal variance suggesting that mean surface transport is restricted in regions of inertial motions associated with stratification.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we report on our efforts to model and measure the interaction between hydrokinetic (HK) devices and the hydraulic and sedimentary environment of the Tanana River, by Nenana Alaska. The Tanana River, by Nenana Alaska, has an open-water median flow rate of about 1325 m3/s, a width of about 200 m, a maximum depth of about 9 m, peak flow velocities of about 2.5 m/s, and suspended sediment concentrations as high as 2 g/L. Preliminary modeling of the hydraulic impact of a 45 KW cross-flow-style HK turbine using SNL-EFDC software found that the device raised water levels upstream of the device by about 0.5 cm. It also led to reductions in velocity of about 0.05 m and enhancements of about 0.01 m/s. In this paper, we will report on ongoing efforts to model the corresponding sedimentary impacts of HK devices at this location. In late August of 2014, a 15 KW open-center-style hydrokinetic turbine (manufactured by Oceana Energy Corporation) was deployed for a three week period at the Tanana River site. Device performance (e.g., power generation and angular frequency (rpm’s)) were monitored along with environmental parameters including: velocity as a function of depth upstream and downstream of the device, turbulence at “hub elevation” upstream and downstream of the device, suspended sediment concentration upstream and downstream of the device, and sediment bed elevation before and after testing. In this paper, we will report on all of these data as well as data on the abrasion of device components. Further, we will present data on the dependence of device coefficient of performance and turbulence intensity. Finally, we will compare modeled and measured hydraulic and sedimentary impacts of the HK device.",

            "abstract": "Most ecological models of decomposition rely on plant litter chemistry. However, growing evidence suggests that the chemical composition of organic matter (OM) is not a good predictor of its eventual fate in terrestrial or aquatic environments. New data on variable decomposition rates of select organic compounds challenge concepts of chemical recalcitrance, i.e. the inherent ability of certain molecular structures to resist biodegradation. The role of environmental or “ecosystem” properties on influencing decomposition dates back to some of the earliest research on soil OM. Despite early recognition that the physical and aqueous matrices are critical in determining the fate of organic compounds, the prevailing paradigm hinges on intrinsic chemical properties as principal predictors of decay rate. Here I build upon recent reviews and discuss new findings that contribute to three major transformations in our understanding of OM persistence: (1) a shift away from an emphasis on chemical recalcitrance as a primary predictor of turnover, (2) new interpretations of radiocarbon ages which challenge predictions of reactivity, and (3) the recognition that most detrital OM accumulating in soils and in water has been microbially processed. Predictions of OM persistence due to aromaticity are challenged by high variability in lignin and black C turnover observed in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Contradictions in the behavior of lignin are, in part, influenced by inconsistent methodologies among research communities. Even black C, long considered to be one of the most recalcitrant components of OM, is susceptible to biodegradation, challenging predictions of the stability of aromatic structures. At the same time, revised interpretations of radiocarbon data suggest that organic compounds can acquire long mean residence times by various mechanisms independent of their molecular structure. Understanding interactions between environmental conditions and biological reactivity can improve predictions of how disturbance events can further stabilize or destabilize organic C pools, with implications for terrestrial C storage, aquatic C cycling, and climate change.",

            "abstract": "The demand for agricultural and forest yield will continually increase as populations grow, though it is unclear how agricultural and forested ecosystem productivity and water use will respond to the interactions of changing climate, carbon dioxide and ozone. In ecosystems essential to resource production, it is critical to understand how productivity and water use will respond to these future changes. Previous research suggests that future climate and ozone can each decrease crop and timber yield and water use efficiency, while future carbon dioxide might increase yield and improve water use efficiency. However, the change in agricultural and forest water use and yield in response to the interactions among these variables has not yet been determined. We use the Community Land Model (CLM) to determine how changes in agricultural and timber water use and yield in response to the interactions of all three variables (climate, carbon dioxide, and ozone).\nPreliminary results suggest that future ozone and climate decrease forest and grain yield. However, carbon dioxide concentrations increase forest and grain yield, offsetting the decreases. Future climate increases evapotranspiration in all regions more than the decreases caused by carbon dioxide and ozone. The interactions of climate, carbon dioxide, and ozone decrease water use efficiency, with climate having the largest impact. These results demonstrate that, to maintain agricultural and forest productivity in the future, the demand for irrigation will increase.",

The flow is transient, and may transition between free-surface and pressurized, resulting in complex dynamical features with important consequences for water suppliers and users. These consequences include degradation of distribution system components, compromised water quality, and inequitable water availability. The goal of this work is to model the important dynamics and identify operating conditions that mitigate certain negative effects of intermittent water supply. Specifically, we will look at controlling valve parameters occurring as boundary conditions in a network model of transient, transition flow through closed pipes. Gradient-based optimization will be used to find boundary values to minimize pressure gradients and ensure equitable water availability at system endpoints.",

We present shipboard video of breaking waves from a research cruise in the North Pacific. As with airborne systems, motion compensation is essential in geo-rectifying the image. A stabilization method based on the location of the horizon in the image is shown to be effective in correcting pitch and roll motions to within one degree, without an IMU (inertial motion unit). After rectification, whitecaps are identified and measured based on the translation of surface foam patches, which appear as groups of bright pixels. Two standard breaking metrics, whitecap coverage and Phillips' Λ(c) distribution, are calculated for the full dataset and compared with other recent observations. In addition, the growth rate of the whitecap foam patches is used to examine a new dissipation function, independent from Λ(c), which was developed in laboratory experiments. Finally, we present preliminary whitecap results from a stereo system. Stereo imaging has the potential to provide much more information about the geometry and kinematics of breaking surface waves in the field, but significant technical challenges remain.",

One of the key drivers of regional climate is the observed reduction in end of summer sea ice extent over the Arctic. Here we show that interannual variations between the September Arctic sea ice concentration, especially in the East Siberian Sea, and the maximum Okhotsk sea ice extent in the following winter are positively correlated. An increase of sea ice both in the East Siberian Sea and the Okhotsk Sea and corresponding atmospheric patterns, showing a seesaw between positive anomalies of sea level pressures over the Arctic Ocean and negative anomalies over the mid-latitudes, are related to cold anomalies over the high-latitude Eurasian Continent. The patterns of atmospheric circulation and air temperatures are similar to those for the annually integrated Arctic Oscillation (AO). The negative annual AO forms colder anomalies in autumn sea surface temperatures both over the East Siberian Sea and the Okhotsk Sea, which causes heavy sea-ice conditions in both seas through season-to-season persistence.",

Improvement of such prediction relies on a better representation of the interactions between hydrological, geochemical and microbial processes in the Arctic ecosystem that occur over a wide range of space and time scales and under dynamic freeze-thaw conditions. As part of the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments in the Arctic (NGEE-Arctic), we conducted controlled laboratory freeze-thaw experiments to study greenhouse gas release in vertical permafrost soil columns with vertically heterogeneous hydrological, geochemical and microbial properties. The studies were performed using soil cores collected from the NGEE Barrow, AK site. Two cores collected next to each other with very similar soil structures were used for the experiment. One of the cores was destructively sampled for baseline characterization, and the second core was used for the freeze-thaw experiments. The core extends from the ground surface into the permafrost with roughly 40 cm of active layer. The column was instrumented with various sensors and sampling devices, including thermocouples, geophysical (electrical) sensors, and sampling ports for solids and fluids. The headspace of the soil column was purged with CO2 free air and the gas samples were collected periodically for greenhouse gas analysis. Our initial tests simulated seasonal temperature variation from ~ -10°C to +10°C at the ground surface. Our results demonstrated that temperature and geophysical data provided real time information on the freeze thaw dynamics of the column and the surface greenhouse gas fluxes correlated with the freeze thaw stages and associated hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the vertical soil column. For example, surface fluxes data revealed an early burst of GHG concentrations during the initial thawing of the surface ice rich layer of the soil, indicating the presence of trapped gases from previous season activities. In addition, the dynamics of the surface flux are closely related to the changes of the geochemical and microbial conditions during the freeze thaw processes.",

            "abstract": "River deltas are dynamic systems composed of a network of channels and interchannel islands that are subject to forces such as river discharge, tides, wind, and anthropogenic activities. The delivery of water, sediment, and nutrients from the channel to the delta floodplain is important for maintaining and evolving delta systems. This delivery depends on the connectivity between channels and delta floodplains. Connectivity is a concept that has been investigated extensively in tributary systems but remains relatively unexplored in delta distributary networks. This may be due to the structure of delta networks, often more complex than the one of tributary networks, and forces such as wind and tides acting on delta systems.\nIn this study, we present a framework for analyzing connectivity in river delta networks and present field evidence of surface water connectivity mechanisms from Wax Lake Delta (WLD) in coastal Louisiana, USA through measurements of water discharge and hydraulic tracer propagation. Calculated discharges from velocity measurements reveal that 46-77% of the flow exits the system via the distributary channels, while the remaining volume is routed to the islands, highlighting the importance of channel-island connectivity and the role of islands in the hydrological network at WLD. Tides and wind also play an important role in the channel-island connectivity by modulating flow into and out of the islands, as well as influencing the hydraulic residence time of the inundated island interiors, which has implication for nutrient cycling. A framework for analyzing connectivity in river deltas is presented, in which we characterize the importance of dynamic island inundation, environmental forces, and network structure.",

Using both global and statistically downscaled climate model output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) and hydrologic model results, management-relevant measures of the climate and environment are analyzed for the Pacific Northwest (PNW), within the broader context of the continental United States. The specific climate variables were selected through meetings with key regional resource managers at federal, state, and local agencies, and generally relate to exceptional events in temperature, precipitation, and streamflow. Uncertainty in ToE calculations is also examined due to three sources: 1) statistical estimation of emergence 2) future emission scenarios (rcp4.5 and rcp8.5) and 3) multi-model ensemble spread. In the PNW, results show that for temperature related climate variables, ToE is likely within the next 50 years, with a strong positive trend, regardless of emission scenario. Precipitation related variables show a much later ToE, with a weak positive signal despite some model disagreement in direction of change. As this data is intended for socio-economic stakeholders in the PNW, a web tool has been designed to allow for visualizing and analyzing ToE for multiple climate variables and the associated probability statistics across the PNW domain. This information will help guide resource managers in the prioritization and timing of climate change adaption activities.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we examine the physical weathering of Ferrar dolerite clasts along a multi-million-year-old soil chronosequence on Mullins Glacier, a debris-covered glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica. Collected morphological field data show that: (1) with increasing distance from the headwall, clasts become more rounded and deeply buried by surrounding sediment; (2) clasts with exposure histories > ~20,000 years exhibit disintegration via flaking of mm-scale surface fragments; (3) these flakes increase in thickness with distance, with an overall average of 1.8 mm. Coupling the field data with improved chronological control for surface ages, we estimate an erosion rate of ~9 cm Ma-1 via flaking, which represents ~ 60% of the currently assumed maximum erosion rate for the region. We test thermal fatigue as a mechanism for flake detachment by collecting high-frequency temperature data for rock surfaces and at depth on multiple clasts, as well as meteorological data (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed/direction, solar intensity) during the austral summer. Vertical temperature gradients across flakes surpassed 8°C during the 28-day study interval, and rates of surface temperature change exceeded 5°C min-1. The latter value greatly exceeds the accepted value for producing thermal fracture in igneous rocks. Dolerite samples were also collected to determine rock surface albedo, near-surface geochemistry, and mechanical properties; these data, in combination with the acquired field data, were used to create a model of internal temperature and thermally induced stresses in a typical clast. Overall, our results demonstrate that the production of altered rinds modifies thermal properties at the rock surface and may help facilitate fracture at the interface between altered and unaltered material. Additional sediment analyses show that the detached flakes add to the surrounding regolith, increasing in abundance with inferred soil age. This process modifies clast shape and promotes self-burial, providing a negative feedback to further erosion. Our measurements imply that the detachment of altered material on Mullins Glacier represents a dynamic equilibrium process that may have important implications for rates of landscape evolution in ice-free polar deserts like the MDV.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Recent aspirations for offshore development in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, off the North Slope of Alaska, have precipitated the need of additional information for various sea-ice parameters. Of specific interest to engineers and regulatory agencies are the magnitudes of parameters representative of major hazards with a low expectation of occurring over some timeframe. The thickness and width of large pressure ridges that may impact offshore structures is of particular interest. Here, we analyze an extensive dataset from moored ice profiling sonars (IPSs) and acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) deployed in the vicinity of offshore oil-and-gas lease areas in the US portions of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. In all, we examine 16 annual time series of ice draft and velocity from six different mooring locations over five years. Using an automated algorithm, we identify individual pressure ridge keels based on deviations in ice draft from surrounding level ice and derive measurements of the maximum depth and shape of each. Of particular note, and contrary to many idealized ridges portrayed in the literature, we find that flat-bottomed keels are rare in this region. Since the orientation of each ridge as it passes over the mooring is unknown it is not possible to directly measure the precise width. Instead we bin the keels by maximum depth and find the modal width value for each depth bin. Finding that most keels have broadly the same triangular cross-section, we assume the modal width value corresponds to cases when the ridge passes over the mooring approximately perpendicular to its axis. Using this approach, we find a constant ratio between maximum keel depth and width, corresponding to a mean keel slope of around 33 degrees. This is somewhat steeper than is commonly found in literature. We also analyze the relationship between keel depth and drift speed, but find no statistically significant dependence.",

            "abstract": "Ammonium (NH4+) oxidation coupled to iron (Fe) reduction in the absence of oxygen and nitrate/nitrite (NO3-/NO2-) has been reported by several investigators and referred to as Feammox. Feammox is a biological reaction, where Fe(III) is the electron acceptor, which is reduced to Fe(II), and NH4+ is the electron donor, which is oxidized to NO2-.\nThrough a 180-day anaerobic incubation experiment, and using PCR-DGGE, 454-pyosequecing and qPCR analysis, we have shown that an Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6, a previously unreported species in the Acidimicrobiaceae family, might be either responsible or plays a key role in the Feammox process, We have enriched these Feammox bacteria (65.8% in terms of cell numbers) in a membrane reactor, and isolated the pure Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 strain in an autotrophic medium.\nIn samples collected and then incubated from a series of local wetland-, upland-, as well as storm-water detention pond-sediments, Feammox activity was only detected in acidic soil environments that contain Fe oxides. Using primers we developed for this purpose, Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 was detected in all incubations where Feammox was observed. Anaerobic incubations of Feammox enrichment cultures adjusted to different pH, revealed that the optimal pH for Feammox is 4 ~ 5, and the reaction does not proceed when pH > 7. Feammox was still proceeding at pH as low as 2. In Feammox culture amended with different Fe(III) sources, Feammox reaction proceeded only when Fe oxides (ferrihydrite or goethite ) were supplied, whereas samples incubated with ferric chloride or ferric citrate showed no measurable NH4+ oxidation.\nFurthermore, we have also determined from incubation experiments conducted with a temperature gradient (10 ~ 35℃), that the Feammox process was active when the temperature is above 15℃, and the optimal temperature is 20℃. Incubations of enrichment culture with 79% Feammox bacteria appeared to remove circa 8% more NH4+ at 20ºC than at 35ºC. This is in contrast to anammox, another anaerobic ammonium oxidation pathway, for which optimal NH4+ oxidation is at temperatures ~ 30ºC. Hence, a Feammox-based process is an attractive candidate for wastewater treatment that could result in further energy savings, by requiring no aeration or heating of the wastewater in temperate climates.",

            "abstract": "Several poorly understood faults are exposed along the mid- and lower slope offshore southern California from Encinitas to San Clemente. From south to north, these faults have been referred to as the Carlsbad, San Onofre, and San Mateo fault zones, which are generally characterized as nearly vertical to steeply east-dipping faults with a reverse slip component. The U.S. Geological Survey collected high-resolution seismic reflection and bathymetric data from 2009-2012 to better characterize these faults. From offshore Encinitas to Oceanside, these data reveal a complex and variable fault zone that structurally controls the slope-basin transition. In this area, the faults show both reverse as well as normal offset, but may also include an unknown amount of strike-slip offset. North of Oceanside, however, faulting shows clear evidence of right-lateral slip, offsetting submarine channels near the base of the slope by approximately 60 m. North of these offset channels, the base of the slope bends about 30° to the west, following the trend of the San Mateo fault zone, but fault strands on strike with those that offset the channels trend obliquely up slope, appearing to merge with the Newport-Inglewood fault zone (NIFZ) on the shelf. These fault strands consist of several en echelon left-stepping segments separated by “pop-up” structures, which imply a significant component of right-lateral offset along this fault zone, and thus may serve to transfer right-lateral slip from faults along the base of the slope to the NIFZ. This fault zone also separates structures associated with the San Mateo fold and thrust belt to the west from undeformed slope sediments to the east. The existence of significant right-lateral slip on faults along the slope and slope-basin transition has implications for assessing seismic hazards associated with the NIFZ, and also provides constraints on possible reverse motion on the hypothesized Oceanside Thrust.",

The interaction of the Pacific and Indian basins and their modes of variability (El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)), both through atmospheric teleconnections and the ocean link via the Indonesian Throughflow, is now being hotly pursued in the research community.\nWe will present some initial findings from the 3-year time series (2011-2014) of the Timor Passage and Ombai Strait moorings. This mooring array is a component of the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), and builds on the earlier results of the INSTANT (2003-2006) observational program. The moorings comprise of velocity, temperature and salinity instruments. Observations from these moorings provide the required spatial and temporal coverage to understand ocean dynamics, the ocean’s role in climate variability and change, investigate forcing of the atmosphere and ocean and assess the realism of data-assimilative ocean models and coupled ocean-atmosphere models.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade, ambient noise tomography has become increasingly popular to image the earth's upper crust. The seismic noise recorded in the earth's crust is dominated by surface waves emanating from the interaction of the ocean with the solid earth. These surface waves are low frequency in nature ( < 1 Hz) and not usable for imaging smaller structures associated with mining or oil and gas applications. The seismic noise recorded at higher frequencies are typically from anthropogenic sources, which are short lived, spatially unstable and not well suited for constructing seismic Green's functions between sensors with conventional cross-correlation methods.\nTo examine the use of ambient noise tomography for smaller scale applications, continuous data were recorded for 5 months in an active underground mine in Sweden located more than 1km below surface with 18 high frequency seismic sensors. A wide variety of broadband (10 – 3000 Hz) seismic noise sources are present in an active underground mine ranging from drilling, scraping, trucks, ore crushers and ventilation fans. Some of these sources generate favorable seismic noise, while others are peaked in frequency and not usable.\nIn this presentation, I will show that the noise generated by mining activity can be useful if periods of seismic noise are carefully selected. Although noise sources are not temporally stable and not evenly distributed around the sensor array, good estimates of the seismic Green's functions between sensors can be retrieved for a broad frequency range (20 – 400 Hz) when a selective stacking scheme is used.\nFor frequencies below 100 Hz, the reconstructed Green's functions show clear body-wave arrivals for almost all of the 153 sensor pairs. The arrival times of these body-waves are picked and used to image the local velocity structure. The resulting 3-dimensional image shows a high velocity structure that overlaps with a known ore-body. The material properties of the ore-body differ from the host rock and is likely the cause of the observed high velocity structure. For frequencies above 200 Hz, the seismic waves are multiply scattered by the tunnels and excavations and used to determine the scattering properties of the medium.\nThe results of this study should be useful for future imaging and exploration projects in mining and oil and gas industries.",

            "abstract": "We present a synthesis of seismic observations that allow us to test models of ridge segmentation and subridge mantle flow beneath active oceanic spreading centers. Active-source experiments conducted along segments of the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), the intermediate-spreading Juan de Fuca Ridge (JdFR), and the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) resolve the seismic velocity structure of the crust and uppermost mantle on the scale of 5 to 10 kilometers. Second-order discontinuities in the mid-ocean ridge (MOR) system have commonly been attributed to a decrease in magma supply from the upwelling mantle. However, the observed increase in the magnitude of mantle low-velocity zones, interpreted as zones of subcrustal melt accumulation, near these discontinuities is in direct contradiction to this view. Segment-scale measurements of seismic anisotropy at these three locations also reveal a new characteristic of MORs that may be commonplace: A systematic misalignment between the orientation of plate divergence and the direction of mantle flow. Crustal anisotropy, assumed to result from preferentially aligned cracks, is used to infer the current orientation of tensile tectonic stress driving plate separation. At the MAR, JdFR, and EPR the orientation of crustal anisotropy is consistent with the orientation of plate divergence predicted from plate velocity models. Passive mantle flow models predict that mantle anisotropy, resulting from strain-induced olivine LPO, should trend parallel to the direction of plate divergence. However, beneath each of these spreading segments, mantle anisotropy is rotated away from the plate divergence direction. The geometry of these misalignments correlates with recent rotations of the Euler poles in each plate system and with the sense of offset at 2nd-order discontinuities. We discuss alternative models of ridge segmentation and mantle flow geometries and their implications for lithosphere-asthenosphere coupling.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall-triggered shallow landslides are both a hazard and a major source of sediment in steep landscapes. Extreme precipitation events are expected to change under climate warming, but we have limited understanding of their effect on the relative abundance, size, and spatial distribution of landslides. In particular, changes in orographic precipitation may alter landslide distributions in steep landscapes. Recent theory suggests a significant downwind shift in orographic precipitation under a warming climate, causing larger fractional changes on leeward than on windward slopes. This may prove particularly relevant on the west coast of the USA where mountain ranges are oriented perpendicular to the moisture-laden prevailing winds coming from the Pacific. We analyze precipitation data from regional climate models (NARCCAP) under a high-end emissions scenario (IPCC A2). Preliminary results show that mean winter precipitation over the contiguous United States increases by roughly 2% over both low and high elevation regions in the simulations between the periods 1971-2000 to 2041-2070, but much larger fractional changes (~ triple) are found on leeward slopes. For the same periods, we find that extremes have greater fractional changes in intensity than the mean, and that these changes increase with return period. Similar trends emerge in the West Coast, but with bigger differences between windward and leeward slopes, which increase with return period. Moreover, while leeward increases are large for 30-year events (14%-19%), they are marked even for 2-year events (7-12%). This could significantly impact the frequency and magnitude of shallow landslides in steep landscapes affected by orographic precipitation. We test this hypothesis by applying a new catchment-scale model, which predicts both landslide location and size, to an intensively investigated study site in the Oregon Coast Range, where a ten-year landslide inventory has been mapped onto high-resolution topographic data and soil parameters have been well constrained. We perform numerical experiments under a range of orographic rainfall scenarios to quantify the impact of changes in extreme precipitation on landslide-derived sediment volume on steep slopes, and we compare this behavior with the historical observations available at the site.",

            "abstract": "Because reverse-time migration (RTM) honors the physics of wave propagation more closely than other migration algorithms, it has become the preferred imaging tool in seismic exploration over the past 10-15 years. This shift has been facilitated by advances in computational power which have made it feasible to routinely migrate large datasets. Despite this evolution in exploration seismology, the use of RTM has remained relatively limited in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) applications even though the advantages in GPR imaging are comparable. For example, within the RTM framework it is possible to include antenna radiation directly in the imaging algorithm. Additionally complications such as irregular surface topography and highly heterogeneous subsurface electrical properties can be incorporated naturally into an RTM algorithm. I have implemented both pre- and post-stack RTM algorithms for GPR imaging. The post-stack algorithm utilizes the exploding reflector concept and an approximate formulation of the EM wave equation to account for propagation through lossy media. The pre-stack algorithm utilizes the full two way solution to Maxwell’s equations, and includes radiation patterns directly in the imaging routine. Here, I investigate amplitude reconstruction using RTM in complex environments with a focus on complex topography and the interplay between radar radiation patterns and topography. Complex topography alters wavefield kinematics making for a challenging imaging problem; topographic variation can substantially distort radiation patterns, produce irregular spreading, and alter amplitudes by focusing and defocusing effects at the surface. The effects are magnified when the topographic variations are on the same order as the depth of investigation – a situation that is often encountered in GPR investigations. I consider both pre- and post-stack GPR imaging in the presence of large topographic and subsurface variability. Using both synthetic and field examples I show that a carefully constructed RTM algorithm is capable of accurate reconstruction of GPR reflection amplitudes in complex media and thereby facilitates estimation of reflection coefficients at a reflecting boundary.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning (BB) events are known to produce chemically rich environments that can impact the evolution of primary aerosols and influence secondary aerosols production rates. With their increasing in frequency, BB events are expected to exert an ever-increasing impact on climate due to aerosol radiative forcing processes. One area that is still poorly understood is the evolution of these smoke aerosols in the near field. Recent literature suggests that BB aerosols undergo a rapid evolution near their source that is then followed by a slower aging phase. During the summer of 2013, the Department of Energy-sponsored an aircraft field campaign called the Biomass Burning Observation Project (BBOP) that specifically targeted the evolution of smoke aerosols in the near field (< 2 hours). Results examining the evolution of BB optical and microphysical properties will be presented.\nTo probe these properties, the BBOP field campaign deployed a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) to probe the mixing state of refractory black carbon (rBC) and a Soot Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SP-AMS) to investigate the composition of both non-refractory and rBC-containing particles. Aerosol optical properties were measured in situ using a 355 nm Photoacoustic spectrometer (PAS), a 532 nm photo thermal interferometer (PTI), a 630 nm cavity Attenuation Phase Shifted (CAPS) spectrometer, a 3-λ nephelometer, and a 3-λ PSAP. The BBOP study represented the maiden aircraft deployment for the SP-AMS, the 355 nm PAS and 532 nm PTI.\nDiscussion will be on the near-field evolution of particle mixing state and morphology, chemical composition, and microphysical processes that determine aerosol size distributions and single scattering albedo (SSA) of light absorbing aerosols. In the cases studied, increases in the coating thickness of refractive black carbon (rBC) particles, organic aerosol/rBC ratio, scattering/CO ratio, and aerosol size distributions have been observed. Results will be given from wildfires sampled in the US northwest and on controlled agricultural burns in the south-central Mississippi valley.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between the North and South Atlantic bidecadal sea level (SL) oscillations in the twentieth century (1908-2008) is investigated using SODA 2.2.4 reanalysis and 102 monthly mean SL time series from TG stations provided by PSMSL. Bidecadal SL signal extraction was done using our method of subjectively choosing groupings of space-time data into non-overlapping period bands by use of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)/ Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) analysis. A CEOF analysis of the SODA bidecadal band shows dominance of 22–24 year periods. Propagating bidecadal mode expansions were then determined through this analysis, which gives two principal modes. The first mode is dominant from 1915 to 1965 and the second from 1970 onward. The amplitude variabilities obtained suggests the presence of regime shifts, which coincide in time with shifts actually observed in European climate and South African lobster fisheries. The first mode is characterized by states with North and South Atlantic subtropical gyres in phase, while tropical and subpolar regions are in opposite phase relative to them. The second mode is characterized by the subpolar gyre and North subtropical gyre almost in quadrature, with North and South subtropical gyres out of phase. The evolution mechanism of this latter mode is related to east-west density contrasts and westward propagating Rossby waves. These waves show phase speeds dominated by geostrophic self-advection of density anomalies relative to the mean meridional density gradient as known from previous studies, but are shown to be additionally influenced by bottom topography. The oscillations caused by these waves are shown to have phase differences (quadrature in the North Atlantic) with regional indices of bidecadal AMOC oscillations. A number of SL-AMOC fingerprints are also reviewed, and a new eastern equatorial fingerprint is proposed.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol indirect forcing is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in estimating the extent of global warming. Increased aerosol levels can enhance the solar reflection from warm liquid clouds countering greenhouse gas warming. However, very little is actually known about the strength of the indirect effects for mixed-phase stratiform clouds as well as other cloud types such as cumulus, altocumulus, nimbostratus, deep convection, and cirrus. These mixed-phase cloud types are ubiquitous and typically overlooked in satellite estimates of the indirect forcing. In this study we assess the responses of each major cloud type to changes in aerosol loading and provide an estimate of their contribution to the global mean indirect forcing. Satellite data is collected from several co-located sensors in the A-train for the period starting in January of 2007 – 2010. Cloud layers are classified according to the 2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR CloudSat product. Radiative fluxes are obtained from CERES (Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System) and examined as a function of the aerosol loading obtained from MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data. For low-level cloud regimes (e.g., stratus, stratocumulus, cumulus) we show that the longwave contribution to the net indirect effect is insignificant and dominated by changes in reflected shortwave radiation which also becomes insignificant as cloud top temperature decreases below 0°C. An increase in the aerosol loading in mixed-phase stratocumulus leads to more ice and precipitation that depletes cloud water and limits cloud brightening. For the more convective type clouds (e.g., altocumulus, nimbostratus, deep convection), increased aerosol loading can invigorate deep convection and promote deeper clouds with higher cloud albedo (cooling effect) and cloud tops that emit less longwave radiation to space (warming effect). As a consequence, the shortwave and longwave indirect radiative effects tend to cancel for the observations of deep convective clouds. Overall, marine warm low-cloud largely govern the aerosol indirect forcing due to its strong sensitivity. Given the significantly weaker sensitivities amongst other cloud regimes it is imperative to incorporate them to improve estimates of the overall strength of the aerosol indirect effect on climate.",

            "abstract": "Arid and semi-arid regions of the world are predicted to continue to expand through land degradation and prolonged drought events. Agricultural practices in these drylands degrade soils through elevated salinity, sodicity and alkalinity. Indeed, flood irrigation loads salts onto the soils including carbonate minerals in the form of calcite. Alfalfa and Pecan are salt tolerant and commonly grown in the arid El Paso region, but need irrigation using Rio Grande water with little to no contribution from local ground waters. We hypothesize that the irrigation is loading extra Ca and bicarbonate to soils and anthropogenically enhancing the precipitation of carbonates. We intend to monitor soil CO2 efflux after irrigation, characterize soil minerals, and combine them to isotopic data of soil, irrigation, and drainage waters to link the sources of Ca and C, kinetics of calcite precipitation, to irrigation events. This will include strontium isotopic analysis to determine the source of calcium in the agricultural fields, U-disequilibrium isotopes to estimate the carbonate ages, and CO2 efflux to monitor atmosphere-soil exchange. Carbon dioxide emissions are expected to change during flood irrigation when soils are saturated. After irrigation events, evaporative effects increase Ca and dissolved inorganic carbon concentration in soil waters leading to precipitation of calcite and thus elevated CO2efflux.\nPreliminary measurements in the pecan field show a marginally significant difference in CO2 fluxes before and after irrigation (p=0.07, t-test). Carbon dioxide emissions are lower during moist conditions (0.6 g m-2hr-1 CO2) than those in dry conditions (1.0 g m-2hr-1 CO2). Future C isotope data are needed to identify the source of extra CO2, biogenic or calcite-precipitation related. A water leachable extraction of alfalfa soils shows 87Sr/86Sr ratios ranged from 0.7101 to 0.7103, indicating Rio Grande river as a dominant calcium source. Further Sr isotopic analysis of sequential extractions from both alfalfa soils (for calcite fraction), pore waters, irrigation waters, and drainage waters will allow us to quantitatively evaluate the source of calcium in calcite therefore, defining if anthropogenic sources of calcium lead to enhanced CO2 production in agricultural fields.",

            "abstract": "Population growth and water scarcity are factors that increase pressures on water resources of the semiarid southwestern United States. In these areas, groundwater recharge and delayed return flow to rivers are hydrological benefits of traditional irrigation systems. A broad spatial-temporal analysis of the dynamics of surface water and groundwater interactions is necessary to improve water planning and management. Our study at three northern New Mexico agricultural valleys with low to high water availability was carried out to characterize surface water and groundwater interactions and to quantify different water budget components. The study sites were instrumented to collect weather data, water flows from rivers and acequias, shallow groundwater level fluctuations, soil physical properties and irrigation and crop management on irrigated lands. From one crop field of our study sites, results showed up to 38 cm of water level response after the beginning of an irrigation event. Other results in our study sites, showed water level response up to 80 cm after canal flow started and ditch seepage of 12% of the total valley surface water flow. Preliminary field scale results from our three study sites showed that deep percolation from irrigation is the major component of the total water budget with 43, 46 and 52% from low, medium and high water availability sites respectively. This farm scale study revealed that, water availability drives the amount of applied water and the irrigation schedule on the farms that in turn drive deep percolation and shallow aquifer recharge. It appears that traditional irrigation is an important source of groundwater recharge in our study valleys. From the ongoing study, we expect to get detailed information about the water distribution over larger spatial scales using field measurements and geographic information systems-based land use classification.",

            "abstract": "Cirrus clouds play an important role in the vertical transport of water vapor between the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL). Unfortunately, the physical limitations of observing the TTL and the model uncertainty surrounding cirrus clouds prevent a full understanding of the properties of cirrus and their role in water vapor transport. However, recently NASA’s ATTREX 3 field mission was undertaken to observe water vapor and cirrus properties in the TTL. The high altitude Global Hawk aircraft gathered a unique in-situ data set from the tropical Western Pacific. This region is known to be crucial for the upward motion of water vapor and chemical transport in the atmosphere, but has been observed infrequently. With the ATTREX data, we investigate the differences between in situ and anvil cirrus, and we assess the relative frequency of heterogeneous and homogenous ice nucleation. Alongside the observational data, we ran NCAR’s CESM model and coupled it to an advanced cirrus model (CARMA). The model was run at a 1x1 degree resolution along the aircraft’s flight track to simulate the observations. We compare the CAM5/CARMA simulations to the aircraft observations to investigate the effectiveness of the model in reproducing the aircraft data.",

            "abstract": "Many Global Climate Models (GCMs) are known to have a high near surface temperature bias over the central portions of Northern Hemisphere continents (e.g. North America). It has been postulated that this high bias is due to the lack of propagating convection in the GCMs, due to their coarse resolution and convective parameterizations. Recent results from the Clouds Above the United States and Errors at the Surface (CAUSES) program indicate that there may be myriad factors contributing to the high bias. Additionally, high resolution, convection permitting simulations (grid spacing of 4 km) performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) have shown that the warm bias persists, even though propagating convection is now resolved in long-term climate simulations.\nThis presentation will examine summertime retrospective regional climate simulations with high temperature biases over the contiguous United States (CONUS) at resolutions similar to GCMs (36-km grid spacing) down to convective permitting resolutions (4-km grid spacing). Identification of days with and without large bias contributions are examined and contrasted. Differences in regional water budgets, surface precipitation, representations of propagating convection, mesoscale organized downdrafts and their evolution will be diagnosed. Use of surface, radiosonde, radar, and satellite observations can highlight key differences in the evolution of clouds, precipitation and resultant cold pools. Additional aspects related to the land-surface such as albedo specification, sensible and latent heat flux partitioning and irrigation impacts on flux partitioning will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Unlike other oceans, the Arctic Ocean is completely surrounded by permafrost, which is being degraded at an increasing rate under warming conditions most pronounced in East Siberian region and Alaska. The thaw and release of organic carbon (OC) from Arctic permafrost is postulated to be one of the most powerful mechanisms causing the net redistribution of carbon from lands and oceans to the atmosphere. The East Siberian Arctic shelf (ESAS) is the world’s largest continental shelf, containing more than 80 % of the world oceans’ subsea permafrost and the largest hydrocarbon reservoir on the planet, while the stability of this sequestered carbon, which exists primarily as CH4, is highly uncertain. This area is heavily influenced by subsea permafrost thaw, and CH4 seeps from subsea permafrost reservoirs under warming conditions. Various other phenomena influence the area, including coastal erosion, mostly caused by onshore permafrost/coastal ice complex thaw; the input of dissolved and particulate OC through the Lena, Indigirka, and Kolyma rivers. The ESAS is also of particular interest for its carbon-climate couplings because thawing of onshore and offshore permafrost leads to the CH4 and CO2 emission to the atmosphere. The overall goal of the current research is to provide a quantitative, observation-based assessment of the dynamics of different ESAS carbon cycle components with emphasize on the emission of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere under changing climatic and environmental conditions.",

Low-magnitude earthquake activity began on February 28, 2008 in the Mogul neighborhood west of urban Reno, NV and continued to build in intensity leading to the MW 5.0 mainshock on April 26, 2008. Initial locations are obtained by applying station and datum corrections to analyst-picked travel times using HYPOINVERSE then relocating the sequence via the HypoDD double-difference algorithm of Waldhauser and Ellsworth (2000) using both cross-correlated and catalog phase data on P and S arrivals. The final relocation set reveals a mechanism-supported temporal and spatial migration of seismicity on several distinct structures prior to the mainshock rupture. First-motion focal mechanisms are computed using the HASH code of Hardebeck and Shearer (2002). We apply the spatial and temporal stress inversion (SATSI) software (Hardebeck and Michael, 2006) to investigate variations in the stress field throughout the sequence. We integrate preliminary analysis of stress drops (ML ≥ 3.0) using an EGF-derived spectral ratio technique. Finally, we determine significant fault planes identified in the foreshock sequence and build a local 3D fault model. We systematically test various slip scenarios on these structures using both CIG’s finite-element crustal deformation code PyLith and the USGS-supported Coulomb 3 program to explore how the foreshocks promote or inhibit failure on subsequent structures that may facilitate mainshock rupture.",

            "abstract": "Slow-moving earthflows regularly exhibit seasonal velocity patterns driven by transient perturbations in effective normal stress that alter the frictional resistance along the sliding surface. These annual velocity patterns are ubiquitous in slow-moving landslides throughout the world, with individual landslides often displaying complex spatial patterns of acceleration that can vary from year to year. Here, we model landslide motion using a rate- and state-dependent frictional treatment that incorporates variations in effective normal stress and material properties, including both velocity-weakening (VW) and velocity-strengthening (VS) patches, along the sliding surface. We calculate changes in effective stress by allowing rainfall-induced changes in pore-water pressure to diffuse vertically from the ground surface to the landslide base. We then solve for changes in frictional strength and velocity along a 1D slip surface that extends the length of the landslide. Model parameters are calibrated using measurements from laboratory tests, field instruments, and satellite InSAR. Our model is able to produce seasonal variations in sliding rate that mimic the patterns commonly displayed by these slope failures. We use our model to identify the conditions under which these slides can transition from non-catastrophic motion to catastrophic failure. We find that non-catastrophic motion occurs if the landslides are comprised of entirely VS material or if their spatial dimensions do not exceed a critical nucleation length, which is determined by the ratio of VW to VS material and the effective stress. Furthermore, this modeling framework suggests that landslides that exhibit spatially varying motion (i.e. consisting of an ensemble of smaller slip patches) may be less likely to fail catastrophically when compared to landslides that exhibit spatially uniform motion if differences in the timing of motion along the landslide reflect the presence of temporary slip barriers (i.e. strong patches). Our rate and state friction model provides a new way to view the evolution of slow-moving earthflows and to predict their behavior. Future work would benefit from additional laboratory tests on materials from a broad (i.e. worldwide) distribution of earthflows to better constrain their frictional properties.",

In this work, an attempt is presented to deal with dynamical variables highlighting both the local topology and the role of space scale.\nIn order to promote local topology to the role of a dynamical variable, use is made of the gradients of the velocity and of the magnetic field, through which the description of the local topology becomes very transparent. Such a formulation, well explored in Hydrodynamics, is extended here to the MHD.\nThe new dynamical variables evolve in a finite scale stochastic dynamics: letting the scale appear explicitly as a variable of the problem helps studying inter-scale processes, while statistical aspects of topological variable dynamics are expected to be extremely relevant in the turbulent regime, where a stochastic field scenario is, in practice, taking place.",

            "abstract": "Precambrian shales and tillites have been insufficiently studied so far. We present oxygen and hydrogen isotope data for 103 bulk shale and tillites that were collected from drillholes on all continents from 3.2 to 1.4Ga. These samples have also been analyzed for total organic and inorganic carbon, total sulfur, δ13Corg values and by XRF for major and trace elements to calculate chemical index of alteration (CIA). Having uncompromised fresh samples from drillcores is a must for this kind of investigation. We have a particularly good coverage for the ca. 2.7-2.2 Ga time interval when Earth experienced 3-4 Snowball Earth glaciations associated with the rapid rise in atmospheric O2 and fluctuations in CO2, thus affecting weathering cycle and attainment of isotopic fractionation. All units have similar to Phanerozoic ranges in δ13Corg values (-23 to -33‰ PDB) and Corg content (0.1 to 10 wt. %). Compared to Phanerozoic shales, Precambrian shales have comparable ranges in δ18O values (+7 to +20‰), with slightly decreasing means with increasing age, and identical δ17O-δ18O slope (0.528). Shales in some drill holes display wide δ18O ranges over short stratigraphic intervals suggesting significant variability in the provenance. We however observe a significant, several permil downward shift and decrease in the range of δ18O values (7-9‰) in 2.2-2.5 Ga shales from several continents that are associated with the Paleoproterozoic glaciations. Scattered negative correlation of CIA with δ18O, for some of these shales broadly associated with the Paleoproterozoic glaciations suggest contact with glacial meltwater having ultra-low-δ18O values during deposition or diagenesis of these shales. The δD values of shales range from -50 to -75‰, and are comparable to Phanerozoic values, with the exception of the ~2.5-2.2 Ga shales that reach to -100‰. We also compare O isotope values of ultra-low-δ18O, +8 to -27‰ SMOW subglacial hydrothermal rocks recently discovered in Karelia (Russia), quartz amygdules in mafics and their relations to our global shale dataset. The overall conclusion is that despite first-order changes in areal mass, exposed surface conditions, pCO2, pO2 affecting chemical/physical weathering cycle, it was not dramatically different before and after the rise of atmospheric oxygen at ~2.3-2.4 Ga.",

            "abstract": "Explosive cyclones are rapidly intensifying low pressure systems with severe wind speeds and precipitation, affecting livelihoods and infrastructure primarily in coastal and marine environments. A better understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on these so called meteorological bombs is therefore of great societal relevance. This study evaluates how well CMIP5 climate models reproduce explosive cyclones in the extratropics of the northern hemisphere, and how these bombs respond to global warming. For this purpose an objective-feature tracking algorithm was used to identify and track extratropical cyclones from 25 CMIP5 models and 3 reanalysis products for the periods 1980 to 2005 and 2070 to 2099. Cyclones were identified as the maxima of T42 vorticity of 6h wind speed at 850 hPa. Explosive and non-explosive cyclones were separated based on the corresponding deepening rates of mean sea level pressure. Most models accurately reproduced the spatial distribution of bombs when compared to results from reanalysis data (R2 = 0.84, p-value = 0.00), with high frequencies along the Kuroshio Current and the Gulf Stream, as well as the exit regions of the polar jet streaks. Most models however significantly underestimated bomb frequencies by a third on average, and by 74% in the most extreme case. This negative frequency bias coincided with significant underestimations of either meridional sea surface temperature (SST) gradients, or wind speeds of the polar jet streaks. Bomb frequency biases were significantly correlated with the number vertical model levels (R2= 0.36, p-value = 0.001), suggesting that the vertical atmospheric model resolution is crucial for simulating bomb frequencies accurately. The impacts of climate change on the location, frequency, and intensity of explosive cyclones were then explored for the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Projections were related to model bias, resolution, projected changes of SST gradients, and wind speeds of the polar jet stream.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved methane, ethane, propane, and butane concentrations in natural waters are traditionally measured using a headspace equilibration technique and gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). While a relatively simple technique, headspace equilibration suffers from slow equilibration times and loss of sensitivity due to concentration dilution with the pure gas headspace. Here we present a newly developed pre-concentration system and auto-analyzer for use with a GC-FID. This system decreases the time required for each analysis by eliminating the headspace equilibration time, increases the sensitivity and precision with a rapid pre-concentration step, and minimized operator time with an autoanalyzer. In this method, samples are collected from Niskin bottles in newly developed 1 L plastic sample bags rather than glass vials. Immediately following sample collection, the sample bags are placed in an incubator and individually connected to a multiport sampling valve. Water is pumped automatically from the desired sample bag through a small (6.5 mL) Liqui-Cel® membrane contactor where the dissolved gas is vacuum extracted and directly flushed into the GC sample loop. The gases of interest are preferentially extracted with the Liqui-Cel and thus a natural pre-concentration effect is obtained.\nDaily method calibration is achieved in the field with a five-point calibration curve that is created by analyzing gas standard-spiked water stored in 5 L gas-impermeable bags. Our system has been shown to substantially pre-concentrate the dissolved gases of interest and produce a highly linear response of peak areas to dissolved gas concentration. The system retains the high accuracy, precision, and wide range of measurable concentrations of the headspace equilibration method while simultaneously increasing the sensitivity due to the pre-concentration step. The time and labor involved in the headspace equilibration method is eliminated and replaced with the immediate and automatic analysis of a maximum of 13 sequential samples. The elapsed time between sample collection and analysis is reduced from approximately 12 hrs to < 10 min, enabling dynamic and highly resolved sampling plans.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decades strong efforts have been made to apply new spaceborn technologies to the study of volcanic activity. Recent studies have shown that the high resolution satellite images can be very useful for tracking of evolution of the stress patterns related to the volcanic activity. It can be done by observing the changes in density and orientation of lineaments extracted from satellite images. A lineament is generally defined as a straight or a somewhat curved feature in the landscape visible in a satellite image as an aligned sequence of pixels of a contrasting intensity compared to the background. The system of lineaments extracted from the satellite images is not identical to the geological lineaments which are usually determined by land-based surveys, nevertheless, it generally reflects the structure of the faults and fractures in the Earth’s crust. For this study the lineaments were detected using the ADALGEO software, based on the Hough transform (Soto-Pinto et al, 2013). A temporal sequence of the Landsat 8 multispectral images of the Lascar volcano, located in the North of Chile, was used to study changes in lineament configuration during 2013-2014. It was found that, the number and orientation of lineaments is affected by microseimicity. In particular, it was found that often the density of lineaments decreases with the intensity of microseisms, which could be related to the volcano inflation.",

            "abstract": "In the study presented here, we used the COSmIC/Titan Haze Simulation (THS) experiment, an experimental platform developed to study Titan’s atmospheric chemistry at low temperature, to produce aerosols representative of the early stages of Titan’s aerosol formation. In the THS, the chemistry is simulated by plasma in the stream of a supersonic expansion. With this unique design, the gas is jet-cooled to Titan-like temperature (~150K) before inducing the chemistry by plasma, and remains at low temperature in the plasma discharge (~200K). Because of the pulsed nature of the plasma, the residence time of the gas in the discharge is only a few microseconds, which leads to a truncated chemistry and allows for the study of the first and intermediate steps of the chemistry. Different N2-CH4-based gas mixtures can be injected in the plasma, with or without the addition of heavier precursors present as trace elements on Titan, in order to monitor the evolution of the chemical growth. Both the gas phase and solid phase products resulting from the plasma-induced chemistry can be monitored and analyzed using a combination of complementary in situ and ex situ diagnostics.\nIn a recently published study, a mass spectrometry analysis of the gas phase has demonstrated that the THS is a unique tool to probe the first and intermediate steps of Titan’s atmospheric chemistry at Titan-like temperature. In particular, the mass spectra obtained in a N2-CH4-C2H2-C6H6 mixture are relevant for comparison to Cassini’s CAPS-IBS instrument. Here we present the results of a complementary study of the solid phase. Scanning Electron Microscopy images have shown that aggregates produced in N2-CH4-C2H2-C6H6 mixtures are much larger (up to 5 μm in diameter) than those produced in N2-CH4 mixtures (0.1-0.5 μm). Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) combined with Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) have detected the presence of aminoacetonitrile, a precursor of glycine, in the THS aerosols. IR measurements show the influence of the trace elements on the balance between aliphatic and aromatic functional groups present in the aerosols. These complementary studies show the high potential of THS to better understand Titan’s chemistry and the origin of aerosol formation.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research is supported by NASA SMD PATM.",

            "abstract": "Computational software and custom-written codes play a key role in scientific research and teaching, providing tools to perform data analysis and forward modeling through numerical computation. However, development of these codes is often hampered by the fact that there is no well-defined way for the authors to receive credit or professional recognition for their work through the standard methods of scientific publication and subsequent citation of the work. This in turn may discourage researchers from publishing their codes or making them easier for other scientists to use. We investigate the issues involved in citing software in a scientific context, and introduce features that should be components of a citation infrastructure, particularly oriented towards the codes and scientific culture in the area of geodynamics research. The codes used in geodynamics are primarily specialized numerical modeling codes for continuum mechanics problems; they may be developed by individual researchers, teams of researchers, geophysicists in collaboration with computational scientists and applied mathematicians, or by coordinated community efforts such as the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics. Some but not all geodynamics codes are open-source. These characteristics are common to many areas of geophysical software development and use. We provide background on the problem of software citation and discuss some of the barriers preventing adoption of such citations, including social/cultural barriers, insufficient technological support infrastructure, and an overall lack of agreement about what a software citation should consist of. We suggest solutions in an initial effort to create a system to support citation of software and promotion of scientific software development.",

            "abstract": "During mountain uplift, fresh silicate rocks are exhumed and broken into small pieces, potentially increasing their chemical weathering rate and thus the consumption of atmospheric CO2. This process remains debated because although erosion provides fresh rocks, it may also decrease their residence time near Earth's surface where clasts weather. Several recent publications also emphasized the key role of forelands in the weathering of clasts exported from the mountains by erosion. Predicting the chemical outflux of mountains requires to account for the chemical evolution of these rocks from their source to outlet. Powerful chemical models based on diffusion-advection of species between rocks and water have been developed at pedon scale, and recently at hillslope scale. In order to track the weathered material, we have developed a different approach based on the introduction into a 3D landscape evolution model (CIDRE) of dissolving discrete spherical clasts that move downslope. In CIDRE, local erosion and deposition depend on slope and water discharge which adapt dynamically during the topographical evolution. On a cell, bedrock is converted to soil at a rate depending on soil thickness. Clasts are initially spread at specified depths. They have a specified initial size and mineralogical composition. Once they enter the soil, they begins to dissolve at a rate depending on their minerals, temperature and exposed area, which decreases the clast size. Clasts move downstream according to probabilities depending on the ratio between the calculated local deposition and erosion fluxes. Chemical outflux is calculated for each clast during its life. At pedon scale, the model predicts chemical depleted fractions close to that obtained with advection-diffusion models and in agreement with measurements. An integrated chemical flux is estimated for the whole landscape from the clast dissolution rates. This flux reaches a stable solution using a suitable number of initial clasts. This method seems promising to predict where and when silicate weathering (and associated CO2 consumption) is maximum through the mountain-foreland continuum.",

            "abstract": "Plagioclase crystals from silicic (andesitic to dacitic) lavas and domes at Volcán Uturuncu, a potentially active volcano in the back-arc of the Andean CVZ (22.3°S, 67.2°W), exhibit large variations in An contents, textures, and core to rim 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Many of the isotopic variations can not have existed at magmatic temperatures for more than a few thousand years. The crystals likely derived from different locations in the crustal magmatic system and mixed just prior to eruption. Uturuncu magmas initially assimilated crustal rocks with high 87Sr/86Sr ratios. The magmas were subsequently modified by frequent recharge of more mafic magmas with lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios. A typical Uturuncu silicic magma therefore only attains its final composition just prior to or during eruption.\nIn the Lazufre region of active surface uplift (~25˚14’S; Volcán Lastarria and Cordon del Azufre) closed system differentiation processes are not the only factors influencing silicic magma compositions. 87Sr/86Sr (0.70651-0.70715) and 206Pb/204Pb ratios (18.83-18.88) are highly elevated and143Nd/144Nd ratios (0.512364 –0.512493) are low relative to similar composition rocks from the “southern Cordillera domain.” These data, along with major and trace element trends, reflect a multitude of differentiation processes and magma sources including crystallization-differentiation of more mafic magmas, melting and assimilation of older crustal rocks, and magma mixing and mingling.\nOn an arc-wide scale silicic lavas erupted from three well-characterized composite volcanoes between 21oS and 22oS (Aucanquilcha, Ollagüe, and Uturuncu) display systematically higher K2O, LILE, REE and HFSE contents and 87Sr/86Sr ratios with increasing distance from the arc-front. In contrast, the lavas have systematically lower Na2O, Sr, and Ba contents; LILE/HFSE ratios; 143Nd/144Nd ratios; and more negative Eu anomalies. Silicic magmas along the arc-front apparently reflect melting of relatively young, mafic composition amphibolitic source rocks with the continental crust becoming increasingly older with a more felsic bulk composition toward the east. We suggest this results from progressively smaller degrees of mantle partial melting, primary melt generation, and crustal hybridization with distance from the arc-front.",

            "abstract": "Scheduled for launch in 2020, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will measure river height, width, and slope, globally, as well as characterizing storage change in lakes, and ocean surface dynamics. Four discharge algorithms have been formulated to solve the inverse problem of river discharge from SWOT observations. Three of these approaches are based on Manning’s equation, while the fourth utilizes at-many-stations hydraulic geometry relating width and discharge. In all cases, SWOT will provide some but not all of the information required to estimate discharge. The focus of the inverse approaches is estimation of the unknown parameters. The algorithms use a range of a priori information.\nThis paper will generate synthetic measurements of height, width, and slope for a number of rivers, including reaches of the Sacramento, Ohio, Mississippi, Platte, Amazon, Garonne, Po, Severn, St. Lawrence, and Tanana. These rivers have a wide range of flows, geometries, hydraulic regimes, floodplain interactions, and planforms. One-year synthetic datasets will be generated in each case. We will add white noise to the simulated quantities and generate scenarios with different repeat time. The focus will be on retrievability of the hydraulic parameters across a range of space-time sampling, rather than on ability to retrieve under the specific SWOT orbit.\nWe will focus on several specific research questions affecting algorithm performance, including river characteristics, temporal sampling, and algorithm accuracy. The overall goal is to be able to predict which algorithms will work better for different kinds of rivers, and potentially to combine the outputs of the various algorithms to obtain more robust estimates. Preliminary results on the Sacramento River indicate that all algorithms perform well for this single-channel river, with diffusive hydraulics, with relative RMSE values ranging from 9% to 26% for the various algorithms. Preliminary sensitivity tests indicate that Manning-based approaches are more sensitive to slope error on the Sacramento River than on the Garonne River, but more sensitive to width error for the Garonne River. Fully understanding these tradeoffs is critical for reliable deployment of these algorithms for global discharge estimation from SWOT observations.",

            "abstract": "Deltas hold major economic potential due their strategic location, close to seas and inland waterways, thereby supporting intense economic activity. The increasing pace of human development activities in coastal deltas over the past five decades has also strained environmental resources and produced extensive economic and sociocultural impacts. The Amazon delta is located in the Amazon Basin, North Brazil, the largest river basin on Earth and also one of the least understood. A considerable segment of the population living in the Amazon delta is directly dependent on the local extraction of natural resources for their livelihood. Areas sparsely inhabited may be exploited with few negative consequences for the environment. However, increasing pressure on ecosystem services is amplified by large fluxes of immigrants from other parts of the country, especially from the semi-arid zone in Northeast Brazil to the lowland forests of the Amazon delta. Here we present partial results from a bigger research project. Therefore, the focus will be on presenting an overview of the current state, and the extent of changes on forest related ecosystem services in the Amazon delta over the last three decades. We aggregated a multitude of datasets, from a variety of sources, for example, from satellite imagery such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and climate datasets at meteorological station level from the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) and social and economic statistics data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and from the Brazilian Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA). Through analysis of socioeconomic and satellite earth observation data we were able to produce and present spatially-explicit information with the current state and transition in forest cover and its impacts to forest ecosystem services providing units in the Amazon delta.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for extreme weather phenomena and their changing behaviour in a warming world is essential to predict such events. This task, however, is challenging because of the nonlinear behaviour of the climate system, the small scales and fast dynamics of extreme events and the inherent intermittency of our turbulent atmosphere and ocean. Recent work has shown that representing the inherent intermittency and chaotic nature of turbulent sub-grid scale processes, such as convection, via stochastic parameterizations can improve the performance of weather and climate models, including the interaction of sub-grid scale processes and large scale climate. However, the influence of stochastic parameterizations on the prediction of extreme events has not received much attention.\nIn this study we explore the influence of a stochastic parameterization of convection on the statistics of extreme rainfall events in the USA. The deep convection parameterization of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5), which is based upon the bulk mass-flux scheme of Zheng and McFarlane, is modified to have a stochastic entrainment rate in the mixing model for the calculation of dilute CAPE. The entrainment events are described by a stochastic Poisson process, based on cloud resolving model simulations by Romps and Kuang [2010]. This modification represents turbulent mixing in the atmosphere in a manner more consistent with large eddy simulations of convection.\nWe find that the stochastic scheme results in an increase in the amounts of both light and intense precipitation, which is in closer agreement with observed rainfall distributions compared to results from CAM5 with its usual deterministic parameterization of convection. The increase is due to changes in both the convective precipitation and the large scale precipitation, which suggests that stochastic entrainment alters not just the sub-grid scale processes but also their interaction with the large scale climate. We use a hindcast-based system developed by O’Brien et al. [abstract submitted to session #2018] to characterize the influence of stochasticity on the fidelity of simulated extremes.",

            "abstract": "The South Polar Residual Cap (SPRC) on Mars is an icy reservoir of CO2. If all the CO2 trapped in the SPRC were released to the atmosphere the mean annual global surface pressure would rise by ~20 Pa. Repeated MOC and HiRISE imaging of scarp retreat within the SPRC led to suggestions that the SPRC is losing mass. Estimates for the loss rate vary between 0. 5 Pa per Mars Decade to 13 Pa per Mars Decade. Assuming 80% of this loss goes directly into the atmosphere, an estimate based on some modeling (Haberle and Kahre, 2010), and that the loss is monotonic, the global annual mean surface pressure should have increased between ~1-20 Pa since the Viking mission (~20 Mars years ago).\nSurface pressure measurements by the Phoenix Lander only 2.5 Mars years ago were found to be consistent with these loss rates. Last year at this meeting we compared surface pressure data from the MSL mission through sol 360 with that from Viking Lander 2 (VL-2) for the same period to determine if the trend continues. The results were ambiguous. This year we have a full Mars year of MSL data to work with. Using the Ames GCM to compensate for dynamics and environmental differences, our analysis suggests that the mean annual pressure has decreased by ~ 8 Pa since Viking.\nThis result implies that the SPRC has gained (not lost) mass since Viking. However, the estimated uncertainties in our analysis are easily at the 10 Pa level and possibly higher. Chief among these are the hydrostatic adjustment of surface pressure from grid point elevations to actual elevations and the simulated regional environmental conditions at the lander sites. For these reasons, the most reasonable conclusion is that there is no significant difference in the size of the atmosphere between now and Viking. This implies, but does not demand, that the mass of the SPRC has not changed since Viking.\nOf course, year-to-year variations are possible as implied by the Phoenix data. Given that there has been no unusual behavior in the climate system as observed by a variety of spacecraft at Mars since Phoenix, its seems more likely that the Phoenix data simply did not have a long enough record to accurately determine annual mean pressure changes as Haberle and Kahre (2010) cautioned. In the absence of a strong signal in the MSL data, we conclude that if the SPRC is loosing mass it is not going into the atmosphere reservoir.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of VOC composition from fossil fuels are analytically challenging because of the complex mixture of hydrocarbons (saturated, unsaturated, aromatics, etc). Speciated chemical measurements typically rely on relatively slow GC separation. Proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) is advantageous due to its fast response and high sensitivity. The most common ionization mechanism applied to VOC detection by PTR-MS is proton transfer from hydronium ion (H3O+). However, alkanes cannot be detected using H3O+ ionization chemistry because their proton affinities are too low. Ionization of alkanes is possible via electron transfer and/or hydride abstraction using O2+ or NO+.\nWe used PTR-MS to analyze aromatic, alkene and alkane (linear, branched and cyclic) compounds simultaneously not by switching the ionization agents, but by adjusting the drift tube voltage and optimizing the ratio of H3O+/O2+ produced in the instrument’s ion source. The highest detection sensitivity for aromatic and alkene compounds was produced by proton transfer from H3O+, while hydride abstraction by O2+ allowed detection of alkanes. For alkanes, sensitivities ranged from 1.1±0.01 cps/ppbv for n-decane to 74.7±0.25 cps/ppbv for decalin. Sensitivities in O2+ mode were from 6 (Adamantane) to 146 (4-Methyl nonane) times higher than those obtained in H3O+ mode under the same ion source and drift tube voltage conditions. Sensitivities for butyl benzene and 1-decene were 157±0.57 and 66.8±0.21 cps/ppbv, respectively. Sensitivity differences among C10 hydrocarbons are related to their structure, which affects their ionization energies (IE) and hence ease of hydride abstraction. Sensitivities at the parent ion mass were inversely correlated with IE (142 cps/ppbv/eV). This suggests higher electronic stability for cyclic non substituted compounds, followed by cyclic substituted, branch linear and linear C10 hydrocarbons. Although selectivity is a known shortcoming of quadrupole-based PTR-MS, we demonstrated that, when optimized, it can be a useful tool to study alkanes, olefins, and aromatics simultaneously in high concentration plumes or in a laboratory.\nAMO acknowledges financial support of UCMEXUS-CONACyT Program for the Postdoctoral Fellowship",

Spatial and temporal (i.e., time series analysis) correlations of the trends extracted from GRACE-derived (TWSGRACE) and LSM-derived (TWSLSM) TWS indicate the following: (1) Large (≥ 90 % by area) sectors of Africa are undergoing statistically significant TWSGRACE and TWSLSM variations due to natural and anthropogenic causes; (2) a general correspondence between TWSGRACE and TWSLSM over areas (e.g., Niger and Mozambique NE basins in eastern and western Africa) largely controlled by natural (i.e., increase/decrease in precipitation and/or temperature) causes; (3) discrepancies are observed over areas that witnessed extensive anthropogenic effects measured by TWSGRACE but unaccounted for by TWSLSM. Examples include: (a) strong (compared to that observed by TWSLSM) negative TWSGRACE trends were observed over areas that witnessed heavy groundwater extraction (e.g., Western, Desert, Egypt); (b) strong (compared to that observed by TWSLSM) positive TWSGRACE over Lake Volta reservoir; and (c) strong (compared to that observed by TWSLSM) negative trends over areas undergoing heavy deforestation (e.g., northern and NW Congo Basin); (4) additional discrepancies in other areas (e.g., Zambezi and the Okavango basins) are attributed to models being uncalibrated and not simulating all of the TWS components (e.g., river storage and groundwater in GLDAS; lakes and reservoirs in GLDAS and CLM4.5) . Future work should focus on using TWSGRACE to calibrate TWSLSM.",

            "abstract": "Continents strongly constrain the planform of the mantle convection/plate tectonic system. They impose long wavelength structure on surface velocities and tend to collect subduction zones around their margins . Additionally, they may affect the ability of the underlying mantle to effectively cool, which would create persistent temperature gradients between subcontinental and suboceanic mantle. These effects will change the moment of inertia of the planet and may control its rotational dynamics. Configurations of the continents have been implicated for both Earth's apparent Cenozoic rotational stability as well as its potential for large scale true polar wander deeper in its past. Here we present investigations into how continents can affect Earth's long term rotational stability. We have developed a version of the mantle convection code Aspect with a free outer surface, allowing for isostatically compensated continents and dynamic topography due to plumes and slabs. This allows us to self-consistently calculate moment of inertia anomalies in mantle convection models with surface continents and lateral viscosity variations. We explore different surface fractions of continental material as well as different mantle viscosity structures to identify when continents have a controlling influence. Finally, we discuss implications for Earth history, during which both continental mass and mantle viscosity may have changed significantly.",

            "abstract": "The Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) mass extinction (~66 Ma) was associated with a collapse in the carbon isotopic (δ13C) gradient between planktonic and benthic foraminifera and a decrease in bulk carbonate δ13C values. These perturbations have been attributed to three hypotheses: the Strangelove Ocean, with global collapse of primary productivity; the Living Ocean, with greatly reduced export but not primary productivity; and the Resilient Ocean, with persistent export productivity. While previous studies have focused on deep-sea locations, we tested the hypotheses in the paleo-continental shelf of New Jersey, USA, where δ13C values and organic carbon accumulation rates can distinguish among the hypotheses. We also evaluated interbasinal deep-sea δ13C differences between Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Sites 1210 (Shatsky Rise, North Pacific) and 1262 (Walvis Ridge, South Atlantic). New Jersey shelf shows that a ~2.5 ‰ δ13C drop in bulk carbonate, a collapse of the vertical δ13C gradient between planktonic and benthic foraminifera, and a significant decrease in organic carbon mass accumulation rates occurred across the K/Pg boundary. We interpret a ~1.0 ‰ water column δ13C gradient and cross-shelf benthic foraminiferal δ13C gradient in the early Danian to reflect the presence of active primary productivity, strongly supporting the Living Ocean hypothesis. Deep-sea δ13C differences between ODP Sites 1210 and 1262 show that the interbasinal deep-sea benthic foraminiferal δ13C gradient collapsed immediately after the mass extinction, which is consistent with a strong reduction in the export productivity after the K/Pg boundary. However, the ocean floor in highly productive regions like the equatorial Pacific may have continued to receive significant export productivity.",

            "abstract": "Despite the global occurrence of salt, very few salt bodies outcrop and are presently preserved at the surface. Because of this much of our knowledge on salt structures is sourced from subsurface imaging and modeling and less from field based studies. Using interferometry of synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) we monitor surface displacements across four surface salt outcrops in the western margin of the Kuqa fold-thrust belt of Xinjiang Province, China. An InSAR time series was constructed from 40 Envisat ASAR C-band images between June 2003 and October 2010. Interferometric processing was completed using the New Small Baseline Algorithm Subset (NSBAS). These poorly studied salt structures provide a fresh opportunity to study how salt behaves on the surface. The salt bodies outcrop along an active intracontinental thrust system between the Tian Shan and Tarim basin to the south. The four surface namakiers (salt glaciers) were analyzed in this study include: the Quele, Awate, Bozidun, and an unnamed structure referred to as the Western namakier. The ~35 km long Quele namakier is a line-sourced structure advancing along the Quele salt thrust. The other three namakiers range between ~1-3 km long and are point-sourced structures. The namakiers studied display non-steady deformation with rates of displacement varying between uplifts of up to +4 cm/yr and subsidence rates of -4 cm/yr. Additionally, the Kuqa fold-thrust belt hosts a number of hydrocarbon fields and InSAR measurements detect significant anthropogenic deformation associated with hydrocarbon extraction and fluid injection.",

            "abstract": "During the late Holocene, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) all in part influenced precipitation along the southeastern United States (US) coast. While proxy records show a warm/dry Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) along the eastern US, Little Ice Age (LIA) records demonstrate a regional heterogeneity with the more northern sites indicating wet conditions and southern sites indicating dry.\nWe used detailed pollen, microscopic charcoal, and carbon accumulation records from a well-dated core collected in a salt marsh along the Nassau River, Fl and compared it with other regional proxies of climate to help discern the multi-decadal drivers of climate during the late Holocene in the southeastern US. The Nassau River is ideal because it is sensitive to changes in both summer and winter precipitation unlike rivers farther south (summer) and north (winter). Pollen indicative of sustained dry conditions (e.g. Amaranthaceae) and microscopic charcoal increase during MCA-I, which is characterized by strong La Nina conditions and positive NAO and AMO. Carbon accumulation rates are elevated during MCA-I compared to MCA-II. During the LIA, Amaranthaceae pollen and microscopic charcoal drastically decline while fire suppressed pollen taxa, which indicate wetter conditions, increase. LIA carbon accumulation rates are among the lowest in the record. Proxy records suggest this period is dominated by El Nino conditions and a negative NAO and AMO. During the LIA, the AMO includes regional differences in precipitation during any single phase. For instance, during a positive (negative) AMO, the US northeast coast experiences less (greater) precipitation, while the south Florida experiences greater (less) precipitation. Therefore, our pollen and microscopic charcoal data suggest that the phase of the AMO during the LIA was a major driver of spatial heterogeneity in precipitation observed between south Florida and more northerly sites along the eastern United States.",

            "abstract": "The volume of a volcano's magma reservoir places a fundamental limit on the maximum size of an eruption (neglecting significant co-eruptive recharge), and also controls the temporal evolution of eruptive activity. Geochemical residence times, the volumes of aseismic zones beneath volcanoes, and the volumes of past eruptive products may all be used to estimate reservoir volume, but most estimates are associated with a great deal of uncertainty and can vary by an order of magnitude or more for a single volcano.\nSimple eruption models which assume that eruption rate is proportional to the pressure in a deflating elastic reservoir suggest that the reservoir volume should be directly proportional to the erupted volume, to the magnitude of ground deformation around the volcano, and to the rate of change of these observations during an eruption. However, these observations are inadequate for directly estimating reservoir volume; we must also place constraints on reservoir pressure or properties of the conduit linking the reservoir to the surface.\nUsing simple theoretical models and Monte Carlo simulations with more sophisticated models we evaluate our ability to place limits on reservoir volume using different combinations of information including ground deformation, eruption rate, the changing surface heights of active lava lakes, and the compressibility of the magma-reservoir system. Particularly useful in combination with geodetic data is constraint on co-eruptive pressure change, inferred from limitations on host rock strength or changing lava lake height; observations of the latter have allowed for a direct estimate of the shallow reservoir volume at Kīlauea Volcano (on the order of one cubic km). We also demonstrate that geodetic and eruption rate data can provide constraint on a magma’s volatile content; conversely, independent constraint on volatile content (such as from melt inclusion data) can place a lower bound, and sometimes an upper bound, on reservoir volume.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the origin of wave packets in elastic waves propagate through a rock sample based on a 3D finite difference method (FDM) simulation. Though direct waves of the transmitted waves have been applied to estimate the internal structure of a rock sample, later part of the waveforms did not utilized because their origin were unclear. Understanding the reflection and conversion effect in a rock sample would help to retrieve more information from whole waveform as with the analysis in natural fields.\nWe numerically simulated the elastic wave propagation in a medium model which covers a cylindrical shape of a rock sample. The model was discretized into 1024 x 1024 x 2048 grid points with an interval of 54 micrometer in horizontal direction and 60 micrometer in vertical direction. The density, P wave velocity, and S wave velocity of the each grid point are assumed to be proportional to the X-ray absorption coefficient derived from the micro focus X-ray CT images of a Westery granite sample. We applied a single point force on the boundary of the model sample which mimics realistic transducer movement.\nThe wave propagation movie obtained from the numerical simulation shows very complicated wavefield in a rock sample. Because a rock sample is small and closed, once waves are radiated, they were trapped in the sample by repeating reflection and conversion. Many reflected waves which followed by the converted waves were generated at the sample side surface as well as the upper and lower end. The phase with the largest amplitude propagate along the curved boundary was detected as Rayleigh wave from the particle motions on the sample side surface. Additionally, the surface waves were observed not only in the horizontal section but also in the vertical section.\nOur simulation indicated that the later phases of the transmitted waves are highly affected by the sample boundary. In order to extract accurate interior information from the transmitted waves, elimination technique of the boundary effect should be considered.",

The second method computes the power centroid (Cohen, 1995) of the time-frequency spectrum, obtained using either the Gabor or Stockwell Transform. Common to both methods is the necessity of division by a diagonal matrix, which requires appropriate regularization.\nWe modify Fomel’s (2007) method by explicitly penalizing the roughness of the estimate. Following Farquharson and Oldenburg (2004), we employ both the L curve and GCV methods to obtain the smoothest model that fits the data in the L2 norm.\nUsing synthetic data, quarry blast, earthquakes and the DPRK tests, our results suggest that the optimal method depends on the data.

            "abstract": "We conducted a study using data from continuous Global Positioning System (CGPS) stations throughout Mexico to understand a variety of factors that may have an impact on crustal deformation of Mexico—a research topic investigated for many years. This arises from the fact that Mexico is directly influenced by the interactions between the North American, Pacific, Cocos, Caribbean and Rivera tectonic plates. We analyzed CGPS data originating from several networks covering Mexico. These stations have been installed to serve diverse purposes and applications, and are administered by diverse organizations that include government agencies and public universities. We evaluated a total of 80 CGPS stations operating in Mexico; where dual-frequency geodetic-grade GPS receivers collected data continuously during periods between 1994 and 2014.5, in order to provide a synoptic view of the crustal velocity field of Mexico. The CGPS sites located in the Mexican territory were processed with respect to 133 sites outside of Mexico (i.e., Caribbean, Pacific, South and North American plates) in order to evaluate crustal deformation in Mexico in the context of the relative motions among these tectonic plates. Given the heterogeneous nature of the available GPS networks, we performed an analysis of time-series in terms of their duration and precision, finding generally high precision. From the estimated crustal velocities, we observe that these are very comparable (± 1 mm) with respect to previously derived values for stations located at the Baja Peninsula and the Oaxaca—Guerrero region. In general, the behavior of the northern CGPS spanning Mexico are very consistent with North American plate motion.",

            "abstract": "Microphysical and resolution sensitivities of explicitly resolved convection within mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) in the central United States are well documented in the context of single case studies simulated by cloud resolving models (CRMs) under tight boundary and initial condition constraints. While such an experimental design allows researchers to causatively isolate the effects of CRM microphysical and resolution parameterizations on modeled MCSs, it is still challenging to produce conclusions generalizable to multiple storms. The uncertainty associated with the results of such experiments comes both from the necessary physical constraints imposed by the limited CRM domain as well as the inability to evaluate or control model internal variability. A computationally practical method to minimize these uncertainties is the use of super-parameterized (SP) global climate models (GCMs), in which CRMs are embedded within GCMs to allow their free interaction with one another as orchestrated by large-scale global dynamics. This study uses NCAR’s SP Community Atmosphere Model 5 (SP-CAM5) to evaluate microphysical and horizontal resolution sensitivities in summer ensembles of nocturnal MCSs in the central United States. Storm events within each run were identified using an objective empirical orthogonal function (EOF) algorithm, then further calibrated to harmonize individual storm signals and account for the temporal and spatial heterogeneity between them. Three summers of control data from a baseline simulation are used to assess model internal interannual variability to measure its magnitude relative to sensitivities in a number of distinct experimental runs with varying CRM parameters. Results comparing sensitivities of convective intensity to changes in fall speed assumptions about dense rimed species, one- vs. two-moment microphysics, and CRM horizontal resolution will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The gravitational torque on Mercury's solid mantle from a solid inner core displaces the spin axis from the Cassini state when the second--degree shapes of the mantle and inner core are misaligned. Dissipation brings the spins of the inner core, outer fluid core, and mantle to stationary equilibrium positions in the frame of the precessing orbit, where such misalignment is sustained. The equilibrium spin axes of the mantle, fluid core, and inner core all lie in the plane determined by the orbit normal and the Laplace plane normal and precess with the orbit. The fluid and inner core spins have\n∼4\narcmin higher obliquities than the mantle spin, which is itself displaced from the Cassini state toward higher obliquity by an angle that exceeds the 5 arcsec uncertainty in the observed spin axis position if a hydrostatic inner core size exceeds\n∼0.35\nMercury radii. The equilibrium mantle obliquity increases with the inner core size. Rather than placing an upper bound on the inner core size, this result means that the determination of the obliquity of the Cassini state and the determination of\nC/M\nR\n2\ntherefrom are incomplete, where\nC,M,andR\nare Mercury's polar moment of inertia, mass and radius respectively. The dependence of the mantle obliquity on the inner core size and shape as well as\nC/M\nR\n2\nand the second degree coefficients in the expansion of Mercury's gravitational field\nJ\n2\nand\nC\n22\nmeans our determination of\nC/M\nR\n2\n=0.346\nfrom only the latter three parameters is more uncertain than previously estimated, since the inner core size and shape remain unknown. The precise value of\nC/M\nR\n2\nis a crucial constraint on Mercury's internal structure.",

            "abstract": "Volcaniclastic turbidity currents can be caused by subaerial explosive eruptions. However, their flow and emplacement processes in oceanic environment are still ambiguous. Core data obtained by deep-ocean drilling give constraints on the origin of such turbidity currents and resultant deposits. In this presentation, stratigraphy and grain data of volcaniclastic deposits from IODP site U1398 cores are shown and the origin of the deposit is discussed. The site is located 120 km southwest of Dominica Island. The uppermost unit that we study extends 0-40 mbsf. The main part is composed of a series of thick massive volcaniclastic turbidites, and is divided into several subunits. Each subunit has a few to 10 m thick and is separated by thin layers of fine materials or hemipelagic mud. Most of the layers are massive, composed of sorted, medium to coarse sand, and poor in fines. Some are normally graded. The upper turbidite is thick and massive, and contains abundant pumice clasts. They tend to concentrate in middle or upper part of the layer. Components of matrix are represented by pumice, massive lava, crystals (pl, opx, cpx, qz, hbl, titanomagnetite), and sparse carbonates. Generally, in normally graded layers, upper finer part is rich in pumice and bioclasts, and lower part is richer in crystals. In some layers, crystal concentration in matrix vary in proportion up to 80 wt.%, and its variation is correlated with magnetic susceptibility data. Grain size and component characteristics and their variations are thought to reflect emplacement process of volcaniclastic turbidity currents. Importantly, the grain characteristics are almost identical to the previous description for subaerial deposits or piston core data of the Roseau Tuff (~30 ka B.P.) that originated from the largest eruption in the Lesser Antilles in the last 200,000 years. The eruption formed caldera(s) on land in Dominica, and the most of the materials were deposited beneath the sea. Also it has been thought that subaqueous flows travelled down >200 km in Grenada Basin. New data from the site U1398 will give insights into the emplacement processes of volcaniclastic turbidity currents from the explosive events in Dominica.",

            "abstract": "A climatology of extreme Greenland blocks from 1958–2013 is examined within the context of anomalous anticyclonic circulation patterns over the North Atlantic region during recent years and accelerating Greenland Ice Sheet surface melting. The Greenland Blocking Index is used to quantify 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies for the identification of extreme blocking episodes. The annual rate of extreme blocking days has doubled since 1958, reaching an average of approximately 20 days per year by 2013. Over the western and eastern sectors of Greenland, surface energy budget components and meltwater production simulated by the Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) regional model are examined during extreme blocks, particularly those accompanied by precursor cyclones. Based on an analysis of backward trajectories and North Atlantic SST anomalies, enhanced surface melting during the summer, particularly over southern and western Greenland, is strongly linked to the combination of vigorous tropospheric warming generated by the blocking anticyclones and anomalous warm air advection supplied by the precursor cyclones. In addition to vigorous adiabatic warming and maximum insolation associated with the blocking high, diabatic sources of heating linked to precursor cyclones are also critical for enhancing runoff. Long-term increases in GrIS surface melting can be partially attributed to the interaction of these atmospheric and oceanic processes.",

            "abstract": "Lightning produces strong broadband radio waves, called \"sferics\", which propagate in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide and are detected thousands of kilometers away from their source. Global real-time detection of lightning strokes including their time, location and energy, is conducted with the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). In the ionosphere, these sferics couple into very low frequency (VLF) whistler waves which propagate obliquely to the Earth's magnetic field. Possible one-to-one coincidence between lightning and VLF whistler wave is already found by the conjunction work between WWLLN and Van Allen Probes (formerly known as the Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP)). The previous global study showed a good match between WWLLN sferics and RBSP VLF whistlers at low L shell region (L < 3). In this summer, we started obtaining high sampling mode data from RBSP near the apogee. Initial results indicate many one-to-one coincidences at high L shell region (L>4). The whistlers observed at high L shell region are often nose whistlers. In our work, we will show the statistics results between WWLLN sferics and RBSP VLF whistlers at high L shell region. This talk will also explore the difference between low and high latitude lightning VLF wave propagation.",

            "abstract": "S-520-23 sounding rocket experiments are carried out at Uchinoura Space Center (USC) in Japan at 19:20 LT on 2 September, 2007. The purpose of this experiment is the investigation of the process of momentum transportation between the atmospheres and the plasma in the thermosphere during the summer evening time at mid latitudes. The S-520-23 payload was equipped with a two set of orthogonal double probes to measure both DC and AC less than 40Hz electric fields in the spin plane of the payload. One of the double probe is the inflatable structure antenna, called the SPINAR, with a length of 5m tip-to-tip. The SPINAR was the first successful use of an inflatable structure as a flight antenna. It extended and worked without any problems. Another one is the NEI type antenna with a length of 2m tip-to-tip. The electrodes of two double probe antennas were used to gather the potentials which were detected with high impedance pre-amplifiers using the floating (unbiased) double probe technique. The potential differences on the two main orthogonal axes were digitized on-board using 16-bit analog-digital converters, sampled at 400 samples/sec with low pass filters at cut-off frequency of 40Hz.\nWe have investigated the DC electric field during the rocket ascent. And it was able to obtain the electric field vector in a geographic-coordinates system. The direction of DC electric field vector at altitude from 140km to 170km is seems to be dependent on the direction of a neutral wind in the ionosphere. And intensity of DC electric field is increasing at altitude more than 260km. Its direction is east. It is thought that the polarization electric field was observed in the region where the difference of the electron density was large after sunset.\nIn this presentation, we will describe the result of investigation of the relationship between an electric field and ionospheric plasma in detail. Especially the dependence of the direction of electric field and the direction of the neutral wind is investigated. Then we will show the irradiated region during the sounding rocket flight, and examine a possibility that a polarization electric field is generated in this region.",

            "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated the highly dynamic nature of hydrologic connectivity, and the vertical and spatial expansion of the active watershed area during wet periods. While activation of variable DOM and solute sources during expansion and contraction periods has been well documented in a number of systems, changes in nutrient loading to streams have rarely been linked explicitly to in-stream function.\nTo this end, we investigated the linkages between terrestrial mobilization of DOC and DIC, in-stream biogeochemical cycling, and downstream transport across scales in two geomorphically contrasting watersheds located in Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, Montana. We deployed a network of in-situ high frequency sensors with a focus on CO2, dissolved oxygen, fluorescent DOM, nitrate, and a suite of supporting chemical constituents every 30 minutes beginning with the onset of snowmelt and through summer baseflow recession.\nOur results suggest that DOM and DIC fluxes, as well as ecosystem processes such as metabolism, were coupled to watershed scale carbon accumulation and mobilization. In both watersheds, metabolism tracked the temporal trends of DOM loading from the terrestrial landscape, indicating that the streams are actively transforming allochthonous organic materials during transport. Headwater stream reaches in the watershed with more hydrologically connected riparian source areas exhibited elevated metabolism, carbon uptake, and carbon export as compared to streams in the watershed with less riparian connectivity, suggesting that the degree of riparian connectivity may explain spatial variation in metabolism and in-stream carbon cycling within and across stream networks.\nUltimately, this study highlights the tight coupling between terrestrial uplands and in-stream ecosystem processes in headwater catchments, and identifies spatio-temporal variation in hydrologic connectivity as a key driver of in-stream metabolic variation. We posit that the balance between biologically and physically driven in-stream fluxes (i.e. relative rates of metabolic components and downstream transport) across watersheds, stream network position, and time can provide new insight into the linkages of watershed and in-stream processes.",

            "abstract": "Diesel engines are the largest source of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions nationally, and also a major contributor to the black carbon (BC) fraction of fine particulate matter (PM). Recently, diesel particle filter (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) emission control systems that target exhaust PM and NOx have become standard equipment on new heavy-duty diesel trucks. However, the deliberate catalytic oxidation of engine-out nitric oxide (NO) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in continuously regenerating DPFs leads to increased tailpipe emission of NO2. This is of potential concern due to the toxicity of NO2 and the resulting increases in atmospheric formation of other air pollutants such as ozone, nitric acid, and fine PM. While use of SCR reduces emissions of both NO and NO2, it may lead to increased emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas.\nHere we report results from on-road measurements of heavy-duty diesel truck emissions conducted at the Port of Oakland and the Caldecott Tunnel in the San Francisco Bay Area. Emission factors (g pollutant per kg of diesel) were linked via recorded license plates to individual truck attributes, including engine model year and installed emission control equipment. Between 2009 and 2013, the fraction of DPF-equipped trucks at the Port of Oakland increased from 2 to 99%, and median engine age decreased from 11 to 6 years. Over the same period, fleet-average emission factors for black carbon and NOx decreased by 76 ± 22% and 53 ± 8%, respectively. However, direct emissions of NO2 increased, and consequently the NO2/NOx emission ratio increased from 0.03 ± 0.02 to 0.18 ± 0.03. Older trucks retrofitted with DPFs emitted approximately 3.5 times more NO2 than newer trucks equipped with both DPF and SCR. Preliminary data from summer 2014 measurements at the Caldecott Tunnel suggest that some older trucks have negative emission factors for N2O, and that for newer trucks, N2O emission factors have changed sign and are significantly increased. More comprehensive analysis of the effects of SCR on diesel NOx and N2O emissions will be reported in the presentation.\nThese on-road emission studies indicate that advanced emission control systems such as DPF and SCR dramatically reduce PM and NOx emissions, but can cause undesirable side effects like increased NO2 and N2O emissions.",

            "abstract": "Although a great deal is known about crustal extensional processes in the East African Rift System (EARS), questions remain as to the impact of extension on the continental lithospheric mantle. The northernmost portion of the EARS is the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), which is divided into three sectors: the Northern, (NMER), Central (CMER), and the Southern Main Ethiopian Rift (SMER). The NMER-CMER transition coincides with the Yerer-Tullu Wellel volcanotectonic lineament (YTVL), and may represent a terrain boundary along which extension was directed during the Cenozoic. Here we present petrographic data from peridotite xenoliths contained within ~6 Ma lavas recovered along the western portion of the YTVL near Nekempte, Ethiopia to examine the characteristics of the lithospheric mantle, and how peridotite has responded to extensional strain. Our preliminary results show that the Nekempte xenoliths are deformed spinel-bearing lherzolites, which previous studies have constrained to the spinel lherzolites field at 1.1 GPa in the lithospheric mantle. Petrographic examination of these xenoliths reveals two generations of crystals. These generations are defined by both size and texture; the first generation (coarse crystals) being up to 4 mm in diameter and the second generation (fine crystals) being less than 1 mm in diameter. The samples contain two generations of olivine (Ol I and Ol II) and orthopyroxene (Opx I and Opx II), one generation of clinopyroxene (Cpx I), spinel (Spl I), amphibole (Amp), and many fluid inclusion trails. We compare these xenoliths to samples from Injibara, Lake Tana Province, approximately 200 km north of Nekempte on the Ethiopian Plateau, a region with less focused extensional strain. Xenoliths from Injibara are also spinel-bearing lherzolites, however they exhibit less strain and metasomatic textures in comparison to xenoliths from along the YTVL. Based on the petrographic and textural analyses performed, we propose that the larger scale recrystallization of mineral phases and metasomatic textures seen in the Nekempte xenoliths are a result of more focused extensional strain in the continental lithospheric mantle.",

            "abstract": "Recent field studies have shown that bedrock groundwater may play an important role to control the dynamics of the saturated subsurface flow in humid and steep mountainous regions. However many of existing hydrologic models typically assume impermeable bedrock and simulate saturated subsurface flow as a dominant runoff process. The objective of this study is to develop a simple groundwater model for mountainous bedrock aquifer incorporated to a distributed rainfall-runoff model to assess the importance of the bedrock groundwater for hydrologic simulations. The proposed model assumes the exponential-decline hydraulic conductivity in the bedrock to avoid defining the unknown bottom boundary. For the soil layer, it employs a stage-discharge relationship to simulate the unsaturated and saturated subsurface flows and surface flow. The developed model was applied to two Japanese catchments with weathered granite and sedimentary bedrock. We evaluated the simulation not only by the agreement with observed hydrographs but also in terms of the characteristics of their recessions and dynamic storage changes. Compared to the sedimentary rock catchment, the granite rock catchment showed stronger hysteresis in the recession and also dynamic storage change and discharge relationship estimated from the observed discharge. The original model with only surface soil layer failed to simulate these patterns, while the proposed model with groundwater component improved significantly the representation of the special patterns. Our study indicated the importance of bedrock groundwater for controlling lateral subsurface flow in particular the granite catchment we studied here.",

            "abstract": "Tracking nitrogen (N) deposition patterns is important for understanding how anthropogenic sources of nitrogen affect natural habitats, human health, and for evaluating computer models of future N deposition. It can also aid in tracking and modeling anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions. This pilot study investigated the use of Orthotrichum lyellii, a common urban epiphytic moss, as a possible bioindicator for N deposition through the analysis of total moss N content and N isotopic fractionation ( δ15N) for evaluating N sources. In the spring/summer of 2013 we collected 168 O. lyellii samples from the trunks of deciduous trees in 53 locations in the Portland metropolitan area. In the winter of 2013-14, we resampled the same locations to investigate the effect of seasonality. The averaged summer moss N content were plotted against a land use regression model (LUR) developed by taking NOx samples from 144 sites in the Portland area within the Urban Growth Boundary. The correlation between moss N and modeled NO2 was found to be significant at p < 0.001, r=0.625. Summer moss samples N content ranged between 0.71% and 3.36% (mean of 1.87%), the δ15N ranged -8.97‰ and 11.78‰ (mean of -0.91‰). Moss winter N content ranged between .77% and 3.12% (mean of 1.71%), and the δ15N ranged -10.40‰ and 10.27‰ (mean of -3.73‰). The average values for %N and δ15N fall within the range of previous studies in other moss samples, however the maximum values are higher than what other studies have typically found for both %N and δ15N. A significant correlation between δ15N and %N was found (r = 0.67). The moss samples showed a similar pattern of higher N content and δ15N near the urban center decreasing with distance from major roadways and other significant sources of fossil fuel derived NOx. These results indicated the sensitivity of O.lyellii to N and the potential for its use as a biomonitor. With sufficient sampling density, using O. lyellii  as an inexpensive biomonitor to evaluate local bioavailable N deposition could be a useful tool in monitoring atmospheric N inputs at relatively high resolution and low cost.",

            "abstract": "The Great Lakes have been warming rapidly over recent decades, even more than surrounding land regions. This accelerated warming trend is most pronounced during summer, where the lakes are deepest. Analyses of in-situ observations, remote sensing, reanalysis data, and a regional climate model suggest that a combination of antecedent, internal lake processes (e.g. earlier stratification) and synchronous, large-scale meteorological forcing (e.g. increased insolation) is responsible for the amplified lacustrine warming trend during summer. This long-term trend (1979-2010) is characterized by an approximate step-change in lake temperature between 1997 and 1998, particularly for the deep Lake Superior.\nWe present an attribution study involving the International Centre for Theoretical Physics Regional Climate Model Version Four (RegCM4) that aims to identify the key physical processes driving the accelerated lake warming and to assess the relative roles of antecedent lake processes during winter-spring and synchronous, large-scale meteorological forcing in summer. The model performs credibly in simulating the step-change in lake temperature between 1997 and 1998, including the enhancement of warming within the Great Lakes compared with air temperature increases over adjacent land. We find that earlier seasonal stratification explains much of the amplified lake warming, particularly at deep lakes points, whereas antecedent ice coverage exerts only a secondary influence. At shallow lake points, large-scale meteorological forcing during summer, especially reductions in cloudiness, appears to play a dominant role in the warming trend.",

Francis and Vavrus (2012) and others link Arctic amplification, or enhanced Arctic warming, to decreasing extratropical cyclone (ETC) speeds, and increasing northward meridional heat transports. Here, we are using the latest high-resolution reanalysis models (ASR, JRA-55, CFSR, ERA-Interim, MERRA) to evaluate how Arctic amplification may be impacting the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Our approach is to assess synoptic-scale changes in circulation as represented by changes in storm tracks and storm intensities in the North Atlantic region. As part of this work, we are validating the reanalysis models against existing accumulation, ablation, and meteorological station data available across Greenland, and therefore hope to gain insights on model performance and applicability to the problem domain.",

            "abstract": "While the standard picture of a coronal mass ejection (CME) remains largely unchanged from the early 1990s, we continue to develop our understanding of the finer structures comprising the CME anatomy. Our efforts are impeded by an assortment of inconveniences involving the detection and tracking of CMEs: namely that they are two-dimensional manifestations of an extended three-dimensional structure, they are optically-thin, have asymmetric geometries that evolve at different kinematic rates, and when observed by coronagraphs their appearances are subject to the laws of Thomson scattering. Even in the STEREO era we have rarely had an opportunity to explore in 3-D the finer structures comprising CMEs and their greater counterparts. Through careful analysis of a CME observed during such an opportunity, we have constructed a detailed narrative describing the pre-launch configuration of the magnetic configuration that gave rise to the CME, and its launch and evolution through the corona and solar wind. We present our narrative using observational evidence from EUV imagers, coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers. We offer insight into the implications of its 3-D structure for CME observation, including the difficulties presented by geometry, kinematics and Thomson scattering.",

            "abstract": "The climate of Alaska is experiencing dramatic changes that have been enhanced by Arctic amplification. Understanding the mechanisms of change is necessary to better assess potential impacts. Due to sparse station observations in the vast state, dynamical downscaling of coarse resolution reanalysis/global climate model data using a regional climate model may be especially valuable to better understand the local climate. In this study we downscaled the ERA – Interim reanalysis data set 1979-2013 using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to a 20km grid centered on Alaska. The results of the downscaling were compared to the original reanalysis to determine the value added by downscaling temperature and precipitation.\nOwing to the complex topography of Alaska, the more realistic topography of WRF compared with the more smoothed topography of ERA – Interim allows for a better representation of the effect of terrain on the local climate. Preliminary results indicate warmer temperatures over higher elevations in winter relative to the reanalysis with cooler temperatures in summer. Lower elevations also tended to be cooler in winter in the downscaling. The downscaling tended to be wetter when compared to the original reanalysis. When compared locally with station data, the Fairbanks downscaling was warmer than observations while the Juneau downscaling, being in more complex terrain, tended to follow the station observations more closely than the reanalysis. This demonstrates that, with the added detail of topography and mesoscale processes, dynamical downscaling enhances the local information of temperature and precipitation in Alaska.",

The post-collapse fan deposits are distributed in the northern foot of the volcano, and to reveal their depositional process in terms of modern sedimentology, we carried out the geological study includung digging survey, as well as geomorphological analysis, mineralogy, and 14C chronology. Consequently, the geological study revealed that the fan deposits consist of more than 16 units, which are debris flow, hyperconcentrated flow and streamflow deposits. We give hare general name lahar deposits for these deposits. The lahar deposits have a total thickness of 30 m, and overlie the 2.5-ka Kisakata debris avalanche deposit. The lahar deposits form a part of volcanic fan and volcaniclastic apron of Chokai volcano. In proximal areas (steep or moderate sloped areas), the lahar flowed down as debris flows, and in the distal area (horizontal area) the lahars transformed into hyperconcentrated flow or stream flows but partly arrived the area as debris flow. The hyperconcentrated flows or stream flows reached the horizontal area at least four times, supposed by AMS dating (the ages of some lahar deposits are 2200, 1500-1600, 1000-1200, and 100-200 yBP). The lahar deposits contain clasts of altered andesite, fresh andesite, mudstone and sandstone. Proportions of altered andesite clasts to total clasts decrease upwards in stratigraphic sequence. Matrices of the lower eight units are composed of grayish-blue clay, and are different from those of the upper eight units, composed of brownish yellow volcanic sand. The stratigraphic variation in matrix component is consistent with the change in matrix mineral assemblage, possibly reflecting changes in the source materials from Chokai volcano.",

The predecessor to the IQ, the SonTek Argonaut SW, is a well-established tool for measuring discharge in open channels utilizing a velocity index equation. The IQ builds upon this with velocity indexing capabilities and the addition of two skew beams and the implementation of SmartPulseHD.\nThe SonTek IQ Plus measures velocity with 4-acoustic transducers and the water level using a fifth vertically oriented transducer integrated with a pressure sensor. This improves upon previous and other bottom-mounted, up-looking, acoustic Doppler current meters by measuring the velocity at more points across the channel using its 4-monostatic acoustic transducers. Additionally, the vertically oriented transducer measures the water level and works in conjunction with the pressure sensor to provide a highly accurate water level/stage measurement. The implementation of SmartPulseHD enables the IQ to change ping type and processing technique based on water depth and velocity, in order to provide the most accurate velocity data possible.\nThe IQ was designed specifically for measuring open channel flow in irrigation canals and similar open channels, either by utilizing SonTek’s theoretical flow algorithm or using a velocity index equation. The study presented here demonstrates data collected by an IQ installed in an irrigation canal and the discharge computed using a developed index velocity equation.

            "abstract": "Magmatic evolution in the northern Kita-Hakkoda, northern Honshu, Japan, was investigated from temporal variations of whole-rock chemistry and petrographic characteristics. The temporal variations are based on stratigrahic relation observed by geological survey and geomorphology. The volcanic activity of northern Kita-Hakkoda occurred about 0.4-0.2Ma. Rocks from northern Kita-Hakkoda are classified into two series on the AFM and the Miyashiro diagrams: calc-alkaline and tholeiite series. Calc-alkaline series rocks draw liner trends on Harker’s diagrams of compatible elements (Ni, Cr, MgO), whereas the trends of tholeiitic series are convex downward. Some calc-alkaline rocks have disequilibrium mineral assemblages, e.g., coexistence of magnesian olivine and embayed quartz. The calc-alkaline rocks exhibit mineralogical features that indicate open system processes, e.g., coexistence of reversely zoned pyroxenes and normally zoned pyroxenes, dusty zoning in plagioclase. In contrast, no evidence for open system process is recorded in phenocrysts in the tholeiitic rocks. Previous studies (Sasaki et al.,1985; Ohba et al.,2009) accounted for the chemical variation of tholeiitic magma by crystallization differentiation. The calc-alkaline trend intersects the tholeiitic trend on Miyashiro diagram; therefore, the mafic endmember is tholeiitic basalt magma with a composition of the intersection. In this study, we conclude that the calc-alkaline series rocks were formed by magma mixing. Compared with the stratigraphic order, the calc-alkaline rocks changed in composition from SiO2 60wt% to SiO2 50wt% with a stratigraphic order, but the compositional variation accompanied a small fluctuation. Because the magma compositions of calc-alkaline magma were influenced by magma mixing, the chronological chemical variation was caused by temporal variation in mixing ratios of endmember magmas.",

            "abstract": "Tree Ring Chronology (TRC) is traditionally used for streamflow reconstructions. These reconstructions are helpful in understanding the dynamics of past flow conditions, including droughts and floods, by extending the length of available streamflow data. This study aims to improve the traditional reconstruction methodology that only uses TRC, by incorporating the climate index of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Pacific Ocean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) information as predictor variables, along with TRC, in a stepwise linear regression model. The approach is tested on Sacramento River, in Southwest U.S., having a history of recurring hydrologic drought, coupled with the challenges of increasing water demands and changing climate. The proposed methodology is applied to four naturalized gages with the observed period of 94 years (1906-1998) to reconstruct streamflow dating back to year 1800, based on past climate information. Although selected TRC extend up to year 1378, the available climate information limits the reconstruction to year 1800. Results show that using the climate information of PDO and SST along with the TRC model, performance was better compared to the traditional reconstruction method using TRC only. These streamflow reconstructions can provide useful insights, to the regional water managers, about the duration and frequency of past hydrologic droughts, and help make informed decisions regarding water resources planning. For future studies, the improved reconstruction methodology, presented here, will be applied to other river basins in the region.",

            "abstract": "The US EPA’s National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) uses spatially balanced sampling to estimate the proportion of streams within the continental US (CONUS) that fail to support healthy biological communities. However, to manage these systems, we also must understand how human land use alters stream communities from their natural condition and how natural factors, such as climate, interact with these effects. We used random forest modeling and data from 1353 streams that NRSA determined to be in “good” or “poor” biological condition (BC) to predict the probable BC of nearly 5.4 million km of stream (National Hydrography Dataset) within the CONUS. BC was best predicted by 5 natural factors (mean discharge, mean annual air temperature [AT], soil water content, topography, major ecoregion) and 2 riparian factors that are easily altered by humans (% riparian urbanization [%Urb], % riparian forest [%Fst] cover). The model correctly predicted BC for 74% of sites, but predicted poor BC slightly more accurately (76%) than good BC (71%). Initial results showed that probability of good BC declined rapidly with increasing %Urb, but this effect leveled off in streams with >7 %Urb. Likewise, probability of good BC increased in streams with >45 %Fst. This model can be used to generate hypotheses to guide future research and test restoration scenarios. For example, BC had a U-shaped relationship with AT, with poorest BCs predicted between 10-15°C. Plots suggested a strong AT-%Fst interaction, where higher %Fst values mitigated this U-shaped response of BC to AT. These ATs correspond to latitudes that receive the greatest combination of solar radiation intensity and duration in July, and we hypothesize that thermal alteration due to riparian disturbance may be negatively affecting BC in these streams. Finally, simulations suggested that restoring riparian forests could increase the number of streams achieving good BC by 60%, and may represent a critical management tool.",

            "abstract": "Accurate terrestrial paleotemperature records are key pieces of information in the paleoenvironmental reconstruction of Earth history. These records aid in building reliable climate models and help scientists understand the links between continental and oceanic climate data. Many different types of analyses are used to estimate terrestrial climate shifts, including leaf margin analysis, palynology, glacial deposits, elemental ratios, organic geochemistry, and stable isotopes of lacustrine deposits. Here we report a carbonate clumped isotope calibration for microbial carbonates. Application of the clumped isotope paleothermometer can potentially provide a direct temperature measurement of the water at the time of carbonate formation. Although different calibrations of the paleothermometer have been published for both inorganic and biotic carbonate minerals, the effects of clumping in microbialites (structures built under the influence of microbial activity) have not yet been quantified. Lacustrine microbialites present a potentially large, untapped archive of terrestrial climate data, however they are not strictly biotic or abiotic, but bio-induced carbonate, meaning that organisms (such as photosynthetic bacteria) influence but do not directly control precipitation. We have measured modern microbialites from multiple lacustrine sites and will report a comparison of these results to known water temperatures. Additionally we will compare lacustrine samples to marine microbialites (e.g., samples from Shark Bay) to assess potential differences between lacustrine and marine intertidal environments on clumped isotope compositions.",

            "abstract": "Three WRF simulations for the DISCOVER-AQ 2013 Texas campaign period (30 days in September) are performed to characterize uncertainties in the simulated meteorological and chemical conditions. These simulations differ in domain setup, and in performing observation nudging in WRF runs. There are around 7% index of agreement (IOA) gain in temperature and 9-12% boost in U-WIND and V-WIND when the observational nudging is employed in the simulation. Further performance gain from nested domains over single domain is marginal. The CMAQ simulations based on above WRF setups showed that the ozone performance slightly improved in the simulation for which objective analysis (OA) is carried out. Further IOA gain, though quite limited, is achieved with nested domains. This study shows that the high ozone episodes during the analyzed time periods were associated with the uncertainties of the simulated cold front passage, chemical boundary condition and small-scale temporal wind fields. All runs missed the observed high ozone values which reached above 150 ppb in La Porte on September 25, the only day with hourly ozone over 120 ppb. The failure is likely due to model’s inability to catch small-scale wind shifts in the industrial zone, despite better wind directions in the simulations with nudging and nested domains. This study also shows that overestimated background ozone from the southerly chemical boundary is a critical source for the model’s general overpredictions of the ozone concentrations from CMAQ during September of 2013. These results of this study shed a light on the necessity of (1) capturing the small-scale winds such as the onsets of bay-breeze or sea-breeze and (2) implementing more accurate chemical boundary conditions to reduce the simulated high-biased ozone concentrations. One promising remedy for (1) is implementing hourly observation nudging instead of the standard one which is done every three hours.",

            "abstract": "Submarine gullies are common features on continental slopes on both passive and active margins, but the processes dictating gully formation and the role of gullies in deep-water sediment transport are topics of debate. The geometries of gullies can provide clues to understanding the processes by which they initiate and grow, particularly when considered in the context of surrounding submarine geomorphology. Further confidence in these interpretations can be gained by tracking the temporal history of gullies with evolution of the continental margin. The 500 km2 Tui 3D seismic survey from the Taranaki Basin, New Zealand, shows continental slope gullies and other channel features in a ~1 km-thick package of prograding shelf-slope clinoforms that developed over Pliocene-Pleistocene time. This dataset allows for documentation of gullies over ~3 Ma, through numerous cycles of initiation and burial. For this study, we manually interpreted clinoform packages to generate ‘paleo-seafloor’ surfaces that provide context such as position of the shelf edge, slope gradient and azimuth, and relative progradation and aggradation magnitudes. Gully geometries were obtained from detailed seismic interpretation guided by semblance and RMS amplitude imaging on these surfaces. Gullies are low sinuosity, with widths ranging from ~50-150 m and depths from a few tens to <100 m. Gullies are observed to grow in width and relief downslope without evidence for aggradational confinement (levees), and in some cases form gully ‘complexes’ hundreds of m wide in the lower slope region. These complexes are present through >150 m of stratigraphy, indicating that they are long-lived features on the slope. This further indicates that the frequency of flows along the gullies was enough to maintain their topographic expression during slope progradation and aggradation, and suggests that gullies play an integral role in transport processes on the slope.",

However, one can invert available observations of ice thickness and velocity to infer the spatial distribution of glacial bed stress that is most consistent with existing measurements. We have performed inversions for Greenland’s three largest outlet glaciers: Jakobshavn, Helheim and Kangerdlugssuaq. Many previous studies have employed depth-averaged glacier models; we have instead used a full Stokes model, as implemented in the software package Elmer/ICE. For all three glaciers, we found that their beds provided almost no frictional resistance to the driving stress. This finding is in keeping with observations that ice thinning extends very far upstream of the terminus. Finally, we address how much predictive validity these inversions possess given the presently available observational data.",

            "abstract": "The van Genuchten equation is used often to provide an empirical description of soil water retention data. The equation is commonly used for modeling hydrologic processes for environmental and agricultural applications, including irrigation. Most applications involved soils of temperate or arid climatic regions. Soil of tropical zones often have distinct textural compositions with a predominance of clay and sand, which may lead to multimodal pore size distributions that are not conducive to applications of the standard van Genuchten equation. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the van Genuchten equation using a large database on soil water retention of tropical soils in Brazil, where almost 6 million hectares are irrigated and responsible for about 70% of water consumption in Brazil. We selected 1058 undisturbed soil samples with water retention data covering a wide matric potentials. The results show that the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the water retention estimates was larger than 4% for only 10 samples. For the remaining datasets, the RMSE distribution behaved as follows: 27 samples had an RMSE from 3 to 4%, 70 samples had an RMSE from 2 to 3%, 332 samples had an RMSE from 1 to 2%, and 619 samples had an RMSE from 0 to 1%. Because of the bimodal pore size distribution of many soils, a dual porosity retention model is probably more appropriate for samples having the higher RMSE values. Overall, the van Genuchten equation was found to be appropriate for Brazilian soil conditions. Work is underway to see if soil or landscape properties can be used to predict the presence of the bimodal pore-size distributions.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that the environment of the Arctic Ocean is currently changing rapidly as a result of anthropogenic inputs of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The loss of sea ice is one of the most dramatic and impactful aspects of change. Warming is amplified due to the open water albedo feedback effect. Ice is more reflective than ocean, creating a positive feedback with negative consequences. Here I compare our knowledge of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean using data from two satellites (SSM/I “NASA-team” and “Bootstrap” algorithms and MODIS MOD29 sea ice extent) to a coupled numerical model of ocean circulation and sea ice (Regional Ocean Modeling System, ROMS). I run the model from 1987 through 2012. Most years, the summer ice extent near Greenland and Norway is fairly well simulated, but in the Alaskan and Canadian Region, satellite data show ice retreating dramatically from the coast, well into the Arctic basin. This retreat is not captured in the model. During the sea ice minima in September, ice extent from satellite data is approximately 72% of modeled ice extent (for a ten-year average from 2003 – 2012). I focus on extent, concentrations, and thicknesses, three of the main ice characteristics described in ROMS. The results of this model vs. satellite data comparison show that the model simulates the presence of much more ice, both a larger extent and higher concentrations. This overestimation of ice is common among many of the models presented in the literature. Changes in ice thicknesses are a major concern as multi-year ice is being lost at an accelerating pace. Ice thickness is a good proxy for ice age, and young ice is much more susceptible to melting than older ice. Many polar ocean models specify ice concentrations and thicknesses instead of modeling them. This is problematic at present due to limited data available for ice thickness. For this reason, it is key to develop models like ROMS in order to improve understanding of the Arctic ocean - ice system.",

            "abstract": "The Boulder flood of September 2013 resulted in significant structural damage, inundated communities, and accelerated land erosion in central and northern Colorado. This exceptional event led to approximately 11,000 people being evacuated in the area as more than 17 inches of rain fell in parts of Boulder County, Colorado in seven days. This storm resulted from persistent southerly flow and high precipitable water values which were responsible for the record-breaking precipitation. This study assessed the factors associated with extreme precipitation events in both observations and climate model simulations. Satellite-based observed precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, and ERA-Interim Reanalysis of precipitable water and low-level winds were used in this study.\nProbability distribution functions (PDFs) were calculated for daily values of observational and reanalysis variables: precipitation, precipitable water, and low-level winds. Each of the PDFs were compared with equivalent variables in the CESM simulations and analyzed over three regions of different areal extent occupying the eastern Rocky Mountains. The PDF calculations were found to be sensitive to the choice of the spatial region with fewer high precipitable water events in the northern domain and a greater number of high precipitable water events in the more southerly domain. The similarities between observational and present-day CESM PDFs enabled us to study changes to PDF distributions in future climate simulations. They predict a significant increase in precipitable water over the Boulder flood region. Given the importance of high precipitable water in the 2013 Boulder flood precipitation event, the potential for more frequent and stronger flooding events in the future is significant.",

            "abstract": "Fuel-reduction treatments are commonly employed throughout the western United States to improve forest health and/or decrease the risk of wildland fires. Periods of prolonged drought and high temperatures increase both the risk of wildland fires and the stress on water resources. Forest managers may mitigate the risk of wildland fires by increasing fuel-reduction treatments but the subsequent effect on forest hydrology and water resources is not well understood. Of particularly interest to water resources is the effect on snow pack accumulation and melt timing, which is impacted by forest cover. As part of a Comprehensive Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP), four sites were selected in the Hat Creek Basin of Lassen National Forest to study the hydrologic effects of two common fuel-reduction strategies, forest thinning and group selection. During the 2013/2014 winter, California experienced a significant drought, including a near-absence of continuous snow cover. Therefore, the effect on snow accumulation and melt timing during the 13/14 winter was not directly measured. However, significant deviations in solar radiation, wind speed, and solar moisture were observed in the data, suggesting fuel reduction treatments will have a tangible effect of snow pack and forest hydrology. Further work to examine the relationship between forest cover, fuel-treatments, and basin hydrology includes the analysis of historic stream flow data and the development of a hydro-ecological model for the basin.",

            "abstract": "This is a golden age for near-Earth Object (NEO) research. We have discovered some 90% of the most threatening NEOs, while ongoing surveys are finding many sub-km NEOs as well. NEO physical characterization studies by missions, space- and ground-based observatories are also revolutionizing our ideas about what NEOs are like. President Obama announced on April 15, 2010 that NASA would send astronauts to an NEA by 2025; this remains Administration policy. The Feb. 15, 2013 explosion of an NEO over Chelyabinsk, Russia, has further boosted interest in NEOs.\nThis increasing interest, and a vast array of new data, have led us to re-investigate the debiased orbital and absolute magnitude distribution of the NEO population. Such models are asboluetly needed to make accurate predictions about NEOs that are likely exploration targets for human and robotic spacecraft.\nUsing the methods of Bottke et al. (2002), we numerically tracked a large unbiased sample of asteroids escaping the main belt and TNO populations in order to locate all possible NEO source regions. From here, we recorded the orbital evolution of the bodies that entering the NEO region; their evolutionary pathways were used to create so-called NEO residence-time distributions. They were combined with the calculated observational selection effects for the Catalina Sky Survey, with the model fit to 4,550 NEOs (15 < H < 25) detected by the Catalina Sky Survey’s Mt. Lemmon (G96) and Catalina (703) stations between 2005–2012. Our best fit case beautifully reproduces observations and provides us with a new and improved NEO model population.\nWe find our results are in good agreement with the Bottke et al. (2002) model, but we also find many intriguing differences as well: (i) There is an increasing preference for small NEOs to come from the central main belt; (ii) Many low-perihelion-distance NEOs are apparently missing -- we suspect many were removed by a physical destruction mechanism; (iii) We are largely complete in H < 18 Atens and Amors, but we are still missing a good fraction of Apollo NEOs. In our talk, we will discuss our latest findings and will describe the nature of the NEO populations accessible by both ARM and human missions.",

Here we explore the outcomes of a student project to crosswalk terms between the Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) program and other international systems, as part of the Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP).\nR2R is a U.S. program developing and implementing an information management system to preserve and provide access to routine underway data collected by U.S. academic research vessels. R2R participates in ODIP, an international forum for improving interoperability and effective sharing of marine data resources through technical workshops and joint prototypes. The vocabulary mapping effort lays a foundation for future ocean data portals through which users search and access ocean data using familiar terms.\nR2R describes its data with a suite of controlled vocabularies (http://www.rvdata.us/voc) some of which were developed within R2R or are specific to the U.S. The goal of this student project is to crosswalk local/national vocabularies to authoritative international ones, where they exist, or to vocabularies widely used by ODIP partners. Specifically, R2R developed the following crosswalks: UNOLS ports to SeaDataNet Ports Gazetteer, R2R Device Models to NVS SeaVoX Device Catalog, R2R Organizations to the European Directory of Marine Organizations (EDMO), and R2R chief scientist names to well known professional identifiers such as ORCID, Research Gate, Linkedin, etc. Mappings were done in simple spreadsheets using synonymy relationships, and will be published as part of the R2R Linked Data resources.\nThe level of success in crosswalking was variable. All ports are successfully mapped. Both organizations and device models have initial mappings and R2R has added new terms to EDMO and SeaVoX Device Catalog vocabularies allowing for nearly complete coverage of terms. An initial search for R2R scientists identifiers on ORCID returned few potential matches, and most potential matches lacked sufficient metadata to confirm the match. R2R is now adopting an alternate approach of requesting chief scientists to self-report on the professional identifiers used to expose their work.",

This study, conducted along the Papua New Guinea Peninsula outer shelf (Gulf of Papua), focuses on the analyses of a Calypso core, MD05-2945 (MD-45), and the interpretation of seismic lines obtained during the PECTEN (2005) and PANASH (2004) cruises aboard the R/V’s Marion Dufresne and Melville, respectively. Sediments and coralgal detritus were identified, analyzed, and dated with AMS radiocarbon and U/Th.\nThe seismic lines illustrate the establishment of reefal edifices directly on top of a lowstand shelf edge delta, shrinking through time towards the southeast by partial drowning and back-stepping. MD-45 sampled the reef that thrived during the 19 ky meltwater pulse. At its base, a 19.3 kyr BP-old coral colony (Faviid Goniastrea), part of a shallow/inter-tidal framework, was retrieved in living position at 111 mbsl. Then, a clear deepening/drowning pattern is observed; shallow Faviid Goniastrea framework coral is covered by debris from shallow/upper fore-reef corals (Faviids, Galaxeas, Acroporas), and lastly by encrusting/foliacious corals (Agariciids, Pectiniids, Montiporiids, Poritiids) and encrusting algae/digitate Microbialites. When the reef back-stepped 5 km to the SE where it continued to accreted to sea level, Sr/K (excellent proxy for reef derived detritus) drops dramatically and siliciclastics increase at 6 mbsf in MD-45. This coincides also with the end of the coralgal clasts within a well dated gasteropod-rich (Turritella cingulifera) interval (15-14.5 cal kyr BP), contemporaneously with the globally established MWP-1A. At 11.5 kyr, roughly synchronous with MWP-1B, a 3.5 m-thick 98% siliciclastic mud unit, interpreted as the onset of the Indo-Australian Monsoons, was abruptly deposited in MD-45, coinciding with an even more severe back-stepping of the reef towards the southeast.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal base metal mineralization is rare in Iceland due to the scarcity of evolved magma bodies that discharge metal-rich aqueous fluids into bedrock. One exception is the Lon District of southeastern Iceland, where explosively emplaced rhyolitic breccias host base metal sulfide minerals. We performed petrographic, fluid inclusion, and stable isotope analyses on samples collected in Lon to constrain the conditions of sulfide mineral formation. Based on outcrop and hand sample observations, hot, early-stage hydrothermal fluids precipitated sulfide minerals, quartz, and epidote in rhyolitic breccia and basalt flows. Cooler late-stage fluids precipitated carbonates and quartz in rhyolitic breccia and basalt flows. The order of precipitation of the sulfides was: galena, sphalerite, then chalcopyrite. Homogenization temperatures of liquid-dominated multi-phase fluid inclusions in hydrothermal early-stage quartz coeval with chalcopyrite cluster around 303 °C and 330 °C, indicating precipitation of metallic sulfides in two main hydrothermal fluid pulses early in the period of hydrothermal activity in the Lon District. Freezing point depression analyses of fluid inclusions in quartz show that the sulfide minerals precipitated from a solution that was 4 wt. % NaCl. The 𝛿34S values of sulfides indicate that early-stage hydrothermal sulfur was derived from igneous rocks, either through leaching by non-magmatic hydrothermal fluids or by exsolution of magmatic waters. Early stage epidote 𝛿D values were on average -65.96 per mil, about 14 per mil higher than reported values in epidotes from elsewhere in southeastern Iceland. The 𝛿13C and 𝛿18O values of late-stage carbonates indicate that late stage hydrothermal fluids were meteoric in origin. Collectively, fluid inclusion and stable isotope analyses suggest that early-stage aqueous fluids derived from a mixture of magmatic waters exsolved from the proximal Geitafell intrusion and meteoric waters and that late-stage fluids were meteoric. This work provides insight into conditions of hydrothermal systems in early continents, which featured bimodal volcanism like that of Lon.",

            "abstract": "Nitrification is the process of converting ammonium (NH­­4+) into nitrate (NO3-), and is a crucial step in removing nitrogen (N) from aquatic ecosystems. This process is governed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) that utilize the ammonia monooxygenase gene (amoA). Studying the rates of nitrification and the abundances of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in south San Francisco Bay’s Artesian Slough, which receives treated effluent from the massive San Jose-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility, are important for understanding the cycling of nutrients in this small but complex estuary. Wastewater inputs can have negative environmental impacts, such as the release of nitrous oxide, a byproduct of nitrification and a powerful greenhouse gas. Nutrient inputs can also increase productivity and sometimes lead to oxygen depletion. Assessing the relative abundance and diversity of AOA and AOB, along with measuring nitrification rates gives vital information about the biology and biogeochemistry of this important N-cycling process. To calculate nitrification rates, water samples were spiked with 15N-labeled ammonium and incubated in triplicate for 24 hours. Four time-points were extracted across the incubation and the “denitrifier” method was used to measure the isotopic ratio of nitrate in the samples over time. In order to determine relative ratios of AOB to AOA, DNA was extracted from water samples and used in clade-specific amoA PCR assays. Nitrification rates were detectable in all locations sampled and were higher than in other regions of the bay, as were concentrations of nitrate and ammonium. Rates were highest in the regions of Artesian Slough most directly affected by wastewater effluent. AOB vastly outnumbered AOA, which is consistent with other studies showing that AOB prefer high nutrient environments. AOB diversity includes clades of Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas prevalent in estuarine settings. Many of the sequenced genes are related to estuarine sediment found at other sites in the San Francisco Bay as well as the Chesapeake Bay, China East Sea, and Pearl River Estuary. Our data provide evidence for the path that N takes once entering the estuary and also further characterize the behavior of nitrifying microorganisms in extremely high-nutrient aquatic environments.",

            "abstract": "We report field data and preliminary numerical modeling results documenting the transit of a sediment wave along the Lillooet River following a large debris flow in 2010. The Lillooet drains a midsize (~4000 km2) glacially-influenced alpine catchment. Our study reach lies 70 km between the Mt. Meager Volcanic Complex (MMVC) and Lillooet Lake, which traps over 90% of incoming sediment. The channel transitions from braided and cobble-bedded to straight and sand-bedded, and the downstream half is dyked. Sediment supply is dominated by frequent debris flows originating in the MMVC.\nIn 2010, a landslide on the MMVC released 48.5 x 106 m3 of material and triggered a debris flow that extended 2.5 km down the Lillooet Valley, briefly damming the river and causing an outburst flood. 1500 valley residents were evacuated temporarily, and the event led to ~$10 M CAD of damage to commercial forests and roads. The subsequent sediment wave is expected to lead to channel aggradation, putting pressure on the Lillooet’s dyking system.\nWe conducted bulk sampling and Wolman pebble counts along the river in 2014. Grainsize distributions from channel bars along the reach are compared to those of cutbanks to track the extent of the wave and the mobility of individual grainsize classes. We use the Morphodynamics and Sediment Tracers in 1-Dimension (MAST-1D) model to simulate the Lillooet’s response to the debris flow on decadal timescales and to predict its recovery time. Sediment from the debris flow is traced in the model to estimate the proportion of the sediment wave that will remain in permanent storage within the valley fill. Future work will focus on quantifying the role of floodplain-channel interactions on sediment wave evolution for decadal and longer timescales.",

            "abstract": "Based on cross-correlations computed from 61 ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) within the Juan de Fuca plate from the Cascadia Initiative experiment and 42 continental stations near the western US coast, we investigate the generation locations of the primary (11-20 sec period) and secondary (5-10 sec period) microseisms in the northern Pacific Ocean by analyzing the directionality of the microseism signals received in this region. (1) Ambient noise observed across the array is much different in the primary and secondary microseism bands, both in its azimuthal content and seasonal variation, indicating different source generation locations. (2) The principal secondary microseism signals propagate toward the east, consistent with source generation in deep water of the North Pacific, perhaps coincident with the region of body wave excitation observed by Gerstoft et al. [2008] and Landès et al. [2010]. (3) Local primary microseism sources within and near the Juan de Fuca plate are implied by observations of the azimuthal dependence of the fundamental mode Rayleigh wave amplitudes as well as observations of precursory arrivals in cross-correlations of ambient noise. The strongest local generation region is observed northwest of the Juan de Fuca plate near the coast of British Columbia perhaps near Graham Island. Weaker local sources appear to be oceanward of Vancouver Island and southern Oregon. (4) High quality Green’s functions are derived from cross-correlations between deep water OBSs and continental stations proving that deep water generated signals can efficiently propagate onto the continent and are well recorded by continental seismic stations, at least at periods longer than about 5 sec.\nIn conclusion, the primary and secondary microseisms are generated at different locations, with the secondary microseism dominantly coming from deep-water sources and the source of primary microseism having a significant component in the shallow waters of the eastern Pacific. These observations are consistent with different physical mechanisms for the generation of the two microseisms. Both microseisms above 5 sec period propagate efficiently from either deep or shallow water source regions to continental stations.",

            "abstract": "The Fire Radiative Power (FRP) [MW] is a measure of the rate of biomass combustion and can be retrieved from ground based and satellite observations using middle infra-red measurements. The temporal integral of FRP is the Fire Radiative Energy (FRE) [MJ] and is related linearly to the total biomass consumption and so pyrogenic emissions. Satellite derived biomass consumption and emissions estimates have been derived conventionally by computing the summed total FRP, or the average FRP (arithmetic average of FRP retrievals), over spatial geographic grids for fixed time periods. These two methods are prone to estimation bias, especially under irregular sampling conditions such as provided by polar-orbiting satellites, because the FRP can vary rapidly in space and time as a function of the fire behavior. Linear temporal integration of FRP taking into account when the FRP values were observed and using the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration has been suggested as an alternate FRE estimation method. In this study FRP data measured rapidly with a dual-band radiometer over eight prescribed fires are used to compute eight FRE values using the sum, mean and trapezoidal estimation approaches under a variety of simulated irregular sampling conditions. The estimated values are compared to biomass consumed measurements for each of the eight fires to provide insights into which method provides more accurate and precise biomass consumption estimates. The three methods are also applied to continental MODIS FRP data to study their differences using polar orbiting satellite data. The research findings indicate that trapezoidal FRP numerical integration provides the most reliable estimator.",

To update the KF scheme for multiple scales in the WRF model, first, we proposed a scaling parameter to introduce scale-dependence in the KF scheme for use with various convection parameters, and then we developed new formulations for: (1) the convective adjustment timescale; (2) the entrainment of environmental air; (3) the fallout of condensates from updrafts; and (4) the stabilizing capacity. These scale-dependent formulations make the KF scheme operable at all scales down to about sub-kilometer grid resolution. Additionally, we have introduced methodologies for (5) impacting grid-scale vertical velocity with convective updrafts and downdrafts, (6) eliminating double counting of precipitation due to concurrent usage of grid-scale and subgrid-scale cloud formulations for any grid cell, and (7) including aerosol indirect effects by embedding a double moment convective cloud microphysics within the KF scheme. Results obtained from using the regional WRF and global MPAS models will be presented to demonstrate the effects of these science updates to the KF scheme. ",

These GHG measurements are conducted to quantify trends of climatically important gases and to validate satellite-based GHG column estimates from Greenhouse Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2).\nThe vertical profiles of GHGs observed over RRV show relatively uniform features below and above the boundary layer, and mixing ratios are increasing every year. Strong enhancements in the free troposphere are seen in these profiles in some instances. To assess possible sources of these enhancements and their effects on the GHG column average, GHG vertical profiles calculated by the 3-D GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (v9-01-03) and back-trajectory analysis from the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) are compared with airborne measurements. The main results that we will show are 1) the comparison of vertical GHG distribution calculated from GEOS-Chem and that measured by AJAX, 2) total column GHG values from the model, AJAX, and GOSAT, and 3) demonstrate the source apportionment in GHGs profiles measured at RRV.\nThe RRV playa is a flat high altitude desert site where local sources and sinks of carbon-species are expected to be minimal except for a small oil field. RRV is a radiometrically flat region and has been used to calibrate various satellite radiometers before. These measurements are conducted as part of the Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) which regularly measures GHGs, ozone, and 3-D winds over California and Nevada. The Alpha Jet is operated from NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field and airborne instruments are installed in an unpressurized wing pod.",

            "abstract": "From March to June 2014, the Schmidt Ocean Institute, along with National Marine Sanctuaries and the National Science Foundation, supported 72 days of mapping surveys on two cruises using R/V Falkor in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (PMNM) located within the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). PMNM is one of the largest marine protected areas in the world. Approximately 127,000 km2, 35% of the PMNM, were surveyed using dual multibeam systems from less than 30 to >5000 meters water depth, and thus covering the habitat depth ranges for shallow living corals, mesophotic corals, drowned reefs, to deep-sea corals and sponge communities. A total of 18 seamounts, guyots, banks, or atoll flanks (e.g., Midway and Kure) were mapped in the upper northwestern section of the monument, including the generically named Bank 9 Seamount, which appears to be a composite of a younger Hawaiian seamount and an older Cretaceous guyot. The middle segment of the PMNM consists mostly of large volcanic rift zone ridges and broad carbonate platforms. The rift zones located there are comparable in shape and size with those off Maui and the Island of Hawai‘i in the main islands. Likewise, the magnitude of the largest carbonate platform of Gardner Pinnacles suggests its original high island may have met or exceeded the enormity of the Island of Hawai‘i. Furthermore, the new mapping data have revealed the detail of numerous landslides and their deposits all along the chain, including an unusual rift zone flank failure creating a knife-edge ridge off Pioneer Bank. Dives with the Pisces V submersible were previously carried out on this feature, where extensive filter feeding biological communities were discovered. Not to be overlooked, the sidescan backscatter component of the multibeam data proved essential for identifying subtle reef features, numerous carbonate terraces, and debris channels that appear to transport sediment down the edifice flanks to the deep seafloor. Additionally, it was essential in delineating volcanic landforms such as lava flows, fissures, and eruptive cones. In short, the high quality and resolution of Falkor’s bathymetric and backscatter data have exposed second and possibly third order deep-water geomorphologic and structural elements on a regional scale.",

The Southern Cook Strait earthquake sequence, beginning on 19 July 2013, included the 21 July M=6.5 and 16 August M=6.6 2013 earthquakes, which were the largest shallow earthquakes to strike the Wellington region since 1942. Following the two largest earthquakes we began the Seddon Earthquake Aftershock Structural Investigation (SEASI) and deployed a line of 21 seismometers stretching approximately 400 km along the strike of the Hikurangi subduction zone in order to use aftershocks to illuminate the structure of the subducted Pacific slab. The SEASI line ties into the SAHKE line, which was an array of up to 900 seismometers that recorded air gun and explosion shots in deployments from 2009-2011. The SAHKE project characterized the structures perpendicular to the strike of the subduction zone. Our results use the SAHKE line as a starting point and look for strike-parallel variations in the depth of the Moho and other structures. Previous studies have suggested potential changes along strike in this region, and deep slow slip events (> 35 km) are also observed north of Wellington, further indicating that variation in properties exists along slab strike.\nWe have used 246 M > 3 earthquakes that occurred from September 2013 through January 2014 to create common receiver gathers. Multicomponent prestack depth migration of these receiver gathers, with operator antialiasing control and prestack coherency filtering, produces reflectivity sections using a 1-D velocity model derived from the SAHKE project. Relocation of aftershocks of the Seddon earthquakes using the deployment of a temporary array by New Zealand GeoNet facilitates the migration. An initial P-P migration shows a north-dipping reflector at 15-25 km depth under the earthquake sequence, and suggests the Moho at 20-25 km depth. From Wellington, a reflector dips very gently south from 25-35 km depth, which is probably the slab interface. These results are helping to build 3-D information about the plate interface. We hope that this will help us to understand future hazards posed by subduction thrust earthquakes in this region, and the feeding system for deep slow-slip earthquakes.",

With the development of acoustic doppler technology the decision was made to incorporate latest technology in the Argonaut SL and hence the SonTek SL3G was born.\nThe SonTek SL3G Acoustic Doppler instrument incorporates a number of innovations that improves velocity measurements and quality assurance of data for Side-Looking Doppler Current Meters. SmartPulseHD was originally introduced with the launch of the SonTek M9/S5 RiverSurveyor Acoustic Doppler Instruments and the increased accuracy and resolution of velocity measurements made it obvious to include into the new SL3G instruments. SmartPulseHD continuously tracks the water conditions and selects the optimum processing configuration required using multiple ping types and processing techniques. The new SL3G design makes it the smallest Side Looking Acoustic Doppler Velocity Meter on the market reducing flow disturbance caused by the instrument and the distance of first measurement cell from boundary.\nThe application of the SL3G Acoustic Doppler instrument is designed for complex flow conditions where the use of conventional stage-discharge relationships is economically not viable and therefore requires the use of velocity index methodology. The case-study presented in this paper is situated in the Colorado River downstream of Imperial Dam affected by controlled releases, drainage from adjacent irrigation areas and backwater from a weir situated downstream of the monitoring site.  The paper analyses the relationship between measured mean velocity and index velocity and if additional variables such as stage and or Y-velocity need to be incorporated in the development of the index velocity rating.  In addition, to determine the variables impacting on the index velocity rating, the index velocity applied will be evaluated by the best linear relationship between the multi-cell and integrated cell index velocities and measured mean velocities.\nThe data presented in this paper shows that the physical design and features of the new SonTek SL3G instrument enables the user to accurately measure real time discharge information in complex flow conditions based on index velocity rating principles.",

The network has distinct engineering and operational abilities that aid in studying near-ground hydrological processes at smaller scales. During April-June 2013, Iowa XPOLs were deployed for Iowa Flood Studies (IFloodS), the first integrated studies field experiment under the aegis of NASA’s Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Ground Validation.\nThe XPOLs demonstrated their field worthiness with nearly 46 days of near-uninterrupted remote operations in the campaign, and collected research-quality data as indicated by the detailed post-campaign analyses. In this study, we present XPOL observations of selected diverse meteorological events at high spatial and temporal resolutions from a unique and vast dataset generated during IFloodS operations. The XPOL data exhibit detailed, complex structure of precipitation viewed at multiple range resolutions (75 m and 30 m). An inter-XPOL comparison within an overlapping scanned volume demonstrates consistency across different XPOL units.\nWe derive rain accumulation maps for the XPOL-4 radar data on June 12, 2013 using reflectivity (Ze) and specific differential phase (Kdp) algorithms derived from scattering simulations using measured drop size distributions (DSDs) from six two-dimensional video disdrometer units from four rain days (data set of 6,200 one-minute averaged DSDs). We constructed Ze-based rain maps using measured and attenuation-corrected reflectivity. Without attenuation correction the rainfall is vastly under-estimated, whereas the corrected Ze-based accumulations are more consistent with estimates based on R(Kdp). Still, there are spatial differences between the latter two accumulation maps made apparent due to the high resolution of XPOL-4 used for Ze algorithm.\nFor comparison, we derived rain accumulation maps for the same event using the NASA polarimetric NPOL radar except that its spatial (azimuthal) resolution is significantly lower due to long range to the storm complex (>80 km). By comparing the high-resolution rain maps from XPOL-4 radar with 150 m resolution maps from NPOL radar, we are able to examine the scaling properties and observational uncertainties of rainfall.",

In comparison to a manual slug test wherein the water level is measured using a water level tape, pneumatic slug tests are especially useful when the water level recovery is very fast (<10 sec) in a high hydraulic conductivity (K) aquifer (>10-4 m/s) and when the recovery is very slow (<10-7 m/s). The submerged pressure transducer monitors pressure changes at intervals of fractions of a second and for longer recoveries no personnel are required to make repeated measurements. A pneumatic slug test begins with pressurizing the well at the well head using an air pump followed by several minutes waiting for the pressure in the well to equalize with the pressure outside the well screen. In semi-confined settings this equalization may take >5 minutes. In lower K media it’s not always feasible to wait until the well fully recovers before making the next replicate measurement. Therefore, it would greatly reduce the time needed to make replicate measurements if these waiting times could be reduced. Here we present a method using non-linear least squares regression on a portion of the recovery curve to simultaneously fit 3 parameters used to determine K from a slug tests using the Hvorslev method. The advantage of this approach is that waiting for the well to reach static head between replicate measurements is not required. This is because the regression fits static head (H) from the shape of only part the recovery curve. We compare the resulting K values from this new method to values obtained from manually measured static heads for triplicate measurements on 50 wells. The well’s settings ranged from unconfined to semi-confined and K ranged from 10-3 to 10-5 m/s. The new method gave identical results. We performed the same comparison on a subset 16 wells using data collected in half the time, where only part of the recovery curves were measured before starting the next replicate. This also resulted in near identical K values. Sensitivity analyses indicated that only about 30% of the recovery curve needs to be measured to accurately determine K. This method saves time in investigations where large numbers of monitoring wells are involved and/or where wells are placed in low K media.",

            "abstract": "The need to accurately model and understand reactions among organic compounds and biomolecules in solution is necessary to develop realistic chemical models for the reactions leading to the emergence of life and metabolic processes of extremophiles under elevated temperature and pressure conditions. Unfortunately, the scarcity of experimentally determined volumetric (and other) properties for important compounds at high temperatures and pressures leads to uncertainty in the calculation of reaction properties. Experimentally determined volumetric properties of aqueous solutions at non-standard conditions provide direct tests of current estimation methods and aid in the refinement of these methods. The goal of our research is to provide a database of experimentally determined volumetric properties. In previous studies, we have examined important organic molecules and biomolecules such as adenosine, coenzyme M and D-ribose. In this study, we investigate the volumetric properties of the structural isomers 1- and 2-propanol. 1-propanol (n-propanol) is a primary alcohol (CH3CH2CH2OH) and 2-propanol (isopropanol) is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol (CH3CHOHCH3). These compounds differ slightly in structure depending on to which carbon atom the hydroxyl group is bonded and will provide a sensitive test of current estimation methods and lead to more accurate predictions of the properties of complex aqueous systems at elevated temperatures and pressures.\nWe obtained the densities of aqueous solutions of the alchohols using an Anton Paar DMA HP vibrating tube densimeter. Pressure was measured (pressure transducer) to an accuracy of ±0.01% and temperature was measured (integrated platinum thermometer) with an accuracy of ±0.05 K. Experimental uncertainty of density measurements is less than ±0.0001 g·cm-3. The partial molar volumes at infinite dilution (V∞) for 1- and 2-propanol were calculated from the measured densities and are shown in the figure at 0.10-50.00 MPa and 293.15-373.15 K (representative error bars ±1.0 cm3·mol-1 for V∞ are included). Comparison of our results with previous studies shows good agreement and our data significantly increase the availability of volumetric data for dilute 1- and 2-propanol solutions to elevated pressures and temperatures.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this presentation is to illustrate how a probabilistic simulation workflow can be built to provide real-time products, and therefore be used in a real-time decision support environment for volcanic plumes and ash clouds. Generating simulations of volcanic plumes and ash clouds requires knowledge of the eruption characteristics and the potential atmospheric variability, both above the volcano and at distal locations downwind as the ash cloud disperses. Often the initial event characteristics, such as plume height, particle size distribution, and eruption rate have a level of uncertainty associated to them. Therefore, there is a need to simulate the full spectrum of eruption inputs to a dispersion model, to produce a complete range of downwind ash concentrations and atmospheric mass loadings, each with their own probability. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) data are generated as ensemble members also, each representing a potential state of the atmosphere. Therefore, one needs to couple the NWP ensemble members to the eruption uncertainties to build the probabilistic ash cloud concentrations and mass loadings. Here, we show the results of a Lagrangian dispersion model, Puff, used with a one-dimensional volcanic plume model, BENT, to characterize the input variability, and coupled with ensemble NWP data to build a full probabilistic set of ash cloud simulations. We show how these real-time simulations can be generated and then compared to remote sensing data for calibration/validation of the simulations' probabilistic output and how end users could apply the developed products in their operational environment.",

            "abstract": "Voluminous granitic batholiths of the ~500 Ma Ross Orogen in Antarctica are enigmatic in their pace of magmatism, temporal and geochemical trends, sources of melt, and tectonic setting. Isotopic study can address these questions and also reveal the age and composition of the ice-covered East Antarctic craton, which the batholiths intrude in the Transantarctic Mountains. New U-Pb age data, coupled with whole-rock geochemical compositions and zircon O- and Hf-isotope analyses, from a geographically diverse suite of samples provide a wealth of new geochronologic, tracer and inheritance information. SHRIMP zircon U-Pb ages from these samples range from 476-549 Ma with several <490 Ma, which is typically considered the minimum age of Ross magmatism. Geochemically the Ross magmatic suite consists mostly of granites, with lesser granodiorites and tonalites, that show major and trace element characteristics of Cordilleran-type, calc-alkaline volcanic-arc magmas. They have uniform peraluminous compositions of both ferroan and magnesian affinity. Trace-element patterns and oxide mineralogy show that both HFSE-enriched I-type compositions and S-type compositions occur along the length of the belt. SHRIMP zircon δ18O values range from +5.4 to +11.5‰ and are generally uniform within respective samples. The lower values are equivalent to those of mantle zircon and range to crustally-derived magmatic values. Initial εHf compositions determined by LA-MC-ICP-MS range from -16 to +7, and most samples are uniform composition. Zircon xenocrysts indicate inheritance of older components of about 1.2, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.5 Ga. There is no apparent relationship between age and O- or Hf-isotope compositions, but a strong inverse correlation between εHf and δ18O indicates that more crustal-like O-isotope compositions correlate with less radiogenic Hf. Four samples of S-type granites that intrude Archean basement lie off this trend and indicate greater contributions of older, unradiogenic crust.",

Best fits to the data produce the empirical relations ΔTi = 0.13 miVAL2 and ΔTe = 0.017 miVAL2, where mi is the proton mass, indicating that the amount of ion (electron) heating is 13% (1.7%) of the inflowing magnetic energy per proton-electron pair. Our empirical relations may explain the relatively weak ion and electron heating in solar wind reconnection exhausts at 1 AU and strong heating to keV (~107-108 K) energies common in Earth’s magnetotail exhausts. The finding could potentially be used to evaluate the role of reconnection in plasma bulk heating in laboratory, solar and astrophysical contexts.",

Exceedence of sustainable yield of groundwater resources has resulted in groundwater depletion, which has raised a series of issues such as drying wells, increasing pumping costs and environmental damage. With a rapid agricultural and economic development, population increase has added extra stress on available water resources by increasing municipal, agricultural and industrial demands. This necessitates efficient water resources management strategies with better understanding of the causes of water stress and options for sustainable development of economy and management of environment. This study focuses on simulating the water supply and demand, under the influence of changing climate, for Shanshan County, located in northwest of China. A dynamic simulation model is developed using the modeling tool Stella for monthly water balance for the period ranging from 2000-2030. Different future water demand and supply scenarios are developed to represent: (1) base scenario- with current practices; (2) change of the primary water source; (3) improvement of irrigation efficiency; (4) reduction of irrigation area; and (5) reduction of industrial water demand. The results indicate that besides growing demand, the low water use efficiency and low level of water reuse are the primary concerns for water scarcity. Groundwater recharge and abstraction could be balanced by 2030, by reducing industrial demand by 50% and using high efficiency irrigation for agriculture. The model provided a better understanding of the effect of different policies and can help in identifying water resources management strategies.",

            "abstract": "Turkey is one of the self-sufficient in foodstuffs and globally ranks as 7th significant agricultural exporter in the world. Main trading partners are the European Union, the United States and the Middle East. As known, agricultural production is dependent on factors including efficient and effective use of all inputs ranging from those natural resources as in land and water to well-trained human resources as labour at the production. The socio-economic aspects of this sector take several forms ranging from the incomes of the primary producers.\nRural land regulation is a necessity for rural areas and is regarded as a useful instrument for improving farmer’s incomes and life standards. The irrigation system, established during the rural regulation/land consolidation period of large-scale farming, is insufficiently adjusted to the new land tenure structures. The government is especially in the process of water management with hydroelectric power plants. This process produces energy that is required but effects negatively the rivers and agricultural, environmental, climatic conditions. Rivers are vessels of the nature. Free flowing rivers give life to all nature. Most of the studies indicate that Hydroelectric Power Plants (HPP) affects the surface and ground-water management, natural life, agricultural productivity, socio-economic situation at agricultural regions and agro-life related with immigration.\nThis study emphasizes the effect of Hydroelectric Power Plants which are used in transformation of water as a renewable natural resource into electricity power from the perspective of environmental policies and rural regulation.",

            "abstract": "Introduction:We tested the hypothesis that the optical polarization of the light reflected by a sorghum canopy is due to a Fresnel-type redirection, by sorghum leaf surfaces, of light from an unpolarized light source, the sun or overcast sky, toward the measuring sensor. If it can be shown that the source of the polarization of the light scattered by the sorghum canopy is a first surface, Fresnel-type reflection, then removing this surface reflected light from measurements of canopy reflectance presumably would allow better insight into the biochemical processes such as photosynthesis and metabolism that occur in the interiors of sorghum canopy leaves.\nMethods:We constructed a tower 5.9m tall in the center of a homogenous sorghum field. We equipped two Barnes MMR radiometers with polarization analyzers on the number 1, 3 and 7 Landsat TM wavelength bands. Positioning the radiometers atop the tower, we collected radiance data in 44 view directions on two days, one day with an overcast sky and the other, clear and sunlit. From the radiance data we calculated the linear polarization of the reflected light for each radiometer wavelength channel and view direction.\nResults and Discussion: Our experimental results support our hypothesis, showing that the amplitude of the linearly polarized portion of the light reflected by the sorghum canopy varied dramatically with view azimuth direction under a point source, the sun, but the amplitude varied little with view azimuth direction under the hemispherical source, the overcast sky. Under the clear sky, the angle of polarization depended upon the angle of incidence of the sunlight on the leaf, while under the overcast sky the angle of polarization depended upon the zenith view angle. These results support a polarized radiation transport model of the canopy that is based upon a first surface, Fresnel reflection from leaves in the sorghum canopy.",

            "abstract": "Two key parameters for understanding the coupling between the magnetosphere and the thermosphere/ionosphere in polar regions are the characteristic energy and the total energy flux of precipitating auroral electrons. Ionization due to precipitating electrons modifies the ionospheric electron density profile and thereby the height-dependent conductivity in a complex manner in both time and space. Global or regional thermospheric dynamics models typically rely on empirical models (Ovation) or low-resolution global EUV imagery (POLAR) for electron precipitation input which smear out the mesoscale detail of the location and timing of auroral arcs. We have developed a method for measuring the time-dependent auroral electron energy deposition over a several-hundred km range with 25 km resolution using a combination of two ground-based optical instruments - a scanning-doppler imager observing green-line temperatures and a filtered all-sky imager measuring the N2+ first negative emission at 427.8 nm. We will discuss the details of the method, and show several examples including those from the MICA sounding rocket experiment as well as several events from the AMISR PINOT campaign. We will also show comparisons with alternate optical and radar techniques, compare our estimated energy flux to those from Ovation, and discuss limitations and advantages of the technique when examining mesoscale dynamics in the auroral zone.",

            "abstract": "Earth's electron radiation belt dynamics are highly dependent on the state and evolution of the local and global magnetic field. Spacecraft observations provide sparce information on the current state of the radiation belts, however, together with physics-based modeling they may help to resolve the physical processes at work. The Versatile Electron Radiation Belt (VERB) model solves the Fokker-Planck equation in three dimensional invariant coordinates and includes parameterizations of multiple wave processes within the Earth's magnetosphere. The invariant formulation allows one to more effectively separate adiabatic and non-adiabatic changes in the radiation belt electron population. The Kalman filter provides a method to assimilate data with a model, while taking into account the errors associated with each parameter. A split-operator Kalman filter approach is applied in this study, which provides a fast, and computationally inexpensive tool to assimilate data over very long time periods. Data error estimates are derived through energy-channel-specific intercalibration, while model error estimates are adjusted dynamically based on the model forecast performance. In the current study, the reanalysis is applied to investigate the errors in various magnetic field models; knowledge which is vital for accurate modeling of the radiation belts. The goal of the analysis is to develop a quantitative understanding of the magnetic field model errors, and how they contribute to errors in the invariant coordinates of electron phase space density, namely M, K, and L*. Global reanalysis based on data from different MLT sectors and the current understanding of radiation belt physics, allows one to quickly identify any unphysical characteristics in a comparision between different MLT sectors. Two examples of inaccuracies found thus far are a mis-aligned slot region, and differences in the location and magnitude of PSD at fixed first and second invariants, both of which may be explained by magnetic field model errors. Several older magnetic field models, and the data-derived high-resolution and inner-magnetospheric T07 magnetic field model are applied at selected intervals during the Van Allen Probe mission to quantify their performance at different locations and under various conditions.

            "abstract": "The West Kaibab Fault Zone (WKFZ) is the westernmost bounding structure of the Kaibab Plateau of northern Arizona. The WKFZ is a branching complex of high angle, normal faults downthrown to the west. There are three main faults within the WKFZ, the Big Springs fault with a maximum of 165 m offset, the Muav fault with 350 m of displacement, and the North Road fault having a maximum throw of approximately 90 m. Mapping of geologically recent surface deposits at or crossing the fault contacts indicates that the faults are likely Quaternary with the most recent offsets occurring <1.6 Ma. Slip rates are estimated to be less than 0.2 mm/yr. No historic fault slip has been documented. The WKFZ is one of the most seismically active areas in Arizona and lies within the Northern Arizona Seismic Belt (NASB), which stretches across northern Arizona trending NW-SE. The data set for this study includes 156 well documented events with the largest being a M5.75 in 1959 and including a swarm of seven earthquakes in 2012. The seismic data set (1934-2014) reveals that seismic activity clusters in two regions within the study area, the Fredonia cluster located in the NW corner of the study area and the Kaibab cluster located in the south central portion of the study area. The fault plane solutions to date indicate NE-SW to EW extension is occurring in the study area. Source relationships between earthquakes and faults within the WKFZ have not previously been studied in detail. The goal of this study is to use the seismic data set, the available data on faults, and the regional physiography to search for source relationships for the seismicity. Analysis includes source parameters of the earthquake data (location, depth, and fault plane solutions), and comparison of this output to the known faults and areal physiographic framework to indicate any active faults of the WKFZ, or suggested active unmapped faults. This research contributes to a better understanding of the present nature of the WKFZ and the NASB as well.",

            "abstract": "Deciphering the nature of ecohydrological interconnections and scaling that knowledge gained at single points to watersheds is challenging. One tool that that has proved useful in this regard is stable isotope tracing. Single isotope studies have been used recently to quantify landuse change effects on streamflow source apportionment and ecological effects on transit time distributions of water at the catchment scale. However, most work to date has assumed that plant transpiration, groundwater recharge and streamflow are all sourced or mediated by the same well mixed reservoir—the soil. Recent work in Oregon and Mexico has shown evidence of ecohydrological separation, whereby different subsurface compartmentalized pools of water supply either plant transpiration fluxes or the combined fluxes of groundwater recharge and streamflow. However, these findings have not yet been widely tested. Here we assemble the first dual isotope database for δ2H and δ18O extracted from 47 globally-distributed stable isotopic datasets. We use these data to test the ecohydrological separation hypothesis. We combine this dual isotope dataset with global precipitation, streamwater, groundwater and soil water datasets. Our results show that precipitation, streamwater and groundwater from the 47 sites plot approximately along the δ2H/δ18O slope of eight, suggesting that local precipitation inputs supply streamwater and groundwater. Soil waters extracted from the 47 studies plot below the regression of local streamwater and groundwater with a slope of 6.6±0.05 ‰. Local plant xylem waters from our matched dataset plot on a slope 6.6±0.07 ‰ consistent with local soil waters. The tight association of soil water slopes and not that of local groundwater or streamflow suggests that plants use soil water that does not itself contribute to groundwater recharge or stream water. This ubiquity of subsurface water compartmentalization is surprising and has important implications for how we conceptualize ecohydrological interactions in changing environments.",

            "abstract": "More than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and yet urban population is still growing rapidly. It is important to monitor, understand, and model the growth of urban land and population. One of the prerequisites of many urban studies is detailed urban maps. At continental to global scale, Landsat is an ideal source of data for urban extent mapping. However, it is difficult to map urban areas using spectral data only, mainly due to spectral similarity between some urban and non-urban objects and spectral variability within the urban and non-urban class. Here we present an approach for mapping urban extent using object-based texture measures. Preprocessed Global Land Survey (GLS) 2010 Landsat surface reflectance images were segmented using a hierarchical segmentation software package and texture features were extracted at multiple levels of the segmentation hierarchy. We used training data derived from high-resolution imagery to train random forest classifiers for different continents. This method was evaluated in different areas from Europe and North America. Rigorous cross-scene validation gave overall accuracy score of 91.1%. The derived classifier for GLS 2010 images was also tested on GLS 2000 images and generated good results. It is shown that the proposed approach has great potential for global scale urban extent mapping.",

Accurate greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories in urban environments are important to inform responsible policy decisions toward GHG reduction, such as California Assembly Bill #32, and more recently, the Obama Administration proposed rule changes to reduce GHG emissions from power plants.\nAs a megacity (metropolitan area with a population >10 million people), the Los Angeles metropolitan area has been the locus of a number of studies seeking to constrain CO2 emissions. In this work, we adopt an approach toward the atmospheric transport modeling of urban emissions that examines co-emitted pollutants (CO, CO2, CH4) in the LA megacity environment. This approach leverages observations from the ground-based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and space-borne GHG observations through use of the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model to produce an atmospheric inversion of GHGs in the LA megacity environment. This work seeks to develop accurate GHG emission estimates within a framework that leverages TCCON, along with high-resolution satellite observations (<3 km2 footprint) from the recently launched OCO-2 satellite mission to resolve spatial variability on scales that presently challenge Eulerian models.",

More than three-decades long satellite observation of J2 has been useful to understand dynamical process of Earth from mantle to atmosphere. However, causes of decadal J2 variations were still uncertain while ice mass change in polar region was generally believed to be one of the driving forces. In this study, we use anomalous surface mass balance (SMB) in Antarctica and Greenland as a proxy of past anomalous ice mass variation in both ice sheets and quantify their contribution to J2. The SMB contribution in polar ice sheets depicts decadal J2 variations, which agree well with those of SLR observations from 1979 to 2012. This result also suggests an important implication that SMB variations have been important contributors to polar ice mass changes along with ice dynamics. There are still unknown J2 variations with about 10-year periods, and its cause is probably due to limitation of numerical models to depict climate variations associated with solar activity.",

Rather, the coronagraph images show outflow in polar coronal holes as intermittent, highly-variable solar wind speed structures. We compare measurements of these structures in different simultaneously-measured coronagraph images, and with coronal brightness. The distribution of structure speeds shows a gradual decrease with speed in the overlap regions of the two coronagraphs. Measurements of the mean speed derived versus height shows the solar wind acceleration with position angle, and are compared with mass flux and other determinations of solar wind outflow over the large polar coronal hole regions.

            "abstract": "Precipitation events in southern California generate enhanced sediment flux to Santa Barbara Basin (SBB), and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) influence the occurrence and intensity of these events. In order to improve understanding of how enhanced sediment flux from precipitation events affects the well known laminated sediment sequences in SBB, bulk sediment from a new SBB box core (SPR0901-04BC, 62 cm length, 588 m water depth) was analyzed at high-resolution for elemental and mineralogical content. Detrital elemental concentrations increase in samples associated with floods and strong El Niño events, however elemental enrichments vary among these event types, possibly reflecting differences in source area or fluctuations in source contribution. Calcium and sodium concentrations and enrichments oppose those of other detrital elements, suggesting a difference in source area for these two elements, likely the upper reaches of the Santa Clara River. Geochemical weathering index results indicate the sediment deposited during major flood events has undergone increased chemical weathering relative to background sediment deposition in the basin. Weathering index values and clay mineral concentrations, derived from diffractogram peak areas, follow the PDO Index and reflect the frequency of strong El Niño events. During the cool, dry PDO phase when La Nina events are prolonged, weathering index values and clay concentrations decrease, while during the warm, wet PDO phase when strong El Niño events are frequent, weathering index values and clay mineral concentrations rapidly increase with subsequent rainfall events. This pattern can be attributed to a trend of decreasing erosion during dry periods such that only the less chemically weathered soil profile surface is transported to the basin. During wet intervals increasing erosion into the soil profile releases the more intensely weathered sediment and higher clay content of the B horizon. Thus the detrital sediment in this box core records contribution changes from different source areas as well as the intensity and timing of precipitation events, especially those generated during strong El Niño events, and the influence of the PDO phase.",

            "abstract": "By growing roots plants increase potential nutrient and water uptake, which facilitates biochemical and hydraulic health while adding respiration costs and potentially oversubscribing water use. It has been hypothesized that plants arrive at optimal root-to-leaf area (RLA) proportionality through tradeoffs between rhizosphere water and nutrient fluxes that maximize carbon gain while minimizing water loss. We encapsulated these concepts within an ecohydrological framework of soil-rhizosphere-plant hydraulic traits coupled to canopy biochemistry to test this apparent optimality of root allocation. The framework was implemented in TREES, a dynamic ecohydrology model that combines transience in hydraulic impairment with photosynthesis, respiration, and carbon allocation. We conducted model experiments in which total root area was distributed over shallow to deep root profiles, and under conditions where predawn xylem water potential either maintained homeostasis with soil water potential, an assumption of most ecohydrology models, or was fully dynamic with hydraulic impairment building during successive dry periods. The analysis was conducted on 6 conifer species of varying vulnerability to cavitation from climatically different sites in New Mexico, Wyoming, and Northern Wisconsin subject to climate change induced disturbance. Data included sap flux, eddy covariance fluxes, micrometeorology, and leaf level gas exchange. Species with lower vulnerability to cavitation had improved hydraulic status and transpiration at higher RLAs, but these improvements did not produce gains in carbon uptake, which suggested the need for more modest root areas. Distributing the same total root area to greater depth obviated hydraulic impairment in sites with larger precipitation events or lateral subsurface water flow, but only aided carbon uptake when nutrients were non-limiting. Except where chronic hydraulic impairment hindered photosynthesis, there was little advantage to growing deeper roots or maintaining homeostasis between xylem and rhizosphere water status, as both adjustments generally increased water use per unit gain in carbon. Based on the cross-site modeling experiments we offer some general scaling principles that consider tradeoffs between hydraulic and carbon uptake efficiency.",

These products include energy fluxes, water fluxes, and state variables. Soil moisture is one of the most important state variables in NLDAS-2 as it plays a key role in land-atmosphere interaction, regional climate and ecological model simulation, water resource management, and other study areas. The soil moisture data from these models have been used for US operational drought monitoring activities, water resources management and planning, initialization of regional weather and climate models, and other meteorological and hydrological research purposes. However, these data have not yet been comprehensively evaluated due to the lack of extensive soil moisture observations. In this study, observations from over 1200 sites in the North America compiled from 27 observational networks in the North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD, http://soilmoisture.tamu.edu/) were used to evaluate the model-simulated daily soil moisture for different vegetation cover varying from grassland to forest, and different soil texture varying from sand to clay. Seven states in the United States from NASMD were selected based on known measurement error estimates for the evaluation. Statistical metrics, such as anomaly correlation, root-mean-square errors (RMSE), and bias are computed to assess NLDAS-2 soil moisture products. Three sensitivity tests were performed using the Noah model to examine the effect of soil texture and vegetation type mismatch on NLDAS-2 soil moisture simulation. In the first test, site observed soil texture was used. In the second test, site observed vegetation type/land cover was used. In the third test, both site observed soil texture and vegetation type were used. The results from three sensitivity tests will be compared with NLDAS-2 Noah and observed soil moisture.

            "abstract": "The Zagros Mountains are the part of the Alpine-Himalayan chain that forms the northern margin of the Arabian plate and comprises a Neogene-Recent sedimentary basin that is forming in response to ongoing Arabia-Eurasia collision. Flexure of the Arabian lithosphere beneath the Zagros forms one of largest and most active basins in the world at which a backstripped deflection of a competent layer just below the foreland deposits represents its total amount of tectonic subsidence. As such, the Asmari Fm. can be used to analyze flexural bending and subsequently the amount of loading and elastic thickness of the Arabian lithosphere since the continent-continent collision started. In this study, flexure of the Arabian lithosphere is investigated using more than 100 boreholes and 60 interpreted seismic lines which show that the flexure is shallower (~ 1 km) and wider in the east and deeper (~6 km) and narrower towards the west (Figure 1). The shallow and wide eastern foredeep has little accommodation space due to small tectonic loads and the thick lithosphere in this region. In addition, viscous strength in the eastern sector leads to a wide deformation belt with low topography and low surface slopes. These factors, combined with arid climatic conditions, produce low sediment supply to the foreland basin so that it remains under-filled even though the foreland basin is shallow. In contrast, the western part of the Zagros region shows much larger accommodation space due to the combination of large loads and a relatively thin elastic plate. In the western sector, frictional basal strength and steeper topography along with more humid climatic conditions leading to a large supply of sediment to the foreland which is completely filled even though the foreland basin is deep.\nOur results also show that the Zagros foreland basin migrated towards south through the Neogene; however, the way of propagation is not fully understood yet. The eastern depocenter of the Zagros foreland migrated towards south about ~400 km during the last 17 Ma, whereas this migration decreases to about ~100 km towards the west. Our preliminary results propose that the western Zagros foreland basin is developing under wedge growing condition and the eastern sector is growing due to thrusting beneath the steady-state wedge (?), but the idea requires further analysis.",

            "abstract": "The Cascadia subduction zone poses one of the greatest risks for a megaquake in the continental United States and, because of this, the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN) at the University of Washington is building a joint seismic and geodetic earthquake early warning system. Our two-stage approach to earthquake early warning includes: (1) detection and initial characterization using strong-motion and broadband data from the PNSN with the ElarmS package, and (2) geodetic modeling modules using GPS data from the Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array (PANGA) and combined seismogeodetic (GPS + strong-motion) data. Because of Cascadia’s relatively low seismicity rate and the paucity of data from plate boundary earthquakes, we have prioritized the development of a test system and the creation of several large simulated events. The test system permits us to: (1) replay segments of actual seismic waveform data recorded from the PNSN and neighboring networks to represent both earthquakes and noise conditions, and (2) broadcast synthetic data into the system to simulate signals we anticipate from earthquakes for which we have no actual ground motion recordings. The test system lets us also simulate various error conditions (latent and/or out-of-sequence data, telemetry drop-outs, etc.) and to explore how best to mitigate them. Here, we report on the performance of the joint early warning system and the geodetic modeling modules in a simulated real-time mode using simulated 5-Hz displacements from plausible Cascadian earthquake scenarios. The simulations are created using the FK integration method for hypothetical source models for a wide array of possible faulting types and magnitudes. The results show that the geodetic modeling modules are able to properly characterize the simulated events, and we discuss the limitations with respect to latency, network architecture, and earthquake location throughout the Pacific Northwest.",

            "abstract": "A two-moment microphysics scheme for deep convection was implemented in the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) by Song et al. (2012). The new scheme improved hydrometeor profiles in deep convective clouds and increased deep convective detrainment, reducing the negative biases in low and mid-level cloud fraction and liquid water path compared to observations. Here, we examine in more detail the impacts of this improved microphysical representation on regional scale water and radiation budgets.\nAs the primary source of cloud water for stratus clouds is detrainment from deep and shallow convection, the enhanced convective activity leads to larger stratus cloud fractions, higher cloud water content, and more stratiform precipitation in all oceanic regions examined, particularly in the subtropics. This can be seen also in increased values of net cloud radiative forcing. Over land regions, cloud amounts are reduced, leading to weaker cloud forcing and increased OLR. The magnitude and, occasionally, the sign of the changes in cloud properties can differ if scaled by the precipitation produced in a region, and much of the changes occur in the mixed phase region of the atmosphere. This indicates that the complex interactions between liquid and ice phase microphysics can effect changes in regional scale circulations.\nWe will present details of the large scale water and radiation budgets and the microphysical budgets of cloud liquid and ice for several regions. Results will be compared to cloud resolving model simulations.",

Following restoration in the spring of 2014, the reservoir was partially refilled and drained. To quantify the controls of dam restoration on hydrologic patterns in the watershed, stream discharge and temperature were continuously monitored above and below the lake since September 2013. Groundwater levels and temperature were also monitored at two sites (total of 19 wells) within the lakebed and one site upstream of the reservoir (total of 8 wells). Results from streambed tracer tests are also available to help quantify lakebed exchange characteristics.\nData collected prior to and during these filling and drainage events provide insight into shallow surface flow and short-term drainage dynamics of a small watershed influenced by damming. Pre-dam restoration groundwater level data from Shavers Creek suggest the potential for groundwater discharge to the stream, while geochemical evidence indicates that low permeability legacy sediments impeded groundwater-stream water interactions. We demonstrate how the initial stages of refilling the lake have altered groundwater-surface water interactions within the lakebed and in local upstream tributaries.",

            "abstract": "Mo isotope fractionation during soil development was studied across three pedogenic gradients encompassing a range of controlling factors. These include redox conditions, organic matter content, Fe and Mn oxy(hydr)oxide content, mineral composition, degree of weathering, pH, type and amount of atmospheric inputs, age, climate, and underlying rock type. Soil profiles from the island of Maui along a precipitation gradient ranging from 850 to 5050 mm mean annual precipitation show a decrease in average soil d98Mo from -0.04±0.11‰ at the driest, most oxic site, which is indistinguishable from the basalt parent material (-0.09±0.08‰), to -0.33±0.10‰ at the wettest, most reducing site. A suite of 6 Icelandic soils display a broad trend with heavier d98Mo values in soil horizons that are more weathered and with higher organic matter content, with values up to +1.50±0.09‰ in a Histosol. Selective extractions of Mo from different soil components indicate that the association with organic matter and silicate or Ti-oxide residue dominates retention of Mo in these soils, with adsorption on Fe and Mn oxy(hydr)oxides playing a lesser role. Across all basaltic soils, d98Mo values are lighter in soils that exhibit the most net Mo loss relative to the parent material, and d98Mo values are heavier in soils that exhibit net Mo gains. A well-drained soil and saprolite profile in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico also shows heavier d98Mo values than the parent material, up to +0.71±0.10‰ with an integrated profile average of +0.28±0.10‰ ‰ versus -0.01±0.10‰ in the quartz diorite bedrock, but an overall moderate loss of 28% of Mo relative to bedrock. The Luquillo saprolite is unfractionated from bedrock in the deeper part of the profile, however, indicating that rock weathering dissolution processes and secondary clay formation do not fractionate Mo isotopes, and that the heavy Mo isotope values in the upper, most weathered part of the profile reflect atmospheric inputs, biological cycling, or sorption-desorption processes. The presence of both light and heavy Mo (relative to parent material) across all sites and within individual soil profiles suggests that it is normal for multiple Mo fractionation mechanisms to operate under the open-system conditionsof soils.",

The largest glacierized region and present-day contributor to sea level rise outside of the massive ice sheets is the Canadian Arctic. Recent work has shown that the glaciers of the southern Canadian Arctic (Baffin and Bylot Island) have experienced accelerated rates of ice loss in recent decades, but little is known regarding the spatial and temporal variations in rates of loss. For this study we examine in detail changes in the extent of the Penny Ice Cap (a proxy for ice loss) between 1969 and 2014 to better understand the climatic drivers of the recently observed accelerated rates of ice loss on Baffin Island. To do this, we reconstruct the extent of the ice cap for the year 1969 from historical maps and for the years 1985, 1995, 2010, and 2014 from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI imagery. We use 2009 SPOT HRS imagery and a novel extent comparison algorithm to assess the accuracy of glacier extents derived from Landsat imagery. Regional temperature and precipitation records were used to explain the spatial pattern of change. Due to large variation in elevations, hypsometry was also investigated as a contributor to differences in rates of change across the ice cap. Preliminary results show overall retreat throughout the ice cap but with regional differences in area and length change on either side of the Ice Cap divide.",

It is hypothesized that climate models which capture the historical sea surface temperature (SST) and climate relationships for the CRB might garner more weight or consideration when analyzing future conditions. This study analyzes the historical and downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) climatology and hydrology data, along with SST data, using singular variable decomposition (SVD) to identify regions of significant correlation between the Pacific Ocean and the CRB.\nSVD is a statistical tool capable of isolating important modes of variability when identifying coupled relationships between datasets involving gridded arrays and time series. SVD analysis was performed between historical SST and basin temperature, precipitation, and runoff conditions. The historical period analysis was performed prior to performing SVD analysis on all future climate projections to establish a baseline for the coupled SST and climate/hydrology relationship. An inter-model comparison reveals variable regions of significance and correlation magnitudes when all CMIP5 models are analyzed throughout the historical period. The models that captured certain historical features/relationships were then analyzed as a subset against the full ensemble to determine if any refinement or consensus in future projected conditions exists.\nThis study has identified a subset of CMIP5 models hypothesized to replicate the coupled SST and climate/hydrology conditions in the CRB. With this knowledge, a comparison between subset and ensemble model projections provides insight into the magnitude of the climate and hydrology projection differences for the CRB.\nThis study was performed to develop a subset of climate projections and to determine the differences between ensemble and subset climate model projections. The results of the study can potentially assist CRB resource managers in determining the applicability of climate and hydrology projections and reduce the uncertainty of future conditions.

            "abstract": "To explain the lunar Late Heavy Bombardment the Nice Model (Tsiganis, K., Gomes, R., Morbidelli, A., & Levison, H. 2005, Nature, 435, 459; Tsiganis, K., Gomes, R., Morbidelli, A., & Levison, H. 2005, Nature, 435, 459) invokes a period of dynamical instability, occurring long after planet formation, that destabilizes both the main asteroid belt and a remnant exterior planetesimal disk. As a side effect of explaining the lunar LHB, this model also predicts an LHB-like period in the outer Solar System. With higher collision probabilities and impact energies due to gravitational focusing by the giant planets the inner satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus would have experienced a bombardment much more severe than the one supposedly responsible for the lunar basins. The concern is that such bombardment should have resulted in significant, even catastrophic modification of the mid-size satellites.\nHere we look at the problem of satellite survival during a hypothetical outer Solar System LHB. Using a Monte-Carlo approach we calculate, for 10 satellites of Saturn and Uranus, the probability of having experienced at least one catastrophic collision during an LHB. We use a scaling law for the energy required to disrupt a target in a gravity-dominated collision derived from new SPH simulations. These simulations extend the scaling law previously obtained by Benz & Asphaug (1999, Icarus, 142, 5) to larger targets. We then simulate randomized LHB impacts by drawing from appropriate size and velocity distributions, with the total delivered mass as a controlled parameter. We find that Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Hyperion, and Miranda experience at least one catastrophic impact in every simulation. In most simulations, Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys experience multiple catastrophic impacts, including impacts with energies several times that required to completely disrupt the target. The implication is that these close-in, mid-size satellites could not have survived a Late Heavy Bombardment unmodified, unless the mass delivered to the outer Solar System was at least 30 times less that the value predicted by the Nice Model, or 10 times less than the reduced value more recently suggested by Dones & Levison (2013, in 44th Lunar Planet.

We hypothesized that pedogenic oxides would generate more extensive chemical alterations to the protein structure than phyllosilicates. A well-characterized protein proxy (Gb1, IEP 4.0, 6.2 kDA) was adsorbed onto functionally different mineral surfaces (goethite, montmorillonite, kaolinite and birnesite) at pH 5 and pH 7. We used 1H 15N Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (HSQC NMR) to observe structural modifications in the unadsorbed Gb1 that was allowed to equilibrate during the adsorption process for kaolinite, goethite and birnessite. Solid state NMR was used to observe the structural modifications of Gb1 while adsorbed onto kaolinite and montmorillonite. Preliminary results in the HSQC NMR spectra observed no changes in the native conformation of Gb1 when allowed to interact with goethite and kaolinite while birnessite induced strong structural modification of Gb1 at an acidic pH. Our results suggest that not all mineral surfaces in soil act as sorbents for EEs and changes in their catalytic activity upon adsorption to minerals surfaces may not just be an indication of conformational changes but of fragmentation of the protein itself.\n ",

Peat formation is influenced by all these processes and represents the combined effects of climatic and hydrographic evolution.\nIn the framework of Project REPEAT, we studied three peat cores using palynological and paleomagnetic methods, focusing on the influence of the general climatic setting and postglacial sea-level changes during the last 6500 years on the process of peat formation and the interplay of local environmental and hydrological conditions. In this report we consider the hypothesis that peat accretion was closely related to general climatic trends, as reflected in atmospheric carbon storage in the Delta sediments, and to general sea-level fluctuation.\nBased on the fact that the bulk density of the peat is closely correlated with organic carbon content, we examine: 1) whether the pollen concentration is highest when the organic carbon content in the cores is a maximum and corresponds to the warmest episodes; 2) whether organic content is inversely related to the lithic content as determined by paleomagnetic measurements; 3) whether a salinity index based on pollen criteria is highest during the highest stands of sea level; 4) and whether the C3/C4 plant index is a good measure of the carbon content of the peat.",

            "abstract": "Aqueous carbonation of ultramafic rocks has been proposed as a promising method for long-term, secure sequestration of carbon dioxide. While chemical kinetics data indicate that carbonation reaction in olivine is one of the fastest among the mg-bearing minerals, in practice, the factors that limit the extent and rate of carbonation in ultramafic rocks are fluid supply and flux. On the one hand, reaction products could produce passivating layer that prohibits further reactions. On the other hand, the increases in solid volume during carbonation could lead to cracking and create new fluid paths. Whether carbonation in ultramafic rocks is self-limiting or self-sustaining has been hotly debated. Experimental evidence of precipitation of reaction products during olivine carbonation was reported. To date, reaction-driven cracking has not been observed. In this paper, we present the first real-time pore structure evolution data using the x-ray synchrotron microtomography. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution was injected into porous olivine aggregates and in-situ pore structure change during olivine carbonation at a constant confining pressure (12 MPa) and a temperature of 200oC was captured at 30 min. interval for ~160 hours. Shortly after the experiment started, filling-in of the existing pores by precipitation of reaction products was visible. The size of the in-fills kept increasing as reactions continued. After ~48 hours, cracking around the in-fill materials became visible. After ~60 hours, these cracks started to show a clear polygonal pattern, similar to the crack patterns usually seen on the surface of drying mud. After ~72 hours, some of the cracks coalesced into large fractures that cut-through the olivine aggregates. New fractures continued to develop and at the end of the experiment, the sample was completely disintegrated by these fractures. We also conducted nanotomography experiments on a sub-volume of the reacted olivine aggregate. Orthogonal sets of incipient cracks were observed, providing clear evidence that these cracks are generated by isotropic tensile stresses. This strongly indicates that the observed cracking was caused by volume expansion during mineral carbonation. The experimental results provide a mechanism for near 100% alteration of ultramafic rocks observed in nature.",

Geophysical profiles (seismic and multi-beam) collected in the pockmark field in January and February 2013 on the Chatham Rise onboard the RV Sonne (SO226) suggested past and present gas migration in the sediments. With the overall objectives of constraining the timescales for the pockmark formation and describing their formation mechanisms, sediment coring (multi and piston cores) targeted the gas escape features.\nSurface sediments were collected using a multi-corer at water depths ranging from ~500 to 1000 m. Solid phase 210Pb (half-life = 22 y) and 14C (half-life = 5568 y) were measured in surface sediments (≤ 20 cm). Sediment mixing coefficients in the surface sediments calculated from excess 210Pb profiles ranged from 3 – 8 cm2 ky-1. Excess 210Pb penetration depths were ~ 8 cm in most cores. Generally, 14C profiles showed mixing depths similar to excess 210Pb but were greater in some locations. Sediment mixing and its potential effects on paleoceanographic reconstructions at these sites will be presented.\n[1] Davy et al. (2010) Geophys. Res. Lett. 37, L21309.",

Impacts by comets and asteroids are unique in that they can act as either a source or loss process depending on aspects of the impact such as impactor size, velocity, and composition, as well as impact angle and target material. Here we examine multiple pre-existing models for individual impacts (Melosh and Vickery 1989; Genda and Abe 2003; Svetsov 2000, 2007; Shuvalov 2009) and create Monte Carlo models of the effect of these impacts on atmospheric abundances over a period of heavy bombardment. We find generally good agreement between final atmospheric pressures of the various models for identical input parameters. In particular, we note that impacts act as a source of atmosphere for Mars and Earth while they lead to a net loss of atmosphere at Venus. In the future this work can be expanded to track abundances of individual atmospheric components or impact-induced chemical reactions. It may also be used in the larger framework of examining multiple source and loss processes to form a more complete model of atmospheric evolution.",

Land cover/land use change has accelerated over the past three decades, owing to post liberalization socio-economic changes in Inner Mongolia, China (IM) Mongolia (MG) which have different political systems. Extensive anthropomorphic modifications of ecosystems have the ability to alter the structure and function of ecosystems and ecological processes such as the carbon and water cycle and it is therefore important to differentiate between such changes from climate-driven changes. This study identified climate-driven and human-induced changes in vegetation cover on the Mongolian plateau across desert, grassland and forest biomes as well as administrative divisions. We applied non-parametric trend tests on time series of vegetation index datasets that include MODIS EVI, Vegetation Index and Phenology (VIP) EVI2, and GIMMS 3g as well as precipitation and temperature obtained from TRMM and MERRA reanalysis datasets. We then correlated the VI trends with the climate drivers to determine and isolate primary climate drivers. VI residuals obtained from the regression of composites of peak season maximum VI and JJA monthly accumulated rainfall were analyzed for detection of trends in vegetation greenness not explained by rainfall dynamics over different time periods (2000-2012, and 1981 to 2010). In addition, we obtained trends in socioeconomic variables like total livestock and population density which were closely correlated with VI residual trends adjusted for rainfall. Some administrative subdivisions in IM and MG showed a decreasing trend in residuals that could be attributed to anthropogenic activity such as grazing, or urbanization, while other subdivisions showed an increasing trend in residuals increasing trend in residuals suggest that vegetation cover has improved and perhaps be attributed to restoration and conservation efforts.",

            "abstract": "Substratum geology is fundamental in shaping rocky shore morphology. Specific lithologies have various responses to wave action, tectonic features (e.g. fractures, faults) and sedimentary structures (e.g. bedding), creating distinctive weathering profiles. Along with local oceanography and climate forcing, different rock substrata create coastal morphologies that can vary distinctly between scales, ranging from mm to km. Despite the complexity of the system, qualitative observations show coastal areas with similar rock types share similar geomorphologies. Thus, a statistic relationship between geomorphology (expressed for instance by surface parameter rugosity) and geology can be envisaged. There are multiple benefits of finding such a relationship, as rocky intertidal geomorphology can be an important determinant in which organisms can settle, grow, and survive in near shore communities: allowing the prediction of geomorphologic parameters determining coastal ecology solely based on substratum geology, a crucial aspect in guiding the selection of marine protected areas.\nThis study presents preliminary results of multi-scale geospatial surveys (cm to tens of meters) of rocky intertidal outcrops from Central to Northern California using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner. The outcrops investigated are representative of the most common igneous and sedimentary rocks in California (granitoids, conglomerates, sandstones, mudstones) and metamorphic units. The statistical analysis of the survey data support the hypothesis that surface properties can change significantly with changing scale, each rock type having distinct surface characteristics which are similar to comparable lithologies exposed at different locations. These scale dependent variations are controlled by different lithologic and structural characteristics of the outcrop in question. Our data also suggests lithologic variability within a rock unit could be a very significant factor in controlling changes in rugosity across scales.",

For a proposed storage site, this study builds a suite of increasingly complex conceptual “geologic” model families, using subsets of the site characterization data: a homogeneous model family, a stationary petrophysical model family, a stationary facies model family with sub-facies petrophysical variability, and a non-stationary facies model family (with sub-facies variability) conditioned to soft data. These families, representing alternative conceptual site models built with increasing data, were simulated with the same CO2 injection test (50 years at 1/10 Mt per year), followed by 2950 years of monitoring. Using the Design of Experiment, an efficient sensitivity analysis (SA) is conducted for all families, systematically varying uncertain input parameters. Results are compared among the families to identify parameters that have 1st order impact on predicting the CO2 storage ratio (SR) at both end of injection and end of monitoring. At this site, geologic modeling factors do not significantly influence the short-term prediction of the storage ratio, although they become important over monitoring time, but only for those families where such factors are accounted for. Based on the SA, a response surface analysis is conducted to generate prediction envelopes of the storage ratio, which are compared among the families at both times. Results suggest a large uncertainty in the predicted storage ratio given the uncertainties in model parameters and modeling choices: SR varies from 5–60% (end of injection) to 18–100% (end of monitoring), although its variation among the model families is relatively minor. Moreover, long-term leakage risk is considered small at the proposed site. In the lowest-SR scenarios, all families predict gravity-stable supercritical CO2 migrating toward the bottom of the aquifer. In the highest-SR scenarios, supercritical CO2 footprints are relatively insignificant by the end of monitoring.",

            "abstract": "The traditional implementation of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model utilizes common landscape characteristics known as hydrologic response units (HRUs). Discretization into HRUs provides a simple, computationally efficient framework for simulation, but also represents a significant limitation of the model as spatial connectivity between HRUs is ignored. SWATgrid, a newly developed, distributed version of SWAT, provides modified landscape routing via a grid, overcoming these limitations. However, the current implementation of SWATgrid has significant computational overhead, which effectively precludes traditional calibration and limits the total number of grid cells in a given modeling scenario. Moreover, as SWATgrid is a relatively new modeling approach, it remains largely untested with little understanding of the impact of spatial resolution on model output. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of user-defined input resolution on SWATgrid predictions in the Upper Cedar Creek Watershed (near Auburn, IN, USA). Original input data, nominally at 30 m resolution, was rescaled for a range of resolutions between 30 and 4,000 m. A 30 m traditional SWAT model was developed as the baseline for model comparison. Monthly calibration was performed, and the calibrated parameter set was then transferred to all other SWAT and SWATgrid models to focus the effects of resolution on prediction uncertainty relative to the baseline. Model output was evaluated with respect to stream flow at the outlet and water quality parameters. Additionally, output of SWATgrid models were compared to output of traditional SWAT models at each resolution, utilizing the same scaled input data. A secondary objective considered the effect of scale on calibrated parameter values, where each standard SWAT model was calibrated independently, and parameters were transferred to SWATgrid models at equivalent scales. For each model, computational requirements were evaluated. While the definition and choice of input data resolution widely depends on the specific application and area of interest, this study will serve as a general guide in identifying an optimal range of input spatial resolution for SWATgrid applications.",

The Southern Great Plains and North Slope of Alaska sites are undergoing a reconfiguration to support the routine operation of high-resolution process-models. Enhancements are being targeted to both enable the initialization and evaluation of process models with the goal of using the combination of high-resolution observations and simulations to study key atmospheric processes. This type of observation/model integration is not new at ARM sites, but the creation of two new “supersites” will enable the application of this observation/model synergy on a routine basis, further exploiting the long-term nature of the ARM observations.",

            "abstract": "Cataclastic shear bands in unconsolidated sands are typically stronger and lower permeability zones than the surrounding matrix material, and act as barriers to fluid flow in aquifers and reservoirs. Characterization of the mechanical and hydraulic properties of shear bands is especially important for basin and petroleum studies due to their role as barriers to fluid flow in reservoirs. We investigated the nature of permeability and the structural evolution of shear bands and proximal host material collected from the footwall of the McKinleyville thrust fault in Humboldt County, California, and from the footwall of the Moab Fault in Moab, Utah. We report on a suite of laboratory experiments that included measurement of permeability, porosity, and acoustic wave velocity measurements over a range of effective stresses from 5 – 65 MPa.\n The permeability-porosity trends are similar for all samples, with permeability decreasing systematically with increasing effective stress and decreasing porosity. The permeability of the unconsolidated host sand decreases from 8.2×10-16 m2 at 5 MPa effective stress to 3.1×10-17 m2 at 65 MPa, while the permeability of shear bands decreases from 5.9×10-17 m2 to 3.0×10-18 m2 over this stress range. Elastic wave speeds increase systematically with increasing effective stress. P-wave velocities of the host sand increase from 1125 m/s at 5 MPa to 3180 m/s at 65 MPa, and velocities of the cataclastic shear bands increase from 1616 m/s to 3058 m/s. Ongoing and future work will investigate time dependent changes in stiffness, strength, and permeability, and will expand this dataset to include shear bands from a range of geologic settings.",

An emerging engineering application of this class of problem is represented by CO2 sequestration in deep geological formations. We present a modeling approach to tackle coupled fluid flow and geomechanics in naturally fractured reservoir. The system of partial differential equations is solved using a combination of finite-volume and finite-element discretization schemes, respectively, for the flow and mechanics problems. The model accounts for flow along fractures and can predict fracture reactivation by accurately simulating normal and shear stresses acting on the fracture surfaces. The focus is on the effects induced by changes in the stress field in fracture permeability. The fracture permeability evolution is described by a constitutive model that depends on the tangential displacement that develops between the two contact surfaces defining a fracture, and the effective normal traction, giving rise to a highly non-linear problem. The proposed model is verified against both simple single-fracture test cases and more complex fracture network configurations.",

UAVSAR supports a broad array of basic and applied geoscience, covering on smaller scale all the disciplines NI-SAR would be able to address on a global scale. Although designed specifically to provide high accuracy repeated flight tracks and precise imaging geometry for InSAR-based solid earth studies, its fully polarimetric operation, low noise, and consistent calibration accuracy has made it a premier instrument for PolSAR-based studies also. Since 2009 it has successfully imaged more than 16 million km2 and >4300 quad-polarimetric data products are now publicly available online. Upgrades made in the last year to automate the repeat track processing serve as a model for generating large volumes of InSAR products: Since January 2014 more than 700 interferometric products have been released, exceeding the output of all previous years combined. Standardly available products now include browse images of all InSAR acquisitions and coregistered single-look complex image stacks suitable for standard time series analysis. Here we present an overview of the wide range of studies utilizing UAVSAR data including those based on polarimetry and pair-wise and times series interferometry, highlighting both the unique capabilities of UAVSAR and the ways in which NI-SAR would be able to dramatically extend the capabilities.\nThis research was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

Centennial-scale resolution marine observations independently suggest that the global ocean cooling trend observed from 0-1800 CE was reversed in the last two centuries. Building on the results of earlier continental-scale temperature reconstructions from the PAGES 2k community3, we compare the initiation point for recent significant warming between various land and ocean regions. Preliminary results suggest recent significant warming in the tropical oceans was near synchronous with warming of the Northern Hemisphere land masses, in contrast with a potential poleward lag in warming of the Southern Hemisphere land masses. Multi-model climate simulations are used to assess where there is high fidelity between recent warming trends determined by palaeoclimate observations and simulations, and to examine regions of data-model divergence.\n",

            "abstract": "Cryogenic fracturing exploits thermal gradient and resulting local tensile stress to initiate fractures / cracks on a surface exposed to cryogenic fluids. This study investigates the development and morphology of cracks generated from cryogenic thermal shock in a borehole geometry.\nThe study evaluates cryogenic thermal shock under no external confining stress to specimens. To better understand this process in a geometry relevant to applications, a borehole was drilled through transparent acrylic specimens representing a wellbore. This borehole was partially cased with stainless steel tubing set by a high yield epoxy. Liquid nitrogen was injected into the wellbore through a stainless steel tube. The pressure was low (< 10 psia) and the fractures were initiated by the thermal shock; these initiated fractures allowed further penetration of the cryogen, which helped to propagate fractures throughout the specimen.\nA major advantage of performing this experiment in a transparent cryogenic specimen is the ability to observe fracture proliferation through time. It is observed that fracture growth was characterized by abrupt starts and stops, which suggest that the tensile stress generated inside the borehole must reach a certain threshold for fracture initiation and growth. Two distinctive patterns in crack development were observed: one is horizontal-planar-radial pattern created by longitudinal thermal contraction, and another is vertical cracks by circumferential contraction. The horizontal cracks appeared to be spaced by a certain length, known as the exclusion distance, which exists because a set of cracks cannot be created closer than a certain length due to limited amount of thermal contraction. The vertical tension cracks tend to initiate between the horizontal radial cracks and bridge them, as it may be energy-efficient to start from and propagate to existing defects.",

            "abstract": "Carbon isotope analysis of bulk organic and inorganic carbon preserved in the lacustrine deposits of the late Triassic to Jurassic Moenave Formation were analyzed to construct a carbon isotope chemostratigraphic profile of western Pangea. Negative carbon isotope excursions (NCIE) are characteristic of the Late Triassic and are attributed to the effects of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) on climate and the global C-cycle. The aerial extent of the CAMP basalts is the largest in Earth’s history spanning four continents with an area of ~ 7 x 106 km2 and a volume of 3 to 11 x 106 km3. Carbon isotope and paleontological evidence has shown that the end Triassic extinction is near synchronous to the CAMP and likely spurred on the extinction event as well as an increase in global temperatures of 2 – 2.5°C. Global correlations of NCIEs between marine and terrestrial strata provide a connection between the CAMP basalts and the end-Triassic extinction. Preliminary data collected at Potter Canyon, Arizona reveal a 5.5 ‰ decrease in δ13Corganic and a 2.75‰ decrease in δ13Ccarbonate in the lower portion of the Whitmore Point Member. These NCIEs indicate the global carbon cycle perturbation caused by the CAMP is recorded in lacustrine sediments of the Whitmore Point Member in southern Utah and northern Arizona. Additional samples collected at high sampling frequencies at other locations in the Whitmore Point Member will corroborate the terrestrial impacts of the CAMP perturbation at these locations across the region. Correlation of NCIES associated with the CAMP and any identified microfossils of the Whitmore Point Member will also illustrate the global effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on the terrestrial environment and biota.",

That is, 1-2 m resolution bathymetric mapping of the seafloor, when combined with high-resolution magnetic and water column measurements, enables the discharge of hydrothermal vent fluids to be coupled with geological and structural features, and inferred upflow zones. Optimum altitude for the AUVs is ~70 m ensuring high resolution coverage of the area, maximum exposure to hydrothermal venting, and efficency of survey. The Brothers caldera and Clark cone volcanoes of the Kermadec arc have been surveyed by ABE and Sentry. At Brothers, bathymetric mapping shows complex features on the caldera walls including embayment’s, ridges extending orthogonal to the walls and the location of a dominant ring fault. Water column measurements made by light scattering, temperature, ORP and pH sensors confirmed the location of the known vent fields on the NW caldera wall and atop the two cones, and discovered a new field on the West caldera wall. Evidence for diffuse discharge was also seen on the rim of the NW caldera wall; conversely, there was little evidence for discharge over an inferred ancient vent site on the SE caldera wall. Magnetic measurements show a strong correlation between the boundaries of vent fields determined by water column measurements and observed from manned submersible and towed camera surveys, and donut-shaped zones of magnetic ‘lows’ that are focused along ring faults. A magnetic low was also observed to cover the SE caldera site. Similar surveys over the NW edifice of Clark volcano also show a strong correlation between active hydrothermal venting and magnetic lows. Here, the survey revealed a pattern resembling Swiss cheese of magnetic lows, indicating more widespread permeability. Moreover, the magnetic survey showed evidence for a highly magnetized ring structure ~350 m below the volcano summit considered to represent a buried (by continued growth of the cone) caldera rim. Zones of magnetic lows located inside the inferred caldera that are not associated with present-day venting are consistent with an earlier stage of hydrothermal activity.",

To render plausible mechanisms of C4 grass expansion replacing C3 trees, we applied compound specific isotope analysis of lipid biomarkers preserved in mudstones and paleosols of the Nepal Siwalik. We investigate δ13C (vegetation proxy), δD (precipitation proxy) and brGDGTs (mean annual air temperature proxy) of the sedimentary strata deposited in a continental fluvial environment. Samples were collected from various river sections of the Nepal Siwalik to document temporal as well as lateral (along east-west tectonic-strike) variations in vegetation and climate shift. Published paleomagnetic ages of the region provides age constrain of the studied deposits, which range in age from 16 Ma to 2 Ma.\nThis is the first study that provides compound-specific isotopic data and paleotemperatures of the Siwalik strata in the region. As shown by δ13C values, C4 vegetation (grasses) likely started to expand around 6.5 Ma and became highly dominated in 5.2 Ma. Increased precipitation, likely due to monsoonal intensification, is recorded in δD data around this interval of vegetation shift. brGDGTs data revealed an intriguing cyclic (~2 Ma cycle) variation of paleotemperatures. Integration and further analyses of these key proxy data are ongoing.\nKey words: monsoon, Nepal Siwalik, late Neogene, vegetation and climate shift, paleotemperature.",

            "abstract": "We present a new method to simulate high-frequency (HF) (> ~1 Hz) ground motion using the relationships between the characteristics of acceleration envelopes of high- and low-frequency (LF) ground motions. It presupposes that LF ground motion has been already obtained by other deterministic method, and takes advantage of the LF ground motion to simulate HF ground motion. The relationship of acceleration envelopes among different frequency bands are investigated using the observed ground motion data of M5-6 earthquakes that occurred near the target earthquake for which we aim to synthesize the ground motion, by simply taking their ratios in time domain. We show that the envelope ratios can be expressed by three parameters that are site-specific and independent of magnitudes of the earthquakes, and that the envelope ratios enable us to synthesize HF envelope, once LF envelope is available up to near 1 Hz. To confirm the method, we synthesize HF (> 1 Hz) ground motion for two M7 target earthquakes that occurred near Kanto area, Japan, using observed LF (< 1 Hz) ground motion. The synthesized HF ground motion well reproduces the observed ground motion of the target earthquakes, in terms of the S-wave amplitudes and the envelope shapes. Furthermore, we extended the method for M8 class earthquakes, and apply it to a broadband ground motion simulation for the 2003 Tokachi-oki, Japan, earthquake (MW8.0), using LF ground motion computed by a finite-difference method based on the source and velocity structure models of Aoi et al. (2008).\nThe method has the potential to be used as a practical method for broadband ground motion prediction that is consistent with observation and computationally costless, on the condition that LF ground motion is computed by a deterministic approach based on a realistic underground velocity structure model and appropriate source models.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane to the atmosphere. Although they cover only 4-6% of earth’s surface, wetlands contribute 20-39% of global methane emissions. Hollow aerenchyma tissues inside the roots, stems and leaves of plants represent one of the most important methane emission pathways for wetlands. Up to 90% of the emitted methane can diffuse through these hollow tissues that directly connect the atmosphere to the anoxic soils where methane is generated. Thus, concentrations of methane surrounding plant roots directly impact the amount of methane emitted by wetlands. Methane concentrations are controlled by a variety of microbial processes occurring in the soil around the roots of plants (aka the rhizosphere). The rhizosphere is a microbial hotspot sustained by plant inputs of organic carbon and oxygen; plant roots exude excess organic carbon generated in photosynthesis into the rhizosphere and atmospheric oxygen diffuses down to the rhizosphere through the hollow aerenchyma tissues. This environment supports a variety of microbial communities that compete with each other for available carbon and oxygen, including methanogens, methanotrophs, and heterotrophs. Methanogens ferment organic carbon into methane, a reaction that is inhibited by oxygen; methanotrophs use oxygen to oxidize methane into carbon dioxide; and heterotrophs use oxygen to oxidize organic carbon into carbon dioxide. We are interested in understanding how competition between these communities alters methane concentrations and responds to variations in plant inputs. To this end, we have developed a mechanistic root-scale model that describes microbial competition for organic carbon and oxygen in the rhizosphere of wetland plants. Our results focus on variations in rates of methane production, methane oxidation, heterotrophic respiration, and diffusion of methane into plant roots as a result of changes in carbon and oxygen inputs. The study provides insight into how plant-mediated emission of methane may change in the future as plant inputs of carbon and oxygen respond to potential altered climate conditions and alter microbial competition around the roots of wetland plants.",

            "abstract": "Students of field-based geology must master a suite of challenging skills from recognizing rocks, to measuring orientations of features in the field, to finding oneself (and the outcrop) on a map and placing structural information on maps. Students must then synthesize this information to derive meaning from the observations and ultimately to determine the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the deformed structures and their kinematic history. Synthesizing this kind of information requires sophisticated visualizations skills in order to extrapolate observations into the subsurface or missing (eroded) material. The good news is that students can learn 3D visualization skills through practice, and virtual tools can help provide some of that practice. Here I present a suite of learning modules focused at developing students’ ability to imagine (visualize) complex 3D structures and their exposure through digital topographic surfaces. Using the software 3DVisualizer, developed by KeckCAVES (keckcaves.org) we have developed visualizations of common geologic structures (e.g., syncline, dipping fold) in which the rock is represented by originally flat-lying layers of sediment, each with a different color, which have been subsequently deformed. The exercises build up in complexity, first focusing on understanding the structure in 3D (penetrative understanding), and then moving to the exposure of the structure at a topographic surface. Individual layers can be rendered as a transparent feature to explore how the layer extends above and below the topographic surface (e.g., to follow an eroded fold limb across a valley). The exercises are provided using either movies of the visualization (which can also be used for examples during lectures), or the data and software can be downloaded to allow for more self-driven exploration and learning. These virtual field models and exercises can be used as “practice runs” before going into the field, as make-up assignments, as a field experience in regions without good geologic outcrops, or for students with disabilities that prevent them from going into the field. These exercises and modules are available from 3dgeostructuresvis.ucdavis.edu. We plan to add several new structures to the site each year.

            "abstract": "Seismology allows for direct observational constraints on the interior structures of stars and planets. Recent observations of Saturn's ring system have revealed the presence of density waves within the rings excited by oscillation modes within Saturn, allowing for precise measurements of a limited set of the planet's mode frequencies. We construct interior structure models of Saturn, compute the corresponding mode frequencies, and compare them with the observed mode frequencies. The fundamental mode frequencies of our models match the observed frequencies (of the largest amplitude waves) to an accuracy of roughly 1%, confirming that these waves are indeed excited by Saturn's f-modes. The presence of the lower amplitude waves (finely split in frequency from the f-modes) can only be reproduced in models containing gravity modes that propagate in a stably stratified region of the planet. The stable stratification must exist deep within the planet near the large density gradients between the core and envelope. Our models cannot easily reproduce the observed fine splitting of the m=3 modes, suggesting that additional effects (e.g., significant latitudinal differential rotation) may be important.",

            "abstract": "The area of Western Alaska including the Selawik National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) is generally underrepresented in terms of permafrost thermal monitoring. Thus, the main objective of this study was to establish a permafrost monitoring network in Western Alaska in order to understand the spatial variability in permafrost thermal regime in the area and to have a baseline in order to detect future change. Present and future thawing of permafrost in the region will have a dramatic effect on the ecosystems and infrastructure because the permafrost here generally has a high ice content, as a result of preservation of old ground ice in these relatively cold regions even during the warmer time intervals of the Holocene. Over the summers of 2011 and 2012 a total of 26 automated monitoring stations were established to collect temperature data from the active layer and near-surface permafrost. While most of these stations were basic and only measured the temperature down to 1.5 m at 4 depths, three of the stations had higher vertical temperature resolution down to 3 m. The sites were selected using an ecotype (basic vegetation groups) map of very high resolution (30 m) that had been created for the area in 2009. We found the Upland Dwarf Birch-Tussock Shrub ecotype to be the coldest with a mean annual ground temperature at 1 meter (MAGT1.0) of -3.9 °C during the August 1st, 2012 to July 31st, 2013 measurement period. This is also the most widespread ecotype in the SNWR, covering approximately 28.4% by area. The next widespread ecotype in the SNWR is the Lowland and Upland Birch-Ericaceous Low Shrub. This ecotype had higher ground temperatures with an average MAGT1.0 of -2.4 °C during the same measurement period. We also found that within some ecotypes (White Spruce and Alder-Willow Shrub) the presence or absence of moss on the surface seems to indicate the presence or absence of near surface permafrost. In general, we found good agreement between ecotype classes and permafrost characteristics such as temperature, active layer thickness, and freeze back duration. Thus, we believe it might be possible to translate the ecotype map into a very high spatial resolution (30 m) permafrost map using our measurements. Such a map would be useful in decision making with respect to land use and understanding how the landscape might change under future climate scenarios.",

With a 12-year data record and daily, global observations in near real-time, we are finding that AIRS data can play a role in applications that fall under most of the NASA Applied Sciences focus areas. Currently in development are temperature inversion maps that can potentially correlate to respiratory health problems, dengue fever and West Nile virus outbreak prediction maps, maps that can be used to make assessments of air quality, and maps of volcanic ash burden. This poster will communicate the Project’s approach and efforts to date of its applications pipeline, which includes identifying applications, utilizing science expertise, hiring outside experts to assist with development and dissemination, visualization along application themes, and leveraging existing NASA data frameworks and organizations to facilitate archiving and distribution.

            "abstract": "Gibbs oscillations appear in global climate models when representing fields, such as orography, that contain discontinuities or sharp gradients. It has been known for decades that the oscillations are associated with the transformation of the truncated spectral representation of a field to physical space and that the oscillations can also be present in global models that do not use spectral methods. The spurious oscillations are potentially detrimental to model simulations (e.g., over ocean) and this work provides a quantitative characterization of the Gibbs oscillations that appear across the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models.\nAn ocean transect running through the South Pacific High toward the Andes is used to characterize the oscillations in ten different variables. These oscillations are found to be stationary and hence are not caused by (physical) waves in the atmosphere. We quantify the oscillation amplitude using the root mean square difference (RMSD) between the transect of a variable and its running mean (rather than the constant mean across the transect). We also compute the RMSD to interannual variability (IAV) ratio, which provides a relative measure of the oscillation amplitude.\nOf the variables examined, the largest RMSD values exist in the surface pressure field of spectral models, while the smallest RMSD values within the surface pressure field come from models that use finite difference (FD) techniques. Many spectral models have a surface pressure RMSD that is 2 to 15 times greater than IAV over the transect and an RMSD:IAV ratio greater than one for many other variables including surface temperature, incoming shortwave radiation at the surface, incoming longwave radiation at the surface, and total cloud fraction. In general, the FD models out-perform the spectral models, but not all the spectral models have large amplitude oscillations and there are a few FD models where the oscillations do appear. Finally, we present a brief comparison of the numerical methods of a select few models to better understand their Gibbs oscillations.",

            "abstract": "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is emerging as a major cause of the amphibian extinction. As amphibians serve an important role as indicator species in their ecosystem and play a vital role in the food chain, Bd will not only affect the amphibian population but also the health of the environment. Bd is an aquatic fungus that blocks the porous skin of amphibians which interrupts electrolyte, gas and water transfer. This imbalances the electrolyte system which causes cells and organs to malfunction, therefore killing the amphibian. While frogs are more common for Bd, it is not often found in newts. However, Dr. Vance Vredenburg recently found an outbreak of Bd in Taricha torosa in Marin Headlands, California. This location was used in the research as the sample site with most human impact and was expected to have the highest prevalence according to the proposed hypothesis that more human impact will correspond with a higher prevalence of Bd. Decreasing the level of human impact, Fairfield Osborn Preserve and Galbreath Preserve were picked as the other sample sites. After the samples went through qPCR, all of them came back negative for Bd. These results did not support the hypothesis, however, it contributed data to explaining the dynamics of Bd when combined with Dr. Vance Vredenburg’s data from 2 months earlier. Within the two months, there was a huge difference in the prevalence of Bd as it dropped from 88% to 0%. This shows that Taricha torosa does in fact get Bd. However, it is rarely detected because Bd is fast-acting and has high mortality rates. Therefore, it is least likely for current nonspecific surveys to swab the newts during a short but lethal Bd outbreak.",

Obara, 2008). Earthquakes that occurred off the bright area of the array (30°- 85°with respect to the array center) will be ignored. Once a large seismic event is identified successfully, back-projection will be implemented to trace the source propagation and energy radiation. Results from extended global GRiD-MT and real time W phase inversion will be combined for the better identification of large seismic events. \nThe time required is mainly due to the travel time from the epicenter to the array stations, so we can get the results between 6 to 13 min depending on the epicenter distances.

            "abstract": "Depleted oil and gas reserves have abandoned wellbore densities up to 10 per square kilometer (Crow, 2010). These locations are considered to have favorable geological structure and properties for CO2 sequestration. To understand the risk of CO2 leakage along these abandoned wellbores requires the simulation of a comprehensive set of realizations encompassing the potential scenarios. The simulations must capture transient, 3D, multi-phase effects (i.e. supercritical, liquid, and gas CO2 phases along with liquid reservoir and aquifer fluids), and include capillary and buoyant flow. Performing a large number of these simulations becomes computationally burdensome. In order to reduce this computational burden, regression approaches have been used to develop computationally efficient reduced order models to try to capture the general trends of the simulations. In these approaches, model inputs and outputs are collected from the transient simulations at each time step. Recognizing that many of the inputs to the regression approach come from time series (i.e. pressures and CO2 saturations) and that all of the outputs are time series (i.e. CO2 and brine flow rates), we develop a time-series matching approach. In this approach, CO2 and brine flow rate time series are estimated given input time series and parameters by averaging the flow rates of the collected simulations weighted by the similarity of their input time series and parameter. Similarity of both time series and parameters is calculated by the Euclidean distance. Euclidean distances are converted to a generalized likelihood metric, and used to weight the flow-rate time-series averages. We present a comparison of this time series matching approach to the MARS algorithm.",

The topography-based spatial structure is being applied in the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) to represent spatial heterogeneity influenced by topography, soil, and vegetation. In this study, different methods to represent subgrid land surface heterogeneity are explored.

Several recent studies have highlighted the important role of the convection electric field in controlling the formation of these structures but there is still much to be learned about their detailed dynamics. Recent construction of a mid-latitude array of SuperDARN radars combined with the increasingly dense coverage of GPS receivers provides new possibilities to monitor how the convection electric field controls the dynamics of polar cap plasma structures over much wider spatial areas than was previously possible. Specifically, it is now possible to make continuous observations of convection electric fields and total electron content (TEC) at mid-latitudes in the region where the SED first appears, through the dayside auroral zone and cusp as the TOI evolves, and then into the polar cap where patches are formed and transported anti-sunward toward the nightside. Here, we present several recent event periods during which combined GPS-SuperDARN measurements were able to continuously monitor the formation and dynamics of the TOI and polar cap patch formation for several hours. In particular, we discuss the precise conditions under which the TOI and patches do or do not form and the controlling role of the convection electric field in modulating their dynamics.",

            "abstract": "NOAA and CIRES scientists have used Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for the measurement of trace gases involved in climate change since 2005, including both high altitude-long endurance (HALE UAS: NASA Altair & Global Hawk) and 1-m wingspan, small UAS (sUAS: SkyWisp, Aero). These gases include nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), methane (CH4), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), and water vapor (H2O). In particular, atmospheric N2O is the third strongest greenhouse gas (326 parts-per-billion, ppb) and is the largest increasing stratospheric ozone depleting gas in terms of future emissions (~4 Tg N2O-N yr-1), primarily from fertilizer use. Atmospheric SF6, another potent greenhouse gas, is present globally at 8.2 parts-per-trillion (ppt) and growing at a rate of 0.25 ppt yr-1, and is used primarily in electrical power distribution. It is an excellent indicator of transport timescales (e.g., mean age) in the troposphere and stratosphere, because of its source distribution (~95% emitted in NH), long atmospheric lifetime (~600-3200 yr), and large relative atmospheric growth rate (~3%). We have developed atmospheric instrumentation for HALE platforms using a two-channel gas chromatograph with an ozone photometer and a water vapor tunable diode laser spectrometer. We are currently investigating a sUAS glider (SkyWisp) for balloon-assisted high altitude flights (30 km) and propeller driven sUAS (Aero) as a test bed for a new autopilot (Pixhawk, 3DRobotics). Our motivation for utilizing this autopilot is a low cost, open source autopilot alternative that can be used to return AirCore samples from high altitude balloons for quick laboratory analysis. The goal is a monitoring program to understand transport changes as a result of climate change during different seasons at many locations from a balloon-borne package (Moore et al., BAMS, pp. 147-155, Jan. 2014). The glider version of our open source autopilot system is also being considered for a future aerosol and trace gas study, called GOAHEAD (Gao et al., Fall Meeting 2014).\nFigure-1 Collage of UAS platforms used left to right, including NASA Altair during NOAA 2005 Demo, NASA Global Hawk during ATTREX in 2014, SkyWisp (SwRI), and Aero (3DRobotics).",

            "abstract": "Between 2005 and 2013, annual surveys of water properties in the upper 700 m between Ellesmere Island and the North Pole were performed each spring as part of the Arctic Switchyard Program. Although there was not a formal Switchyard field program in 2014, the time series was extended to this year with reduced coverage from a combination of stations taken as part of the SCICEX and NPEO programs. The water property measurements were obtained from hydrographic stations taken from aircraft that landed on the sea ice along a line extending between Alert on Ellesmere Island and the North Pole, hydrographic stations taken to the east and west of this line, and moorings located on the shelf and slope regions of Ellesmere Island. Here we report on the measurements made primarily along the north-south section. One of the major objectives of the Switchyard program is to measure changes in the freshwater (FW) inventory and composition in this region. Freshwater inventories were determined from CTD salinity measurements, and the fractions of the primary components of Freshwater [Meteoric Water (MW), Pacific Freshwater (PFW), and Sea Ice Melt Water (SIMW)] were determined by applying the Optimum Multiparameter Analysis method to the temperature, salinity, delta O-18, dissolved oxygen, phosphate and nitrate measurements. During the time of the program there were major changes in the large-scale upper water circulation and in melting of sea ice. In 2009 the Beaufort Gyre weakened, expelling accumulated freshwater, then returned to its stronger state a couple of years later. In 2007 and 2012 there were major sea ice melting events resulting in new record minima of September sea ice extent. The FW inventory along the North Pole – Ellesmere Island line reached a maximum for the study period in 2009 with the increase driven by an increase in MW from 2007 to 2008 and an increase in SIMW between 2008 and 2009. The FW inventory then decreased until 2011 and was roughly constant through 2013. In 2013, MW was at a maximum for the study period and was the dominant freshwater component for most of the section; PFW and SIMW were at their lowest value for the study period and there was no evidence of input from the 2012 sea ice melting event. The 2014 data, which may show shifts in these distributions, is currently being analyzed and will be presented with the earlier data.",

            "abstract": "Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) develops the probability density function of the forecast variable given the predictions of different models. It applies a linear weighted average to the posterior distributions of individual models to characterize the uncertainty induced by model structures in hydro-climatologic predictions. In the original form of BMA, the posterior distribution of forecast given each model prediction is assumed to be a particular probability distribution (e.g. normal, gamma, etc.). The weight and variance of each conditional PDF is approximated with an iterative Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM) over a calibration period. In this presentation, we demonstrate the integration of a group of multivariate functions, the so-called copula functions, to approximate the posterior distribution of forecast given individual model predictions. Here we introduce a copula-embedded BMA (Cop-BMA) method that skips the iterative procedure in the EM algorithm and also relaxes any assumptions about the shape of conditional PDFs. Both BMA and Cop-BMA are applied to hydrologic forecasts from different rainfall-runoff and land-surface models. We consider the streamflow observation and simulations of ten river basins provided by the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) project. Results demonstrate that the predictive distributions are generally overconfident and have insufficient spread after BMA application. In contrast, the post-processed forecasts by Cop-BMA are more accurate and reliable. In addition, Cop-BMA outperforms BMA in the river basins with poor initial forecasts (e.g., dry regions).",

            "abstract": "The mitigation of induced seismicity is a challenge for a sustained production of unconventional hydrocarbons involving waste water disposal and of geothermal power production where large volumes of fluid are circulated in the subsurface. Large pore pressure perturbations localize where fluid flow is limited by the pre-existing joint set. It drives deformation that – if it occurs in brittle mode – manifests as seismicity leading to dilation of the reactivated fracture network. Therefore, induced seismicity is a process which is accompanied by permeability creation.\nIn many geothermal systems, seismicity is deliberately induced to enhance the reservoir. Experience collected at the EGS at Soultz-sous-Forêts, France has revealed evidence for a large proportion of the induced deformation to be aseismic. Indicators are temporally resolved velocity changes, changes of the stress tensor resolved from inversion of focal mechanisms and direct observation of large slip at wellbores. Furthermore, seismic multiplets, i.e. repeated slippage of asperities with considerable slip accumulation, have been observed not only in Soultz-sous-Forêts but also at other similar systems like in Basel, Switzerland and Landau, Germany. Displacement in the order of up to 0.1 m has been inferred from these observations, which is about one order of magnitude larger than what was observed seismically.\nTo explain this discrepancy we propose a conceptual model of creep-dominated aseismic deformation that is promoted through elevated pore pressures. While few asperities of the pre-existing fracture network experience repeated brittle deformation evidenced as multiple seismic events, the majority of the fault surface is in a subcritical creeping stage. Elevated pore pressure brings them closer to the failure criterion which can enhance the ductile deformation by several orders of magnitude. Relaxation leads to large-scale deformation accompanied by a strong reduction of differential stresses.",

            "abstract": "Currently available calibration standards for LA-ICPMS analysis for a wide range of trace elements in sulphide minerals include hydrothermally-precipitated Fe-Cu-Zn-S powder doped with trace metals MASS-1 [1] and Li borate glass STDGL-2 [2]. Both of them are not ideal due to a limited range of elements they contain and/or non-homogenous distribution and low concentrations of elements. MASS-1 suffers from a limited range of elements and poor homogeneity, whereas STDGL-2 has low and/or unevenly distributed volatile elements and precious metals (e.g. Se, Te, Tl, Pt, Au). In order to produce a better calibration standard, we have experimented with fusing sulphide mineral mixes in a variety of borate-based fluxes. A range of flux compositions, heating and cooling regimes and times at high temperatures have been tested in order to produce a homogeneous glass disk with an appropriate proportion of sulphide, while retaining volatile elements.\nBest results were achieved with using Li tetraborate as a flux with Na nitrate as an oxidizing agent by fusing with an LPG fluxer (M4 by Claisse). Selenium, tellurium and tin were added in the elemental form, whereas thallium was added as carbonate (Tl2CO3). A range of elements was added to provide capability for detecting known common interferences on chalcophile and siderophile elements (e.g. Gd, Hf, Ta, W, Zr, Sr). New standard glass STDGL-3 contains homogeneously distributed volatile elements (Se, Te, Tl, Sn) and precious metals (Au, Pt). A larger proportion of volatile elements was retained (100% Ge, 80% Re, 70% Te, 60% Sn, 20% Tl, 20% Se). Most problematic elements turned out to be Se and Tl, which volatilize together through a network of narrow zones, and Pt and Au, which form micro inclusions. Suitability of the new standard for LA-ICPMS analysis of sulphide minerals for trace element concentrations and Pb isotopes will be demonstrated.\n[1] Wilson et al., 2002.

            "abstract": "Traditional time series methods model the evolution of the underlying process as a linear or nonlinear function of the autocorrelation. These methods capture the distributional statistics but are incapable of providing insights into the dynamics of the process, the potential regimes, and predictability. This work develops a nonlinear dynamical model for stochastic simulation of streamflows. In this, first a wavelet spectral analysis is employed on the flow series to isolate dominant orthogonal quasi periodic timeseries components. The periodic bands are added denoting the ‘signal’ component of the time series and the residual being the ‘noise’ component. Next, the underlying nonlinear dynamics of this combined band time series is recovered. For this the univariate time series is embedded in a d-dimensional space with an appropriate lag T to recover the state space in which the dynamics unfolds. Predictability is assessed by quantifying the divergence of trajectories in the state space with time, as Lyapunov exponents. The nonlinear dynamics in conjunction with a K-nearest neighbor time resampling is used to simulate the combined band, to which the noise component is added to simulate the timeseries. We demonstrate this method by applying it to the data at Lees Ferry that comprises of both the paleo reconstructed and naturalized historic annual flow spanning 1490-2010. We identify interesting dynamics of the signal in the flow series and epochal behavior of predictability. These will be of immense use for water resources planning and management.",

Inundation area in Japan, Taiwan, and Kyrgyz is almost unchanged. At the same time, that in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Laos, and Myanmar reached about 1.4-1.6 times compared to present.

            "abstract": "The Röthlisberger channel (R­-channel) is a commonly adopted model that balances creep closure by Nye 2D in-plane straining, driven by the ice overburden pressure, against the melt rate from viscous energy dissipation in turbulent flow within the channel. Perol and Rice (AGU abstr. C11B-0677, 2011; JGR 2014 in review) and Suckale et al. (JGR F003008, 2014) have conjectured that these R-Channels may exist at the beds of rapidly straining West Antarctic Ice Stream shear margins. That is expected as a result of melt generation and drainage from forming temperate ice, and the channels may interact through the bed hydrology to partially stabilize the shear margin against lateral expansion. However, at those locations the overburden stresses, driving in-plane flow, are supplemented by substantial anti­-plane shear stresses. Similarly, R-channels in mountain glaciers are also subject to both in-plane and anti-plane stresses. These channels usually form in the downstream direction, where anti-plane shear effects arise horizontally from drag at lateral moraines and vertically from the downslope gravity component. Here we examine how superposed anti-plane loading can alter results of the Nye solution for a 2D R-­channel. We use a combination of perturbation analyses and finite element methods, varying the amount of applied anti-plane stress. A closed-form solution is derived for imposing a small anti-plane perturbation, which has no effect at linear order on the Nye closure rate. Such effects become strong at more substantial perturbations, and the in­plane stress and strain fields are then significantly altered from the Nye solution. We further extend our model to compute channel size in terms of the external stressing and flow rate. Understanding the effect of the ice flow on channel size and formation is important to subglacial hydrology, as well as a potentially vital component for our understanding of the formation and motion of ice streams found in West Antarctica.",

Peatlands are believed to contain about 277 Pg of the total 1670 Pg stored in permafrost soils. In the discontinuous permafrost zone, the thawing of permafrost causes thermokarst features, leading to a succession from forested peat plateaus to non-forested sphagnum bogs. The changes in organic matter accumulation and deep carbon decomposition rates following thaw in permafrost peatlands could have an important impact on the climate system. We measured the total carbon content of peat cores along a thaw chronosequence from forested permafrost peat plateau to collapse-scar bogs. Four transect of four cores each were collected to expose the variations in carbon content at the collapse-scar feature scale as well as at the catchment scale. Loss on ignition, bulk density, carbon content of the organic matter and radiocarbon dating data reveal variability in the response of the total carbon content with time. Contrary to previous studies of this type, preliminary results do not seem to indicate an initial raise in total carbon stock following thaw. The increase in surface peat accumulation of this peatland seems to be largely offset by an increase in deep carbon loss from anaerobic decomposition.",

These applications are sometimes developed by large organizations with significant budgets, and at other times by graduate students or professors with short-term grant money and little else. Because of this wide variance in environments, these applications are rarely consistent in their approach to testing, hosting, presentation of information, and approach to maintenance. Many of these applications also continually re-invent solutions to common problems such as bug tracking, collaboration, source code management, user support and feedback, and deployment of new features.\nThe Earthdata Code Collaborative (https://ecc.earthdata.nasa.gov, typically referred to as the ECC) provides a unified and consistent environment for Earth Science application development, whether an application is developed by a team of 10, 50, or even 1. By using commercial products such as the Atlassian suite of tools (https://www.atlassian.com) and custom APIs, the ECC allows Earth Science applications to focus on science rather than infrastructure and tooling.\nThis session will detail the process by which the Earthdata Code Collaborative was developed, as well as the initial requirements that drove its inception. It will go on to demonstrate the current state of the ECC, and explore how bringing on applications–both internal to Earthdata and external–has shaped its requirements and implementation.

            "abstract": "Phenocryst textures were observed to investigate elementary steps of magma mixing processes, using the andesite samples from two western Pacific island arcs; northern Honshu, Japan, and West Java, Indonesia. Andesite from Chokai volcano in northern Honshu was extensively investigated to determine endmember compositions from glass inclusion compositions, mineral compositions, and whole-rock compositions. Reversely zoned pyroxene phenocrysts coexist with normally zoned ones. Every reversely zoned pyroxene crystal consists of a magnesium-poor core that is rounded or irregular in shape and a more-magnesian, normally zoned margin. The margin exhibits concentric oscillatory zoning with broad normal zoning, implying overgrowth in a chemically fluctuating mixing magma. The thicknesses of margins vary crystal by crystal, and the chemical compositions of innermost margins are well correlated with the thicknesses, indicating that the commencement timing of overgrowth is different on every crystal. Most of normally zoned pyroxene exhibit identical characteristics with the margins of reversely zoned pyroxenes. Therefore, these normally zoned pyroxene crystals started growing in the chemically fluctuating magma, or during magma mingling, although magnesian cores of some normally zoned pyroxenes might be derived from mafic basalt endmember magma. Plagioclase phenocrysts exhibit very similar characteristics with the pyroxenes, involving coexistence of reversely zoned crystals and normally zoned crystals. Margins of reversely zoned crystals exhibit oscillatory bands with broad normal zoning, which is the identical occurrence with most of normally zoned plagioclase. Every core of reversely zoned plagioclase exhibits a resorption texture including dusty zoning. These crystal textures occur in mixed andesite from all examined volcanoes in two island arcs, implying that the formation of the textures is ubiquitous regardless of distance from volcanic fronts. The textures record the elementary steps of magma mixing involving resorption of felsic magma and crystallization in cooled mafic magma during thermal equilibration after the encounter, and oscillatory zoning produced by chemical fluctuation during traveling in heterogeneous mingling magma.",

Airborne measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at high spatio-temporal resolution (0.1 s or 10 m) improve our capabilities in characterizing primary emissions from fires and in studying chemical transformations in aging plumes.\nA biomass-burning plume from a forest understory fire was intercepted by the NASA P-3B near Dublin, GA, USA on September 29, 2013. VOCs were measured at high time resolution along with CO, CO2, NOx, O3, HCHO, aerosols and other air quality and meteorological parameters. Repeated measurements in the immediate proximity of the fire were used to determine VOC emission ratios and their temporal variations. Repeated longitudinal and transversal plume transects were carried out to study plume aging within the first hour of emission. We will discuss the observed OH-NOx-VOC chemistry (including O3 formation), the observed changes in the elemental composition of VOCs (e.g. O:C ratios) and the observed formation of SOA.",

            "abstract": "Because of limited filtration and turbulent flow, karst aquifers are more susceptible to microbial contamination than clastic aquifers. Assessment of microbial transport in groundwater is complicated by the need to identify tracers that have a low detection limit, have minimal background concentrations, behave like the organisms of interest, and are non-pathogenic. We are assessing transport of two non-pathogenic isolates of Escherichia coli (E. coli) compared to traditional groundwater tracers in epikarst above Cave Springs Cavern near Bowling Green, KY, and in a karst conduit that emerges at Royal Spring in Georgetown, KY. The E. coli isolate exhibiting higher attachment efficiency in saturated granular columns contains the iha gene, while the isolate exhibiting lower attachment efficiency contains the kps gene. For the field experiments, bacteria are being grown on media enriched in 13C or 15N. Isotopically-tagged bacteria will be injected with rhodamine WT as a solute tracer and fluorescent microspheres as an abiotic particulate tracer. We will monitor breakthrough of the tracers in the cave and at the spring; based on a previous field test, we anticipate that particulate tracers may be remobilized during subsequent storm events. E. coli will be quantified by molecular methods (qPCR) and dual isotope analysis. Preliminary findings suggest that these two methods may be complementary, with each method having detection limitations.",

            "abstract": "Late Quaternary climate is characterized by millennial-scale abrupt climatic changes namely Dansgaard-Oeschger Cycles. Such millennial-scale changes are faithfully recorded in the Japan Sea sediments as alternation of dark and light colored silty clay, and the relationship between the millennial-scale variability and orbitally-driven changes in ice volume has been explored. On the other hand, presence of similar millennial-scale changes was reported from the Middle Miocene alternations of dark and light colored siliceous rocks in the Onnnagawa Formation, Northeastern Japan.\nBecause large, unstable ice sheet was present during the Late Quaternary and the Middle Miocene, it is suggested that such millennial-scale variability and waxing and waning of unstable ice sheet could be interrelated. Thus, it is important to specify the cyclicity and the amplitude variability of millennial-scale cycles during the Middle Miocene to understand the underlying mechanism and the ultimate cause.\nThe Middle Miocene Onnagawa Formation is known as bedded siliceous rocks equivalent to the Monterey Formation, California. Tada (1991) demonstrated that its cm-scale dark-light colored alternations reflected millennial-scale variability. However, the timing, periodicity, and duration of the millennial-scale variability are not fully understood. Thus, we aim to clarify when the millennial-scale variability became distinct and faded out, and examine its possible association with ice volume changes.\nWe conducted a field survey in the Yashima area, Akita, Northeastern Japan to reconstruct a continuous sedimentary record throughout the Middle Miocene, and constructed the age model based on biostratigraphy. In addition, we identified cyclic changes in lithology, and applied cyclostratigraphy to produce the high-resolution age model. Based on this age model, we attempt correlation with δ18O curve to examine the relationship between cyclicity of δ18O changes and occurrence of millennial-scale variability.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is profoundly impacting permafrost regions and reshaping carbon rich tundra ecosystems from carbon sinks to potential carbon sources triggering a positive feedback to climate change. The annual maximum depth of ice-free soil with above 0°C temperatures, which is known as the active-layer thickness (ALT), determines the volume of carbon-rich stores available for decomposition and therefore potential greenhouse gas release into the atmosphere. Despite the increased vulnerability of permafrost regions to climate change, predictive tools and precise parameterization of physical characteristics to estimate projected ALT in tundra ecosystems have been developed slowly and often are not adequately representing natural systems due to the complex nature of corresponding atmospheric-surface-subsurface hydrological and energy interactions undergoing freeze-thaw dynamics. A model-observation-experiment process (ModEx) is employed to generate three 1D models representing characteristic micro-topographical land-formations, which are capable of simulating present ALT from current climate conditions. Observational soil temperature data from a tundra site located near Barrow, AK is used to calibrate thermal properties of moss, peat, and sandy loam soil to be used in the multiphysics Arctic Terrestrial Simulator (ATS) models. In the process of calibration and model formulation key physical processes and appropriate model parameters are identified, which showcases the importance of correctly representing physical processes and reformulating models based on observational data. Iterative execution of the ModEx concept identified key processes that control thermal propagation into the subsurface: 1) physical representation of thermal conduction, 2) liquid, ice, and gas partitioning in the subsurface, 3) snowpack distribution and dynamics, and 4) precipitation delivery of water to the surface/subsurface.

            "abstract": "The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) system is involved in hydrological cycle, and latent heat and energy transport, thus plays a significant role in global climate system. Observation records of the precipitation (~50-year long) are not long enough to reveal the frequency and extremity of the EASM precipitation. Therefore, quantitative reconstruction of the past precipitation changes using geological records is necessary.\n The δ18O of seawater (δ18Ow), an indirect indicator of sea surface salinity, in the northern East China Sea (ECS) is reconstructed for the last 7 kyr using paired Mg/Ca ratio and δ18O of planktic foraminiferal tests. According to modern observation, inter-annual variations in sea surface salinity during summer in the northern part of the ECS are mainly controlled by the discharge from the Yangtze River, which reflects summer rainfall in the drainage area of the Yangtze River. Thus, changes in the summer sea surface salinity in the northern ECS are interpreted as reflecting variations in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation in South China. This interpretation is confirmed by the relationship between salinity in the northern ECS and the discharge from the Yangtze River during wet season (May-October) based on the observational salinity data from 1951 to 1995.\n We calculate a fraction of the Yangtze River freshwater by using two endmembers, freshwater δ18O and seawater δ18O. During the last 7 ky, the freshwater fraction varies between 5% and 0% on multi-centennial to millennial–scale. However, there is no long-term trend from the middle Holocene that is commonly known in Chinese speleothem δ18O. Our record suggests that changes in summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere do not seem to impact on changes in summer precipitation in the Yangtze Basin. Instead, other factors such as inter-seasonal migration speed of the monsoon front likely control on the precipitation in the Yangtze Basin even in the long time scale.",

            "abstract": "Constructed wetland systems (CWS) have been developed to remove nutrients from secondarily treated water, but little is known about their long-term contributions on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), especially in arid regions. To increase our knowledge of ecosystem dynamics of CWS in arid regions, we are investigating N2O, CH4, and CO2 fluxes from a system perspective, a vegetated-shoreline to open-water gradient, and from the wetland plant Typha spp. From 2012 to 2014, we utilized the floating chamber technique to collect fluxes from two transects (nearest to inflow and nearest to outflow) and along two gradient subsites (shoreline and open-water) within the transects. Recently, we began collecting direct fluxes from the vegetation by deploying gas chambers on Typha spp. Fluxes were analyzed using the HMR procedure (Package HMR in R) developed for trace-gas flux estimations when using static chambers. We found significantly higher CH4 and CO2 fluxes in the summer and spring compared to fall and winter months. From the whole system perspective, we found significantly greater CO2 fluxes at the inflow compared to the outflow transect. From the shoreline to open-water gradient, N2O fluxes were significantly greater in the open-water and, CH4 fluxes where significantly greater in the vegetated shoreline subsite. These differences may be explained by the presence of vegetation, differences of water column height, or higher nitrate levels in the open-water compared to the shoreline. Results from the vegetation chambers will be presented from two heights of the Typha spp. leaves from plants in each of the four subsites. The analysis of the 288 fluxes using two HMR procedures, default classification (linear, non-linear, and no flux) and the linear regression, resulted in similar seasonal and spatial patterns in the flux estimates. However, the default classification calculated on average 31% for N2O, 67% for CH4, and 34% for CO2 higher flux estimates relative to the fluxes estimated only by linear regression. Our results highlight the importance of weather conditions, vegetation, and nutrient loading on GHG fluxes in a CWS. Finally, it is important to establish long-term ecosystem-wide studies and at the same time, maintain a constant evaluation of analytical methods available for calculating GHG flux estimates.",

Using HyTES we have developed robust and reliable techniques for the detection and high resolution mapping of small scale plumes of anthropogenic (oil and gas fields, landfills, dairies) and non-anthropogenic (natural seeps) sources of methane in the state of California and Colorado. A background on the HyTES sensor, science objectives, gas detection methods, and examples of mapping fugitive methane plumes in California and Colorado will be discussed. These kind of observational efforts and studies will help address critical science questions related to methane budgets and management of future emissions in California and other regions.",

Due to advances in technology, the environmental sciences are more commonly taking measurements from continuous processes, and sample measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) from snow pillows are one such example. Snow pillows provide daily samples from the continuous SWE yearly profile if SWE measurements are viewed as a continuous function of time. We examine the dominant modes of variation in the timing of snowpack events using functional principal component analysis. Additionally, we examine the associations between the dominant modes of variation with large-scale climate indices and spatial location.",

            "abstract": "The magnetic properties of rocks are affected by geomagnetic fields, heat and shearing stresses after formation. The shear stress associated with tectonic stress, for example, from a fault, can cause magnetic domain­-wall displacement. The wall displacement is thought to reflect the magnetic domain structure. Therefore, the hysteresis of strain, which rocks are subjected to in fault movements, can be used to estimate the structural disturbances of the magnetic domain. Previous studies have shown that the stress effect on magnetic domains can be observed by using industrial and synthetic materials, such as Si–Fe alloys (Chikazumi & Suzuki, 1995). However, few studies have used natural geological materials to study the effect of stress on magnetic domains. This study’s objective is to verify the shear stress history of rocks by observing the magnetic domain structures via the Bitter method and magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Here, the Bitter method is the powder pattern method, whereby a colloidal suspension of the magnetic powder is prepared from magnetic materials, and the patterns of the domain wall produced by ferromagnetic particles are observed under a microscope. On observing the domain structures of industrial and synthetic materials, the remnant stress on the surface layer is removed after mechanical polishing (Hoffmann et al., 1987) because the remnant stress influences the domain structures. There are several technical problems during the observation of rocks compared with those during observation of industrial and synthetic materials. Electrolytical polishing does not work because the electrical conductivity is very low (e.g., Hoffmann et al., 1987). In previous studies of the observation of magnetic domains of rock minerals, the surface strain layer was removed by polishing with colloidal silica (Ozdemir, 1995,etc). In this study, we will attempt to conduct a verification experiment and observations of the magnetic domain structures in natural minerals of rocks, and would like to discuss the relationship between the shear stress and magnetic domain structures. Here, the polishing method was according to Hoffmann et al. (1987), and the magnetic domain was observed by the Bitter method and MFM. As a result, we can observe the magnetic domain walls, and each domain wall has a spacing of 3-5 μm.",

            "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as intermediates in a myriad of biogeochemically important processes, including cell signaling pathways, cellular oxidative stress responses, and the transformation of both nutrient and toxic metals such as iron and mercury. Abiotic reactions involving the photo-oxidation of organic matter were once considered the only important sources of ROS in the environment. However, the recent discovery of substantial biological ROS production in marine systems has fundamentally shifted this paradigm. Within the last few decades, marine phytoplankton, including diatoms of the genus Thalassiosira, were discovered to produce ample extracellular quantities of the ROS superoxide. Even more recently, we discovered widespread production of extracellular superoxide by phylogenetically and ecologically diverse heterotrophic bacteria at environmentally significant levels (up to 20 amol cell-1 hr-1), which has introduced the revolutionary potential for substantial “dark” cycling of ROS. Despite the profound biogeochemical importance of extracellular biogenic ROS, the cellular mechanisms underlying the production of this ROS have remained elusive. Through the development of a gel-based assay to identify extracellular ROS-producing proteins, we have recently found that enzymes typically involved in antioxidant activity also produce superoxide when molecular oxygen is the only available electron acceptor. For example, large (~3600 amino acids) heme peroxidases are involved in extracellular superoxide production by a bacterium within the widespread Roseobacter clade. In Thalassiosira spp., extracellular superoxide is produced by flavoproteins such as glutathione reductase and ferredoxin NADP+ reductase. Thus, extracellular ROS production may occur via secreted and/or cell surface enzymes that modulate between producing and degrading ROS depending on prevailing geochemical and/or ecological conditions.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires are a serious threat to life and property that has exacted greater costs in recent years, despite improving warning systems. In addition to local impacts, the smoke produced by wildfires and biomass burning can travel thousands of kilometers downwind, impacting visibility and health far from the source. Using the recently launched Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi-NPP satellite, this study investigates the adjustment of fire pixel selection criteria to include visible light signatures at night, allowing for greatly improved detection of smaller and cooler fires from satellite observations. VIIRS scenes with coincident Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) overpasses are examined by applying the operational VIIRS fire product algorithm, and including a modified “candidate fire pixel selection” approach, which lowers the 4 µm brightness temperature thresholds but includes a minimum DNB radiance. This approach is applied while leaving the contextual tests unchanged; to be flagged as fires, fire pixels must pass the existing operational tests that compare them to background temperatures. While the detection of small agricultural fires in the Central United States remain problematic because of the coarse spatial resolutions of the 750 meter (M)oderate resolution bands, a large increase in the number of detected fire pixels is observed with small non-agricultural wildfires. Quantitative use of the DNB to improve detection of these smaller fires could lead to reduced warning and response times as well as provide more accurate quantification of biomass burning emissions at night.",

            "abstract": "A number of climate archives have documented millennial-scale variability during the Holocene. It is not currently known whether these variations are forced or unforced. A solar forcing hypothesis has been put forward to explain the 1000 and 2500-year periodicities because of similarities between the spectral peaks in the proxy records and reconstructions of solar variability. Our work on a marine record of Mg/Ca-based sea surface temperatures (SSTs) within the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (core MD98-2181) challenges the solar hypothesis because there is no coherence between the amplitude of changes in solar forcing and in the proxy SSTs. There is also a long phase delay between the peak in forcing and the maximum response.\nOn the other hand, there exists the possibility that the deep ocean can drive some of the Holocene variability, especially at the 1500-year timescale. This periodicity is reminiscent of the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3) cycles. To evaluate whether the Holocene and MIS3 variability does in fact arise from the same mechanism, we start with the premise that climate variability from different parts of the globe should have similar relationships in the Holocene as they did in MIS3. However, this comparison is difficult because of the poor chronologic constraints inherent to proxy records. We circumvented this problem by using the benthic foraminifera δ18O from the same MD81 samples, which provides a record of deep ocean temperature and salinities. Since these conservative properties are acquired in the Southern Ocean, the MD81 benthic δ18O is a record of high southern latitude variability. Thus, MD81 allows us to investigate the relative timing of tropical and southern ocean variability from a single location. A time series analysis of the MD81 record shows that although the 1,500-year cycle is present during both the Holocene and MIS3, the phasing of tropical Pacific and Southern Ocean variability is different. During the Holocene, tropical Pacific warming precedes Southern Ocean warming/freshening but lags during MIS3, suggesting two distinct mechanisms for the Holocene and MIS3 cycles, perhaps one originating from high latitudes and the other from low latitudes.",

            "abstract": "Accurate quantification of surface snow-accumulation over Antarctica is important for mass balance estimates and climate studies based on ice core records. An improved estimate of surface mass balance must include the significant role near-surface wind plays in the sublimation and redistribution of snow across Antarctica. We have developed an empirical model based on airborne radar and lidar observations, and modeled surface mass balance and wind fields to produce a continent-wide prediction of wind-scour zones over Antarctica. These zones have zero to negative surface mass balance, are located over locally steep ice sheet areas (>0.002) and controlled by bedrock topography. The near-surface winds accelerate over these zones, eroding and sublimating the surface snow. This scouring results in numerous localized regions (≤ 200 km2) with reduced surface accumulation. Each year, tens of gigatons of snow on the Antarctic ice sheet are ablated by persistent near-surface katabatic winds over these wind-scour zones. Large uncertainties remain in the surface mass balance estimates over East Antarctica as climate models do not adequately represent the small-scale physical processes that lead to mass loss through sublimation or redistribution over the wind-scour zones.\nIn this study, we integrate Operation IceBridge's snow radar over the Recovery Ice Stream with a series of ice core dielectric and depth-density profiles for improved surface mass balance estimates that reflect the mass loss over the wind-scour zones. Accurate surface mass balance estimates from snow radars require spatially variable depth-density profiles. Using an ensemble of firn cores, MODIS-derived surface snow grain size, modeled accumulation rates and surface temperatures from RACMO2, we assemble spatially variable depth-density profiles and use our mapping of snow density variations to estimate layer mass and net accumulation rates from snow radar layer data. Our study improves the quantification of regional surface mass balance and should improve the mass balance rates using mass budget methods.",

            "abstract": "Protodunes are low-relief, slipfaceless migrating bed forms thought to represent fundamental emergent bed forms that develop from a flat bed of sand and evolve into dunes. Protodunes at White Sands Dune Field in New Mexico are found at the upwind margin of the field, on dune stoss slopes and in interdune areas. Here we used time-series aerial photos from 1996, 2003, 2005 and 2012 and digital elevation models from 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 in conjunction with ground penetrating radar (GPR) to characterize the morphodynamics of protodunes and the stratigraphy generated by protodune migration. Protodunes at the upwind margin of the dune field are larger in wavelength and amplitude and coarser grained than those in the interior of the field. Wind ripples cover protodunes in all areas of the field, but the protodunes at the upwind margin are covered by coarse grained ripples. A consistent progression of ripple patterns occurs over protodunes in which ripples coarsen in wavelength and grain size toward the protodune crest and then decrease in wavelength and grain size toward the troughs. Ripple migration across the protodunes appears to the primary mode by which the protodunes migrate. Trenching and GPR data show low-angle cross-stratification generated by wind ripples migrating down the protodune lee slope of the protodunes. Internal bounding surfaces within the protodunes likely arise from laterally migration and lee slope reactivation in response to the complex wind regime and dune-modified secondary flow within the dune field at White Sands. Understanding the morphology, distribution and genesis of protodunes in dune fields provides a basis to evaluate the significance of protodune strata in the rock record.",

The accessory minerals zircon, monazite [(LREE)PO4], and xenotime [(Y,HREE)PO4] are also present. We use ion microprobe 238U-230Th ages and trace-element geochemistry of unpolished rims and sectioned interiors of individual zircon and monazite grains to track differentiation of the silicic magma body. Core-to-rim zoning in zircon indicates that the parent melt became progressively enriched with U, HREEs, P, and Sc, and depleted in Th and LREEs due to monazite crystallization. Zircon (238U/232Th) values reach as high as 110 in the most differentiated rims. Monazite rims exhibit similar differentiation trends with lower LREE, higher M–HREEs, and higher U than crystal interiors, which eventually led to co-precipitation of monazite and xenotime. Monazite grains form a curved array on an activity ratio plot, with unpolished rims at the higher end. The unusual abundance of monazite, which can accommodate up to several weight percent Th, in the crystallizing assemblage significantly affected the U-Th ratio of the magma as differentiation progressed. 238U/232Th values ranges from 2.6 for early melt, represented by the whole-rock value, to 7.4 for groundmass glass. Assuming monazite fractionation alone is responsible for this change, it would take ~0.12 wt% monazite crystallization, using partition coefficients of 120 and 1000 for U and Th, respectively. This amount of monazite is consistent with that observed in the samples. An isochron for early melt and low-238U/232Th monazites yields an age of 67.0±2.8 ka, whereas one for late melt and high-238U/232Th monazites yields 42.5±0.9 ka. This younger age is indistinguishable from the laser single crystal 40Ar/39Ar age for sanidine of 41.1±2.3 ka. We interpret the apparent 25 k.y. crystallization interval to represent the assembly and differentiation timescale associated with the Hayes magma body.",

Earlier Ulysses observations have found that particles can be accelerated at both the forward and the reverse shocks that often form at a few AUs. The accelerated particles then propagate back to the Earth along Parker's field line. Theoretical calculations predicted a modulation of the spectrum at low energies, qualitatively agreed with obsevations at 1 AU. However, this picture was recently challenged by STEREO observations, where local accelerations near 1 AU were inferred in many events. In this work, we perform a detailed numerical calculation to study particle acceleration and transport in one CIR event which was observed by both ACE and STEREO spacecraft. We obtain particle currents at different heliocentric distances and different longitudes, as well as particle anisotropy. These values are compared with observations and the implication on the acceleration site and the interplanetary turbulence spectrum is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Global mean sea level (GMSL) has been rising since (at least) the 19th century and the rate of rise may be increasing. Several studies that attempt to explain variability of GMSL during the instrumental record share the common assumption that GMSL variability is deterministic in nature and different from natural variations. Here we show that GMSL variability can alternatively be explained, at least in part, as being caused by random variations and hence not having a deterministic origin. This internal variability, which adds to externally forced changes (e.g. through anthropogenic climate change), is a consequence of the integrated character of GMSL, which is the cumulative addition of temporal contributions that exhibit random character, and whose integration results in GMSL variations with persistence on decadal-centennial time scales. The generation of variability by integration of random stationary noise (i.e. even in a constant climate) is a robust and fundamental feature of stochastically forced systems with memory. The integrated character of GMSL results in an intrinsic difficulty in distinguishing internal from externally forced variations.",

            "abstract": "Downdip and along-strike changes in slip behavior at subduction zones are often attributed to changes in the properties of the megathrust. Here we review information on the subduction megathrust offshore of the Alaska Peninsula from MCS reflection and wide-angle seismic data acquired in 2011 during the Alaska Langseth Experiment to Understand the megaThrust (ALEUT) program, and compare them with constraints from other data and experiments. This region encompasses the full spectrum of coupling: 1) the weakly coupled Shumagin Gap; 2) the Semidi segment, which last ruptured in the 1938 M8.2 event, appears to be locked at present, and 3) the western Kodiak asperity, which marked the western extent of the 1964 M9.2 rupture and also appears to be locked.\nOur data reveal substantial along-strike variations in incoming sediment thickness and plate structure and along-strike and downdip variations in megathrust reflection characteristics. Over 1 km of sediment is observed on the incoming oceanic plate in the Semidi segment prior to subduction, and a relatively thick and continuous layer interpreted as subducted sediment can be imaged at the plate boundary here up to ~50 km from the trench . In the Shumagin Gap, where the incoming sediment section is half as thick and more pervasively faulted at the outer rise, a subducting sediment layer is also observed but it is thinner, less continuous and is not observed to continue as far from the trench. ,Although the Semidi segment is capable of producing great earthquakes, the comparatively thick sediment here may contribute to the relative paucity of seismicity compared with adjacent segments. At greater depths, simple and bright reflections are generally observed at depths of ~12-25 km, ~40-100 km from the trench, within the center of the estimated locked zone. The character changes where the megathrust appears to intersect the forearc mantle wedge to a wide (~2 km thick), bright band of reflections and may arise from a change in deformation style, distribution of fluids, and/or plate boundary properties. Although the overall patterns in reflection characteristics are consistent between profiles across different segments, this transition in reflection characteristics occurs at larger distances from the trench within the Semidi segment than in the Shumagin Gap.",

This scheme allows aerosol-cloud interactions through aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei. Here we present the results of an analysis of the cloud radiative forcing focusing on East Asia. Compared with the previous treatment of one-moment cloud scheme together with an empirical formula for droplet size, the new scheme simulates larger low cloud cover, liquid water path, and droplet size, which reflect more solar radiation, emit more longwave radiation, thus yield a larger net cloud radiative forcing. We plan to use offline radiation code (RRTMG) to examine the individual effects of cloud cover (low, middle and high) and cloud microphysical properties on the solar and longwave radiation fluxes reaching the surface and their relative roles in affecting the surface temperature.

Due to the non-stationary characteristics of hydro-climatic data, spectral analysis techniques that involve the use of wavelet transforms are very useful in extracting time-frequency information of such data, as well as in investigating the relationship between large-scale climate indices and hydrological variables (such as streamflow). It is important to identify predictable patterns in these climate indices, along with their influences on water resources, in order to reduce uncertainties associated with the effects of climate variability. This study aims to describe the monthly streamflow variability across Canadian rivers as a response to the influences of three main climate indices affecting the North American climate: the El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

Spearman Correlations were then used to determine the lag time of streamflow response to these climate indices. The WTC spectra indicate that the influences of the ENSO and NAO indices occur at the 2-6-year time scales, and the influences of the PDO index are more apparent at time scales of up to 8 years and greater than 16 years.

            "abstract": "Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) technology offers a viable alternative for accurately measuring wildland fire intensity and distribution in real time applications. We conducted an experiment to test the use of DTS as an alternative technology to monitor prescribed fire temperatures in real time and across a broad spatial scale. The custom fiber-optic cable consisted of three fiber optic lines buffered by polyamide, copper, and polyvinyl chloride, respectively, each armored in a stainless steel tube backfilled with Nitrogen gas. The 150 m long cable was deployed in three different 20 by 26 m experimental plots of short-grass rangeland in central New Mexico. Cable was arranged to maximize coverage of the experimental plots and allow cross-comparison between two main parallel straight-line sections approximately 8 m apart. A DTS system recorded fire temperatures every three seconds and integrated every one meter. A series of five thermocouples attached to a datalogger were placed at selected locations along the cable and also recorded temperature data every three seconds on each fiber. Results indicate that in general there is good agreement between thermocouple-measured and DTS-measured temperatures. A close match in temperature between DTS and thermocouples was particularly observed during the rising limb but not so much during the decline. The metal armoring of the fiber-optic cable remained hot longer than the thermocouples after the flames had passed. The relatively short-duration, high-intensity, prescribed burn fire in each plot resulted in temperatures reaching up to 450 degrees Celsius. In addition, DTS data allow for illustration of the irregular nature of flame speed and travel path across the rangeland grasses, a phenomenon that was impossible to quantify without the use of this tool. This study adds to the understanding of using DTS as a new alternative tool for better characterizing wildland fire intensity, distribution and travel patterns, and establishes the baseline for expanding these test plot results to larger spatial scales.",

            "abstract": "One of the significant technical hurdles to remote estimation of river discharge using river widths is the acquisition of suitable imagery. Most high-resolution, radar-based sensors acquire imagery infrequently (e.g. once or twice per month), while optical sensors are subject to the effects of clouds. Many more images that are partially cloud-free or cover only part of a study area are often available, but their use is problematic because the spatial extent of observable subreaches differs from image to image. Here, a method is presented that allows spatially discontinuous remote observations of river width to be successfully used to estimate discharge despite partial cloudiness and/or inconsistent spatial coverage. The method is demonstrated over 62 km of the Tanana River downstream of Fairbanks, AK. This reach is divided into 1 km subreaches and a separate discharge-width rating curve is produced for each subreach. For any given image, final discharge is estimated as the median discharge calculated from all visible and cloud-free reaches. Application of the method to 28 RapidEye images at 5 m spatial resolution and useable coverage ranging from <20% to 100% suggests that it produces highly accurate estimates of discharge (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE=6.7%, r2=0.92) when compared with in situ observations. Similar but slightly less accurate results are evident from eleven Landsat TM and ETM+ images (RMSE=12.6%, r2=0.86). These results suggest that the method used here produces estimates of discharge comparable in error characteristics to ground-based measurements, at least when high resolution imagery is used over a river reach with substantial temporal width variability.",

            "abstract": "Basal melting of the floating tongue of Petermann Glacier, in northwestern Greenland is by far the largest process of mass ablation. Melting of the floating tongue is controlled by the buoyancy of the melt water plume, the pressure-dependence of the melting point of sea ice, and the mixing of warm subsurface water with fresh buoyant subglacial discharge. In prior simulations of this melting process, the role of subglacial discharge has been neglected because in similar configurations (floating ice shelves) in the Antarctic, surface runoff is negligible; this is however not true in Greenland. Here, we use the Mass Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) at a high spatial resolution (10 m x 10 m) to simulate the melting process of the ice shelf in 2-D. The model is constrained by ice shelf bathymetry and ice thickness (refined model in the immediate vicinity of the grounding line) from NASA Operation IceBridge (2011), ocean temperature/salinity data from Johnson et al. (2011), ocean tide height and current from the Arctic Ocean Tidal Inverse Model (AOTIM-5) by Padman and Erofeeva (2004) and subglacial discharge at the grounding line calculated by the hydrostatic potential of the ice from estimated products of the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) of Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). We compare the results obtained in winter (no runoff) with summer, and the sensitivity of the results to thermal forcing from the ocean, and to the variation of tide height and current, and to the magnitude of subglacial runoff. We conclude on the impact of the ocean and surface melting on the melting regime of the floating ice tongue of Petermann. The basal melt rate increases ~20% with summer surface runoff.

            "abstract": "Traditional hydrological monitoring relies on frequent water level measurements at discrete locations, and in complex environments this type of measurement may not be able to capture the spatial variability of the hydrodynamic processes. While remote sensing, whether air-or-spaceborne, has made spatially distributed measurements of surface waters possible, the frequency of data acquisition is typically too low for most hydrological applications and the data is often used in conjunction with hydrological or hydrodynamic models.\nThe new AirSWOT instrument provides spatially distributed measurements of water surface elevation from an airborne platform and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is one of its test areas. Our objective was to assess the value of such measurements to hydrodynamic modeling in the Delta and to evaluate the necessary spatial and temporal coverage needed for the data to improve on current monitoring capabilities. To achieve this, a synthetic data assimilation experiment was designed: a hydrodynamic model of the Delta was built and run using in situ observations to produce a “true” run and sets of synthetic AirSWOT measurements, covering different locations and at different times, were generated using an instrument simulator. An ensemble of perturbed runs was then generated by perturbing the boundary conditions and the synthetic data sets were assimilated using the ensemble Kalman Filter. The impact of the assimilation on the hydrodynamic model performance was studied for the different sets of synthetic data in order to identify the most sensitive measurement times and locations and help improve the design of future measurement campaigns.",

The limitations of current monitoring systems has pushed the provincial government to seek out advanced sensing technologies such as differential absorption lidar (DIAL) to help assess the impact of energy development and industrial operations. This instrument is housed inside a 36’ trailer and can be quickly staged and used to characterize source emissions and to locate fugitive leaks. DIAL is capable of measuring concentrations for carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) at ranges of up to 3 km with a spatial resolution of 1.5 m. DIAL can map both CO2 and CH4, as well as particulate matter (PM) in a linear fashion; by scanning the laser beam in both azimuth and elevation, DIAL can create images of emissions concentrations and ultimately can be used to determine emission factors, locate fugitive leaks, assess plume dispersion and confirm air dispersion modeling. The DIAL system has been deployed at a landfill, a coal-fired power plant, and an oil sands production area. A system overview of the DIAL instrument and recent results will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "To better understand the long-range atmospheric transport of microbial aerosols from Southeast Asia to the western North Pacific, marine aerosols were collected at a remote Island, Chichi-Jima on a biweekly basis during 1990-1993. These samples were investigated for the atmospheric abundances of hydroxy fatty acids (OH FAs). β-OH FAs are the major structural components of endotoxins in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) whereas w-OH FAs are present in cell walls of higher plants. Thus, we tested the applicability of the β-OH FAs (C10-C18) and ω-OH FAs (C16-C26) to assess the Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and contribution of terrestrial higher plants, respectively. The average concentrations of β- and ω-OH FAs show pronounced seasonal variability with spring maximum (~301 ng/m-3 and ~ 272 ng/m-3, respectively). The concentrations of total OH FAs increased in winter/spring and decreased in summer/autumn, except for 1992-93. This seasonal trend can be interpreted by the atmospheric transport of microbial soil dust and higher plant metabolites from the Asian continent during winter/spring, when westerly winds dominate over the western North Pacific. The even carbon predominance of β- and ω-OH FAs (80 and 74 % of total) in marine aerosols could be explained by their significant contribution from GNB and terrestrial higher plants. These results have implications towards assessing the bacterial transport in the continental outflows. This study also confirms that β-OH FAs can be used as bacterial tracers in ambient aerosol samples.\nKeywords: β- and ω-hydroxy fatty acids, terrestrial biomarkers, marine aerosols, GC-MS",

            "abstract": "The crystal cargo that is found in volcanic and plutonic rocks contains a wealth of information about magmatic mush processes, crystallisation history, crystal entrainment and recycling. Phenocryst populations predominantly record episodes of growth/nucleation and bulk geochemical changes within an evolving crystal-melt body. Ante- and xeno-crysts provide useful clues to the nature of mush interaction with wall rock and with principal magma(s). Furthermore, crystal evolutions (core to rim) record pathways through pressure, temperature and compositional space. These can often illustrate complex recycling within systems, describing the plumbing architecture. Understanding this architecture underpins our knowledge of how igneous systems can interact with the crust, grow, freeze, re-mobilise and prime for eruption. Initially, 2D studies produced corrected 3D crystal size distributions to help provide information about nucleation and residence times. It immediately became clear that crystal shape is an important factor in determining the confidence placed upon 3D reconstructions of 2D data. Additionally studies utilised serial sections of medium- to coarse-grain-size populations which allowed 3D reconstruction using modelling software to be improved, since size and shape etc. can be directly constrained. Finally the advent of textural studies using X-ray tomography has revolutionised the way in which we can inspect the crystal cargo in mushy systems, allowing us to image in great detail crystal packing arrangements, 3D CSDs, shapes and orientations etc. The latest most innovative studies use X-ray micro-computed tomography to rapidly characterise chemical populations within the crystal cargo, adding a further dimension to this approach, and implies the ability to untangle magmatic chemical components to better understand their individual and combined evolution. In this contribution key examples of the different types of textural analysis techniques in 2D and 3D, including texture movie animations, are used from both plutonic and volcanic systems to highlight the roll of this approach towards a goal of true 3D textural analysis.",

In the present contribution, we present the geochemistry of the hydrothermal plumes over the KR1, an AAR segment at 159ºE and 62ºS. In 2011, we collected 48 Miniature Autonomous Plume Recorder profiles, measuring optical back scatter and oxidation-reduction potential, and identified the area between 158.5 and 159ºE as the densest concentration of active hydrothermal sites. In order to further characterize the chemistry of the hydrothermal plumes over the area, named 'Mujin', we conducted intensive vertical and tow-yo CTD casts in 2013. The maximum concentrations of the chemical tracers 3He, CH4, H2, and dissolved Mn, were 7.47 fmol/kg, 19.6 nmol/kg, 8.8 nmol/kg, 94.3 nmol/L, respectively. The CH4/3He (1 -10) and CH4/Mn (0.01 - 0.2) ratios were significantly lower than many ultra-mafic hosted systems, which are often found in slow spreading ridges. The lower ratios are consistent with a basaltic-hosted system, typical of the intermediate spreading rate of 6.8 cm/yr of KR1. Additionally, some of the plume samples collected around 158.6 and 158.8ºE exhibited slightly higher ratios of H2/3He than the others. Assuming that H2 is produced from the reduction of water by reduced iron compounds in the rock, the higher ratios suggest that those plumes are supported by a younger hydrothermal system, which may have experienced a recent eruption.",

            "abstract": "The recent development of full waveform tomography on continental scales has provided new insights into the seismic structure of the lithosphere and asthenosphere. In particular, we can map shorter wavelength, high-amplitude velocity anomalies which would traditionally be damped and spatially smeared using classical methods. Quantitative interpretation of these anomalies – expressed as absolute rather than relative velocities – may open up the possibility of identifying important dynamic processes such as melting, that would otherwise go undetected or unconstrained. In this study we focus on the S-wave speed structure beneath Europe, as obtained from full waveform inversion. On average, the European continent is slow compared to 1-D reference models such as AK135, but of particular interest are regions beneath the Atlantic and Iberian Peninsula which are 6-8% slower. Traditional interpretation of a regional tomography model would assume a fixed chemical composition, and from this estimate lateral temperature variations. In our case we allow both the temperature and composition to vary at random within very broad ranges, and generate thousands of different thermochemical structures in a Monte Carlo procedure. We then convert these thermochemical structures into S-wave speeds using thermodynamic modelling, and including a correction for temperature-dependent intrinsic attenuation. Although we cannot uniquely define the chemical composition in a given location, due to trade-offs between different chemical components and the temperature, this does not affect our interpretation of the very slow regions. We find that in order to generate such low velocities without melting, either prohibitively high temperatures (above the melting temperature) or extremely low Q values (in contradiction with seismic constraints) are required. Our study demonstrates: 1. The importance of using absolute rather than relative seismic wave speeds in constraining the thermochemical structure and 2. That interpreting Vs structure alone without further observables (such as Vp or density) may still provide important insights into mantle physical properties.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the processes that control the terrestrial exchange of carbon and water are critical for examining the role of forested ecosystems in changing climates. A small but increasing number of studies have identified Carbonyl Sulfide (OCS) as a potential tracer for photosynthesis. OCS is hydrolyzed by an irreversible reaction in leaf mesophyll cells that is catalyzed by the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase. Leaf-level field and greenhouse studies indicate that OCS uptake is controlled by stomatal activity and that the ratio of OCS and CO2 uptake is reasonably constant. Existing studies on ecosystem OCS exchange have been based on laboratory measurements or short field campaigns and therefore little information on OCS exchange in a natural ecosystem over longer timescales is available.\nThe objective of this study is to further assess the stability of OCS as a tracer for canopy photosynthesis in an active forested ecosystem and also to assess its utility for constraining transpiration, since both fluxes are mediated by canopy stomatal conductance. An off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy analyzer (Los Gatos Research Inc.) was deployed at the Wind River Experimental Forest in Washington (45.8205°N, 121.9519°W). Canopy air was sampled from three heights to measure vertical gradients of OCS within the canopy, and OCS exchange between the forest and the atmosphere. Here we take advantage of simultaneous measurements of the stable isotopologues of H2O and CO2 at corresponding heights as well as NEE (Net Ecosystem Exchange) from eddy covariance measurements to compare GPP (Gross Primary Production) and transpiration estimates from a variety of independent techniques. Our findings seek to allow assessment of the environmental and ecophysicological controls on evapotranspiration rates, which are projected to change in coming decades, and are otherwise poorly constrained.",

The purpose of the studies was to examine the chemical emissions of reactive gases from the marine surface, to diagnose transport characteristics of this region, and to better understand the controls of the chemical composition and reactive gas budgets of the tropical atmosphere, including the Tropical Transition Layer (TTL) and lower tropical stratosphere.\nAs part of these studies a wide range of trace gases were measured, including various halo- and hydrocarbons, organic nitrates, methyl halides and solvents. In this presentation we will discuss results from whole air samples that were collected from NASA Global Hawk and NSF/NCAR Gulfstream-V aircrafts during ATTREX and CONTRAST, respectively. Samples were collected at altitudes from near 0.5 km to 18 km, and included latitudes from 40°N to 20°S in the Western Pacific. Combined measurements from two aircrafts produced over 1200 samples, which were subsequently analyzed in the field by means of gas chromatography combined with mass selective, flame ionization and electron capture detectors. The observed distributions of trace gases reflected the combined effects of marine emissions and convective mixing, long range transport, and slow ascent in the TTL. We will show our preliminary results featuring vertical and horizontal distributions of selected hydrocarbon and organic halogen trace species and correlations among these species that were observed during the campaigns.",

On the Tibetan Plateau, there are four inland basins in contrast to six external catchments at the marginal plateau. With the same reference system, co-registration and bias/offsets correction, DEMs and ICESat/GLAS data were used to calculate glacier surface elevation changes, which includes the historical DEM at 1:250,000 in 1970s, SRTM DEM and ICESat/GLAS over the whole Tibetan Plateau. According to the 1st glacier inventory database by each glacier in different basins, glacier surface elevation changes were calculated, and glacier mass changes were evaluated. It shows that, for external catchments, glacier mass change was totalled by -9.5 ± 3.6 Gt a-1 during 1970s-2000, it was more negative during 2003-2009 (-14.9 ± 6.9 Gt a-1). It shows more melting glacier water runs into the sea in recent decade. However, it was obviously less than some previous studies in HMA, e.g. Gardner et al., 2013, glacier contributed to sea level rise by 26±12 Gt a-1 .While for internal basins overall, glacier mass change was totalled by -7.6 ± 2.3 Gt a-1 during 1970s-2000, however, it was less negative during 2003-2009 (-3.05± 1.4 Gt a-1). It seems that precipitation has increased in inland Tibet and there might be less glacier melting mass runs into inland lakes in recent decade.",

            "abstract": "Preliminary studies have demonstrated both mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) and mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of Hg isotopes in natural samples. Laboratory experiments showed that photochemical reduction of inorganic mercury (iHg) and methylmercury (MMHg) and liquid-vapour evaporation could produce MIF of odd Hg isotopes. This was thought to cause the MIF actually observed in aquatic organisms. Although isotopic measurements of Hg in aqueous environment would give direct evidence, little data was reported for surface water samples.\nRecent work reported, unexpectedly, positive MIF of odd Hg isotopes in both precipitation and ambient air, in contrast with the prediction of laboratory experiments and measurements of Hg accumulated in lichens . Intriguingly, MIF of even-mass Hg isotope (200Hg) was also recently determined in the atmosphere. In contrast with the now mainstream observation of odd Hg isotope anomaly that has several theoretical explanations, the hitherto mysterious even Hg isotope anomalies were neither reported in laboratory experiments, nor predicted by isotope fractionation mechanisms, highlighting the importance of further study on Hg isotopes in variable systems.\nOur measurements of lichens and lake water samples from different countries show for the first time significant Δ200Hg in surface terrestrial reservoirs, realizing a direct connection of even Hg isotope anomaly in the terrestrial reservoirs to the atmospheric deposition, and fulfilling the gap of Δ200Hg between the atmosphere and the terrestrial receptors. The specific odd Hg isotope compositions determined in lake waters also support the atmosphere contribution, and may be directly linked to the high Δ199Hg values largely determined and manifested on the top of aqueous food web. Our data show that the watershed Hg input is another contributing source, rather than the in-lake processes, to explain the lacustrine Hg isotope anomalies. Interestingly, lake sediments are isotopically decoupled from the atmosphere and even the water column. This probably results from the direct solid input from the watershed.",

The MODIS Level 2 products provide TPW estimated from both the infrared (IR) and near-infrared (NIR) spectral bands and are available over the NAM region approximately twice per day. Our comparisons indicate that the correlations of Terra and Aqua IR TPW with the GPS observations are all significant at the 95% confidence level, while the NIR correlations show little or no significance. The analysis also finds that Terra and Aqua have significant seasonal biases with respect to the GPS for both the IR and NIR estimates at several locations, with the IR estimates showing better agreement than the NIR estimates. The dependence of the errors on elevation and time of overpass will be discussed to help identify contributing factors to the observed errors.",

            "abstract": "The Yarlung Zangbo Suture zone (YZSZ), extending more than 2000 km across southern Tibet, is thought to mark the tectonic boundary between the Indian and Asian plates. West of Saga county of the YZSZ is divided into two sub-belts (Dajiweng-Saga to the north and Daba-Xiugugabu to the south), which are separated by the Zhongba-Zhada microcontinent/terrane containing Sinian to Triassic metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.\nSeveral large ophiolitic massifs that crop out in the southern sub-belt, e.g., the Dongbo (400 km2), Purang (650km2) and Xiugugabu (700km2), have a seamount-like stratigraphy, consisting from the base upward of peridotites, mafic dikes, massive basalt and basaltic hyaloclastites, mudstone and silty shale and radiolarian chert. The sedimentary sequence also locally contains discontinuous basalt flows and siliceous to massive limestones with minor oolites. The peridotites are highly depleted harzburgites, minor lherzolites and dunites, all of which were enriched by later fluids/melts. Mafic dikes (120-130 Ma) intruding the peridotites exhibit N-MORB-like chondrite-normalized REE patterns and negative Nb anomalies in spider diagrams. These geochemical features are similar to those of volcanic-rifted margin basalts. E-MORB-like basalts (137 Ma) within the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous radiolarian cherts and OIB-like basalts (140 Ma) between the silty shale and peridotites reflect limited seamount volcanism.\nIn the northern sub-belt ophiolitic peridotites, mafic dikes, cumulate gabbros, massive basalts, chert and limestone crop out discontinuously as lenses in mélange complexes. The peridotites are harzburgite and minor dunite, both of which were modified by later LREE-enriched melts/fluids. Mafic dikes (122-127 Ma) intruding the peridotites are geochemically similar to those in the southern sub-belt. A 500-meter-thick sequence of cumulate gabbro is tectonically sandwiched between the peridotites and basalts. A 1- 2 km sequence of OIB-type basalt unconformably overlies the gabbro in the Saga massif.\nOphiolitic rocks of the northern belt can be compared with the Xigaze ophiolite in the central YZSZ. If the later formed in Triassic (~170Ma) suggested in some publications, the southern belt should be represented a slightly younger Jurassic to Cretaceous oceanic basin.",

It was determined that the glacier coverage reduced by around 37% in average over 40 years. The Ecuadorean glacier coverage measured in 1997 corresponded to 60 km2. Using the data obtained for Cotopaxi, which has been studied in detail, a projection on the glacier coverage to the year 2010 was performed and a value of 48 Km2 was obtained.

            "abstract": "Understanding the hydro-climatic and geomorphic controls on sediment transport and limnologic controls on deposition in glacier-fed lakes is important to improving paleoclimatic inferences from lake sediments. The timing of clastic sedimentation in two glacial lakes with contrasting watersheds was monitored using sequencing sediment traps for two consecutive years at Allison Lake (Chugach Range, Alaska) and four months at Shainin Lake (Brooks Range, Alaska). Shainin Lake is a weakly stratified lake fed by distant glaciers, whereas Allison Lake is strongly stratified and fed predominantly by proximal glaciers. At Shainin Lake, sediment accumulation started in late June and reached its maximum in mid-August, just before lake mixing and during a period of low river discharge. The median grain size of the sediment reaching the bottom of Shainin Lake was constant throughout the summer, based on analysis of deflocculated samples. Sedimentation appears to be controlled by flocculation rather than by settling of individual grains. At Allison Lake, rapid sedimentation events of coarse particles during late summer and early fall storms were superimposed on the fine-grained sedimentation pattern similar to that observed at Shainin Lake. These storms triggered underflows that were noticeable in the thermal structure of the lake and deposited large volumes of sediment. The sequencing sediment traps reveal a lag between fluvial sediment transport and the deposition of fine-grained sediments at the bottom of both lakes, implying limitations to interpreting intra-annual sedimentary features within the sedimentary sequence in terms inflow discharge.",

These changes indicate that a large-scale shift in the modal climate occurred together with changes in extreme storm frequency or clustering of East Coast Cyclones (ECC), when compared to the past century. ECC are complex subtropical weather systems that form off the east coast of Australia and/or travel parallel to the coast of Australia from south-east Queensland to Victoria.\nWe investigate coastal evolution and the associated climate drivers using a novel combination of methods, including: LIDAR DEM and field mapping of coastal geology; a decadal-scale climate reconstruction of sea-level pressure, marine windfields, and paleo-storm synoptic type and frequency, using a paleoclimate data assimilation approach; together with wave transformation and coastal planform modelling for paleo-wave directions, and historical bathymetry. We present the morphodynamic response to changes in directional wave power, by linking the paleo-windfield reconstruction to wave transformation models.\nThe combined methodology has illuminated the ‘ultimate’ storm impacts not seen in the past century, and defines the multi-decadal coastal system response and recovery to extreme storm sequences. Increased embaymentisation and anticlockwise rotation of embayed and barrier coast planform geometry; shifts in barrier-estuary-inlet configuration; and a ubiquitous foredune transgression, are shown to have occurred between ~1600 to 1800 CE. This was in response to a poleward shift in the subtropics and frequency of tradewind-driven wave climate, and tropical-origin storms. From 1800 to 1900 CE, an equatorward shift in the subtropics, and clustering of extratropical-origin storms drove an increase in the shoreface-littoral sediment budget and a clockwise coastline progradation. This energetic, oblique directional wave climate, delivered higher than modern across-shoreface and alongshore sand transport rates. The 20th century decline in storm wave energy and implied reduction in across-shoreface sand transport is a significant driver of modern shoreline behavior along the Australian east coast.",

            "abstract": "An apparent climate regime shift occurred around 1998/1999, when the steady increase of global-mean surface temperature appeared to hit a hiatus. Coherent decadal variations are found in atmospheric circulation and hydrological cycles. Using 30-year cloud observations from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, we examine the decadal variability of clouds and associated cloud radiative effects on surface warming. Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis is performed. After removing the seasonal cycle and ENSO signal in the 30-year data, we find that the leading EOF modes clearly represent a decadal variability in cloud fraction, well correlated with the indices of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The cloud radiative effects associated with decadal variations of clouds suggest a positive cloud feedback, which would reinforce the global warming hiatus by a net cloud cooling after 1998/1999. Climate model simulations driven by observed sea surface temperature are compared with satellite observed cloud decadal variability.\nCopyright: © 2014 California Institute of Technology",

            "abstract": "Several lines of evidence suggest that subduction zone thrusts lie within overpressured channels. Seismic reflection data often shows a relatively thin, high-reflectivity surface with occasional bright spots, indicative of rapidly varying impedance contrasts over length scales of tens of meters. Scattered coda of teleseismic P waves, such as in receiver functions, often show a thin low-velocity layer corresponding to the top of the subducting plate. The latter have been best documented in Cascadia, where a 2-4 km thick very low velocity channel is seen above a moderately slow subducting crust, and in Alaska where similar structure has been seen. High-reflectivity bright spots occur in the same region, although perhaps over more limited areas. The low velocity zones are characterized by elevated Vp/Vs ratios (>2.0), and extend both throughout the locked, seismogenic fault zone and downdip into the region where episodic tremor and slip occur. Commonly, this combination of low velocities and high Vp/Vs is taken to indicate high pore pressures, and hence a fault zone that can withstand only very low shear stresses. However, models of the low wavespeeds suggest static porosities of 2-5% throughout a 2-4 km thick layer, extending to depths of 40 km, a situation that seems difficult to sustain. At both the Alaska and Cascadia margins, low Vp, high Poisson’s ratios, and high anisotropies should result in part from the subduction of sediments well into and beyond the seismogenic zone. The presence of a significant thickness of subducted and underplated sediment is consistent with observations of preserved subduction “channels” in exhumed examples from tens of km depth. Although some elevation of pore pressure may be still needed to explain observations, if the subduction of 2-4 km of sediment is a significant factor in generating the seismic signatures, then the geophysical observations could reflect a much stronger thrust zone than one sustained by high pore pressure alone.",

            "abstract": "As the amount of observational Earth and Space Science data grows, so does the need for learning and employing data analysis techniques that can extract meaningful information from those data. Space-based and ground-based data sources from all over the world are used to inform Earth and Space environment models. However, with such a large amount of data comes a need to organize those data in a way such that trends within the data are easily discernible. This can be tricky due to the interaction between physical processes that lead to partial correlation of variables or multiple interacting sources of causality. With the suite of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) data mining codes available at MSFC, we have the capability to analyze large, complex data sets and quantitatively identify fundamentally independent effects from consequential or derived effects. We have used these techniques to examine the accuracy of ionospheric climate models with respect to trends in ionospheric parameters and space weather effects. In particular, these codes have been used to 1) Provide summary \"at-a-glance\" surveys of large data sets through categorization and/or evolution over time to identify trends, distribution shapes, and outliers, 2) Discern the underlying “latent” variables which share common sources of causality, and 3) Establish a new set of basis vectors by computing Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) which represent the maximum amount of variance for each principal component. Some of these techniques are easily implemented in the classroom using standard MATLAB functions, some of the more advanced applications require the statistical toolbox, and applications to unique situations require more sophisiticated levels of programming. This paper will present an overview of the range of tools available and how they might be used for a variety of time series Earth and Space Science data sets. Examples of feature recognition from both 1D and 2D (e.g. imagery) time series data sets will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Deltas are unique environments that are rich in natural resources and human populations. As a result, human activities directly to the delta and indirectly to the watershed in the Anthropocene have led to changes within the deltaic system as a response to these natural and anthropogenic forces. Understanding the response of deltas to these new forcings will be critical to assess the vulnerability of deltas to global climate change and expanding human populations. The Brazos River Delta, located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, served as an ideal study area to investigate the effect of human activities on a delta. Historical alterations to the system include agricultural activity, jetty construction, an engineered mouth diversion, and reservoir construction throughout the early and mid 20th Century. Three subaerial deltaic growth phases were identified based on historic shoreline configurations, and combined with high-resolution geophysical data (swath bathymetry, side scan sonar, CHIRP subbottom profiling) from the subaqueous delta to investigate the subaqueous delta changes over time. Evidence from these alternating progradational and retrogradational periods are preserved within the subaqueous delta. The data showed that as the growth of the subaerial delta changed over time, the subaqueous clinoform was subjected to regions of progradation or abandonment. The abandoned clinoform sections were characterized by a thinning modern clinoform sequence downslope from an erosional scarp. High side scan sonar backscatter features are believed to distinguish exposed erosional surfaces throughout the subaqueous delta demarcating the abandoned sections at the seabed. Prograding clinoform areas lack these high backscatter features. In these areas the modern clinoform was relatively thicker and does not exhibit the upslope erosional scarps. This noticeable asymmetry across the subaqueous delta shows that the Brazos Delta has migrated southwestward resulting from shifts in the balance between fluvial sediment supply and marine processes. These shifts were attributed to the anthropogenic activity within the system. This study shows that deltaic responses to human activity can be characterized by dramatic morphological and sedimentological changes that can occur on decadal time scales.",

G-WADI PERSIANN-CCS GeoServer provides near real-time high resolution (0.04o, approx 4km) global (60oN – 60oS) satellite precipitation estimated by the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm developed by the scientists at CHRS. The G-WADI PERSIANN-CCS GeoServer utilizes the open-source MapServer software from the University of Minnesota to provide a user-friendly web-based mapping and visualization of satellite precipitation data.\nRecent efforts have been made by the scientists at CHRS to provide free on-the-go access to the PERSIANN-CCS precipitation data through an application named RainMapper for mobile devices. RainMapper provides visualization of global satellite precipitation of the most recent 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72-hour periods overlaid with various basemaps. RainMapper uses the Google maps application programing interface (API) and embedded global positioning system (GPS) access to better monitor the global precipitation data on mobile devices. Functionalities include using geographical searching with voice recognition technologies make it easy for the user to explore near real-time precipitation in a certain location. RainMapper also allows for conveniently sharing the precipitation information and visualizations with the public through social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. RainMapper is available for iOS and Android devices and can be downloaded (free) from the App Store and Google Play.

The ensemble approach allows us to assess confidence in our estimates, which is critical given that food and water insecure regions in Africa are data-poor are characterized by complex interactions and feedbacks that cause deterministic hydrologic modeling approaches to fall short. We then use the ensemble of water balance estimates to calculate drought severity (derived from modeled soil moisture), and the Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (a function of atmospheric water demand). We compare these indices to the GIMMS 30-year vegetation data product from AVHRR, and the ESA ECV 30 year microwave soil moisture. These historical time series (with confidence bounds) allow us to improve our quantitative understanding of drought thresholds, to explore sources of parameter and model uncertainty, and to better contextualize current operational drought monitoring efforts in Africa.",

            "abstract": "Calculations indicate the average rate of decrease of Earth's angular momentum must have been less than its present value in the past; otherwise, the Earth should have a longer day length. Existing stromatolite data suggests the Earth's rotational frequency would have been near that of the atmospheric resonance frequency toward the end of the Precambrian era, approximately 600Ma. The semidiurnal atmospheric tidal torque would have reached a maximum near this day length of 21hr. At this point, the atmospheric torque would have been comparable in magnitude but opposite in direction to the lunar torque, creating a stabilizing effect which could preserve a constant day length while trapped in this resonant state, as suggested by Zahnle and Walker (1987). We examine the hypothesis that this resonant stability was encountered and sustained for a large amount of time during the Precambrian era and was broken by a large and relatively fast increase in global temperature, possibly in the deglaciation period following a snowball event. Computational simulations of this problem were performed, indicating that a persistent increase in temperature larger than around 10K over a period of time less than 107 years will break resonance (though these values vary with Q), but that the resonant stability is not easily broken by random high-amplitude high-frequency atmospheric temperature fluctuation or other forms of thermal noise. Further work also indicates it is possible to escape resonance simply by increasing the lunar tidal torque on the much longer timescale of plate tectonics, particularly for low atmospheric Q-factors, or that resonance could have never formed in the first place, had the lunar torque been very high or Q been very low when the Earth's rotational frequency was near the atmospheric resonance frequency. However, the need to explain the present day length given the current lunar torque favors the interpretation we offer, in which Earth's length of day was stabilized for hundreds of millions of years, escaping this stability in the aftermath of a sudden global temperature change.",

            "abstract": "A detailed understanding of gas-aerosol-cloud interaction within the turbulent atmosphere is of prime importance for an accurate understanding of Earth’s climate system. As one example: While every cloud droplet began as an aerosol particle, not every aerosol particle becomes a cloud droplet. The particle to droplet transformation requires that the particle be exposed to some critical concentration of water vapor, which differs for different combinations of particle size and chemical composition. Similarly, the formation of ice particles in mixed phase clouds is also catalyzed by aerosol particles. Even in the simplest scenarios it is challenging to gain a full understanding of the aerosol activation and ice nucleation processes. At least two other factors contribute significantly to the complexity observed in the atmosphere. First, aerosols and cloud particles are not static entities, but are continuously interacting with their chemical environment, and therefore changing in their properties. Second, clouds are ubiquitously turbulent, so thermodynamic and compositional variables, such as water vapor or other trace gas concentrations, fluctuate in space and time. Indeed, the coupling between turbulence and microphysical processes is one of the major research challenges in cloud physics.\nWe have developed a multiphase, turbulent reaction chamber, (dubbed the Π Chamber, after the internal volume of 3.14 cubic meters) designed to address the problems outlined above. It is capable of pressures ranging from sea level to ~ 100 mbar, and can sustain temperatures of +40 to -55 ºC. We can independently control the temperatures on the surfaces of three heat transfer zones. This allows us to establish a temperature gradient between the floor and ceiling inducing Rayleigh-Benard convection and inducing a turbulent environment. Interior surfaces are electropolished stainless steel to facilitate cleaning before and after chemistry experiments. At present, supporting instrumentation includes a suite of aerosol generation and characterization techniques, a laser Doppler interferometer, and a holographic cloud particle imaging system.\nWe will present detailed specifications, an overview of the supporting instrumentation, and initial characterization experiments from the Π chamber.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake early warning (EEW) is a time-critical system and typically relies on seismic instruments in the area around the source to detect P waves (or S waves) and rapidly issue alerts. Thanks to the rapid development of real-time Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), a good number of sensors have been deployed in seismic zones, such as the western U.S. where over 600 GPS stations are collecting 1-Hz high-rate data along the Cascadia subduction zone, San Francisco Bay area, San Andreas fault, etc. GNSS sensors complement the seismic sensors by recording the static offsets while seismic data provide highly-precise higher frequency motions. An optimal combination of GNSS and accelerometer data (seismogeodesy) has advantages compared to GNSS-only or seismic-only methods and provides seismic velocity and displacement waveforms that are precise enough to detect P wave arrivals, in particular in the near source region. Robust real-time GNSS and seismogeodetic analysis is challenging because it requires a period of initialization and continuous phase ambiguity resolution. One of the limiting factors is unmodeled atmospheric effects, both of tropospheric and ionospheric origin. One mitigation approach is to introduce atmospheric corrections into precise point positioning with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR) of clients/stations within the monitored regions. NOAA generates hourly predictions of zenith troposphere delays at an accuracy of a few centimeters, and 15-minute slant ionospheric delays of a few TECU (Total Electron Content Unit) accuracy from both geodetic and meteorological data collected at hundreds of stations across the U.S. The Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center (SOPAC) is experimenting with a regional ionosphere grid using a few hundred stations in southern California, and the International GNSS Service (IGS) routinely estimates a Global Ionosphere Map using over 100 GNSS stations. With these troposphere and ionosphere data as additional observations, we can shorten the initialization period and improve the ambiguity resolution efficiency of PPP-AR. We demonstrate this with data collected by a cluster of Real-Time Earthquake Analysis for Disaster mItigation (READI) network stations in southern California operated by UNAVCO/PBO and SOPAC.",

A triggered seismic cluster north of the Moriyoshi-zan volcano in Akita prefecture, Tohoku District, is of interest in light of the contribution of geofluids to seismic activity. We observed an active seismic cluster characterized by the migration of seismicity and reflected/scattered phases. We relocated hypocenters of the cluster using data from temporal observations and the hypoDD location technique, which significantly increased the hypocentral accuracy. We interpreted a complex spatiotemporal variation of seismicity in the cluster as the migration of pore fluid pressure from multiple pressure sources. The hydraulic diffusivity of the cluster was in the range of 0.01 to 0.7 m2/s and increased with time, implying that the migration of hypocenters accelerated after a pathway for fluids was formed by fracturing of the wall rock during the initial stage of seismic activity. A prominent feature of the seismograms is a reflected/scattered phase observed at stations around the volcano. We regard the phase as S-to-S scattered waves and estimated the location of the scatterers using a back-projection method. The scatterers are inferred to be located about 5 km northwest of the Moriyoshi-zan volcano, at an approximate depth of 13 km. The Moriyoshi-zan area is one of the source areas of deep low-frequency earthquakes that have been interpreted as events generated by the migration of geofluids. The depth of the scatterers is close to the upper depth limit of low-frequency earthquakes. Thus, we interpret the observed scatterers to be a reservoir of geofluid that came from the uppermost mantle accompanying contemporaneous low-frequency earthquakes.",

We investigate how the changes in climate and land use/land cover would affect the cycling of mercury as well as its global and regional budgets with a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). On the global scale, climate change will affect the mercury budget mainly through wet deposition while land cover change has more effects on mercury dry deposition. Dry deposition flux of elemental mercury (Hg(0)) increases in most of the continental area; however, change in dry deposition flux of divalent mercury (Hg(II)) shows strong spatial variation reflecting the additional effects associated with mercury chemistry. In addition, climate change leads to decreasing surface concentrations of Hg(0) around the world except for in Southeast Asia and central part of Europe while land cover change decreases Hg(0) concentration all over the world with more in the northern hemisphere.",

The Aquarius measurement objectives are to describe unknown features in the sea surface salinity (SSS) field, and document seasonal and interannual variations on regional and basin scales. This presentation will first describe the structure of the mean annual global salinity field compared with the previous in situ climatology and contemporary in situ measurements , including small persistent biases of opposite sign in high latitudes versus low latitudes, currently under intense investigation, as well as global and regional error statistics. Then we summarize highlights of various studies and papers submitted to the JGR-Oceans special section on satellite salinity (2014). The most prominent seasonal variations, most notably the extant and variability of the SSS signature of the Atlantic and Pacific inter-tropical convergence zones, Amazon-Orinoco and other major rivers, and other important regional patterns of seasonal variability. Lastly we will examine the trends observed during the three Sep-Aug measurement years beginning Sep2011, Sep2012 and Sep2013, respectively, in relation to ENSO and other climate indices, as the first step in analyzing interannual SSS variability. An outline for extended mission operations beyond the initial three-year prime mission will be presented.",

The Barnes Ice Cap, a remnant of Laurentide Ice Sheet, is of particular importance as it has been found to be highly sensitive to changes in summer temperature. Here we determine changes in the extent of the Barnes Ice Cap to understand its evolution from the Little Ice Age to present. Trimlines of the Barnes Ice Cap are extracted from ASTER imagery providing a maximal extent of the ice cap during the Little Ice Age. Extent changes over the past half-century are mapped and quantified with the aid of Landsat imagery and a digitized map sheet derived from 1961 photogrammetry. From these data we identify an accelerating rate of recession, with higher rates of retreat on the western side of the ice cap. Since observations began in the early 1950s there has been little change annual precipitation amounts but a warming trend in summer air temperatures. The observed accelerating rate of retreat is therefore attributed to regional changes in summer temperature.",

            "abstract": "The Ryukyu Arc occurs between the islands of Kyushu and Taiwan with approximately 1200 km in the full length. This volcanic arc is caused by subduction of the Philippine Sea plate beneath the Eurasia Plate along the Ryukyu trench, and is composed of forearc islands, chains of arc volcanoes, and a back-arc rift called Okinawa Trough. The Ryukyu Arc is commonly divided into three segments (northern, central and southern) that bounded by the Tokara Strait and the Kerama Gap, respectively (e.g., Konishi 1965; Kato et al., 1982). Sato et al. (2014) mentioned that there is no active subaerial volcano in the southwest of Iotori-shima in the Central Ryukyu Arc whereas the Northern Ryukyu Arc (i.e., the Tokara Islands) has active frontal arc volcanoes. Therefore, the existence of volcanoes and volcanotectonic history of active volcanic front in the southwestern part of the Central Ryukyu Arc are still ambiguous. Detailed geophysical and geological survey was mainly conducted using R/V Kaiyou-maru No.7 during GK12 cruise operated by the Geological Survey of Japan/National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Japan. As a result, we have found a new submarine volcanic caldera on the west of Kume-jima island, where located the southwestern part of Central Ryukyu Arc. Here, we present (1) the bathymetrical feature of this new submarine caldera for the first time and (2) the microstructural and petrological observations of volcanic rocks (20 volcanic samples in 13 dredge sites) sampled from the small volcanic cones of this caldera volcano. The dredged samples from the caldera consist of mainly rhyolite pumice with minor andesites, Mn oxides-crust and hydrothermally altered rocks. Andesite has plagioclase, olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts.\nKey words: volcanic rock, caldera, arc volcanism, active volcanic front, Kume-jima island, Ryukyu Arc",

            "abstract": "The instruments on board the CASSINI spacecraft observed large carbonaceous molecules in the upper atmosphere of Titan. How these large polyatomic molecules are synthesized in such exotic conditions is, thus far, unknown. Molecular ions, including positive and negative ions, are in relative abundance in the ionosphere of Titan. Hence, barrierless ion-molecule interactions may play a major role in guiding molecules towards each other and initiating reactions. We study these condensation pathways to determine whether they are a viable means of forming large pure hydrocarbon molecules, and nitrogen-containing carbonaceous chains, stacks, and even cyclic compounds. By employing accurate quantum chemical methods we have investigated the processes of growth, structures, nature of bonding, mechanisms, and spectroscopic properties of the ensuing ionic products after pairing small carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen-containing molecules with major ions observed in the upper atmosphere of Titan, e.g. C2H5+ and HCNH+. We have also studied the ion-neutral association pathways involving pure-carbon molecules e.g. acetylene, ethylene and other hydrocarbons, and their dissociation fragments in a plasma discharge. We have investigated how nitrogen atoms are incorporated into the carbon ring during growth. Specifically, we explored the mechanisms by which the synthesis of pyrimidine will be feasible in the atmosphere of Titan in conjunction with ion-mobility experiments. We have used accurate ab initio coupled cluster theory, Møller-Plesset perturbation theory, density functional theory, and coupled cluster theory quantum chemical methods together with large correlation consistent basis sets in these investigations. We found that a series of hydrocarbons with a specific stoichiometric composition prefers cyclic molecule formation rather than chains. Some of the association products we investigated have large oscillator strengths for charge-transfer type electronic excitations in the near infrared and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Our quantum chemistry computations complement well the results from the molecular/ion plasma experiments performed by the Laboratory Astrochemistry groups at Ames.",

            "abstract": "There is widespread concern that changes in climate and fire regime may lead to vegetation change across California, which in turn may influence watershed hydrology. Although plant cover is known to affect numerous hydrological processes, sensitivities to vegetation type and spatial arrangement of species within watersheds are not well understood. The primary objective of our research was to generate mechanistically-based projections of how potential type conversion from forested to shrub dominated systems may affect streamflow. During the 2014 growing season, we measured ecophysiological responses (plant water status and leaf gas exchange rates) of two dominant tree and shrub species to changes in seasonal water availability at two sites within the southern Sierra Nevada Critical Zone Observatory. Plant physiological observations were used to parameterize a process-based eco-hydrological model, RHESSys. This model was used to evaluate the impact of changes in seasonal water availability and vegetation type-conversion on streamflow. Based on our field observations, shrubs and trees had similar access to water through the early part of the growing season (April-early June); however, by late July, available water to shrubs was twice that of trees (shrubs, -0.55 ± 0.08 MPa; trees, -1.07 ± 0.08 MPa, p<0.05). Likewise, maximum transpiration (E) and carbon assimilation (A) rates per unit leaf area were twice as high for shrubs then trees in July (shrubs, A= 21 ± 2.3 µmol m-2 s-1, E=6.6 ± 1.8 mmol m-2 s-1; trees, A=8.2 ± 1.9 µmol m-2 s-1, E=2.4 ± 0.3 mmol m-2 s-1). Preliminary modeled changes in streamflow following simulated vegetation conversion were found to affect both the timing and amount of discharge. Controls on pre vs. post-conversion streamflow included changes in interception, rooting depth, energy balance, and plant response to changes in seasonal water availability. Our research demonstrates how linking strategic field data collection and mechanistic ecohydrologic models can be used as a robust tool for assessing the potential impact of vegetation change on the water balance of an ecosystem. This is an increasingly valuable approach to inform management decisions focused on adapting strategies based on projected changes in climate.",

            "abstract": "Ground- and aircraft-based measurements show that the seasonal amplitude of Northern Hemisphere atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations has increased by as much as 50% over the last 50 years. This increase has been linked to changes in Temperate, Boreal and Arctic ecosystem properties and processes such as enhanced photosynthesis, increased heterotrophic respiration, and expansion of woody vegetation. However, the precise causal mechanisms behind observed changes in atmospheric CO2 seasonality remain unclear. Here we show that increases in agricultural productivity, which have been largely overlooked in previous investigations, explain as much as 25% of observed changes in atmospheric CO2 seasonality, and perhaps more. Specifically, Northern Hemisphere extratropical maize, wheat, rice, and soybean production grew by 240% between 1961-2008, thereby increasing the amount of net carbon uptake by croplands during the Northern Hemisphere growing season by 0.33 Pg. Maize alone accounts for two-thirds of this change, owing mostly to agricultural intensification within concentrated production zones in the Midwestern United States and Northern China. Since a substantial portion of seasonality enhancement results from a process that is roughly neutral in terms of its impact on the terrestrial carbon sink, our results show that care must be taken when making inferences regarding the linkages between CO2 seasonality and terrestrial carbon sink dynamics. More generally, these results demonstrate how intensive management of agricultural ecosystems over the last five decades have imparted a substantial and direct fingerprint of anthropogenic activities on seasonal patterns of Northern Hemisphere atmospheric CO2.",

In this study, we evaluated the impact of soil parameters and physical process on reproducibility of hydrological process by LSM Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and RunOff (MATSIRO; Takata et al, 2003, GPC) forced by the meteorological data observed at grassland in semiarid climate in China and Mongolia.\nThe testing of MATSIRO was carried out offline mode over the semiarid grassland sites at Tongyu (44.42 deg. N, 122.87 deg. E, altitude: 184m) in China, Kherlen Bayan Ulaan (KBU; 47.21 deg. N, 108.74 deg. E, altitude: 1235m) and Arvaikheer (46.23 N, 102.82E, altitude: 1,813m) in Mongolia. Although all sites locate semiarid grassland, the climate condition is different among sites, which the annual air temperature and precipitation are 5.7 deg. C and 388mm (Tongyu), 1.2 deg.C and 180mm (KBU), and 0.4 deg. C and 245mm(Arvaikheer). We can evaluate the effect of climate condition on the model performance.\nThree kinds of experiments have been carried out, which was run with the default parameters (CTL), the observed parameters (OBS) for soil physics and hydrology, and vegetation, and refined MATSIRO with the effect of ice in thermal parameters and unfrozen water below the freezing with same parameters as OBS run (OBSr). The validation data has been provided by CEOP(http://www.ceop.net/) , RAISE(http://raise.suiri.tsukuba.ac.jp/), GAME-AAN (Miyazaki et al., 2004, JGR) for Tongyu, KBU, and Arvaikheer, respectively.\nThe reproducibility of the net radiation, the soil temperature (Ts), and latent heat flux (LE) were well reproduced by OBS and OBSr run. The change of soil physical and hydraulic parameter affected the reproducibility of soil temperature (Ts) and soil moisture (SM) as well as energy flux component especially for the sensible heat flux (H) and soil heat flux (G). The reason for the great improvement on the reproducibility of H and G by the OBSr run is likely to include the ice effect on the soil heat capacity and the thermal conductivity. The reproducibility was lower in winter than summer on the simulation of SM. The low reproducibility of winter SM is not only the performance of LSM but also the observation problem.",

            "abstract": "Within the hydrologic community, there is a growing recognition that different runoff generation mechanisms can be unified within a “fill-and-spill” or storage exceedance paradigm. However, testing this unifying paradigm requires observing watersheds at a variety of scales under their full range of storage conditions, which are difficult to observe on typical human timescales in most environments. Polar watersheds underlain by continuous permafrost provide an opportunity to address these issues, because their total capacity for water storage follows a consistent annual cycle of expansion and contraction as a direct consequence of the extreme seasonality of solar energy availability. Cryotic conditions usually limit water storage to the surface snowpack and frozen soils, but summer warming allows the shallow subsurface to progressively thaw, providing a dynamic storage reservoir that is the convolved expression of several factors, including substrate hydrologic properties, watershed structure, and stochastic precipitation. We hypothesize that the amount of remaining water storage capacity in the system directly controls the amount and timing of runoff production for a given input. We test this prediction for six hillslope watersheds in Arctic Alaska over the 2013 and 2014 summer seasons from snowmelt in May through plant senescence in mid-August. We compare water table position to runoff produced from a given storm event or series of storm events. We find that no runoff is produced until a threshold water table position is exceeded; that is, as seasonal storage changes, runoff depends on watershed storage capacity exceedance. Preliminary results suggest that once that threshold is met, hydrologic response is proportional to storage exceedance. Thus, runoff production from Arctic hillslopes can be modeled from the surface energy balance and a reasonable estimate of shallow subsurface material properties. If storage exceedance is the key control on water export from Arctic watersheds, then the state of downstream aquatic ecosystems is strongly tied with upstream changes in surface energy balance and precipitation regimes. Future analyses will relate storage exceedance and water flux to biogeochemical cycling and solute fluxes in these hillslope watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Gravity waves can dramatically impact the dynamics and energy budget of the middle and upper atmosphere due to the fact that they can transfer momentum and energy. Since the waves with specific properties will not generally be occurring throughout the entire area and time, factors that can describe the spatial and/or temporal intermittency of gravity waves should be considered in the Global Circulation Model (GCM). In this work, observation data from all-sky airglow imager is used to analyze the intermittent nature of gravity waves in mesopause region. The probability density functions (pdfs) of momentum flux show two distinct regions of distribution. Main body of pdfs follows a log-normal distribution; at the tail for larger magnitudes, they deviate from the log-normal distribution and follow a power-law distribution. Also, multi-year simulation results from Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) are used. The gravity waves drag (GWD) data is generated hourly in global range. By analyzing the pdfs of the GWD magnitudes, the global and seasonal pattern of intermittency of the gravity waves is discussed and compared with the results from the observation data.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake clustering tends to be an increasingly important part of general earthquake research especially in terms of seismic hazard assessment and earthquake forecasting and prediction approaches. The distinct identification and definition of foreshocks, aftershocks, mainshocks and secondary mainshocks is taken into account using a point based spatio-temporal clustering algorithm originating from the field of classic machine learning. This can be further applied for declustering purposes to separate background seismicity from triggered seismicity.\nThe results are interpreted and processed to assemble 3D-(x,y,t) earthquake clustering maps which are based on smoothed seismicity records in space and time. In addition, multi-dimensional Gaussian functions are used to capture clustering parameters for spatial distribution and dominant orientations. Clusters are further processed using methodologies originating from geostatistics, which have been mostly applied and developed in mining projects during the last decades. A 2.5D variogram analysis is applied to identify spatio-temporal homogeneity in terms of earthquake density and energy output. The results are mitigated using Kriging to provide an accurate mapping solution for clustering features.\nAs a case study, seismic data of New Zealand and the United States is used, covering events since the 1950s, from which an earthquake cluster catalogue is assembled for most of the major events, including a detailed analysis of the Landers and Christchurch sequences.",

            "abstract": "Western and central Mexico is segmented by several regional structural systems that bound crustal blocs. Paleomagnetic data from the western and eastern Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt as well as from adjacent terrains are still scarce which limits analyses of the both local and regional-scale tectonic evolution. A combined radiometric and paleomagnetic survey performed on late Cretaceous lava flows demonstrate that vertical-axis rotations characterize the paleotectonic evolution of western-central Mexico. The characteristic paleomagnetic directions determined in this study may be considered of primary (thermoremanent) origin. Multicomponent demagnetization plots were observed in some cases.\nIn general, the polarity obtained for the flows studied is consistent with their stratigraphic position and with the radiometric age determination. The mean inclination is in reasonably good agreement with the expected inclination for the Late Creataceous, as derived from reference poles given by Besse and Courtillot (2002) for the North American craton. The declination, however, is quite different from that expected, which suggests a possible counterclockwise tectonic rotation of at least 12º.\nAceptable palointensity determinations were obtained for only eleven individual samples from two basaltic lava flows. The mean virtual dipole moment (VDM) obtained in this study is 4.2 ± 1.2 _ 1022 A m2, which is almost half than the present geomagnetic field strength.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the physical properties of a catchment (form) and climatic forcing of precipitation and energy control how water is partitioned, stored, and conveyed through a catchment (function). Hydrologic Landscapes (HLs) were previously developed across Oregon and describe climatic and physical properties for over 5000 assessment units. This approach was then extended to the three Pacific Northwest states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho (PNW HL). The HLs were developed using the National Hydrography Dataset’s WBD HU12 scale and are comprised of classification components describing climate, climate seasonality, aquifer permeability, terrain, and soil permeability. To compare the PNW HL classification to catchment hydrologic behavior, HLs were aggregated to catchment scale to compare against the input/output of water in the catchment. HL aggregation must preserve information on the location of the HL within the catchment outlet (upstream vs. downstream) and properties of that HL (i.e. water source vs. sink). Catchment function was investigated by use of hydrologic signatures, which are attributes of long-term time series of water into and out of the catchment. Signatures include Runoff Ratio, Baseflow Index, Snow Ratio, and Recession Coefficients. This study has three primary objectives: 1) derivation of hydrologic signatures to capture the hydrologic behavior for catchments in the Pacific Northwest: 2) development of methodology to aggregate HLs to the catchment scale; and 3) statistical analysis of signature values and trends with respect to aggregated HL classification. We hypothesize that we will find: 1) strong relationships between aggregated HLs and hydrologic signatures; 2) signatures related to water balance are explained by climatic conditions; and 3) signatures describing flow paths are predicted by terrain, soil, and aquifer permeability. This study examined 230 catchments to achieve objectives and test hypotheses stated.",

Successful use of the Picarro G2508 for continuous soil flux measurements in a variety of ecosystem types has already been demonstrated.\nMost recently, Picarro is developing a real-time processing software to simplify chamber measurements of soil flux with the G2508 CRDS. The new Realtime Chamber Flux Processor is designed to work with all chamber types and sizes, and provides real-time flux values of N2O, CO2 & CH4.\nThe software features include chamber sequence table, flexible data tagging feature, ceiling concentration measurement shut-off parameter, user-defined run-time interval, temperature/pressure input for field monitoring and volumetric conversion, and manual flux measurement start/stop override.\nRealtime Chamber Flux Processor GUI interface is presented, and results from a variety of sampling designs are demonstrated to emphasize program flexibility and field capability.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimatologists reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST) from corals by sampling boulder-shaped massive corals along the vertical growth direction or the assumed maximum growth axis to avoid kinetic effects related to variations in growth rate. Microatolls are a morphological variation of long-lived massive coral colonies that grow laterally just beneath the ocean surface. Cross-sections from five Siderastrea siderea microatolls, 35 km west of Port-au-Prince Haiti (18.479070°N, 72.668659°W), were recovered following the 2010 earthquake. Two colonies (10BELOC4 and 10LEO1), ~5.5 km apart, were sampled along paths oriented at 25° and 91° from the vertical growth direction; respectively, to determine differences in path orientation and between colonies. We find mean linear extension rates are similar (4.2 ±1.2 mm/year–1, 1σ for 10LEO1; and 4.3 ±1.3 mm/year–1, 1σ for 10BELOC4) with no significant correlation between intercolony linear extension rates (r=0.52, p=0.18, n=8) or between linear extension rates and SST (r=–0.20, p=0.31, n=29 for 10LEO1). We find similar intercolony seasonal variability in coral Sr/Ca (1.35 ±0.04 mmol/mol, 1σ for 10LEO1; and 1.41 ±0.05 mmol/mol, 1σ for 10BELOC4) and no significant difference (p<0.001) in mean coral Sr/Ca (8.90 ±0.05 mmol/mol, 1σ for 10LEO1; and 8.83 ±0.06 mmol/mol, 1σ for 10BELOC4; n=100). Calibration of coral Sr/Ca to OISST for the 1º grid including our study site results in a slope similar to previous studies using boulder-shaped S. siderea colonies (Sr/Ca=7.91–0.04(SST), r2=0.96, n=57). These results suggest that reliable SST reconstructions that span many centuries can be derived from large S. siderea microatolls.",

            "abstract": "In the present study, we report the crustal thickness and mechanical properties along the Lesser Antilles Arc by employing receiver function technique. To do so, we collected teleseismic data, available in the IRIS online database, recorded by several broadband stations that have been deployed in the arc. The selected events have epicentral distances from 30° to 90°, and magnitudes of 5.7 or larger. Unfortunately, we were only able to apply the method to 9 of the 25 stations deployed in the arc, due to nosy data (possibly because of the effects of strong winds, waves and tides), recording problems, and short recording periods. We used the recordings from P-to-S conversion in order to estimate the crustal thickness by depth staking the computed receiver functions. We also analyzed crustal reverberations found in some stations to estimate the crustal thickness and the average crustal Vp/Vs ratio, as well as the Poisson’s ratio, by applying H-k matrix-search methodology. We found large variations in the crustal thickness along the arc: the thinnest crust (~22 km) was found in Barbuda Island at the northern-exterior section of the arc, while the thickest crust (~36.8 km) was found in Anguilla Island at the northern-central section of the arc. In general, the northern sections of the arc have a thicker crust with a mean value of ~29 km, while the southern sections have a thinner crust with a mean value ~23 km, and this might be related to the general asymmetry of the arc (the northern part is much more active and complex than the southern part). Poisson’s ratio estimated along the arc vary from 0.266 (Vp/Vs=1.777) to 0.3 (Vp/Vs=1.87) which are relatively consistent with mafic island arc origin, although the carbonatic cover of the island might influence the lower values in the range, while higher values could be associated to the old Cretaceous basement of some of the northern islands. We hope to be able collect more information from relatively new stations of the West Indies IPGP to better estimate the crustal properties of the arc and further understand the role of the subduction asymmetry in the arc crustal topography and, eventually, characterize the isostasy of the arc using gravimetric data.",

A LAS system is installed over the rooftop of two buildings with a distance between receiver and transmitter of 535 m, an effective height of 18.4 m, a wind speed sensor at 25.0 m high. The path-averaged building height, roughness length, and displacement length between the receiver and transmitter are 9.2 m, 0.4 m, and 7.1 m, respectively. The Bowen ratio computed at every 30 minute interval by the wind speed and air temperature at 10 and 18 m above the rooftop is found to be well correlated with meteorological variables such as net radiation and mixing ratio. Therefore, it is parameterized as a function of mixing ratio and net radiation. The resulting parameterization is applied to estimate the SHF by LAS. The Monin-Obukhov similarity universal function should be changed according to the atmospheric stability using the sign of net radiation sampled at the same time. It is found that the resulting sensible heat fluxes are available under all atmospheric stability and are much improved compared with those by eddy covariance method.",

Although recent spacecraft measurements are revealing solar-wind interaction with the lunar crustal fields on the dayside, plasma signatures around crustal fields on the night side have not been fully studied yet. Here we show evidence of plasma trapping on the closed field lines of the lunar crustal fields in the solar-wind wake, using SELENE (Kaguya) plasma and magnetic field data obtained at 14-15 km altitude from the lunar surface. In contrast to expectation on plasma cavity formation at the strong crustal fields, electron flux is enhanced over Crisium Antipode (CA) anomaly which is one of the strongest lunar crustal fields. The enhanced electron fluxes over the CA anomaly are characterised by (1) occasional bi-directional field-aligned beams in the lower energy range (< 150 eV) and (2) a medium energy component (150-300 eV) that has a double loss-cone distribution that represents bounce motion between the two footprints of the crustal magnetic fields. The low-energy electrons on the closed field lines may come from the lunar night side surface, while supply mechanism of medium-energy electrons on the closed field line remains to be solved. We also report that a density cavity in the wake is observed not above the strongest magnetic field but in its vicinity.",

Therefore, P availability can impact primary productivity. Here we quantify dissolved and particulate P compounds and trace P sources and cycling in Monterey Bay over the course of a year. This time series gives insights into monthly and seasonal variations in the surface water chemistry of this region. Preliminary characterization of seawater samples involves measuring total P and soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P NMR) is used to determine the chemical structure of organic phosphorus compounds present in surface seawater. The isotopic signature of phosphatic oxygen (δ18Op) is used as a proxy for studying P cycling and sources. Oxygen isotope ratios in phosphate are determined by continuous-flow isotope mass ratio spectrometry (CF-IRMS) following purification of dissolved P from seawater samples and precipitation as silver phosphate. We expect to observe seasonal changes in P concentrations, as well as differences in organic P composition and P sources. The chemical structure of organic P compounds will affect their bioavailability and thus the extent to which they can fuel primary productivity in Monterey Bay. δ18Op will reflect source signatures and provide information on turnover rates of P in surface waters. Results from this work will provide valuable insights into seasonal changes in P cycling in surface waters and have important implications for understanding primary productivity in the Monterey Bay ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "Decreases in orbitally-forced summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere have coincided with downward trends in greenhouse gases (GHG) during the late stages of previous interglacials, with both climate forcings acting collectively to reduce the global temperature. In the last several thousand years of the current (Holocene) interglacial, however, while summer insolation has decreased, there was a reversal of the downward trends in CH4 and CO2 concentration around 5,000 to 7,000 years ago. Because this anomalous behavior was presumably due to anthropogenic carbon emissions from early agriculture, the Holocene provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the relative strength of competing climate forcings of orbital and greenhouse gas changes. Here we use the 1-degree, fully coupled Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) to investigate the climatic response to combined forcing from orbital and GHG changes since the mid-Holocene. Six equilibrium CCSM4 runs, 1,000 years apart, were performed to simulate the climate changes of the past 6,000 years.\nOur coupled CCSM4 simulations with combined forcing show that the simulated global mean annual surface temperature increases gradually during the past 6,000 years, following the gradual increase of GHG since the middle Holocene. Despite this global warming trend, the simulated Northern Hemisphere annual snow depths increase by over 20%. Orbital forcing causes a pronounced reduction of seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude regions, with increasingly cooler summers and shorter growing seasons likely presenting a challenge for the development of early agriculture. The simulated annual and summer precipitation decreases significantly over the Sahara region, with major reductions occurring between 5,000 and 4,000 years ago. Changes in hydrologic budgets also occur in parts of Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The mechanisms of these simulated Holocene climate changes due to the competing orbital and greenhouse gas changes will be discussed with the comparison to PMIP simulations and TraCE-21K transient simulations.",

            "abstract": "In order to achieve a turbulent dynamo in the laboratory, we propose to use eutectic Gallium-Indium alloy (eGaIn) with suspended magnetic particles. One of the key challenges is to quantify the magnetic properties of the suspensions, such as the magnetic susceptibility. We measure the susceptibility of materials in both suspension and powder forms. The effective susceptibility is much smaller than the true material susceptibility due to the demagnetization field inside the body resulting from the long-range nature of the dipolar force acting between individual magnetic moments. The demagnetization field tends to decreases the local magnetic field inside the body. It is found that the effective susceptibility is a function of global aspect ratio of the sample (defined as the ratio of length to diameter in a cylindrical sample), local aspect ratio of individual particle, and packing fraction. The effective susceptibility increases with increasing global and local aspect ratio, and packing fraction. The predicted effective susceptibility based on a model of the demagnetization effect in powders (Skomski et al. 2007) is tested against our measured data. The model, which incorporates three affecting factors, can describe powders with relatively high packing fraction (>40%). For powders with low packing fraction (<40%), the measured susceptibility deviates from the model. We propose a correction of the model for the magnetic samples. The new model turns out to quantify the measured effective susceptibility of both solids and powders, which cover a wide range of aspect ratio (from 3 to 56) and packing fraction (from 4% to 45%). The present studies may also be useful to understand the effects of magnetic material distributions in biasing magnetic measurements in rock samples that are used in studies of paleomagnetism for example.",

It is quickly attached to aerosols after its formation, becoming a useful tool to study the dynamics of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Long-term measurements of the spatial and temporal variation of 7Be allows assessment of the influence of these factors. Data of 7Be concentrations in rainfall, air surface, soil and sediments are very well reported in Northern Hemisphere; however these same results are limited in Southern Hemisphere. During a period of 13 years, from October 2001 to October 2014, 7Be concentration was measured every 15 days in surface air at Instituto de Pesquisas Energéticas e Nucleares (IPEN), in the city of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. IPEN campus is located approximately 10 km west from downtown of the city of São Paulo, which is situated on a plateau in Southeastern Brazil, at latitude 23°33’58.27”S and longitude 46°44’14.82”W and an average altitude of 760m above sea level. The climate in the area is temperate tropical with dry period in winter and rainy in summer. The concentrations of 7Be in air filters were measured by non-destructive g-ray spectrometry using a coaxial Be-layer HPGe detector with 15% relative efficiency and live counting time ranged from 100,000s to 250,000 s. The results obtained were correlated to seasons, rainfall, temperature and sunspot number. The concentrations displayed clearly seasonal variations with higher values in spring and summer time and with the amount of precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is a burning issue of our time. It is critical to know the consequences of choosing “business as usual” vs. mitigating our emissions for impacts e.g. ecosystem disruption, sea-level rise, floods and droughts. To make predictions we must model realistically each component of the climate system. The ocean must be modeled carefully as it plays a critical role, including transporting heat and storing heat and dissolved carbon dioxide. Modeling the ocean realistically in turn requires physically based parameterizations of key processes in it that cannot be explicitly represented in a global climate model. One such process is vertical mixing.\nThe turbulence group at NASA-GISS has developed a comprehensive new vertical mixing scheme (GISSVM) based on turbulence theory, including surface convection and wind shear, interior waves and double-diffusion, and bottom tides. The GISSVM is tested in stand-alone ocean simulations before being used in coupled climate models. It is also being upgraded to more faithfully represent the physical processes.\nTo help assess mixing schemes, students use data from NASA-GISS to create visualizations and calculate statistics including mean bias and rms differences and correlations of fields. These are created and programmed with MATLAB. Results with the commonly used KPP mixing scheme and the present GISSVM and candidate improved variants of GISSVM will be compared between stand-alone ocean models and coupled models and observations.\nThis project introduces students to modeling of a complex system, an important theme in contemporary science and helps them gain a better appreciation of climate science and a new perspective on it. They also gain familiarity with MATLAB, a widely used tool, and develop skills in writing and understanding programs. Moreover they contribute to the advancement of science by providing information that will help guide the improvement of the GISSVM and hence of ocean and climate models and ultimately our understanding and prediction of climate.\nThe PI is both a member of the turbulence group at NASA-GISS and an associate professor at Medgar Evers College of CUNY, a minority serving institution in an urban setting in central Brooklyn.\nThis Project is supported by NSF award AGS-1359293 REU site: CUNY/GISS Center for Global Climate Research.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind may be heated non-adiabatically by Joule dissipation of coherent current structures or by wave-particle interaction with kinetic waves. In high-speed solar wind, where current structures of tangential-discontinuity type are rare and Alfven-like waves are abundant, wave-particle interaction may be a promising candidate for the heating mechanism. Here we address how the solar wind protons are heated parallel and perpendicularly based on the observations of proton velocity distributions and kinetic wave fluctuations from the WIND spacecraft. It is shown that solar wind protons consist of anisotropic core and beam populations with a relative field-aligned drift speed of ~VA between them. Both quasi-parallel left-handed Alfven-cyclotron waves (LH-ACWs) and quasi-perpendicular right-handed Alfven-cyclotron waves / kinetic Alfven waves (RH-ACWs/KAWs) are also identified. It seems that the proton velocity distribution contours may be shaped by left-cyclotron resonance with quasi-parallel LH-ACWs for its anisotropic core components, Landau resonance with quasi-perpendicular KAWs for its beam drift, and right-cyclotron resonance with quasi-perpendicular RH-ACWs for its anisotropic beam component. Plasma instability is also investigated from the data, which shows that the core component anisotropy is usually unstable and may be responsible for the observed LH-ACWs with enhanced fluctuations; whereas the beam drift is stable and no RH-fast/whistler waves are observed. Moreover, the solar wind protons are observed, with the unprecedented cadence of 3s, to be highly dynamic in their velocity distributions with an apparent alternation between the stretching and contracting of the drifted beam, which may be connected with amplitude intermittency of associated waves.",

The results of this project are to be submitted to the Mayor of Los Angeles at the Great ShakeOut on October 16, 2014. The ShakeOut scenario detailed how the expected cascade of failures in a big earthquake could lead to significant delays in disaster recovery that could create financial losses that greatly exceed the direct losses in the event. The goal of the seismic resilience plan is to:\nprotect the lives of residents during earthquakes\nimprove the capacity of the City to respond to the earthquake \nprepare the City to recover quickly after the earthquake so as to protect the economy of the City and all of southern California\nTo accomplish these goals, the project addresses three areas of seismic vulnerability that were identified in the original ShakeOut Scenario:\nPre-1980 buildings that present an unacceptable risk to the lives of residents, including “non-ductile reinforced concrete,” and “soft-first-story” buildings\nWater system infrastructure (including impact on firefighting capability)\nCommunications infrastructure\nThe critical science needed to support policy decisions is to understand the probable consequences to the regional long-term economy caused by decisions to undertake (or not) different levels of mitigation. The arguments against mitigation are the immediate financial costs, so a better understanding of the eventual benefit is required. However, the direct savings rarely justify the mitigation costs, so the arguments in favor of mitigation are driven by the potential for cascading failures and the potential to trigger the type of long term reduction in population and economic activity that has occurred in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina.",

            "abstract": "Subglacial discharge at the grounding line of marine-terminating glaciers plays an important role in subaqueous melting, calving and, in turn, ice dynamic change from back-stress perturbations. Subglacial discharge (or runoff) can directly melt glacier termini as freshwater plumes rise buoyantly and entrain warm seawater at depth. Runoff can also impact fjord circulation and thus heat transport to the terminus face. As a result, it is important to understand the spatio-temporal distribution in submarine runoff at the grounding line of marine-terminating glaciers. This information may prove critical for predicting changes in the terminus position and shape through time, as the rate of submarine melt is predicted to vary nonlinearly on the maximum subglacial discharge, and not just its annual volume. Here, we link a predictive model of subglacial water routing to observations of subglacial discharge (both from satellite remote sensing and multibeam bathymetry) for three tidewater glaciers in central West Greenland. Our predictive model identifies the location of several large subglacial channels as point sources for discharge at the grounding line. Channel locations are confirmed through observations of turbid sediment plume formation, polynya formation within the ice mélange, localized thermal undercutting of the calving face and bathymetric morphology of the terminus face and sea floor. We examine the identified subglacial channels in terms of their impact on ice front position over six melt seasons and find that for some glaciers the largest seasonal ice front retreat occurs in sectors that have the most active subglacial discharge. Overall, we find that while subglacial water is routed through complex paths inland, its outlet at the terminus is ultimately controlled by the geometry of the near-terminus region. The outlets remain fixed in space over long time periods for those glaciers not experiencing rapid retreat.",

As the world’s population in urban regions is expected to increase from over 50% now to 70% by 2050, monitoring the temporal trends of urban GHG emissions are necessary to verify regulation policy. Since megacities tend to have large spatially and temporally varying GHG emission characteristics, it is important to perform measurements which provide continuous spatio-temporal coverage of the domain. In this study, we demonstrate the ability to track major greenhouse gases, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) using ground-based remote sensing technique from Mount Wilson.\nSince 2010, in Los Angeles, a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) has been deployed on Mount Wilson to measure CO2, CH4, carbon monoxide (CO), the combustion tracer, and other tracer gases using reflected sunlight in the near-infrared spectral regions. Combining the unique vista from Mount Wilson and high-precision measurements from the FTS, the slant column abundances of these trace gases above and within the urban dome of Los Angeles are acquired. Within the urban dome, continuous daytime temporal and spatial measurements are recorded for 28 reflection points which are strategically located across the basin. Here we analyze the path-averaged dry air mixing ratios XCH4, XCO2 and XCO acquired by the FTS during a three-year period from 2011 to 2014. Using tracer-to-tracer correlation analysis, we investigate the ratios of XCH4:XCO2, XCH4:XCO and XCO:XCO2 in excess of the background values. Significant spatio-temporal variability in all three ratios is observed across the Los Angeles megacity during this measurement period. We then derive the top-down estimates of basin total CH4 and CO2 emissions between 2011 and 2014 using the existing bottom-up emission database of CO2and CO, and compare our estimates to the emissions reported by the state government and previous studies.\nCopyright 2014.

A total of five models are developed; they evolve from an existing four-carbon (C) pool model to models with additional C pools and recently developed models with explicit representations of soil moisture controls on C degradation and microbial uptake rates. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with generalized likelihood function (not Gaussian) are used to estimate posterior parameter distributions of the models, and the posterior parameter samples are used to evaluate probabilities of the models. The models with explicit representations of soil moisture controls outperform the other models. The models with additional C pools for accumulation of degraded C in the dry zone of the soil pore space result in a higher probability of reproducing the observed Birch pulses.

Red Hill Studio is also developing an app which is an aid for making time series and repeat photography. The Now & Then Cam app will allow scientists and citizens to take closely aligned repeat photos by overlaying the iPad/iPhone’s camera image on top of an archival photo. This guides the photographer back towards the original location of the archival shot – leading to a more carefully aligned repeat photograph.\nThe developers hope this app will contribute to both scientific and artistic creation of time-series photographs, an important and persuasive visualization of change.\nThe Painting with Time and Now & Then Cam apps build upon a traveling museum exhibition, Playing with Time, and an international documentary special, Exploring Time, that were developed by Red Hill Studios under grants from the National Science Foundation. The app programmers, Charlie Brown and J.A. Nelson, use Objective C to create fluid, responsive interfaces with no distracting latencies or delays.

            "abstract": "The Central Andean Plateau (CAP), as defined by the 3 km elevation contour, extends over 1,800 km along the active South American Cordilleran margin reaching a maxim width around 400 km near the Bolivian Orocline making it second only to the Tibetan Plateau in geographic extent. First-order questions about principle segments of the lithospheric structure of the northern CAP remain underdeveloped. As part of the seismological component of the Central Andean Uplift and the Geodynamics of High Topography (CAUGHT) project, we image the crustal and lithospheric structure beneath the northern Central Andean Plateau by jointly inverting surface wave dispersion measured from ambient noise and two-plane wave tomography for a S-wave velocity model of the northern CAP. First-order robust features of our S-wave velocity model include a low-velocity (<4.4 km/s) upper mantle wedge under the Subandes extending east thickening towards the Chaco. Directly under the low-velocity wedge, a high-velocity (>4.5 km/s) eastward dipping feature in contact with the Moho below the eastern-most Altiplano reaches a maximum depth of ~160 km. Previous tomography studies have interpreted this high-velocity feature as the western extent of the Brazilian Craton. Additionally, we observe a strong inverse correlation with topography and mean lithospheric Vs east of the Eastern Cordillera excluding asthenosphere inflow from a foundering lithosphere as a possible explanation for the low-velocity wedge. We combine our model with geochemical studies that delineate two lithospheric mantle blocks and suggest the transition from the eastward dipping high-velocity feature to the low-velocity wedge is the mantle signature of suturing the Arequuipa/Antofalla terrane to Amazonia during the Grenville-Sunsás Orogeny. This interpretation of an intact upper plate lithosphere is inconsistent with recent lithospheric foundering in this region.",

            "abstract": "Due to the extent of Mars’ exosphere and the large gyroradii of some heavy planetary ions, it is expected that some atmospheric ions will encounter the bow shock. However, the effect that the bow shock has on these heavy ions is relatively unstudied. Mars Express (MEX) ion data is examined to determine whether significant differences exist in the velocity space distributions of energetic planetary ions inside and outside of the shock. To allow for determination of the solar wind motional electric field (Esw) using Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) magnetometer data, the study is focused on the time interval from early 2004 to late 2006 when MEX and MGS overlapped. For each 192 second measurement, an average velocity is assigned to heavy ions at high energies (> 2 keV). The possibility that there is turbulence in the magnetosheath altering the paths of heavy pickup ions will be tested by comparing flight directions relative to the direction of Esw in the magnetosheath to flight directions relative to the Esw direction upstream of the bow shock.",

            "abstract": "The source of plasmaspheric hiss has been an outstanding problem in inner magnetospheric radiation belt physics since the discovery of this whistler-mode emission. The generation mechanism for plasmaspheric hiss has been suggested to come from one of three possible mechanisms: 1) local generation and amplification, 2) whistlers from lightning, and 3) chorus emissions which have refracted into the plasmasphere. The latter two mechanisms are external sources which produce an incoherent hiss signature as the original waves mix in a stochastic manner, propagating in both directions along the background magnetic field. In contrast, local generation of plasmaspheric hiss within the plasmasphere should produce a signature of waves propagating away from the source region. We report observations from the Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science (EMFISIS) Waves insturment on the Van Allen Probes that clearly indicate that the Poynting flux associated with plasmaspheric hiss is frequently propagating away from the equator in the outer region of the plasmasphere. Initial statistics suggest that for more than 40% of the orbits of the Van Allen Probes, the plasmaspheric hiss is generated by a local source within the plasmasphere. We present examples of the signature of locally generated plasmaspheric hiss and show additional statistics of locally generated hiss occurrence.",

            "abstract": "We present results from three-dimensional (3D) inversion of EarthScope long-period MT data from the north-central USA, to map resistivity from the crust to mantle asthenosphere in the area surrounding the midcontinent rift (MCR). We employed the Modular system for Electromagnetic Inversion (ModEM) for 3D modeling and inversion to invert the full impedance tensors and vertical field transfer functions from 222 stations with 26 periods (11 - 7281 seconds). We used a strategy that reduced the smoothing parameters for layers shallower than 2 km, to improve data fit, and better allow for near surface static shift effects. This inversion strategy pushed resistivity variations to the shallower layers with less smoothing, resulting in cleaner images of deeper structures. The MCR, the most pronounced feature in gravity and magnetic map of the North American continent, is clearly imaged at shallow depths, with conductive flanking sedimentary basins prominent. However, the most striking conductive anomalies are two elongate E-W conductive features in the crust, which are readily identified with two distinct Proterozoic suture zones, one aligned with the Niagara Fault zone (NFz), and the second with the Spirit Lake tectonic zone (SLtz). Vertical sections show that NFz anomaly dips to the south, extending from the surface through the Moho, and at least weakly into the mantle lithosphere. The imaged dip is consistent with the sense of subduction inferred for the Penokean orogeny (~1.85 Ga). Meanwhile, the SLtz anomaly dips to the north, consistent with the sense of subduction associated with Yavapai accretion (~1.75 Ga). This anomaly has little expression in the upper crust, but also extends into the mantle. The 1.1 Ga MCR cuts both anomalies vertically. The uppermost mantle layers are mostly resistive, with reduced (~20 ohm-m) resistivities at depths of about 200 km, consistent with seismic estimates of aesthenospheric depths. Our results provide further support for the suggestion of previous studies that high conductivities in Paleoproterozoic suture zones result from carbon and sulfides accumulated in a foredeep environment, subsequently emplaced, graphitized and concentrated by subduction related deformation.\nB.

This study investigates the extent of soil hydrophobicity resulting from land use changes and its impact on groundwater recharge in a century-old experimental forest surrounded by grassland in the Northern High Plains (Nebraska National Forest). Water Drop Penetration Tests (WDPT) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were used to investigate soil hydrophobicity on 50 cm soil cores collected from experimental plots beneath 5 land cover types. WDPT analysis indicated that most near-surface soils (0–12.5 and 12.5–25 cm) beneath pine plots were moderately to strongly hydrophobic. NMR spectroscopy analysis comparing ratios of hydrophobic (3.2–0.5 and 8.5–6.5 ppm) to hydrophilic (6.5–3.2 ppm) regions suggests that surface soils beneath the plantations were uniformly more hydrophobic than grasslands (by ~30 to 260%). Unsaturated zone soil cores were collected from beneath each experimental plot for comparison of hydrophobicity with recharge rates based on chloride and sulfate mass balance. Recharge estimates beneath the plantations (4–10 mm yr-1) represent reductions of 86–94% relative to the surrounding native grassland, suggesting a link between soil hydrophobicity and reduced infiltration beneath the plantations.",

            "abstract": "Recent work in modern and ancient systems has shown a range of characteristic floodplain sedimentation patterns acting over a range of temporal and spatial scales. In aggradational fluvial systems floodplain sedimentation style influences where rivers relocate during avulsion, which in turn influences the distribution of channel-belt sandstones in stratigraphy over long timescales. Exploring the link between floodplain-sedimentation patterns and avulsions is therefore important for both predicting stratigraphic architecture and using stratigraphy to interpret paleo-floodplain sedimentation dynamics. Here we use an object-based model of basin filling to explore how different floodplain aggradation styles (including both uniform and exponential decay) affect the stratigraphic preservation of three different avulsion patterns: random (channels are equally likely to relocate anywhere on the floodplain), compensational (channels relocate to the lowest point on the floodplain), and clustered (channels relocate to a point near the previous channel position). Preliminary modeling results suggest that only clustered avulsion patterns are identifiable under uniform floodplain aggradation conditions, but that different avulsion patterns generate unique sand-body distributions under exponential floodplain sedimentation. This suggests that floodplain-aggradation styles influence how well we can interpret paleo-avulsion patterns in ancient deposits. We apply these insights to the Paleocene-Eocene Wasatch Formation in western Colorado to explore the relationship between preserved floodplain deposits and basin-scale sand-body architecture. We compare proxies for paleo-floodplain-aggradation patterns (including paleosol development, lateral continuity of paleosol horizons, and occurrence and distribution of splays) in three different members with quantitative metrics of channel-body organization at both sand-body and outcrop scales. Changes in floodplain deposits and sand-body organization between members of this formation suggest a link between floodplain-filling styles and large-scale channel-avulsion patterns.",

            "abstract": "The reduction of U(VI)aq to the insoluble U(IV) oxidation state is a relevant process for retarding U transport in the subsurface. However, experimental results have been inconclusive of whether U(VI)aq is reduced by Fe(II)aq in anoxic, homogeneous environments. Experimental and computational approaches were used here to understand mechanisms for uranyl removal from solution, focusing on whether Fe(II)aq reduces U(VI)aq via homogeneous or heterogeneous pathways. In an initially homogeneous system with 1 mM Fe(II)aq and 0.16 mM U(VI)aq, U(VI)aq concentrations dropped to 10-5 M in the first hour of reaction due to (meta)schoepite precipitation. Similarly, at a lower U(VI)aq concentration (0.02 mM), U(VI) precipitation occurred but more slowly. XRD and XPS analyses of the solids confirmed partially reduced (meta)schoepite phases, where 25-30% of U was reduced. Thus U(VI)aq was removed from solution by precipitation first, enabling partial reduction of the solid U phase via heterogeneous pathways. Ab initio methods and Marcus Theory were used to calculate the electron-transfer (ET) rate of U(VI)aq reduction to U(V)aq by Fe(II)aq. When U(VI)aq and Fe(II)aq were modelled as outer-sphere (OS) complexes, the reaction occurred as a proton-coupled ET reaction. Modelling ET to occur before proton-transfer (PT), the redox products were thermodynamically unfavorable (+102 kJ/mol) and ET was the rate–limiting step (10–12 s–1). If ET and PT occurred concurrently, the redox products were energetically favorable (–19 to -35 kJ/mol) though the reaction was still kinetically inhibited; the rate is effectively 0 s-1. In contrast, ET for an inner-sphere (IS) complex was thermodynamically favorable (–16 kJ/mol) and significantly faster (104 to 108 s‑1). Significant thermodynamic and kinetic barriers were associated with the OS-complex becoming an IS-complex, such as dehydration of the first solvation shell (+96 kJ/mol) and hydrolysis of Fe(II), preventing IS-complex formation. These results substantiate studies where the reduction of U(VI)aq by Fe(II)aq occurs via heterogeneous pathways. Further studies on this system involving the impact of Al- and Fe-oxide minerals are underway to explore heterogeneous redox pathways and the effects of semiconducting and insulating minerals on redox rates.",

Laplace, the Moon’s rotational and tidal bulges are significantly larger than expected, given the Moon’s present orbital and rotational state. This excess deformation has been ascribed to a fossil figure, frozen in when the Moon was closer to the Earth. However, the observed figure (quantified by the Moon’s moments of inertia, or degree-2 gravity field) is only consistent with an eccentric and/or non-synchronous orbit, contrary to our understanding of the Moon’s formation and evolution. Here, we show that lunar mascons and impact basins have a significant contribution to the observed lunar figure. Removing their contribution reveals a misaligned fossil figure consistent with an early epoch of true polar wander driven by the formation of the South Pole-Aitken Basin. This mass anomaly corrected figure is also consistent with an elastic lithosphere that formed while the Moon was on an early low-eccentricity, synchronous lunar orbit. This new self-consistent model solves a long-standing problem in planetary science, and will inform future studies of the Moon’s dynamical evolution and early dynamo, and motivates future exploration of South Pole-Aitken.",

            "abstract": "Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary sections in eastern New Zealand record an alternating succession of pronounced abundance changes in two peridinioid (primarily heterotrophic) genera following the K/Pg boundary event. In Canterbury and East Coast Basin sections, two phases of abundant Trithyrodinium evittii, the first immediately following the K/Pg boundary, are interposed by two acme intervals of Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum. While several lines of evidence suggest T. evittii was a warm-water species and P. pyrophorum flourished in cooler oceanic conditions, robust temperature records have not been available from these K/Pg boundary sections. We have completed sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions, based on glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) distributions, at mid-Waipara River, North Canterbury, from ~1 m below to 20 m above the K/Pg boundary. Changes in GDGT distribution across the K/Pg boundary indicates warming of 2–3°C, regardless of which TEX86-based proxy is used, coincident with the interval of abundant T. evittii. Detailed climatic records at the K/Pg boundary layer are hampered by intense bioturbation. Above an unconformity (at 23 cm) notable shifts in GDGT distribution indicates pronounced cooling, yielding SST estimates that are 7°C lower than the uppermost Cretaceous. The acme of P. pyrophorum corresponds with these cooler SSTs, and an unusual increase in the proportion of GDGT-2 in this interval can be attributed to cool water upwelling. The P. pyrophorum acme is also documented in distal diatom-rich siliceous sediments in Marlborough, where siliceous microfossils and element geochemistry indicate cool-water upwelling in the basal Paleocene. The second phase of abundant T. evittii, at ~2 m in Waipara, coincides with an interval of more stable SSTs that are comparable to the uppermost Cretaceous. Further discussion of the TEX86-based SST proxy and GDGT distributions will be provided in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "Air quality in East Asia has a drastic temporal and spatial variability. The rapid economic growth in the last three decades enhanced the increase of anthropogenic emission of air pollutions, and caused deterioration of the air quality in both source and downwind regions. The unprecedented heavy PM­2.5 pollution over the central China in January 2013 records the maximum PM2.5 concentration of 996 μg/m3 and raised critical environmental issues (e.g., mortality, human health, social activity and trans-boundary transport, etc.). Recently, efforts to reduce anthropogenic emissions (e.g., emission regulations and improvements of emission factors and removal efficiencies) decelerate their growth rates. In fact, Asian SO2 emission is estimated to be reducing from 2007 [Kurokawa et al., 2013]. However, growth rates other pollutant emissions (e.g., NOx and PM10) still remain in high.\nTo understand the life cycle of pollutants (emission, transport, reaction and deposition) and their temporal and spatial variation, an integrated analysis using observation and numerical model (chemical transport model; CTM) is useful. In this study, we installed a comprehensive observation operator system, which converts model results into observed variables, into the GEOS-Chem CTM. A long-term (2005–2013) full-chemistry simulation over East Asia was performed, and simulation results are translated to tropospheric NO2 and SO2 columns and vertical profiles of aerosol extinction coefficient equivalent to satellite measurements and in-situ lidar network observations. Combining CTM and observations, and integrating analyses of aerosols over the downwind region and their precursors over the source region will provide important insights into temporal and spatial variation of air pollutants over East Asia.",

            "abstract": "Cold, low-density diapirs arising from hydrated mantle and/or subducted sediments on the top of subducting slabs may transport key chemical signatures from the slab to the shallow source region for arc magmas. These chemical signatures are strongly influenced by melting of this buoyant material during its ascent. However, to date there have been relatively few quantitative models to constrain melting and melt segregation in an ascending diapir, as well as the induced geochemical signature.\nHere, we use a two-phase Darcy-Stokes-energy model to investigate thermal evolution, melting, and melt segregation in buoyant diapirs as they ascend through the mantle wedge. Using a simplified 2-D axi-symmetric circular geometry we investigate diapir evolution in three scenarios with increasing complexity. First, we consider a case without melting in which the thermal evolution of the diapir is controlled solely by thermal diffusion during ascent. Our results show that for most cases (e.g., diapir radius ≤ 3.7 km and diapir generation depths of ~ 75 km) thermal diffusion times are smaller than the ascent time—implying that the diapir will thermal equilibrate with the mantle wedge. Secondly, we parameterize melting within the diapir, but without melt segregation, and add the effect of latent heat to the thermal evolution of the diapir. Latent heat significantly buffers heating of the diapir. For the diapir with radius ~3.7 km, the heating from the outside is slowed down ~30%. Finally, we include melt segregation within the diapir in the model. Melting initiates at the boundaries of the diapir as the cold interior warms in response to thermal equilibration with the hot mantle wedge. This forms a high porosity, high permeability rim around the margin of the diapir. As the diapir continues to warm and ascend, new melts migrate into this rim and are focused upward, accumulating at the top of the diapir. The rim thus acts like an annulus melt channel isolating the central part of diapir from the hot exterior and leading to even slower heating rates compared to cases without melt segregation.\nThese model results suggest that the melting and melt migration in an ascending diapir will segregate the interior from the outer rim, and may generate strong chemical gradients across the diapir.",

            "abstract": "The real spherical harmonics form a compact, simple and commonly used set of basis functions for describing fields in tomographic inverse problems. It is therefore often useful to perform spherical harmonic analysis on data to represent it in the spherical harmonic parametrisation. Most existing algorithms, based on Fourier transforms, require that data be interpolated to a regular grid; this is not appropriate for the sparse, irregularly distributed data found in many geophysical applications. Instead, this work casts the problem of spherical harmonic analysis as an inverse problem, and applies the methods of Bayesian inference to overcome regularization problems in the inversion. This allows irregular data to be easily handled, and directly provides error estimates for the inverted spherical harmonic parameters. Synthetic tests have shown that this method easily handles relatively large amounts of added Gaussian noise. So far, this method has been applied to estimate the power in each harmonic degree for tomographic maps of the deep mantle based on PKP-PKIKP and PcP-P differential travel times, showing that they agree at global length scales despite local heterogeneity results being heavily influenced by data coverage. This potentially allows for simple heuristic arguments to constrain the global variation in core-mantle boundary topography based on the similarity between PKP and PcP derived tomographic maps.",

            "abstract": "An important lesson on climate communication research is that there is no single way to reach out and inform the public. Different groups conceptualize climate issues in different ways and different groups have different values and assumptions. This variability makes it extremely difficult to effectively and objectively communicate climate information. One of the main challenges is the following: How do we acquire a better understanding of how values and assumptions vary across groups, including political groups? A necessary starting point is to pay close attention to the linguistic content of messages used across current popular media sources. Careful analyses of that information—including how it is realized in language for conservative and progressive media—may ultimately help climate scientists, government agency officials, journalists and others develop more effective messages. Past research has looked at partisan media coverage of climate change, but little attention has been given to the fine-grained linguistic content of such media. And when researchers have done detailed linguistic analyses, they have relied primarily on hand-coding, an approach that is costly, labor intensive, and time-consuming. Our project, building on recent work on partisan news media (Gann & Matlock, 2014; under review) uses high dimensional semantic analyses and other methods of automated classification techniques from the field of natural language processing to quantify how climate issues are characterized in media sources that differ according to political orientation. In addition to discussing varied linguistic patterns, we share new methods for improving climate communication for varied stakeholders, and for developing better assessments of their effectiveness.",

            "abstract": "Europa is planetary body with a young, tectonically active ice shell and a subsurface liquid water ocean. These characteristics make it one of the most promising places in the solar system to search for extant life beyond Earth. Conventional wisdom dictates that temperatures at the surface of Europa's ice shell are not expected to exceed 130K, which is well below the stability temperature of liquid water or brines. However, the regional or local-scale surface temperatures on Europa could be elevated due to regional or local scale heat flow anomalies as manifested by regional variations in tidal heating, recent cracks in the ice shell, or episodic eruptive plumes. Using a sophisticated ray-tracing thermal model developed for the moon and Mercury, we have explored the potential detectability of a range of heat flow anomalies on Europa from remote sensing measurements of the thermal emission and solar reflection from the Europa's surface. We find that the thermal emission signatures of potential heat flow anomalies can be differentiated from those caused by topography, roughness, exposed ice blocks and Jupiter shine. We further quantify the requirements for accuracy and signal-to-noise, as well as the requirements, for spatial, spectral and diurnal coverage, and conclude that heat flow signatures from sites of recent plume activity should be readily detectable, even if they are not currently active.",

            "abstract": "The Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) is a multidecadal mode of Pacific basin SST anomalies, and is the basin-wide, bi-hemispheric expression of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The two indices are highly correlated, but the extent to which they are merely low frequency ENSO is debated. Nonetheless, the IPO/PDO significantly influences interannual rainfall variability and drought risk across and beyond the Pacific region on multi-decadal timescales, thus an understanding of long-term IPO/PDO variability will help with assessing past and future drought risk.\nA new and highly accurate 1 ky IPO reconstruction has been produced from the Law Dome ice core (East Antarctica). Law Dome is a high accumulation site on the coast of Antarctica in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean, and the Law Dome record is directly related to atmospheric anomalies across a broad mid-latitude swathe of this region. The reconstruction utilizes both the accumulation (snowfall) and sea salt (wind proxy) records to produce a reconstruction that is highly calibrated to the instrumental IPO record from 1870-2009 and shows excellent skill (reduction of error value of 0.86).\nWe then super-imposed the 1 ky IPO on a Law Dome proxy for rainfall in eastern subtropical Australia (previously shown to represent rainfall with high significance during IPO positive phases (r =0.406–0.677, p <0.0001–0.01) to identify eight Australian ‘mega-droughts’ (dry periods >5 y duration) over the last millennium. Six mega-droughts occur between AD 1000-1320 including one 39 y drought (AD 1174–1212). Water resources and infrastructure planning in Australia has been based on very limited statistical certainty around drought risk due to the short instrumental record and lack of rainfall proxies. A recent drought (the ‘Big Dry’ ~1995-2009) brought both agricultural and urban water supplies to critically low levels, while the Murray-Darling Basin river system, which provides 65% of the water used for irrigation in Australia, was on the brink of ecosystem collapse. Clearly, decadal-scale droughts of the ‘Big Dry’ kind have occurred regularly in Australia’s past. This new reconstruction will help with assessing drought risk over the longer term in the Pacific Basin, particularly in the data-sparse Southern Hemisphere.",

Through the life cycles, the moistening processes responsible for MJO evolution is investigated by projecting the scale-separated moisture budget terms onto intraseasonal moisture anomaly and its time tendency change and by checking their correlation over their life cycles using time-decomposed wind and moisture fields. Results indicate that broad-scale advection by low-frequency and MJO flow and moisture fields are dominant moisture sources, while residual of moisture budget (-Q2) as dominant sink contributing to tendency term (propagation) and intaseasonal moisture anomaly (growth and decay). Dividing their life cycles into four phases, the two MJOs exhibit different budget balances in pre-moistening stage from the suppressed phase to cloud developing phase when low-frequency vertical motion is downward in MJO1 but upward in MJO2. The corresponding drying and moistening are balanced by negative Q2 (re-evaporation in non-raining cloud) in MJO1 and positive Q2 in MJO2. The result implies that seasonal cycle and interannual oscillations can affect the initiation of MJOs. The pre-moistening in the low-troposphere by boundary-layer moisture convergence leading the deep convection is observed but only in the cloud developing to convective phase of MJOs. Nonlinear moisture advection by synoptic disturbances and by MJOs always acts as diffusive terms. They are dominant moisture sources (sinks) in the suppress phase of MJO1 (MJO2). The above analysis is being extended to successive and primary MJO events in boreal summer and winter seasons using 10 years of data.",

On assumption that each earthquake has stick-slip patch centered in its centroid, we regard cumulative seismic slips around the centroid as representing the inter-plate dislocation. We evaluated the slips on the stick-slip patches of over-M5-class earthquakes prior to three recent mega-thrust earthquakes, the 2004 Sumatra (Mw9.2), the 2010 Chile (Mw8.8), and the 2011 Tohoku (Mw9.0) around them. Comparing the cumulative seismic slips with the plate convergence, the slips before the mega-thrust events are significantly short in large area corresponding to the size of the mega-thrust events. We also researched cumulative seismic slips after other three mega-thrust earthquakes occurred in this 100 years, the 1952 Kamchatka (Mw9.0), the 1960 Chile (Mw9.5), the 1964 Alaska (Mw9.2). The cumulative slips have been significantly short in and around the focal area after their occurrence. The result should reflect persistency of the strong or/and large inter-plate coupled area capable of mega-thrust earthquakes. We applied the same procedure to global subduction zones to find that 21 regions including the focal area of above mega-thrust earthquakes show slip deficit over large area corresponding to the size of M9-class earthquakes. Considering that at least six M9-class earthquakes occurred in this 100 years and each recurrence interval should be 500-1000 years, it would not be surprised that from five to ten times of the already known regions (30 to 60 regions) are capable of M9 class earthquakes. The 21 regions as expected M9 class focal areas in our study is less than 5 to 10 times of the known 6, some of these regions may be divided into a few M9 class focal area because they extend to much larger area than typical M9 class focal area.",

            "abstract": "Extremely large-scale river basin modelling remains a challenge for water resources planning in the developing world. Such planning is particularly difficult in the developing world because of the lack of data on both natural (climatological, hydrological) processes and complex anthropological influences. We simulate three enormous river basins located in south Asia. The Ganges-Bhramaputra and Meghna (GBM) River Basins cover an area of 1.75 million km2 associated with 6 different countries, including the Bengal delta, which is the most densely populated delta in the world with ~600 million people. We target this developing region to better understand the hydrological system and improve water management planning in these transboundary watersheds. This effort uses the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate streamflow in the GBM River Basins and assess the use of global climatological datasets for such large scale river modeling. We evaluate the utility of three global rainfall datasets to reproduce measured river discharge: the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) from NASA, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis, and the World Metrological Organization (WMO) reanalysis. We use global datasets for spatial information as well: 90m DEM from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission, 300m GlobCover land use maps, and 1000 km FAO soil map. We find that SWAT discharge estimates match the observed streamflow well (NSE=0.40-0.66, R2=0.60-0.70) when using meteorological estimates from the NCEP reanalysis. However, SWAT estimates diverge from observed discharge when using meteorological estimates from TRMM and the WMO reanalysis.",

            "abstract": "On April 1, 2014 a great thrust earthquake (Mw 8.1) occurred off Iquique, northern Chile. A remarkable foreshock sequence was observed about 2 weeks before the mainshock. Seismic source models are essentially important to reveal the relationship between the mainshock and foreshock activity. However, seismic source models for the Iquique earthquake are quite different from one another. To grasp features of this earthquake, we compared its teleseismic P-waves and found a clear directivity effect, showing that the main rupture started about 50 km southward from the mainshock epicenter. On the other hand, there is no clear directivity effect of the main phase, indicating that it is generated by a circular crack-like rupture. Our observations also suggest that the Iquique earthquake has a back propagating rupture. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a stable rupture process using conventional inversion schemes. In this study, we estimate the rupture process of the Iquique earthquake from teleseismic P-wave data applying a novel formulation that takes into account the uncertainty of Green’s function. To image the complex rupture features, including the back propagating rupture, we applied the multi-time window inversion scheme with a broad modeling time window for each space knot. The estimated source process is characterized by unilateral rupture propagation. During the first 20 s the dynamic rupture front propagated from the hypocenter to the large asperity located about 50 km southward, crossing a remarkably active foreshock area at high velocity, but small and irregular seismic moment release rate. The main rupture started 20 s after the initial break and the back propagation was observed in the remarkably active foreshock area. Our result implies that the 20 s long initial phase was likely influenced by the stress drop due to the foreshock activity near the mainshock hypocenter. Moreover, the 2-weeks long swarm-like foreshock activity migrating roughly at 5 km/day towards the mainshock hypocenter, and possibly associated slow-slip, contributed to the stress accumulation prior to the Mw 8.1 megaquake. The mainshock initial rupture phase might have triggered the rupture of the large asperity, which had large fracture energy.",

            "abstract": "A complicating aspect to the use of Earth science data delivered to data archive centers is that these data are commonly found in different formats and structures. It is a great challenge to support Earth science research and applications with complex and fast growing datasets. To better support data users, both online and offline data services and tools are developing and improving continuously with new technology, intended to simplify finding, downloading, and working with “big science” data. Although most data services and tools have user guides, many users still experience difficulties with accessing or reading data, due to varying levels of familiarity with data services, tools, and/or formats. The data recipe project at Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) was initiated in late 2012 for enhancing user support. A data recipe is a “How-To” online explanatory document, with step-by-step instructions and examples of accessing and working with real data (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/recipes). The current suite of recipes has been found to be very helpful, especially to first-time-users of particular data services, tools, or data products. Online traffic to the data recipe pages is significant, even though the coverage of data recipe topics is still limited. An Earth Science Data System Working Group (ESDSWG) for data recipes was established in the spring of 2014, aimed to initiate an EOSDIS-wide campaign for leveraging the distributed knowledge within EOSDIS and its user communities regarding their respective services and tools. The ESDSWG data recipe group is working on an inventory and analysis of existing data recipes and tutorials, and will provide guidelines and recommendation for writing and grouping data recipes, and for cross linking recipes to data products. This presentation gives an overview of the data recipe activities at NASA GES DISC and ESDSWG. We are seeking potential collaborators from a broader data scientist community, as well as requirements and input from the data user community, to establish a strong knowledge base for supporting Earth science data research and application implementations.",

Understanding the variability and trends in streamflow can help in water resources planning, especially management of floods and droughts. Pacific Northwest US is unique due to its geographical location, having Pacific Ocean on the west and Rocky mountains on the east. Recent climate studies in the area show increase in temperatures and decline in snow water equivalent. In this study, a series of sequential Mann-Kendall tests and continuous wavelet analysis are performed on 39 Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN) streamflow stations with available data between 1951 - 2010. The results from sequential M-K tests and continuous wavelet analysis reveal the trends observed in the Pacific Northwest region at 5% significance level. Scale-averaged power spectra are used to relate the streamflow time series and interannual variability at the 39 streamflow stations. Mann-Kendall tests show a significant negative trend. Spatial analysis for these stations is done using Time-Latitude Hovmoller plot. It is observed that for 8-16 years period, there is high variance between 1975 to 2002 in the northern region and the variance decreases towards south. For 4-8 year period, increasing variance is observed in the southern part between 1987-1997. For 2-4 year period, significant variance is observed between 1970-1975 and 1998-2002 for all the stations in the study area.",

            "abstract": "For a long time anabranching patterns were primarily restricted to “exotic and remote” zones in arid systems such as Australia. For that reason, they were not accepted as a major topic of discussion in our discipline, which was based on concepts principally derived from case studies in the Northern Hemisphere. However, anabranching alluvial patterns are widespread in a variety of environments and scales, from arid small rivers to alluvial reaches of giant rivers such as the Amazon, Congo, and Negro. The largest rivers of the world in water discharge are anabranching, and the majority of the forty-five largest rivers (water discharges >5000m3s-1) are dominantly anabranching systems. Only a small number of rivers with meandering patterns, or sinuous with branches (meandering-tendency to anabranch) are part of the largest rivers group. The present large anabranching rivers with well developed floodplains flowing on lowlands have in common a characteristic very slow slopes, specific stream power of < 25 Wm-2 and sandy bed load with sand sizes dominantly ranging from 0.1 < D50 <0.5 mm. Large axial anabranching rivers also contain the largest floodplains. The diversity of planforms and island morphologies in large anabranching rivers result from autogenic adjustments to millennial scales in broad valleys and to century-decadal scale channel-floodplain processes. The variety of anabranching styles are not specifically related to a single explanatory “physically based theory” but to a variety of morphological processes, complex-channel floodplain interactions and the geologic characteristics of the valleys. Once considered a kind of oddity, anabranching rivers must be considered major and fundamental representatives of the fluvial world.",

            "abstract": "The mode of extension and crustal accretion in backarc basins is strongly affected by proximity to the arc volcanic front. The factor that likely has the strongest control on these processes is mantle water content. At Mid-Ocean Ridges, the small amount of water in the mantle is efficiently extracted into the melt, dehydrating the residual material and increasing the viscosity and strength of the lithosphere. This may aid in focusing melt generated over a broad (~200+ km wide) zone in the mantle toward a narrow zone of crustal accretion ~1-2 km wide. In the near-arc setting, the continuous flux of water into the mantle wedge should oppose lithospheric dehydration and inhibit strengthening of the lithosphere, which may allow deformation, volcanism, and crustal accretion to occur over a broad area instead of along a narrow axis. A possible example of this process can be observed at the southern terminus of the Malaguana-Gadao Ridge, a backarc spreading center in the Southern Mariana Trough, at the southern end of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana convergent margin. The spreading axis, which forms an axial high in this area, abruptly terminates at 143˚20'E, 12˚37'N and is replaced by a broad zone of active volcanism and tectonism characterized by short volcanic ridges, volcanic cones, and low-relief grabens. This study uses deep-towed and ship multibeam sonar, gravity, and magnetics data collected during an early 2012 cruise on R/V Thomas G. Thompson (TN273) along with available geophysical and geochemical data in the Southern Mariana Trough to gain insight into the nature of the diffuse crustal accretion process. Evidence of a similar transition from organized to \"disorganized\" spreading can also be observed at Valu Fa Ridge in the southern Lau basin and other backarc spreading centers. This suggests that this process is not unique to the Southern Mariana Trough, and may be an important mode of crustal accretion in a variety of backarc settings where there is extension in close proximity to the arc.",

Assessing possible adaptation strategies of crop production in West Africa under climate change is thus critical for ensuring regional food security and improving human welfare. Our previous efforts have identified as the main features of climate change in West Africa a robust increase in temperature and a complex shift in the rainfall pattern (i.e. seasonality delay and total amount change). Unaddressed, these robust climate changes would reduce regional crop production by up to 20%. In the current work, we use two well-validated crop models (APSIM and SARRA-H) to comprehensively assess different crop adaptation options under future climate scenarios. Particularly, we assess adaptations in both the choice of crop types and management strategies. The expected outcome of this study is to provide West Africa with region-specific adaptation recommendations that take into account both climate variability and climate change.",

            "abstract": "Basaltic shield volcanoes are subjected to important gravitational loads that lead to their spreading. Such deformation influences the stress state within the volcano, thus the formation of faults and the location of earthquakes and the propagation of magmas and the potential eruption location.\nUsing distinct numerical approaches constrained by geophysical data from the Hawai`i Island Shield Volcano (HISV), we studied the extent to which horizontal deviatoric stresses (HDS) induced from gravitational loading drives the process of volcanic spreading. Two distinct numerical approaches based on similar models were used: 1- the thin-sheet method, and 2- finite element models using COMSOL Multiphysics.\nWe quantified depth integrals of vertical stress (i.e., the gravitational potential energy per unit area or GPE) and then we derived the HDS that balance the horizontal gradients in GPE. We performed the integration over series of single layers that encompasses the surface of variable topography down to a uniform depth of 10 km b.s.l. consistent with the base of the HISV. To compare the results of our numerical approaches we built a fine-scale, Island-wide, set of kinematically constrained deformation indicators (KCDI) using the slip-rate and fault style information from a comprehensive fault database for the HISV. We measure the success of each numerical approach by how well model HDS match the horizontal styles of the strain rates associated with KCDI.\nThus far we find that the HDS obtained using the thin-sheet method match well with the KCDI. This may indicate that to first order that patterns of observed surface deformation on the HISV are governed by gradients in GPE. This provides a balance to the gravitationally-induced stresses associated with the volcano load. These HDS do not account for other competing sources of stress (e.g., flexure, magmatic, or hoop) that taken all together may combine to better explain the volcano spreading process for basaltic shield type volcanoes.",

These targets represent a very complex set of intersecting issues of scale, cross-sector science and technology, education, politics, and economics. Implications transcend individual projects and ministries. An immediate challenge is to incorporate the realities of changing environmental conditions in these sectors into the policies and projects of the Ministries nominally responsible. Ideally this would be done on the basis of the absolute best understanding of the issues involved, and done in a way that optimizes a multi-stakeholder return. Central to a response is \"actionable information-\" the synthesis and \"bringing to life\" of the key information that integrates the end-to-end knowledge required to provide the high-level decision support to make the most informed decisions. But, in practice, the information necessary and even perspectives are virtually absent, in much of especially the developing world. To meet this challenge, we have been developing a Dynamic Information Framework (DIF), primarily through collaborations with the World Bank in Asia, Africa, and Brazil. The DIF is, essentially a decision support structure, built around \"earth system\" models. The environment is built on progressive information layers that are fed through hydrological and geospatial landscape models to produce outputs that address specific science questions related to water resources management of the region. Information layers from diverse sources are assembled, according to the principles of how the landscape is organized, and computer models are used to bring the information \"to life.\" A fundamental aspect to a DIF is not only the convergence of multi-sector information, but how that information can be conveyed, in the most compelling, and visual, manner.

            "abstract": "The chemistry of water-soluble carbonyl compounds in clouds is now acknowledged as an important source of secondary organic aerosol. These reactive carbonyl compounds are oxidized to carboxylic acids and form oligomers by radical-radical reactions and by “dark reactions” with ammonium salts (AS) and/or amines. The latter class of reactions also produces light-absorbing brown carbon compounds, especially reactions involving methylglyoxal or glyoxal and amines. However, recent work has found that UV light fades the color of glyoxal + AS and methylgyloxal + AS reaction mixtures. We recently studied aldehyde-AS-amine reactions in sunlight and in control vessels at the same temperature to determine the effects of solar radiation on the aqueous-phase production of brown carbon. In sunlight, methylglyoxal reaction mixtures lost their initial color and failed to brown, indicating the photolytic loss of reactants and/or pre-brown intermediates. In many other reactions, brown products are lost to photolysis, reducing the overall browning of solutions exposed to sunlight. In other experiments, hydrogen peroxide was added to generate OH radicals by photolysis. In the presence of OH radicals, some carbonyl compound mixtures (e.g. those containing hydroxyacetone or glycolaldehyde) browned more rapidly when exposed to sunlight. This indicates the existence of uncharacterized photooxidative browning pathways involving aqueous-phase OH radicals, carbonyls, ammonium salts, and/or amine compounds.",

            "abstract": "Accurate and reliable cropland burned area products are essential for aiding estimates of trace atmospheric gases and particles which influence atmospheric chemistry dynamics and air quality. Cropland residue burning has been estimated to account for approximately 8-11% of all global fires (Korontzi et al. 2006). Cropland residue burning is also a significant fraction of atmospheric emissions at the local level. Timely and accurate assessments of cropland fire activity are needed by local and regional administrators involved in carbon emission, human health, and air quality regulations. Remote sensing systems used for monitoring fire activity have significant detection uncertainty due to ambiguous spectral characteristics of cropland burning. The present research is focused on the quantitative characterization of the spectral signature of cropland burning by monitoring the spectral signal throughout the full growing, harvest, and burning periods. Field data collection was conducted in the southern Palouse region of Idaho and Washington. Reflectance was measured on a test area of spring wheat fields with an analytical spectral device (ASD) spectrometer. All the dates for field data collections are coincident with Landsat 8 overpasses, and the spatial sampling of field measurements were performed following the VALERI protocol for upscaling to 30 meter pixels (Baret et al. 2005).",

            "abstract": "Oxidation Flow Reactors (OFRs) using OH produced from low-pressure Hg lamps at 254 nm (OFR254) or both 185 and 254 nm (OFR185) are commonly used in atmospheric chemistry and other fields. OFR254 requires addition of externally formed O3 since OH is formed mainly from O3 photolysis, while OFR185 does not since OH can also be formed from H2O photolysis. In this study we use a plug-flow kinetic model to investigate OFR properties under a very wide range of conditions applicable to both field and laboratory studies. We show that radical chemistry in OFRs can be characterized as a function of 3 main parameters: UV light intensity, H2O concentration, and total external OH reactivity (e.g. from VOCs, NOx, and SO2). In OFR185, OH exposure is more sensitive to external OH reactivity than in OFR254, because injected O3 in OFR254 greatly promotes the recycling of HO2 to OH, making external perturbations to the radical chemistry less significant. The uncertainties of modeled OH, O3, and H2O2 due to uncertain kinetic parameters are within 40% in most cases. Sensitivity analysis shows that most of the uncertainty is contributed by photolysis and reactions involving OH and HO2, e.g. 2HO2→H2O2+O2 and OH+O3→HO2+O2. Reactants of atmospheric interest are dominantly consumed by OH, except some biogenics that can have substantial contributions from O3. Other highly reactive species (UV photons, O(1D), and O(3P)) only contribute for some species under conditions low H2O concentration and/or high external OH reactivity, which can be avoided by experimental planning. OFR185 and OFR254 are comparable in terms of non-OH oxidants’ influence. In OFRs NO is fast oxidized. RO2 fate is similar to that in the atmosphere under low NO conditions. A comprehensive comparison of OFRs with typical environmental chamber studies with UV blacklights and with the atmosphere is also performed. OFRs’ key advantages are their short experimental time scales, portability to field sites, and generally good performance in terms of controllable and predicable radical chemistry.",

First we study the effect of the variability of the Enceladus plume activity, that is varying with the distance of the moon from Saturn. The brightness of the plume is largest at apocentre and smallest at pericentre. This implies that more material is escaping the plume when Enceladus is further away from Saturn and the fissures of Enceladus south polar region is under tension due to tidal stresses, than when Enceladus is closer to Saturn. We show that the variability of the Enceladus plume cannot explain the large dayside/nightside asymmetry detected by the LP. Instead, the ion density and velocity asymmetry seems to be related to the recently detected noon to midnight electric field of the E ring, which could be created by negatively charged nanometer-sized grains in the E ring. We investigate what nanograin properties that are needed in order to cause such large scale effects as the density and velocity dayside/nightside asymmetry. We also study the relation between the previously reported electron density variation with SLS4 and the ion density variation detected by the LP.",

            "abstract": "As modern geodesy technologies, both GRACE and GPS are used for observing the earthquake activities nowadays. While GPS can obverse the surface deformation continuously and accurately, GRACE satellites can measure the global gravity changes especially for those inaccessible areas. This shows that the GRACE satellites have the potential to supplement the unique information in those great offshore earthquakes. In the case of 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, many scientists have been using GPS measurement data to inverse the earthquake parameters. Because the GPS observations are all on one side of the fault, it should be more accurate when combined with the coseismic gravity changes measured by GRACE data which can provide the information of the other side of the fault. In this study, we firstly used the Slepian function method to extract coseismic gravity change caused by Tohoku-Oki earthquake from GRACE data and then combined this coseismic gravity change with the coseismic deformation data measured by GPS. As these two data sets are quite different in space resolution and time spans, variance component estimation (VCE) was then used to determine the weights of gravity data and deformation data in joint inversion. At last a simulated Annealing method was used to inverse the earthquake source parameters. As a result, we found the fault geometry and source location are similar to previews studies which were derived from GPS data or seismic data but with differences. It shows that the GRACE data can play an important role in a joint inversion for source parameters of great earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "An arc volcano hosting a hydrothermal field was surveyed by using an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with a sidescan sonar system and a multibeam echo sounder. The survey area is relatively small in area but has large variations in bathymetry and geology. To correct large geometric distortions in sidescan images, actual topographic cross sections cut by fan beams were taken into consideration instead of assuming flat bottoms. Beam pattern corrections were cautiously performed in combination with theoretical radiometric corrections for slant range and incident angle. These detailed geometric and radiometric corrections were efficient to patch neighboring images and build a complete picture of the whole survey area. Three textural attributes were computed from the corrected images by means of grey level co-occurrence matrices and used for the seafloor classification. As no ground truth data were available to us, we used a cluster analysis for the classification and obtained a result that seems relevant to the geological features suggested by the topography. Moreover, slopes of the caldera wall and of the central cones are clearly differentiated in the classification result, though the difference is not immediately obvious to our eyes. As one of the classes clearly delineates a known hydrothermal field, we expect by analogy that this class will highlight hydrothermal features in the survey area, helping to detect potential targets to be specifically investigated for mineral exploration. Numerical processing of sonar images effectively complements their visual inspection with human eyes and is helpful in providing a different perspective.",

            "abstract": "Because future projections by AOGCMs require huge computer and human resources, simple climate models are used under a wide range of emission scenarios. The observation obtained in the past cannot provide a strong constraint on equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and thus the future projections by simple climate models. However, when observations are obtained more in future, the uncertainty of future projections is expected to reduce. There is a public debate over whether to start to reduce carbon dioxide emissions now or to delay implementing mitigation policy in future. If the observation obtained in future can provide substantive benefits to climate policy, a climate policy of “wait and see”, or a sequential-decision strategy for climate change would be useful.\nWe investigated how much the uncertainty in economic damage and reduction ratios of CO2 emission, by which a climate target can be achieved, will reduce in future after future observation can be obtained. To conduct this, we first produced hypothetical observations of different ECSs using a simple climate model, and then validated whether the sequential decision strategy is useful or not for the estimations of economic damages and reduction ratios of carbon dioxide emissions.\nIn low ECS, the magnitudes of the uncertainty for future projections in global mean SAT changes are small, and they reduce rapidly after observations are obtained in future. On the other hand, in high ECS, the magnitudes of the uncertainty for future projections in global mean SAT changes are large, and they still remain large in future. Because economic damages increase nonlinearly for the global mean SAT changes, the uncertainty of future projections in the economic damages is larger, and still remains larger after obtaining observations in future in high ECS. In particular, peaks of the pdfs of the economic damages shift to more serious values after obtaining observations in future in high ECS.",

            "abstract": "The Upper Wind River Basin is located in north-central Wyoming (USA). At the northwestern edge of the basin, preliminary work by others has identified <4 Ma igneous rocks (lavas and shallow intrusives in low volumes) that are exposed southeast of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field. Virtually no literature exists on these rocks aside from a few K-Ar ages. Pilot Knob is an augite-rich intrusive body that yields a 3.4 ± 0.06 Ma K-Ar age. Lava Mountain, which lies ~ 4 km south of Pilot Knob, is a shield volcano where ~25 lavas are exposed in what appear to be glacially truncated cliffs. At the summit, a small capping cinder cone overlies lavas; one of the youngest lavas yields a K-Ar age of 0.48 ± 0.06 Ma. Crescent Mountain lies ~6 miles northeast of Lava Mountain and one Crescent Mountain lava yielded an ~3.6 Ma K-Ar age. At Spring Mountain, ~14 km north of Dubois, WY, local eruptions of at least one thin basaltic lava occurred from fissures that cut Paleozoic and Eocene sedimentary strata. Materials sampled from all locations range from basalt to dacite and define a primarily calc-alkaline differentiation array. Pilot Knob and one Crescent Mountain sample have wt. % K2O values between 2.7 to 3.8 at ~53 to 56 wt. % SiO2, which are much more K-rich than any other sample. These samples are also characterized by enrichments in LILE (e.g., >2000 ppm Ba, >1500 ppm Sr), LREE (>100 ppm La, >250 ppm Ce), Zr, Pb, and HREE depletions, relative to the other samples. The least evolved basalts from Spring Mountain are primitive with Mg # ~70 and Cr >900 ppm. Preliminary field constraints and satellite imagery indicates that regional fault zones control the location of individual eruptive loci/intrusives. For example, Pilot Knob and Lava Mountain lie along the projection of a normal fault zone that extends southeast from the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field. Work is ongoing to further physically, geochemically, and isotopically characterize these igneous rocks with the goal of determining whether they are related to mantle melting associated with the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field and the eastern Snake River Plain (e.g., Yellowstone hotspot), or other regional lithospheric-derived melting associated with continental extension (e.g., Basin and Range faulting or other causes).",

Thermodynamic modeling is a powerful approach to describe such phase relation, mass balance and energy balance during melting.\nThis study presents a new thermodynamic model for the calculation of phase relations during the melting of anhydrous spinel lherzolite at pressures between 1–2.5 GPa. The model is based on the total energy minimization algorithm for calculating phase equilibria within multicomponent systems and the thermodynamic configuration of Ueki and Iwamori [2013]. The model is based on a SiO2−Al2O3−FeO−Fe3O4−MgO−CaO system that includes silicate melt, olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and spinel as possible phases. The thermodynamic parameters for silicate melt end-member components are newly calibrated with a expanded-pressure calibration database. The temperatures and pressures used in this newly compiled calibration dataset are 1230−1600◦C and 0.9–3 GPa, corresponding to the stability range of spinel lherzolite.\nThe modeling undertaken during this study reproduces the general features of experimentally determined spinel lherzolite melting phase relations at 1–2.5 GPa, including the solidus temperature, the melt composition, melting reaction, the degree of melting and the dF/dT curve.\nThis new thermodynamic modeling also reproduces phase relations of various bulk compositions from relatively fertile to deplete spinel lherzolite and can be used in the modeling of multi-pressure mantle melting within various natural settings.",

In this study, we use a comprehensive physics-based hydrologic response model to simultaneously examine differences in hysteresis at the catchment scale and at the point scale for positions within the catchment hollow and higher up on the hillslopes. Using 11-years of observed climate data from a small headwater catchment dominated by saturation excess overland flow, we examine hysteresis for numerous rainfall events with different durations, intensities, and initial conditions. Additionally, we examine the annual water balances to explore the possibility of relating hysteretic storage-discharge trends to simple predictors of runoff generation. Simulation results did not show a dominant directionality in hysteresis across the catchment (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) regardless of storm duration or initial conditions. However, the magnitude of hysteresis is consistently larger at hillslope positions as well as for short duration, higher intensity storms, which illustrates the importance of hillslope drainage limitations on the storage behavior within the catchment. Furthermore, results illustrate that a threshold value of hillslope soil moisture can be a useful indicator of the seasonal transition from ET-dominated to runoff-dominated response. Thus while soil moisture storage within the hollow remains near capacity throughout the year due to continuous lateral drainage, dynamic hillslope storage is only exceeded seasonally when PET is lower. Despite the complex temporal and spatial dynamics in the hysteretic responses to rainfall, results support previous assessments that a well-placed soil-moisture probe [e.g., Catchment Average Soil Moisture Monitoring site (CASMM)] could be a simple and useful predictor of storage within a watershed. The implication is that soil-water retention characteristics of hillslopes are key for predicting runoff generation potential in catchments dominated by saturation excess overland flow.",

We collected 24 piston cores from small basins of the Japan Trench inner slope (37.5-40 N, 143.5-144.16 E, 4000-6000 m in water depth) during the cruise NT13-19 with R/V Natsushima, to investigate recurrence intervals of earthquakes in this area, based on the analysis of the turbidite record. Many fine-grained turbidites are observed in the cores. High sedimentation rates in this area preserve the turbidites well. Turbidites are more frequently intercalated in the cores recovered from the southern part of the area. On the other hand, several turbidite layers can be correlated widely in the northern part of the area, assisted by tephrostratigraphy and matching of paleomagnetic secular variations. Moreover, some of these turbidites are considered to be correlative to the reported onshore tsunami deposits along the Sanriku-Sendai coast. We will report the occurrence, characteristics and correlation of seismo-turbidites in the Japan Trench inner slope. The evidence suggests that the Japan Trench area is an ideal site for application of turbidite paleoseismology.",

GETSI was born out of requests from geoscience faculty for more resources with which to educate future citizens and future geoscience professionals on the power and breadth of geodetic methods to address societally relevant topics. Development of the first two modules started at a February 2014 workshop and initial classroom testing begins in fall 2014. The Year 1 introductory module “Changing Ice and Sea Level” includes geodetic data such as gravity, satellite altimetry, and GPS time series. The majors-level Year 1 module is “Imaging Active Tectonics” and it has students analyzing InSAR and LiDAR data to assess infrastructure vulnerability to demonstratively active faults. Additional resources such as animations and interactive data tools are also being developed. The full modules will take about two weeks of class time; module design will permit portions of the material to be used as individual projects or assignments of shorter duration. Ultimately a total of four modules will be created and disseminated, two each at the introductory and majors-levels. GETSI is working in tight partnership with the Science Education Resource Center’s (SERC) InTeGrate project on the module development, assessment, and dissemination to ensure compatibility with the growing number of resources for geoscience education. This will allow for an optimized module development process based on successful practices defined by these earlier efforts.",

            "abstract": "Changes in global and land precipitation have been observed over the last decades across different time scales. Particularly, studies conducted at the global scale have usually been consistently reporting increasing trends in extreme precipitation; but at the regional level the findings may differ, which require special attention because of the expected impact of extreme precipitation on society and ecosystems. Despite general trends, the local precipitation structure, relevant generating mechanisms and other specificities can dictate sometimes unexpected differences in precipitation characteristics and change over short distances that cannot be disregarded.\nIn general, no significant annual precipitation trends have been reported for mainland Portugal (South-western Europe); in this region there is strong precipitation spatial variability and gradients and very marked seasonality. In this study we analyzed ground-based point data to get insight into the properties of local and regional land precipitation in the recent past. Daily precipitation data recorded over more than 70 years were tested over different multi-decadal periods. We explored the statistics and frequency of extreme precipitation events and their intensity. Results show that after the mid-seventies the proportion of the total precipitation attributed to heavy and very heavy precipitation events increased and, consequently, daily precipitation events show a tendency to become more intense in this region. Moreover, analysis shows that the most extreme events could be changing at a faster absolute rate in relation to the mean than more moderate events. Whereas many engineering studies are supported by precipitation statistics derived from data recorded several decades ago, it is therefore important to re-evaluate design procedures and the operation of many hydraulic structures.",

            "abstract": "West Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) is the warm water body confined by Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over 28°C. The most important role of WPWP in response to air-sea interactions is that El-Niño and La-Niña events are determined by WPWP’s zonal migration. Many researches have conducted to understand the relationship between ENSO events and WPWP changes, but research for Subsurface Temperature (ST) fluctuation by WPWP’s movement does not well understood due to deficiency of observations, which is the main motivation of this research.\nThis research based on ARGO’s float profile subsurface data and TAO/TRITON’s mooring subsurface data. Especially, our research results are based on ST from surface to 500m depth and estimated ST deviation in route of eastbound WPWP between north and south 10° by the Pacific equatorial line to identify ENSO events. The El-Niño and La-Niña events were defined by Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) and then, we computed certain frequencies of ST under each condition, respectively. In order to understand the dominant frequency of ST, Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) was used. EEMD is analysis method to add Gaussian white noise in signal to redeem weak point of analysis method to non-linear and non-stationary signal. The research result shows that during normal condition, ST deviation values in Eastern Pacific (EP) had lower than those of Western Pacific (WP). During El-Niño condition, ST deviation values in the EP was higher than the normal condition, and ST deviation values in the WP was lower than normal condition and higher frequency in temperature fluctuation. During La-Niña condition, EP had similar ST amplitude with normal condition, but ST deviation values in the WP was so lower than the normal condition and fluctuation frequency was lower, too. So, we could understand that our estimations are resulting from intensified ST difference between high temperature of WPWP and low temperature of subsurface in location of WPWP during El-Niño and La-Niña condition. In addition, ST fluctuation at different depths show that El-Niño events occur at relatively higher frequencies than La-Niña events.",

Keya mong these aefects is the amount of cosmic rays arriving on the Earth. Famous hostorical periods, such as the Maunder minimum or the stronger northern lights reported in Ancient Roman times and their link with the Earth climate are much debated.\nThe dramatic reduction of solar activity during the ongoing solar cycle 24 and the related sudden end of the Modern Grand Maximum of solar activity have given increasing importance to the topics related to space climate. There is evidence for weakening magnetic fields in sunspots, decreasing polar fields and reduction in solar wind density and pressure during the last decennium. As a consequence, geomagnetic activity and magnetic storminess have reduced to more quiet levels during this time. Possible related effects upon the atmosphere and climate are under keen evaluation. We report on the ongoing ativites and debates within the European Commission funded project eHeroes (www.eheroes.eu) related to all aspects of space climate, including studies reporting changes in the solar and near-Earth space environment, and their effects in the atmosphere and climate, as well as evaluations of historical datasets upon which such studies are based.\nWork funded by the European Commission.",

In addition there are remote-sensing studies that provide icefield-wide data on surface velocities and thickness changes.\nWe study the future evolution of the Juneau Icefield using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM). Despite the multitude of field campaigns, the spatial distributions of ice thickness and precipitation remain poorly constrained, and obtaining a reasonable surface mass balance across the icefield proved to be challenging.\nWe show how we calibrate the model using the mass balance, surface velocity and thickness change measurements, and investigate the remaining uncertainty in our future projections by performing sensitivity tests.

Sampling occurred from near the surface to 1000 m above the ground. A Wide-band Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor (WIBS-4) measured concentrations of supermicron fluorescent particles with average regional concentrations ranging from 1.4±0.7 to 6.8±1.4 x 104 particles m-3 and representing up to 24% of total supermicron particle number. We observed distinct variations in size distributions and fluorescent characteristics in different regions, and attribute these to geographically diverse bioaerosol populations. Fluorescent aerosol signatures detected in the east is largely consistent with those of mold spores observed in a laboratory setting. A shift to larger sizes associated with different fluorescent patterns is observed in the west. Loadings in the desert west were nearly as high as those near the Gulf of Mexico, indicating that bioaerosol is a substantial component of supermicron aerosol both of these humid and arid environments. The observations are compared to simulated fungal and bacterial loadings. Good agreement in both particle size and concentrations is observed in the east. In the west the model underestimates observed concentrations by a factor of 2 to 3 and the prescribed particle sizes are smaller than the observed bioaerosol.",

            "abstract": "Associations of tephra and lava flow/domes produced by eruptions involving evolved magmas are a common occurrence in various types of volcanic settings (e.g. Pu’u Wa’awa’a ~114ka, Hawaii; South Mono ~AD625, California; Newberry Big Obsidian flow ~AD700, Oregon; Big Glass Mountain ~AD1100, California; Inyo ~AD1350, California, Chaitén AD2008-2009, Chile; Cordón Caulle AD2011-2012, Chile), ejecting up to a few cubic km of material (tephra+flow/dome). Most, if not all, of these eruptions have in common the paradoxical coexistence of (1) eruptive styles which are inferred to be sustained in nature (subplinian and plinian), with (2) a pulsatory behavior displayed by the resulting fall deposits, and (3) the coeval ejection of vesicular tephra and pyroclastic obsidian. Through two case studies, we explore this apparent set of paradoxes, and their significance in understanding transitions from explosive to effusive behavior.\nIn this second case study (also cf. Shea et al., same session), we present new field, textural and geochemical data pertaining to the 114ka Pu’u Wa’awa’a trachyte eruption in Hawai’i. This large volume (>5 km3) event produced both a tephra cone (~1.6 km in diameter) and a thick (>250 m) lava flow, which have been largely covered by the more recent basaltic Mauna Loa and Hualalai lava flows. The trachyte tephra contains juvenile material displaying a large textural variety (pumice, scoria, obsidian, microcrystalline trachyte and banded-clasts), which can be linked with the extent of degassing and the formation of feldspar microlites. Notably, the abundance of microlites can be used to reconstruct an ascent and devolatilization history that accounts for all the seemingly contradictory observations.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have documented variation in skeletal structure and carbonate mineralogy across a broad range of marine invertebrate taxa. Intraspecific changes in growth, morphology, and carbonate composition may occur in response to local and global changes in temperature, carbonate saturation state, and nutrient availability. Recurring upwelling along the west coast of the United States creates an alongshore mosaic of Ocean Acidification (OA), which may induce plastic responses and/or select for adaptive skeletal construction that can withstand pCO2 and temperature changes. Calcifying bryozoans provide a unique study system for investigating carbonate precipitation under variable conditions. Using a newly constructed flow-through CO2 control apparatus, we tested whether three laboratory-reared populations of the bryozoans Membranipora serrilamella, M. tuberculata and Celleporella cornuta showed differences in growth, calcification, and skeletal composition in response to simulated future OA conditions. Under elevated pCO2 (1200 μatm), bryozoans showed no significant differences in growth rate (new zooids added) compared to clones reared under current atmospheric values. However, C. cornuta colonies raised under high CO2 were significantly lighter, with less carbonate per zooid compared to colonies grown in present-day conditions (400 μatm). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that elevated pCO2 led to dissolution of bryozoan skeletons, which did not occur at 400 μatm. Structural changes in M. tuberculata and C. cornuta colonies may be related to the dissolution of high magnesium calcite skeletal components. Analyses of bryozoan morphological responses along with environmental proxies (δ13C, δ18O, and Mg/Ca ratios) could yield high resolution records of temperature and pH, which could be used to help reconstruct environmental variation along the California coast.",

            "abstract": "One of the most spectacular features of the Dry Valleys of Antarctica is the Vanda Dikes, an exceptionally well exposed swarm of >600 Cambro-Ordovician dikes emplaced near the end of the Ross Orogeny. Whereas their compositions range from mafic to felsic, they are primarily bimodal, with few intermediate compositions between 56 and 66 wt.% SiO2; mafic dikes vary from calc-alkaline to shoshonitic. The suite of dikes exhibits 87Sr/86Sr from 0.704-0.711 and 143Nd/144Nd from 0.51217-0.51242; the wide range of Nd isotopic ratios may reflect variable degrees of assimilation of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle inherited during Proterozoic crustal generation and the Ross Orogeny. The mafic dikes have a subduction-related trace element signature and we propose they originated as melts of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. The siliceous suite is characterized by elevated 87Sr/86Sri and an average Nd model age (τDM) of 1444 Ma, suggesting that the silica-rich dikes were generated by melting of or contamination by a Neoproterozoic crustal source, followed by variable fractional crystallization and further continental crust contamination. Analysis of zircons by CA-TIMS U-Pb geochronology reveals that the dikes were emplaced in a narrow time window, from 491 to 495 ± 0.3 Ma, which falls between emplacement of a synorogenic pluton (DV1) and extension-related plutons (DV2). Thus, we conclude that the dikes were intruded during the transition of the Ross Orogeny from collision to extension. During orogenic uplift and collapse, decompression melting of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle was initiated, resulting in the emplacement of the Vanda Dike Swarm. Because there is a strong correlation between dike age and latitude, the dikes can be used to map the progress of the collision-extension transition during the Ross Orogeny across the Dry Valleys.",

            "abstract": "A rapid prediction of damage to structures due to a large earthquake is important to prevent secondary disasters. Ground motion at the base of each construction to be input to a numerical simulation is to be estimated from seismograms. An accurate damage prediction requires such ground motions with spatially-high resolution although the seismometers much sparsely distribute comparing with the required resolution. We have been developing a procedure based on sparse modeling to image the ground motions from seismic array data. Our target is the Tokyo metropolitan area of Japan, in which the seismic array “MeSO-net” (Metropolitan Seismic Observation network) is in operation.\nMizusako[2013, graduation thesis] applied an algorithm based on the Taylor expansion to MeSO-net data when the Earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tohoku occurred on March 11, 2011. This method was found to never account for ground motions in frequencies higher than 0.15Hz, which was insufficient taking into consideration that the typical eigenfrequency of a construction is usually between 1-10Hz. Moreover, this method requires a priori assumed truncation order in differential and groups of observatories called “cluster”, in order to determine the unknown partial differential coefficients. Mizusako[2013] suggested that the truncation order was one and each cluster included five nearest observatories.\nWe propose a new algorithm using lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, Tibshirani[1996]) in order to obtain an image of spatially-high-resolution ground motions objectively determining the truncation differential order and clusters. The truncation order for a given cluster is automatically determined by lasso owing to the L1-norm regularization, and an appropriate cluster is selected based on an information criterion. Our initial result indicates that the ground motion determined by using the information criterion EBIC (Chen and Chen[2008]) is successfully reproduced in frequencies lower than 2Hz, which is drastically improved comparing with the previous study.",

            "abstract": "We carried out a series of particle simulations to study electron acceleration by Z-mode and whistler-mode waves generated by an electron ring distribution. The electron ring distribution excites, through cyclotron maser process, the X-mode, Z-mode and whistler-mode waves. The X-mode wave propagates mainly in the perpendicular direction; the Z-mode wave in the perpendicular and the parallel directions; the whistler-mode wave mainly in the parallel direction. The parallel Z-mode and whistler-mode waves can further accelerate and diffuse the energetic electrons. The peak energy of the accelerated electrons can reach 2~8 times of the initial kinetic energy which ranges from 100 to 500 keV. We then study the acceleration process via test-particle calculations in which electrons interact with one wave, two counter-propagating waves or four counter-propagating waves. The electron trajectories in the one wave case are along simple diffusion curves. In the multi-wave cases, simultaneous acceleration of electrons by counter-propagating waves occurs, and electrons are accelerated efficiently. The strong acceleration in the multiwave cases is related to electron resonant trapping by waves, and wave phase velocity, amplitude and frequency play important roles.",

            "abstract": "Absorbing aerosols produced from biomass burning and dust outbreaks are often found to overlay the lower level cloud decks as evident in the satellite images. In contrast to the cloud-free atmosphere, in which aerosols generally tend to cool the atmosphere, the presence of absorbing aerosols above cloud poses greater potential of exerting positive radiative effects (warming) whose magnitude directly depends on the aerosol loading above cloud, optical properties of clouds and aerosols, and cloud fraction.\nIn recent years, development of algorithms that exploit satellite-based passive measurements of ultraviolet (UV), visible, and polarized light as well as lidar-based active measurements constitute a major breakthrough in the field of remote sensing of aerosols. While the unprecedented quantitative information on aerosol loading above cloud is now available from NASA’s A-train sensors, a greater question remains ahead: How to validate the satellite retrievals of above-cloud aerosols (ACA)? Direct measurements of ACA such as carried out by the NASA Ames Airborne Tracking Sunphotometer (AATS) and Spectrometer for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research (4STAR) can be of immense help in validating ACA retrievals. In this study, we validate the ACA optical depth retrieved using the ‘color ratio’ (CR) method applied to the MODIS cloudy-sky reflectance by using the airborne AATS and 4STAR measurements. A thorough search of the historic AATS-4STAR database collected during different field campaigns revealed five events where biomass burning, dust, and wildfire-emitted aerosols were found to overlay lower level cloud decks observed during SAFARI-2000, ACE-ASIA 2001, and SEAC4RS-2013, respectively. The co-located satellite-airborne measurements revealed a good agreement (root-mean-square-error<0.1 for Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 500 nm) with most matchups falling within the estimated uncertainties in the MODIS retrievals (-10% to +50%).\nAn extensive validation of satellite-based ACA retrievals requires equivalent field measurements particularly over the regions where ACA are often observed from satellites, i.e., south-eastern Atlantic Ocean, tropical Atlantic Ocean, northern Arabian Sea, South-East and North-East Asia.",

            "abstract": "Dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR), where ferric iron (Fe3+) is reduced to ferrous iron (Fe2+) anaerobically, is an important respiratory pathway used by soil bacteria. DIR contributes to carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux from the wet sedge tundra biome in the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) in Alaska, and could competitively inhibit the production of methane, a stronger greenhouse gas than CO2, from arctic soils. The occurrence of DIR as a dominant anaerobic process depends on the availability of substantial levels of Fe3+ in soils. Siderophores are metabolites made by microbes to dissolve Fe3+ from soil minerals in iron deficient systems, making Fe3+ soluble for micronutrient uptake. However, as the ACP is not iron deficient, siderophores in arctic soils may play a vital role in anaerobic respiration by dissolving Fe3+ for DIR. We studied the effects of direct siderophore addition to arctic soils through a field study conducted in Barrow, Alaska, and a laboratory incubation study conducted at San Diego State University. In the field experiment, 50μM deferroxamine mesylate (a siderophore), 50μM trisodium nitrilotriacetate (an organic chelator) or an equal volume of water was added to isolated experimental plots, replicated in clusters across the landscape. Fe2+ concentrations were measured in soil pore water samples collected periodically to measure DIR over time in each. In the laboratory experiment, frozen soil samples obtained from drained thaw lake basins in the ACP, were cut into cores and treated with the above-mentioned compounds to the same final concentrations. Along with measuring Fe2+ concentrations, CO2 output was also measured to monitor DIR over time in each core. Experimental addition of siderophores to soils in both the field and laboratory resulted in increased concentrations of soluble Fe3+ and a sustained increase in Fe2+concentrations over time, along with increased respiration rates in siderophore-amended cores. These results show increased DIR in siderophore treated cores compared to the other treatments. From the results of these experiments, we conclude that arctic soil microbes can use siderophores to maintain a pool of dissolved Fe3+ for DIR. This study provides insight into the mechanisms of DIR in this ecosystem, and has relevance for understanding anaerobic soil respiration in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "A major challenge for spaceborne observations of ocean color is to correct for atmospheric scattering, which typically contributes ≥85% to the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance and varies substantially with aerosols. Ocean color missions traditionally analyze TOA radiance in the near-infrared (NIR), where the ocean is black, to constrain the TOA atmospheric scattering in the visible (VIS). However, this procedure is limited by insufficient sensitivity of NIR radiance to absorption and vertical distribution of aerosols, and by uncertainties in the extrapolation of aerosol properties from the NIR to the VIS.\nTo improve atmospheric correction for ocean color observations, one needs to change the traditional procedure for this correction and/or increase the aerosol information. The instruments proposed for the Pre-Aerosol, Clouds, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission include ultraviolet and Oxygen A-band observations, as well as multispectral and multiangle polarimetry, to increase the aerosol information content. However no studies have been performed on whether such observations contain sufficient aerosol information, and on how to use this information, to substantially improve atmospheric correction.\nTo study the atmospheric correction capabilities of PACE-like instruments, we are conducting field experiments off the Coast of California to obtain high-altitude airborne and in-situ observations of water-leaving radiance. The airborne data sets consist of hyperspectral radiance between 380-2500 nm by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, and narrow-band multiangle polarimetric data between 410-2250 nm by the Research Scanning Polarimeter. We discuss the quality of and comparisons between these data sets, and their differential sensitivities to variations in aerosol properties and ocean color.",

            "abstract": "The importance of hydrologic-geochemical interactions in arid environments is a controlling factor in quality and quantity of water available for human consumption and agriculture. When acid drainage affects these watersheds, water quality is gravely degraded. Despite its effect on watersheds, the relationship between time changes in hydrological variables and water quality in arid regions has not been studied thoroughly. Temporal variations in acid drainage can control when the transport of toxic elements is increased.\nWe performed field work at the Azufre River (pH 2, E.C~10.9 mS/cm) and Caracarani River (pH 8.7, E.C~1.2 mS/cm) confluence, located in the Northern Chilean Altiplano (at 4000 m asl). We registered stream flowrates (total flowrate~430 L/s), temperature and electric conductivity (E.C) hourly using in-stream data loggers during one year. We also measured turbidity and pH during one field survey at different distances from the junction, as a proxy of the formation of iron-aluminum particles that cycle trace elements in these environments. We found turbidity-pH diurnal cycles were caused by upstream hourly changes in upstream flowrate: when the Caracarani River flowrate reached its daily peak, particle formation occurred, while the dissolution of particles occurred when the Azufre River reached its maximum value. This last process occurred due to upstream freeze-thaw cycles. This study shows how the dynamics of natural confluences determines chemical transport. The formation of particles enriched in toxic elements can promote settling as a natural attenuation process, while their dissolution will produce their release and transport long distances downstream. It is important to consider time as an important variable in water quality monitoring and in water management infrastructure where pulses of contamination can have potentially negative effects in its use.\n Acknowledgements: Funding was provided by “Proyecto Fondecyt 1130936” and “CONICYT/FONDAP 15110020”.",

            "abstract": "The Antarctic ice mass balance and rates of change of ice mass over the past decade are analyzed based on observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, in the form of JPL RL05M mascon solutions. Surface mass balance (SMB) fluxes from ERA-Interim and other atmospheric reanalyses successfully account for the seasonal GRACE-measured mass variability, and explain 70-80% of the continent-wide mass variance at interannual time scales. Trends in the residual (GRACE mass - SMB accumulation) mass time series in different Antarctic drainage basins are consistent with time-mean ice discharge rates based on radar-derived ice velocities and thicknesses. GRACE also resolves accelerations in regional ice mass change rates, including increasing rates of mass gain in East Antarctica and accelerating ice mass loss in West Antarctica. The observed East Antarctic mass gain is only partially explained by anomalously large SMB events in the second half of the record, potentially implying that ice discharge rates are also decreasing in this region. Most of the increasing mass loss rate in West Antarctica, meanwhile, is explained by decreasing SMB (principally precipitation) over this time period, part of the characteristic decadal variability in regional SMB. The residual acceleration of 2+/-1 Gt/yr, which is concentrated in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) basins, represents the contribution from increasing ice discharge rates. An Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) run with constant ocean forcing and stationary grounding lines both underpredicts the largest trends in the ASE and produces negligible acceleration or interannual variability in discharge, highlighting the potential importance of ocean forcing for setting ice discharge rates at interannual to decadal time scales.",

            "abstract": "The influence of ocean on typhoon Nuri (2008) is investigated in this study using the WRF numerical model. Typhoon Nuri formed over the warm pool of the western North Pacific. The storm traversed west-northwestward and became a Category 3 typhoon over the Kuroshio east of the Luzon Strait and weakened as it moved across South China Sea. Three types of SST: NCEP RTG_SST (Real-time，global，sea surface temperature) GHRsst (Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) and SST from the ATOP North Pacific ocean model [Oey et al 2014, JPO] are used in WRF to test the effect of ocean on the intensity of typhoon Nuri. The typhoon intensity and track are also compared with simulations using different microphysics schemes but with fixed SST. The results show that thermodynamic control through ocean response is the dominant factor which determines Nuri’s intensity. The simulated intensity agrees well with the observed intensity when ATOP SST is used, while using NCEP SST and GHRsst yield errors both in intensity and timing of maximum intensity. Over the Kuroshio, the thicker depth of 26 ℃ from ATOP provides stronger heating for the correct timing of intensification of Nuri. In South China Sea, the storm weakened because of cooled SST through ocean mixing by inertial resonance. A new way of explaining typhoon intensification though PV is proposed.",

            "abstract": "Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) has been recognized as an important pathway for material transport to the marine environment. Submarine fresh groundwater discharge will occur wherever an aquifer is hydraulically connected with the sea and the water table is above sea level. The driving force behind this process is the hydraulic gradient from the upland region of a watershed to the surface water discharge location at the coast. Permeability also affects the rate of recharge into an aquifer and discharge into a sea. In the present study, we thus evaluated the SGD impact on the two locations in eastern (Yuza) and western (Otsuchi) side of the northern Japan to clarify the relationship between the coastal distribution of SGD and the local-scale coastal geology and topography. We applied 222Rn monitoring survey with the dual-loop system (Dimova et al. 2009) to assess the local-scale impact of SGD. In the Yuza area, abundant spring discharges are present around the coast at the terminus of volcanic lava flows. We conducted the continuous 222Rn monitoring at boat speeds of < 2 knots along the coast for a few kilometers scale assessment. Moreover, at the two contrastive specific sites (Kamaiso beach and Shonai dune) where are different properties of geology and topography, the continuous 222Rn monitoring using a rubber boat at speeds of 1 m per 20 seconds was done for a few hundred meters scale assessment. As a result, 222Rn activity clearly showed the higher impact of SGD on the Kamaiso beach compared to the Shonai dune. In the Otsuchi area, on the other hand, 222Rn monitoring survey was also done at boat speeds of < 2 knots in Otsuchi Bay and Funakoshi Bay in same tidal conditions (2 hours before lowest tide), because there are negligible influence of tidal changes on 222Rn concentrations in the Pacific coast of Japan. 222Rn concentrations in Otsuchi Bay were significantly higher than those in Funakoshi Bay. Although the Otsuchi Bay and Funakoshi Bay is adjacent embayment, larger watershed and steeper hydraulic gradient in Otsuchi Bay would be induced the stronger influence of SGD compared to Funakoshi Bay.",

            "abstract": "The White Island stratovolcano of New Zealand has an active shallow S-rich hydrothermal system present in the Central Crater. In this hydrothermal system, subsurface Fe-rich mineralization is prevalent in the unconsolidated volcaniclastic sediments. Development of these laterally coherent Fe-rich layers may alter the fluid and gas flow and mineralization dynamics of the hydrothermal system. Here we assess the redox chemistry and pathways leading to the formation of the subsurface Fe-rich layer(s). Based on fluid chemistry, mineralogical analyses and geochemical modeling, the subsurface Fe-rich layers are mainly composed of jarosite and goethite and form at the interface between the atmospheric (O2-rich) and hydrothermal (reduced) systems. Cyclic mixing of volcanically-related fluid/gas pulses and precipitation is conducive to both jarosite and goethite forming in the same layer. Macroscopically, the formation of these Fe-rich layers decreases the permeability and porosity in the crater fill directly affecting fluid and gas flux and heat released throughout sections of the crater. Microbial communities are present in the Fe-rich layers, but how and to what extent microbial activity is interacting within these layers requires further investigation. Overall, the subsurface Fe-rich layers present at White Island represent a confined and small scale version (a few centimeters) of a redox interface potentially applicable to larger hydrothermal and ore forming systems.",

The HSRL1 resolves vertical variations in scattering by phytoplankton in the water column and profiles of extinction by aerosols in the atmosphere, in addition to measuring intensive aerosol properties that can be used to identify the types of aerosols that are present. The RSP measures the intensity and linear polarization of reflected sunlight in nine spectral bands from 410 to 2264 nm at multiple viewing angles. These measurements can be used to retrieve aerosol and cloud properties and also the near surface chlorophyll concentration [Chl]. While the aircraft observations during SABOR provided the capability for rapidly surveying variations in ocean particulate scattering and near surface [Chl], they can not match the detail or system context provided by measurements made on the R/V Endeavor. Ship based measurements quantified not only the standing stocks of ocean particles, but rates of phytoplankton productivity, speciation of the phytoplankton community, and characteristics of other in-water absorbing materials. The two measurement platforms therefore complement one another, with the R/V Endeavor measurements providing evaluation and validation of the remote sensing products in addition to their own unique scientific value. In this paper we will present a survey of the ocean, aerosol and cloud products retrieved from the RSP observations and some initial inter-comparisons with the observations made by the HSRL1 and on the R/V Endeavor.",

            "abstract": "Not only the stress state but also the elastic and inelastic properties of rocks around a target fault may be key information on seismogenic processes. Monitoring them may help us improve earthquake hazard assessment. In laboratory, elastic wave speed has been found to decrease prior to the main fracture (e.g., Lockner et al., 1977; Yoshimitsu et al., 2009). At the Ezulwini mine in South Africa, a fault with a high potential for mining-induced earthquakes with a relatively large magnitude (M ~2) was specified based on boring-core observation, tunnel wall observation, and mining plans. We started monitoring transmitted waves across the fault at about 1 km deep (Kawakata et al., 2011). We installed a piezoelectric transmitter as a wave source about 20 m away from the fault in the hanging wall. Three accelerometers of 3-component were installed along the acoustic beam from the transmitter; one in the hanging wall, and the other two in the footwall. Ultrasonic pulses were repeatedly transmitted, and the received waves were recorded at 400 ksps. Transmitted signals can be clearly recognized in stacked waveforms of all channels. In May 2012, increases in travel times (5-10 ms) from 2011 were observed for all the three stations. The common delay suggested that the decrease in wave speed was not localized at the fault. After that, there was a long strike in the mine, and the data were missed for about 100 days and 300 days due to the lack of maintenance of the monitoring system. By September 2013, when the data recording was resumed, travel times to the two receivers located after crossing the fault had increased greatly to ~60 ms, while that to the receiver before the fault increased only to 20 ms. Assuming that the thickness of the fault is 5 m, the difference in delay of 40 ms corresponds to a wave speed decrease of 8 %. We have not identified a relatively large event that might be associated with this change in travel times, but the event search is not completed.",

            "abstract": "In many cases the Landsat mission series (Landsat 1-5, 7 and 8) provide our only detailed and consistent data source for mapping the global glacier changes over the last 40 years. However, the scan-line corrector (SLC) of the ETM+ sensor on board Landsat 7 permanently failed, resulting in wedge-shaped data gaps in SLC-off images that caused roughly 22% of the pixels to be missed. The SLC failure has left a serious problem for the glacial applications of ETM+ data, particularly for monitoring long-term glacier dynamics in High Asian Mountain where has few available data due to the frequently cloudy covers.\nThis study aims to evaluate the potential of the Landsat 7 SLC-off images in deriving surface velocities of mountain glaciers. A pair of SLC-off images over the Siachen glacier acquired in Aug 2009 and 2010 was used for this purpose. Firstly, two typical filling-gap methods, the localized linear histogram match (LLHM) and the weighted liner regression (WLR), were utilized to recover the mentioned SLC-off images. Subsequently these recovered pairs were applied for deriving glacier-surface velocities with the COSI-Corr feature tracking procedure. Finally, the glacier velocity results were quantitatively compared with that of a pair of Landsat-5 TM images acquired nearly at the same time with the SLC-off pair.\nOur results show that (1) the WLR method achieves a better performance of gap recovering than the LLHM method, (2) the surface velocities estimated with the recovered SLC-off images are highly agreement with those of the TM images, and (3) the annual mean velocity of the Siachen glacier is approximately 70 m/yr between 2009 and 2010 with a maximum of 280 m/yr close to the glacial equilibrium line that are similar with the results in previous studies. Therefore, if a suitable filling-gap method is adopted, e.g. the WLR method, it is highly feasible that the ETM+ SLC-off data can be utilized to estimate the surface velocities of mountain glaciers.",

            "abstract": "Greater thaw depth in the Arctic permafrost regions will increase soil liquid-water content and enrich for the microbial production of methane (CH4). Carbon cycling in Arctic soils is poorly understood with regard to biological controls on observed CH4 fluxes. In the analysis presented here I have measured and compared chemical and physical properties and conducted an anaerobic incubation experiment on soil core samples obtained from Atqasuk and Ivotuk, two sites on the North Slope of Alaska. Additionally, metagenomes have been sequenced across a soil depth profile at both sites. There are significant differences between the two sites with regard to soil bulk density, pH, volumetric water content, total carbon, total phosphate, Iron III and methanogenesis potential. The sites are not significantly different in total organic matter, total nitrogen, Iron II and anaerobic respiration potential. Volumetric water content is highly correlated at both sites with soil bulk density, with higher water content measured at Ivotuk with finer, siltier soil, and lower water content measured at Atqasuk with coarser, sandier soil. The water retention in these soils may influence carbon dioxide and methane flux at these two sites. Incubations produced similar levels of carbon dioxide at both sites, and much higher levels of methane at Atqasuk than Ivotuk. Multiple regression analysis shows a strong correlation between volumetric water content and pH as predictor variables for methanogenesis in Ivotuk, though not in Atqasuk. Additionally, carbon dioxide production is significantly correlated with methane production in all samples and all depths, though there is a much stronger relationship in Atqasuk. This may indicate a relationship between methane oxidation and carbon dioxide production in Atqasuk, though further investigation is needed. Preliminary metagenomic data for Ivotuk indicates a possible relationship between iron reducing bacteria and soil iron concentrations. Further analysis of metagenomic data is ongoing and will ideally provide greater insights into methane cycling at these two sites.",

            "abstract": "In excess of $700 million has been spent over the last 10 years on restoration of the Missouri River. During this time, restoration efforts have focused progressively on avoidance of jeopardy for three threatened or endangered species: interior least tern (Sternula antillarum), piping plover (Charadrius melodus), and the pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus). In 2013, the US Army Corps of Engineers, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Missouri River stakeholders (through the Missouri River Recovery Implementation Committee) commissioned an Effects Analysis (EA; Murphy and Weiland, 2011) to evaluate the effects of this effort on the three species’ populations and to project effects of future restoration. The EA includes synthesis of existing abiotic and biotic scientific information relating to species population processes, distributions, and habitat needs, as well as development of conceptual and quantitative models linking river context to its management and to species’ responses. The EA also includes design of the next generation of hypothesis-driven science to support adaptive management of the species and the river. The Missouri River EA faces the challenge of evaluating how management of North America’s largest reservoir storage system, 600 km of non-channelized mainstem, and nearly 1,200 km of channelized mainstem contribute to species’ population dynamics. To support EA needs, the US Army Corps of Engineers is developing a new generation of reservoir simulation and routing models for the Missouri River basin, coupled with components to evaluate ecological and socio-economic metrics. The EA teams are developing coordinated models relating management to functional habitats and species’ responses. A particular challenge faced by the EA is communicating the very different uncertainties in population dynamics between well-documented birds and the enigmatic fish, and the implications of this disparity in decision making, implementation, and adaptive management strategies.",

            "abstract": "Invasive and exotic earthworms are now present in many forested areas of the northeastern US with currently unquantified consequences to abiotic and biotic Hg cycling. To quantify these effects, we measured Hg concentrations (mg kg-1) and amounts (μg m-2) in earthworms and soil horizons at 45 soil pits from 9 sites in northern New England. Seven earthworm species were observed in varying assemblages. Most earthworm species attained concentrations of Hg potentially hazardous to wildlife that may ingest them, with highest concentrations found in shallow-burrowing, litter-feeders. Specifically, Aporrectodea rosea and Amynthas agrestis had the greatest Hg concentrations (0.9 ± 0.1) and Hg amounts (8 ± 2) μg m-2. Aporrectodea rosea and Amynthas agrestis were found to inhabit the forest floor and the top 5 cm of the mineral horizons in high abundance, potentially making it a readily accessible prey species. Bioaccumulation of Hg by invasive and exotic earthworms may be an important mechanism that transfers Hg to ground foraging predators, such as thrushes, red-backed salamanders and foxes, which is generally unaccounted for in terrestrial food chains. Earthworm Hg concentrations were poorly correlated with their respective soil Hg concentrations, suggesting a species dependence for Hg bioaccumulation rather than site effects.\nWe observed that forest floor Hg concentrations and amounts were 23% and 57% lower, respectively, at soil pits with earthworms compared to those without. Moreover, Hg amounts in forest floor-feeding earthworms exceeded the remaining forest floor Hg pools. Mercury concentrations and pools in the mineral soil were 21% and 33% lower, respectively, for soil pits with earthworms compared to those without. We hypothesize that enhanced decomposition, horizon disturbance and bioaccumulation by earthworms has decreased Hg amounts in the forest floor and mineral soil. Our results suggest that earthworms are decreasing Hg storage in forest soils with potential hazardous impacts for predatory animals in northeastern US forests and other ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of leaf waxes, such as n-alkanes, have extensively been used in paleoenvironmental studies for reconstruction of the past vegetation, climate and carbon cycling. There is however little information available on the seasonal variation of leaf wax concentration and δ13C in modern plants and when the δ13C signal is set. This lack of information confounds interpretations of leaf wax δ13C in sedimentary archives. To address this gap, this study investigates temporal changes in n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid δ13C values in several species (Acer rubrum, Acer saccharum, Ulmus Americana, Sassafras albidum, and Juniperus virginiana) within a single temperate deciduous forest stand in southern Ohio. We sampled atmospheric air, buds, leaves, leaf litter, and surface soil weekly during leaf flush and biweekly thereafter. In A. rubrum, A. saccharum, and U. Americana, buds had one or two dominant n-alkanes, such as C29 and C31. After leaf flush, the concentrations of shorter n-alkanes (C23~C27) significantly increased relative to the longer chain-lengths. We are currently analyzing remaining samples from the growing season and are analyzing bulk leaf and leaf wax (n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids) δ13C values. This information will be important for identifying environmental and physiological controls on leaf wax δ13C and will improve interpretations of leaf wax δ13C preserved in the geologic record.",

            "abstract": "At the current stage I used the database created under the Next Generation Attenuations (NGA-East) project by Cramer et al. (2013). In contrast to the active tectonic environment in the Western US (WUS) the strong motion record database for the stable continental environment in the Central and Eastern US (CEUS) is not sufficient to create purely empirical ground motion prediction equations (GMPE) covering required for the PSHA magnitude (4.5<Mw<8.5) and distance ranges (0<R<1000 km). Recorded data are sparse and cover mostly ranges of Mw<6.0 with only few data points for larger earthquakes. There is also only small number of recordings at close fault distances (R<10 km). Absences of large magnitude and near fault recordings significantly complicate constraining GMPE. I used previously developed GMPE models developed by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in 2013 and Pezeshk et al. (2011) as main constraints especially for large magnitudes.\nCurrent GMPE model is based on the same modular approach developed by Graizer and Kalkan for active tectonic environment (2007, 2009, and 2011). In this approach, a GMPE is expressed as a series of filters with each filter representing a certain physical phenomenon affecting the radiation of seismic waves from the source. Graizer-Kalkan GMPE for peak ground acceleration (PGA) was composed of five different filters. For consistency I keep same number of filters for the CEUS GMPE. The main filter modeling the distance attenuation of ground-motion is similar to the frequency response function of a damped single-degree-of-freedom oscillator with frequency replaced by distance to the fault. Following the approach developed in Graizer and Kalkan (2009) for WUS spectral acceleration (SA) prediction model explicitly integrates PGA as a scaling factor for the spectral shape, which is a continuous function of spectral period. Geometrical spreading of R-1 combined with anelastic attenuation Q0 is used allowing adjusting the model for regional anelastic attenuation. The model covers the range of 4.5<Mw<8.5, distances of 0<R<1000 km, S-wave velocities of 500<VS30<2800 m/sec and period range of 0.01 to 10 s.

            "abstract": "The scale effect of the friction law is crucial in connecting field observations, laboratory experiments, and natural fault behaviors. Here we present our recent study towards understanding of the scale effect of the friction law.\nThe fault friction law is usually studied in laboratory experiments for cm-scale specimens, and one of the prominent problems is its direct applicability to the large-scale behavior. Small repeating earthquakes (repeaters) may be a realization of heterogeneous frictional property on faults, which were modeled by rate-weakening patches embedded in a rate-strengthening fault [e.g., Chen and Lapusta, 2009]. After the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, so many repeaters were found in the Tohoku subduction zone [e.g., Kato and Igarashi, 2012]. But it is quite difficult to numerically resolve them in a large-scale simulation of the whole subduction zone, which is demanded for potential disaster mitigation. Then, it is important to investigate a spatiotemporally coarse-grained friction law of a fault region including unstable inclusions. We hypothesized that each point on a fault obeys the cm-scale friction law (the rate-state friction law in the aging law formulation) with sub-mm state evolution distance L, and assumed a rate-weakening circular patch (80 m diameter) which generates repeating events. We set 256 m periodicity along the fault, and conducted dynamic earthquake sequence simulations [e.g., Liu and Lapusta, 2009] by driving the system by far field stress τ0. We did not prescribe the long term slip rate by setting a region of constant slip rate as is done in previous studies. Those simulations can be seen as numerical friction experiments with controlling the shear stress and observing the slip rate.\nThe macroscopic steady-state can be explained by a logarithmic law, with the frictional resistance slightly smaller and the rate-dependency slightly more rate-strengthening than the spatial average. The transient behavior on a step in τ0 can be explained by the aging law with significantly longer L and smaller a- and b-values. The optimum parameters are different for different amount of the stress step, indicating that the macroscopic friction law takes a different form from the aging law. Effects of high velocity weakening efficient within the rate-weakening patch has been also investigated.",

            "abstract": "Pleistocene climate is characterized by glacial-interglacial changes in the ice volume. Reconstruction of ice volume is essential for understanding past climate change and is usually based on variations in the oxygen isotope composition of benthic foraminifera shells, which in turn are influenced by bottom water temperature. Another approach is to use the oxygen isotope composition of planktonic foraminifer in semi-enclosed seas, where the surface environments are sensitive to sea level change. The oceanographic condition at the sea north of Japanese islands is also largely influenced by the eustatic change. The Japanese islands and inter island shallow straits (sill depth less than 130 m) limit seawater exchange between the North Pacific and the marginal seas. The oxygen isotope record in this area show a unique feature and is a candidate for reconstructing global sea level history.\nDuring the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 346 “Asian Monsoon” (29 July–27 September 2013), a shallow marine sediment sequence was recovered from the slope of north coast of western Japan, Site U1427. The shipboard data highlight the sediment contains well-preserved foraminifer and has high sedimentation rate of ~40 cm/kyr. A complete splice down to ~400 m provides the potential for a continuous record for the last ~1.4 Ma. Preliminary isotope results show isotopic variations correspond to lithological change and therefore show similar variation to physical properties of the sediment, such as bulk density, natural gamma ray, and so on. The result suggests that the oxygen isotope of foraminifer in this area may provide key information on past global ice volume changes.",

            "abstract": "It is important to assess the likely rupture characteristics of future megathrust earthquakes. One approach is to study the spatio-temporal variation of geophysical properties in active subduction zones. We explore this idea by examining stress drops of 1563 small earthquakes (Mw 3.0 – 4.5) shallower than 80 km in the Tohoku-oki region before the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. Although individual stress drop estimates exhibit considerable scatter, we find a strong increase in stress drop with depth between 30 km and 60 km, whereas stress drops for shallower and deeper events, respectively, are nearly constant. We also identify lateral variations in stress drop along strike. Higher-than-average stress drops are found in East Aomori-oki and Miyagi-oki, whereas Sanriku-oki is a moderate stress-drop area. The high stress-drop zone in Miyagi-oki is located just south of the large slip area of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, and possibly acted as a barrier to further rupture propagation during the event. In addition, the frequency dependence of the seismic radiation observed during the mainshock, with proportionally higher frequencies coming from the deeper parts of the fault, mimics the depth dependence we see in small earthquakes in the same region. These results imply that smaller pre-mainshock earthquakes can provide insight into the fault properties and consequent rupture processes of future megathrust earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Regional climate is controlled by large scale forcing at lateral boundary and physical processes within the region. Landuse in East Asia has been changed substantially in the last three decades, featured with expansion of urban built-up at unprecedented scale and speed. The fast expansion of urban areas could contribute to local even regional climate change. However, current spatial datasets of urban fractions do not well represent extend and expansion of urban areas in the regions, and the best available satellite data and remote sensing techniques have not been well applied to serve regional modeling of urbanization impacts on near surface temperature and other climate variables. Better estimates of localized urban fractions and urban climate effects are badly needed. Here we use high and mid resolution satellite data to estimate urban fractions and to assess effects of urban heat islands at local and regional scales. With our fractional cover, data fusion, and differentiated threshold approaches, estimated urban extent was greater than previously reported in many global datasets. Many city clusters were merging into each other, with gradual blurring boundaries and disappearing of gaps among member cities. Cities and towns were more connected with roads and commercial corridors, while wildland and urban greens became more isolated as patches among built-up areas. Those new estimates are expected to effectively improve climate simulation at local and regional scales in East Asia. There were significant positive relations between urban fraction and urban heat island effects as demonstrated by VNIR and TIR data from multiple satellites. Stronger warming was detected at the meteorological stations that experienced greater urbanization, i.e., those with a higher urbanization rate. While the total urban area affects the absolute temperature values, the change of the urban area (urbanization rate) likely affects the temperature trend. Increases of approximately 10% in urban area around the meteorological stations likely contributed to the 0.13◦C rise in air temperature records in addition to regional climate warming. This study also provides a new approach to selecting reference stations based on remotely sensed urban fractions.\nFurther reading: http://green.tea.ac.cn",

            "abstract": "Impact cratering is a violent process, shattering and melting rock and excavating deep-seated material. The resulting scars are apparent on every planetary surface across our Solar System. Subsurface density variations associated with the resulting impact structures contain clues to aid in unlocking the details of this process. High-resolution gravity fields, such as those derived from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, are ideal for investigating these density variations. With gravity measurements from GRAIL and topography from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), we derived high-resolution Bouguer gravity fields (i.e., the gravity field after the contribution from topography is removed) that we correlated with craters mapped from LOLA data. We found that the mass deficit beneath lunar impact craters relates directly to crater size, up to diameter ~130 km, whereas craters larger than this diameter display no further systematic change. This observation, coupled with the greater depth of impact damage expected beneath larger craters, indicates that some process is affecting the production and/or preservation of porosity at depth or otherwise altering the mean density beneath the larger craters (note, measurable mantle uplift is observed for craters larger than ~184-km diameter). The observed crater gravity anomalies, however, exhibit considerable variation about these mean trends, suggesting that other factors are also important in determining the bulk density of impact crater structures. Milbury et al. (this conference) have demonstrated that pre-impact crustal porosity strongly influences the resulting density contrast between the impact damage zone beneath a crater and its surroundings. Herein, we extend these studies using the same GRAIL- and LOLA-derived maps to further investigate the effects that crustal properties have on the bulk density of the rock beneath lunar impact features. We focus, in particular, on the processes that influence the generation and preservation of porosity beneath complex craters 100–150-km in diameter.",

            "abstract": "With the development of surface energy balance analyses, remote sensing has become a spatially explicit and quantitative methodology for understanding evapotranspiration (ET), a critical requirement for water resources planning and management. Limited temporal resolution of satellite images and cloudy skies present major limitations that impede continuous estimates of ET. This study introduces a practical approach that overcomes (in part) the previous limitations by implementing machine learning techniques that are accurate and robust. The analysis was applied to the Canal B service area of the Delta Canal Company in central Utah using data from the 2009–2011 growing seasons. Actual ET was calculated by an algorithm using data from satellite images. A relevance vector machine (RVM), which is a sparse Bayesian regression, was used to build a spatial model for ET. The RVM was trained with a set of inputs consisting of vegetation indexes, crops, and weather data. ET estimated via the algorithm was used as an output. The developed RVM model provided an accurate estimation of spatial ET based on a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E) of 0.84 and a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.5 mmday−1. This methodology lays the groundwork for estimating ET at a spatial scale for the days when a satellite image is not available. It could also be used to forecast daily spatial ET if the vegetation indexes model inputs are extrapolated in time and the reference ET is forecasted accurately.",

We examine a suite of 3 samples that we interpret as being representative of the transition between hypersolidus and subsolidus flow based on petrographic observations; in hypersolidus fabrics, olivine shows evidence for crystal plasticity whereas plagioclase and clinopyroxene do not, and in subsolidus fabrics, plagioclase shows the most evidence for crystal plasticity relative to olivine and clinopyroxene.\nWe use EBSD analyses to acquire microstructural, lattice preferred orientation (LPO), and misorientation data from plagioclase, olivine, and clinopyroxene in each sample. In the hypersolidus end member fabric, seemingly undeformed plagioclase laths define a shape fabric LPO where {010} is parallel to foliation and <100> axes are parallel to lineation, but clustering of low-angle (<10º) misorientation axes about [001] suggests the onset of the high-temperature slip system {010}<100>. Olivine and clinopyroxene grains are not abundant enough to define a LPO, but misorientation data suggest the activity of the {001}<100> slip system in olivine and a lack of slip system activity in clinopyroxene. Average internal grain misorientations show that olivine and clinopyroxene are the most and least strained minerals, respectively. In the subsolidus end member fabric, recrystallized plagioclase and olivine grains both define LPOs suggestive of the {010}<100> slip system, which is also supported by clustering of low-angle misorientation axes about [001]. Clinopyroxene grains define a LPO indicative of the {010}<001> slip system, but low-angle misorientation axes are scattered. Average internal grain misorientations show that plagioclase and olivine are equally strained, but clinopyroxene is least strained.

            "abstract": "When applying seismic tomography to local arrival times from an area with a low-velocity sedimentary cover, the effect of the sediments on travel times should be taken into account. If that is not done, the resulting velocity model(s) cannot be assumed to be correct. This fairly obvious statement has been challenged recently by Powell et al. (JGR, 2010), who claimed that the sediments that cover the New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ, central United States) can be ignored. This claim is examined here and shown to be incorrect. The NMSZ is covered by low-velocity, poorly consolidated sediments (Vp=1.8 km/s, Vs=3), which are underlain by Paleozoic rocks of much higher velocity. In  the central NMSZ the sediment thickness varies between about 0.1 and 0.7 km. The JHD analysis of the data collected in that area by a portable network (PANDA) showed that the P- and S-wave station corrections spanned large ranges (0.35 and 0.63 s, respectively, Pujol et al., Eng. Geol., 1997). This study also showed that a Vp/Vs of 3 for the sediments would be too high if the lateral velocity variations were confined to the sedimentary cover. Here we generate synthetic traveltimes for a model with a sedimentary cover having variable depth (as determined from boreholes) underlain by the high-velocity layers in the 1-D model used for the JHD analysis. The synthetic data were generated for the station and event distributions corresponding to the Panda data. The tomographic inversion of the synthetic times produces spurious anomalies in Vp, Vs, and Vp/Vs, from the surface to a depth of 10 km. In addition, the events are mislocated in depth, with errors between 0 and 1 km for most of them. These results should dispel the notion that the effect of the unconsolidated sediments can be ignored. On the other hand, the inversion of the actual Panda data results in velocity anomalies similar to the synthetic anomalies, although larger, which is consistent with the conclusions of Pujol et al. (1997). Unfortunately, extricating the effects of the sediments from those of deeper velocity anomalies will not be possible with seismic tomography unless in-situ determinations of Vp/Vs for the sediments in the network area become available. Alternatively, analysis techniques that make use of more than just P- and S-wave arrivals (such as S-to-P converted waves) may have to be designed.\n ",

            "abstract": "Despite the global importance of the Congo Basin, which is the second largest river basin in the world, the limited understanding of its hydro-climatic patterns is in part due to the lack of in-situ monitoring of climate variables there. Climate and hydrological station networks are sparse and poorly maintained; the few networks that were implemented during the colonial period have shrunk considerably. Conversely, the recent improvements in remote sensing technology provide more observations than ever before that can advance hydrological studies, particularly in tropical basins. This work provides the first monitoring of water level at the basin scale for the Congo Basin based on merged data from different altimetry missions: ENVISAT, Jason-2 and SARAL. More than 500 time series of water level are computed for a twenty of contributors, over the period of 2002 to 2010 for 200 ENVISAT series, including using the second orbital period, from 2008 for 75 Jason-2 series and from mid 2013 for 250 SARAL series. The consistency and the quality of this datasets are investigated. First, the ENVISAT and J2 series are compared to in-situ measurements where possible. SARAL is the very first mission collecting water levels over rivers in the Ka band. Therefore, in a second step, we compare the capability of its altimeter AltiKa to that of previous missions working in the Ku band such as ENVISAT and Jason-2 in retrieving water levels over the Congo basin. In the last part of the work, we investigate the river dynamics in the Congo Basin since 2002 until today, using the Multichannel SSA (MSSA) to provide information about the common temporal variability of the dominant variables among the water level datasets.",

            "abstract": "Throughout history, significant portions of the native vegetation of many Caribbean islands were replaced by cropland. Even though most islands eventually underwent reforestation, sediment yields and deposition rates appear to be higher now than throughout the past millennia, and this suggests that coral reef systems are experiencing an unprecedented level of sediment-related stress. Given the present-day emphasis on erosion control projects to restore coral reefs of the US Caribbean, it is of utmost importance to develop a quantitative understanding of the effects of both land development and watershed restoration activities on sediment delivery at various spatio-temporal scales.\nEfforts to measure contemporary erosion, sediment delivery and deposition rates have been conducted on the island of St. John-USVI since 2009. Sediment yields under natural conditions from the small (<10 km2) watersheds in this dry sub-tropical setting are between 1 and 10 Mg km-2 yr-1. Current sediment yields are 2 - 50 times higher than background depending on unpaved road network abundance and characteristics. Our efforts indicate that a watershed restoration program implemented in 2010-2011 within the 13-km2 Coral Bay watershed resulted in the reduction of annual sediment delivery rates from 445 Mg yr-1 to 327 Mg yr-1.\nMarine sedimentation rates of terrigenous materials based on sediment trap data were 6 - 24 times greater below developed watersheds relative to undeveloped catchments and were consistent with spatial comparisons of modeled sediment yields. At sites located within reef systems, total and silt deposition rates during sampling periods with major storms exceeded rates shown to harm corals more frequently in developed areas. Terrigenous sedimentation rates during periods with equivalent storms were reduced following watershed restoration. These results suggest that targeted watershed restoration may be effective in reducing sedimentation where land development and sediments are considered a major threat to coral reefs.",

            "abstract": "The growing economic damage incurred by U.S.-landfalling hurricanes is arguably due to a mixture of changing hurricane activity with climate change, increased wealth and population exposure along the coast, and changes in vulnerability to landfall events. Considering the multiple contributing factors, we aim to develop a U.S. hurricane economic damage model and connect the climate effects on hurricanes to the resulting expected economic damage. First, we normalize total damages by an estimate of economic exposure, the wealth of the effected counties. This allows us to focus on the relationship between the physical storm landfall attributes and damage. The normalized quantity is called the Damage Fraction. Second, the record of U.S. hurricane economic damage from 1900-2012 is analyzed using a peaks-over-threshold approach in which the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is applied to model the probability distribution of Damage Fraction extremes. Two covariates are incorporated into the GPD model to represent multiple hazards, the normalized maximum sustained wind at landfall and the bathymetric slope at the landfall location. The latter represents storm surge risk. The former, which is the storm maximum wind normalized by the local 100-year return period wind from the ASCE 7-10 wind map, serves to incorporate a proxy for regional vulnerability, or resilience.\nThe new GPD model is applied to datasets of synthetic hurricane tracks downscaled from 20th century and future (RCP 8.5 scenario) CMIP5 model climates using a statistical-deterministic hurricane model. Using Monte Carlo Simulations, it is shown that across the range of six different CMIP5 model inputs, there is an expected increase of annual Damage Fraction in the future climate. Then we test possible effects of varying levels of future national adaptation by increasing the 100-year return period wind by 5, 10, and 20%. Using the future hurricane climatology, it is shown that the adaptation can help reduce the expected annual Damage Fraction. In one case, adaptation reduces the Damage Fraction even lower than the 20th century climate expectation.",

            "abstract": "Since 2000, the technological advances of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the United States have led to a dramatic increase in hydrocarbon (gas and oil) production from shale formations, changing the energy landscape in the US and worldwide. Since 2005, the surge in tight oil production from shale formations has provided tremendous optimism regarding future United States hydrocarbon production, unexpectedly becoming the fastest-growing frontier of unconventional resources. According to the Energy Information Administration’s newly released report in 2014, US oil output from tight oil prospects will almost double from the 2012 level of 2.5 million barrels per day, to 4.8 by 2019. However, total gas recovery from the Barnett play was reported to be only12–30%, and the tight-oil recovery rate from shale formations is even lower at 5–10%. The main barrier to sustainable development of US shale, the pore structure of the nanopores storing and transporting hydrocarbons, has been quietly ignored.\nWe have studied pore structure, edge-accessible porosity, and how wettability is associated with mineral and organic kerogen phases, from four complementary tests: vacuum saturation with vacuum-pulling on dry shale followed with tracer introduction, tracer diffusion into fluid-saturated shale, fluid and tracer imbibition into partially-saturated shale, and Wood's metal intrusion followed with SEM imaging and elemental mapping. The first three tests use tracer-bearing fluids (API brine or n-decane), with tracer distribution on shale mapped with micro-scale laser ablation-ICP-MS analyses. These innovative approaches indicate the limited accessibility (several millimeters from shale sample edge) and connectivity of nanopores in shales under atmospheric condition, which is linked to the steep initial (e.g., 1st year) decline and low overall recovery because of the limited connection of hydrocarbon molecules in the shale matrix to the stimulated fracture network.",

            "abstract": "We continue investigation of the world’s lowest δ18O and δD (down to -27.3‰ and -235‰, respectively) rocks associated with high-Mg and high-Fe intrusions found within a 450-km-long zone of metamorphic rocks in the Belomorian Belt (Baltic shield, Russia). We suggest that extreme depletion occurred during premetamorphic high temperature interaction between shallow mafic intrusions and Paleoproterozoic glacial waters. Heat associated with intrusion of Paleoproterozoic mafic dikes allowed for circulation of glacial water in mafic dikes’ exterior causing isotopic exchange between ultra-low-δ18O water and host rocks. Based on correlation of Paleoproterozoic glaciogenic deposits scattered worldwide, it was inferred that that global glaciations occurred three times between 2.45 to 2.20 Ga, independently or systematically coincident with the rise of atmospheric oxygen. However, the exact ages of glaciations remain uncertain. Dating igneous cores within zircon grains from the intrusions that interacted with subglacial meteoric waters enables us to develop a new approach to determine the age of δ18O depletion and thus, glacial events. Recently published geochronology data for Fennoscandia indicates that there were at least three episodes of compositionally distinct mafic magmatism spanning between 2.5 and 2.2 Ga which may help us to precisely resolve the glaciation episodes. Initial efforts to date the Paleoproterozoic mafic intrusions in conjunction with newly published geochronology data suggest that the low-δ18O anomalies discovered at different localities were probably produced during different glacial episodes. We also present new data based on a study of the ~2.45 Ga Vetreny Belt rift, Karelia craton, where unmetamorphosed pillow basalts contain abundant genetically-related hydrothermal quartz-epidote veins (+4.7‰ and -0.44‰, for the two minerals respectively) that formed at temperature of ~350°C. Since hydrothermal minerals likely precipitated from seawater-based fluid, this direction will further provide us with insight into the isotopic composition of Paleoproterozoic seawater existed before the series of glaciations.",

The extreme conditions considered are high flows, low flows, and elevated stream temperature as derived from historic and future simulations using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrologic model and downscaled output from a GCM ensemble. Results indicate noteworthy differences in the frequency changes of extremes based on geographic region, season, elevation, and stream size. We found wide-spread increases in the occurrence of stream flows exceeding 150% of historic averages for winter by the end of the century, and extensive increases in the occurrence of both extreme low flows (representing <50% of historic averages), and elevated stream temperatures (> 3 °C of monthly averages) during the summer months, with some basins expecting extreme conditions 90-100% of the time by the end of the century.

In this study, we use the historical records to document the earthquake migration pattern and the existence of a 180-km seismic gap along the 600-km long right-slip Tangshan-Hejian-Cixian (THC) fault zone that cuts across the North China basin. The newly recognized seismic gap, which is centered at Tianjin with a population of 11 million people and ~120 km from Beijing (22 million people) and Tangshan (7 million people), has not been ruptured in the past 1000 years by M≥6 earthquakes. The seismic migration pattern in the past millennium suggests that the epicenters of major earthquakes have shifted towards this seismic gap along the THC fault, which implies that the 180- km gap could be the site of the next great earthquake with M≈7.6 if it is ruptured by a single event. Alternatively, the seismic gap may be explained by aseismic creeping or seismic strain transfer between active faults.",

Therefore, accurately quantifying methane oxidation rates is crucial when constructing methane budgets on a local or global scale. Here we present a comparison of two techniques used to determine methane oxidation rates based on samples obtained over the Hudson Canyon seep field in the North Atlantic. Traditional methane oxidation rate measurements require inoculation of water samples with isotopically labeled methane and tracking the changes to methane concentrations and isotopes as the samples are incubated. However, the addition of methane above background levels is thought to increase the potential for methane oxidation in the sample. A new technique to calculate methane oxidation rates is based on kinetic isotope models and incorporates direct measurements of methane concentrations, methane 13C isotopes, and water current velocity. Acoustic instrumentation (ADCP) aboard the R/V Endeavor was used to obtain water current velocity data while water samples were collected for methane concentration and isotopic ratio analysis. Methane δ13C measurements allow us to attribute changes in methane concentration to either water dispersion or bacterial methane oxidation. The data obtained from this cruise will tell us a comprehensive story of methane removal processes from this active seep field. The kinetic isotope models will allow us to estimate the total flux of methane from the seep site and calculate methane oxidation rates at different depths and locations away from seafloor plumes.",

During El Nino events wetness tends to prevail over the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico, simultaneously with drought over Central America and the Pacific Northwest. Map congruence analysis was used to measure the similarity between the composite moisture anomaly map during 10 El Nino extremes and the continent-wide pattern of tree-ring reconstructed moisture during each year from 1400 to 2005. Map congruence was also computed using the composite moisture anomalies during La Nina extremes as the target (ENSO extremes defined using the extended Multivariate ENSO Index). The two congruence time series (El Nino vs La Nina-like) are far from the perfect inverse of one another (r = -0.36; p < 0.001; 1400-1979), but sub-decadal smoothing reveals interesting episodes of continental scale structure in the moisture field that may have arisen from multi-year cool and warm ENSO extremes over the past 600-years.",

            "abstract": "Soil erosion is a major problem in northwestern Rio de Janeiro State where, during the last three centuries, major land-use changes took place, associated with the replacement of the original rainforest by agriculture and grazing. The combination of steep hillslopes, erodible soils, sparse vegetation, natural and human-induced fires, as well as downslope ploughing, led to an increase in surface runoff and surface erosion on soil-mantled hillslopes; together, these actions and responses caused a decline in soil productivity.\nIn order to estimate changes in erosion rates over time, we compared erosion rates measured at different spatial and temporal scales, both background (natural) and short-term (human-induced during last few decades). Background long-term erosion rates were measured using in-situ produced cosmogenic 10Be in the sand fraction quartz of active river channel sediment in four basins in the northwestern portion of Rio de Janeiro State. In these basins, average annual precipitation varies from 1,200 to 1,300 mm, while drainage areas vary from 15 to 7,200 km2. Short-term erosion rates were measured in one of these basins from fallout 210Pb in soil samples collected along a hillslope transect located in an abandoned agriculture field. In this transect, 190 undisturbed soil samples (three replicates) were collected from the surface to 0.50 m depth (5 cm vertical intervals) in six soil pits. 10Be average background, basin-wide, erosion rates in the area are ~ 13 m/My; over the last decades, time-integrated (210Pb) average hillslope erosion rates are around 1450 m/Myr, with maximum values at the steepest portion of convex hillslopes of about 2000 m/Myr. \nThese results suggest that recent hillslope erosion rates are about 2 orders of magnitude above background rates of sediment generation integrated over many millennia. This unsustainable rate of soil loss has severely decreased soil productivity eventually leading to the abandonment of farming activities in areas where soil loss is severe.",

            "abstract": "The 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquakes triggered many landslides in the Port Hills including rockfalls, rock and debris avalanches and slides and associated cliff-top cracking. The most abundant, and the highest risk to people and buildings, were rockfalls and rock/debris avalanches.\nVolumes of rock leaving several cliffs during the earthquake sequence were determined from terrestrial laser scan change models. Relationships between volume leaving cliffs during the earthquakes, and site peak ground acceleration, Arias intensity, peak ground velocity, and shaking duration above a given amplitude threshold were compared for different sites. There were no instrumented cliff sites and some distance between the cliffs and nearest strong-motion sites. Therefore, we synthesised free-field rock-outcrop seismograms by employing a stochastic approach controlled by source models and regional parameters derived using spectral inversion of the extensive strong motion data set (Holden et al., 2014; Oth and Kaiser in press; Kaiser et al., 2013).\nRockfall volumes fit a power law with horizontal peak ground accelerations, with the exception of the 4 Sept. 2010 (Darfield) earthquake (Figure 1) which generated much smaller failures at Port Hills sites than in later earthquakes. This is presumed to be because the rock slopes became more fractured in the 22 Feb. 2011 earthquake. Ground conditions likely weakened further after 22 Feb. 2011. Fracturing and rock-mass strength degradation during subsequent earthquakes further degraded rock-mass quality, but the amount of degradation in each is unknown.\nWe suggest strong ground motion removes the mass most susceptible to failure, whilst reducing the strength of other remaining rock by dilating existing and generating new fractures. Shaking episodes thus increase the slope’s susceptibility to failure. This process repeats, such that rock slopes experience a continual cycle of coseismic weakening and failure (Parker et al. 2012). Immediately after an earthquake sequence, the new rock exposures are also more prone to static failure than was the former slope. The measured post-earthquake sequence static rockfall rates appear to be decaying with time, but they are still significantly higher than the static rates estimated before the earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Industrial metal pollutants are now ubiquitous in the global atmosphere and are a potential source of contamination to surficial environments, even in remote-from-source locations. Few studies, however, have examined the environmental fate of atmospheric industrial metals at a landscape scale. In this study patterns of atmospheric industrial metal accumulation were investigated within different surface environments of the Snowy Mountains, Australia. Atmospheric concentrations of industrial metals were compared with enrichment in peat mires, a tarn-lake, reservoirs and soils to elucidate patterns of dilution and concentration. Industrial metals (including lead, cadmium and antimony) were enriched in collected aerosols by 3.5-50 times pre-industrial concentrations. Surface enrichment was variable and depended on relative geomorphic activity (i.e. the rate of atmospheric deposition relative to surface derived sediment input), metal sensitivity and metal behaviour. Peat mires, the environments most dominated by atmospheric deposition, most closely reflected atmospheric enrichment patterns and tended to record the highest industrial metal enrichment. Even in this environment, however, metal enrichment was reduced by 5-7 times relative to atmospheric concentrations. Those metals most sensitive to enrichment (those with low natural abundance in local sediments (cadmium, silver, antimony and molybdenum)) were enriched within all sedimentary environments. In the most geomorphically active environments (the alpine tarn) no other industrial metals were enriched. In reservoirs located lower in the catchment, industrial metals displayed complex patterns related to metal behaviour. Particle reactive metals, such and lead, displayed relatively minor enrichment, suggesting that they are retained in catchment soils. In contrast, more mobile elements such as copper and cadmium were enriched relative to catchment soils, implying preferential down-catchment transport. The presence of industrial metals in all sampled environments further confirms their widespread perturbation in the environment. Overall, however, enrichment of industrial metals in surficial environments is complex and varies across the landscape as a function of metal behaviour and surface geomorphic processes.",

Yet emissions from developing countries have a higher uncertainty, and their increasing trend hence causes the global emission uncertainty to increase with time. By using full transparency emission inventory which the energy consumption, fuel heating values, carbon content and oxidation rate reported separately in sectoal level, here we found new 1.5 Gt C yr-1 (15% of global total) uncertainties of carbon emission inventory, which mainly contributed by the mass energy use and various consumption coal quality in China and India. Increment of coal’s carbon emission in China and India are equivalent to 130 % of global total coal’s emission growth during 2008-2010, various reported heating value and carbon content of coal consumption result in the different estimates of carbon emission in China and India up to 1.5 C yr-1. These new emerging uncertainties implies a significant mis-estimation of human induced carbon emissions and a new dominating factor in contributing the global carbon budget residual.",

            "abstract": "Numerical and conceptual models of flat-slab rollback predict broad initial dynamic subsidence above the slab hinge then uplift and volcanism triggered by the advection of asthenosphere beneath the overriding plate. These predicted surface effects provide a viable but largely untested explanation for lake basin formation in Cordilleran-type orogenies. We argue that the hydrologic closure of both the foreland (early Eocene) and hinterland (late Eocene) of the North American Cordillera were caused by a trenchward-migrating wave of dynamic and thermal topography resulting from progressive removal of the Farallon flat-slab.\nTwo major episodes of hydrologic drainage closure are recorded by Eocene terrestrial strata in the western United States. The first occurred in the retroarc foreland during the early Eocene, and resulted in the deposition of the Green River Fm. The second occurred in the hinterland during the late Eocene and resulted in accumulation of the Elko Fm. In both regions, lake strata overlie fluvial strata and become progressively more evaporative up-section, and are overlain by volcaniclastic strata. Both successions were then truncated by regional unconformities that extend until the Oligocene. We interpret these stratigraphic successions to record trenchward propagation of a regional topographic wave, caused by slab rollback. Migration of the slab-hinge initially caused dynamic subsidence and initiation of lacustrine deposition. Regional surface uplift followed, and was associated with scattered volcanism. Uplift promoted formation of endorheic basins and ultimately the development of regional unconformities. The height of the uplift can be roughly approximated by the preserved thickness of lacustrine and other nonmarine deposits at both locations (0.2-1.0 km).\nThe 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb geochronology of Green River Fm ash beds indicate that this surface topographic wave migrated trenchward (SW) across the foreland from 53 to 47 Ma at a velocity of ~6 cm/yr. Single crystal sanidine 40Ar/39Ar ages for ash beds within the Elko Fm indicate hydrologic ponding from 43 to 38 Ma. The 4 myr gap between Green River and Elko Fm deposition may represent the time required for the rollback wave to transit the steep eastern slope of the Sevier fold-thrust belt.",

            "abstract": "On average, several hundred earthquakes are located each year within the Wasatch Plateau region of central Utah. This region includes the boundary between the relatively stable Colorado Plateau and the actively extending Basin and Range physiographic provinces. Earthquakes in this region tend to fall in the intermountain seismic belt (ISB), a continuous band of seismicity that extends from Montana to Arizona. While most of the earthquakes in the ISB are of tectonic origin, events in the Wasatch Plateau also include mining induced seismicity (MIS) from local underground coal mining operations. Using a catalog of 16,182 seismic events (-0.25 < M < 4.5) recorded from 1981 to 2011, we use double difference relocation and waveform cross correlation techniques to help discriminate between these two populations of events. Double difference relocation greatly improves the relative locations between the many events that occur in this area. From the relative relocations, spatial differences between event types are used to differentiate between shallow MIS and considerably deeper events associated with tectonic seismicity. Additionally, waveform cross-correlation is used to cluster events with similar waveforms—meaning that events in each cluster should have a similar source location and mechanism—in order to more finely group seismic events occurring in the Wasatch Plateau. The results of this study provide both an increased understanding of the influence mining induced seismicity has on the number of earthquakes detected within this region, as well as better constraints on the deeper tectonic structure.",

            "abstract": "Southern Patagonia Icefield (SPI) is losing volume, and the loss is due partly to rapid changes in outlet glaciers that terminate in lakes or the ocean. Despite their key influence, relatively few of these calving glaciers have had high-frequency measurements on their frontal variations and ice speed changes. We present frontal variations and ice speed changes of all glaciers having a surface area exceeding 100 km2 in the SPI from 1984 to 2013. The analysis is based on satellite images acquired using Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8. From 1984 to 2011, only the two termini of Glaciar Pío XI advanced. Of the remaining glacial fronts, 12 changed less than ±0.5 km, but 17 retreated at least 0.5 km. In the latter group, three (Glaciar Jorge Montt, HPS12, and Upsala) retreated over 6 km. Averaged over all 31 glacial fronts of the calving glaciers, the front positions retreated 1.56 km (median: 0.71 km). Along the centerline within 20-km of the front, the ice speeds ranged from 50±40 to 5900±200 m a−1. Except for regions showing large acceleration or deceleration, the mean speed over the measured area decreased by 30 m a−1 from 1984 to 2011. The three most rapidly retreating glaciers showed much larger acceleration near the calving front. Except for Pío XI, the glaciers fall into one of three categories: stable front position without significant ice speed change, gradual retreat with deceleration, and rapid retreat with large acceleration. The overall retreat trend was probably due to the long-term warming trend. Nevertheless, our data demonstrated that the extraordinary large retreats in the three glaciers were not directly controlled by the warming trend, but instead driven by glacier dynamics. Such dynamically controlled rapid recession of several calving glaciers plays a key role in the recent volume decrease of the SPI.",

For example, timber type information is needed for accurate estimation of the amount and life cycle of carbon stored in the harvested wood product (HWP) pool, and possible transport of carbon in wood products through trade. Several attempts have been made to estimate the carbon storage in the HWP, regardless which approach to use, information of the annual timber production are required. A statistic model has been developed to estimate the annual roundwood production at the county level. The inputs of the model includes forest disturbance area calculated using the VCT algorithm derived from the Landsat time series stack, a forest type map, and timber product output (TPO) data collected from wood processing mills by the USFS. The model is applied to North Carolina, a state with a large forestry sector and where harvesting and logging are a primary forest disturbance type. Ten-fold cross validation were done to the preliminary estimation for each type of HWP. The root mean square errors range between 13.6 and 31.5 for hardwood types; and between 1.3 and 55.6 for softwood types. The model is empirical as it depends on the local information on forest disturbance, forest types, and the amount of the roundwood output. However, the approach of the model can be used to apply to other areas with the local information provided. The result can be served as a starting point in spatial estimation of carbon storage in HWP.",

            "abstract": "Laser ablation depth profiling of geochronometers—such as zircon, monazite, titanite and rutile—has become popular in recent years as a tool to both determine date vs. depth or trace-element (TE) composition vs. depth; the former allows the dating of thin rims and, potentially, inversion of Pb-loss profiles for thermal histories, whereas the latter can yield insight into changes in PTX or mineral parageneses and inversion of trace-element profiles for thermal histories. In this study, we combine both techniques, enabling simultaneous acquisition of U-Th/Pb isotopic ratios and trace-element compositions, by joining a 193 nm excimer laser to a multi-collector ICP-MS and single-collector ICP-MS. The simultaneous acquisition allows direct shot-by-shot linkage between time and petrology, expanding our ability to understand the evolution of complex geologic systems. We construct each depth profile by capturing the analyte with a succession of individual laser pulses (each ~100 nm deep) . This has two main advantages over a typical time-dependent analysis of a multi-shot routine composed of tens to hundreds of shots and a several µm deep hole. 1) The reference material is analyzed between each shot for a more-accurate standardization of each aliquot of ablated material. 2) There is no mixing of material ablated from successive laser pulses during transmission to the ICP. The method is limited by count rate, which depends on spot size, excavation rate, instrument sensitivity, etc., and, for single-collector ICP, the switching time, which limits the number of elements that can be analyzed and their total counts. We explore the latter theoretically and experimentally to provide insight on both the ideal number of elements to measure and the dwell time in any given sample. Examples of the utility of SS-LASS include the comparison of apparent Pb loss to diffusion profiles of trace elements in rims of metamorphic rutile and titanite, as well as the determination of the timing and petrologic conditions of thin zircon rims in metamorphic rocks.",

            "abstract": "The Oman ophiolite extends along the east coast of Oman, and is the world’s largest and best-preserved slice of obducted oceanic lithosphere. The magmatic history of this ophiolite is complex and is generally regarded as having occurred in three stages (MOR magmatism, subduction magmatism and intraplate magmatism). Wehrlitic intrusions constitute an important element of oceanic lower crust of the ophiolite, and numerous intrusions cut gabbro units in the northern Salahi block of this ophiolite. In this study area, we identified two different types of wehrlitic intrusions. One type of the intrusions mainly consists of dunite, plagioclase (Pl) wehrlite and mela-olivine (Ol) gabbro, in which the crystallization sequence is Ol followed by the contemporaneous crystallization of Pl and clinopyroxene (Cpx). This type is called “ordinary” wehrlitic intrusions and has similar mineral compositions to host gabbros (Adachi and Miyashita 2003; Kaneko et al. 2014). Another type of the intrusions is a single intrusion that crops out in an area 250 m × 150 m along Wadi Salahi. This intrusion consists of Pl-free “true” wehrlite, in which the crystallization sequence is Ol and then Cpx. The forsterite contents (Fo%) of Ol from the “ordinary” wehrlitic intrusions and “true” wehrlitic intrusions have ranges of 90.8-87.0 (NiO = 0.36-0.13 wt%) and 84.7 (NiO = 0.31 wt%), respectively. Cr numbers (Cr#) of Cr-spinel from the “true” wehrlitic intrusions show higher Cr# value of 0.85 than those of the “ordinary” wehrlitic intrusions (0.48-0.64). But the former is characterized by very high Fe3+ values (YFe3+ = 0.49-0.68). Kaneko et al. (2014) showed that the “ordinary” ubiquitous type has similar features to MOR magmatism and the depleted type in the Fizh block (Adachi and Miyashita 2003) links to subduction magmatism. These types are distinguished by their mineral chemistries (TiO2 and Na2O contents of Cpx). The TiO2 and Na2O contents of Cpx from the “true” wehrlitic intrusions have 0.38 wt% and 0.26 wt%, respectively, and plot on the field of MOR magmatism. The most-evolved Ol (Fo% = 84.7) from the wehrlitic intrusions has high NiO (0.31 wt%) and plots on the olivine mantle array (Takahashi 1986). It is suggested that heterogeneity of source mantle influences the magmatic diversity of the wehrlitic intrusions.",

            "abstract": "Fertilizer use is rapidly increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, we currently have little understanding of the consequences of increased nitrogen (N) fertilizer use on surface and groundwater resource quality in these tropical croplands. This is because there are few field studies that examine N dynamics in SSA, and extrapolation is difficult because soil biogeochemistry and land management differ from the regions where most of our understanding of N losses from agriculture has been developed. We present data on N leaching losses in the vadose zone from a high-clay soil in western Kenya and a low-clay soil in mid-western Tanzania. Experimental fields were established in both sites with fertilizer rates ranging from 0 to 200 kg N ha-1 yr-1. We combine measuring soil pore water concentrations from tension lysimeters with a variably saturated hydrologic flow model to estimate N leaching losses under different fertilizer scenarios in two soil types. Vertical N fluxes are given at the soil surface, within, and below the root zone. We find N losses from high-clay soils to be nearly two orders of magnitude lower than low-clay soils likely due to lower fluid flux and higher anion exchange in the high-clay soils. Organic material additions (from leguminous tree prunings) reduced N leaching losses substantially in low-clay soils likely by changing the timing of N-release and by increasing soil organic matter (and thus improving water retention and the formation of soil aggregates). Predicting the fate of added N in SSA is very important as N application is poised to increase in this vulnerable and under-studied region.",

            "abstract": "Luni-solar gravitational forcing drives the Earth’s body-tide response over periods ranging from 8 hours to 18.6 years, a timespan that extends far beyond the seismic band. A finite volume numerical study of body tides in the semi-diurnal (SD) band by Latychev et al. (2008; EPSL) demonstrated that aspherical density and elastic structure inferred from seismic tomography perturbed the radial crustal displacement response by ~1 mm, a level at which they can be observed with modern space-geodetic inferences of body tide signals (Yuan et al., 2012; EPSL). Thus, site-specific estimates of the body-tide response to the known luni-solar forcing potentially provides a new, independent and powerful method for probing long-wavelength, deep mantle structure. To this end, we have used advances in seismic free oscillation theory to derive a new normal mode treatment of the SD body tide response of an aspherical, rotating and anelastic Earth. The accuracy of the theory is demonstrated by benchmarking our body tide predictions against both finite volume treatments of aspherical structure and previous theoretical and observational constraints on the effects of anelasticity. We begin by summarizing these results, as well as a series of synthetic tests that indicate that the body tide response is particularly sensitive to long wavelength, deep mantle structure – a sensitivity that is ideal for investigating the elastic and density structure of the two large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) that exist below the Pacific and southern Africa. Finally, we also present results from a first tidal analysis of the integrated density of the LLSVPs and discuss the implications of these results for the ongoing debate concerning the relative size of thermal and chemical effects on these structures, their net buoyancy and longevity.",

            "abstract": "On 10 April 2014 a magnitude Mw 6.1 struck central Nicaragua. The main event and the aftershocks were clearly recorded by the Nicaraguan seismic network. These crustal earthquakes were strongly felt but caused relatively little damage to the city of Managua and to the surrounding cities and towns. This is in sharp contrast to the destructive effects of the 1972 earthquake in the capital city of Managua. The differences in damage stem from the fact that in 1972, the earthquake occurred on a fault beneath the city; in contrast, the 2014 event lies offshore, under Lake Managua. The distribution of aftershocks shows two clusters of seismic activity. In the northwestern part of Lake Managua, an alignment of aftershocks suggests a southeast trending fault. The reported source mechanism suggests right-lateral strike slip motion on a plane with the same azimuth as the aftershock sequence. A second cluster of seismic activity occurred simultaneously, but spatially separated, beneath Apoyeque volcano. There is no clear alignment of the epicenters in this cluster. Seismic scaling relations between magnitude and the fault length predict a length of approximately 10 km for an earthquake of this magnitude. This is in agreement with the extent of the fault defined by the aftershock sequence. The northeast - southwest trending Tiscapa and Ciudad Jardín faults that broke during the 1972 and 1931 Managua earthquakes are orthogonal to the fault where the 10 April earthquake occurred. This set of conjugate faults confirms that Central Nicaragua is being deformed in a complex tectonic style of deformation. The forearc sliver between the trench and the volcanic arc moves to the northwest relative to the Caribbean plate. This deformation, however, does not take place on a single set of faults. The motion is apparently accommodated by a system of conjugate faults: right lateral, strike-slip faults oriented parallel to the volcanic arc and another set of faults trending northeast - southwest, on which the slip is left lateral. The presence of this complex geometry of conjugate faults highlights the seismic hazard not only in the capital city of Managua, but also to the major Nicaraguan cities, all lying close to the volcanic arc.",

            "abstract": "The Upper Troposphere / Lower Stratosphere (UTLS) plays a significant role in controlling the chemical composition and the radiative property of the stratosphere. Transport and mixing processes with time scales ranging from a few hours (e.g., convection) to several months (e.g., slow ascent) have been previously observed in this region of the atmosphere. While the tropics act as the dominant gateway for air entering the stratosphere, monsoon regions have recently gained significant interest as sources of direct injection of surface air into the extratropical stratosphere, bypassing the thermal and chemical control of the tropics.\nIn this study, we use high-altitude aircraft measurements of chemical tracers with different atmospheric lifetimes to investigate the aforementioned processes. These measurements were recently collected over the tropics during the NASA ATTREX campaign and over the North American Monsoon (NAM) region during the NASA SEAC4RS campaign. In addition, we use surface station data and trajectory analysis in order to elucidate the chemical and dynamical context of the aircraft measurements. Our goals are twofold: (i) examine the age of air and age spectra in the UTLS over the tropics and the NAM region, and (ii) examine the transport rates linking the tropics and midlatitudes at UTLS altitudes. This study is primarily based upon the analysis of greenhouse gas data, in particular CO2. This tracer has a well-defined seasonal cycle driven by biosphere-atmosphere interactions and an annual trend driven by anthropogenic activity. This ‘clock-like’ property makes it a useful tracer for studying transport timescales. This information is then complemented by process-specific information given by additional chemical tracers such as H2O, O3, CO, and short-lived hydrocarbons. Multi-tracer aircraft data from more than 150 vertical profiles over the tropical Pacific and over 50 vertical profiles over the NAM region between Jan 2013 and Mar 2014 provide unprecedented statistics for elucidating specific processes and timescales controlling the chemical and dynamical properties of the UTLS. Understanding these properties in the UTLS is important for accurately forecasting the long-term impact of surface emissions and convective activity on the climate system.",

The soil profiles (12 layers) in Gobi desert and riparian sites of Ejina were installed with sensors to monitor soil moisture and temperature for 1 year. The meteorological conditions and water table were measured by micro weather stations and mini-Divers respectively in the two sites. Soil properties, including particles composition, moisture, bulk density, water retention curve, and saturated hydraulic conductivity of two site soil profiles, was measured. The observations showed that soil temperatures for the two sites displayed large diurnal and seasonal fluctuations. Temperature gradients with depth resulted in a downward in summer and upward in winter and became driving force for thermal vapor movement. Soil moistures in Gobi desert site were very low and varied slowly with time. While the soil moistures in riparian site were complicated due to root distribution but water potentials remained uniform with time. The hydrus-1D was employed to simulate evapotranspiration processes. The simulation results showed the significant difference of evaporation rate in the Gobi desert and riparian sites.",

            "abstract": "Flooding from landfalling tropical cyclones can affect drainage networks over a large range of basin scales. We develop a method to characterize the spatial distribution of flood magnitudes continuously over a drainage network, with focus on flooding from landfalling tropical cyclones. We use hydrologic modeling to translate precipitation fields into a continuous representation of flood peaks over the drainage network. The CUENCAS model (Cunha 2012) is chosen because of its ability to predict flooding over various scales with minimal calibration. Taking advantage of scaling properties of flood magnitudes, a dimensionless flood index (Smith 1989, Villarini and Smith 2010) is obtained for a better representation of flood magnitudes for which the effects of basin scales are reduced. Case study analyses from Hurricane Irene are carried for the Delaware River using Stage IV radar rainfall fields. Reservoir regulation is implemented in CUENCAS since the Delaware River, like many large rivers, is strongly regulated. With limited info of dam operation and initial water level, reservoirs are represented as filters that directly reduce streamflow downstream, as a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Results show a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 for all the available flood peak observations. Uncertainties are mostly from errors in rainfall fields for small watersheds, and reservoir regulation for large ones. The hydrological modeling can also be driven by simulated rainfall from historical or synthetic storms: this study fits into our long-term goal of developing a methodology to quantify the risk of inland flooding associated with landfalling tropical cyclone.",

            "abstract": "The D/V Chikyu, committed to scientific ocean drilling since 2007, has completed thirteen IODP expeditions, and Chikyu’s enhanced drilling technology gives us the means to reach deep targets, enhanced well logging, deep water riserless drilling, and state of the art laboratory.\n Chikyu recovered core samples from 2466 meters below sea floor (mbsf) in IODP Exp. 337, and drilled to 3058.5 mbsf in IODP Exp. 348, but these are still not the limit of Chikyu’s capability. As deep as these depths are, they are just halfway to the 5200 mbsf plate boundary target for the NanTroSEIZE deep riser borehole. There are several active IODP proposals in the pipeline. Each has scientific targets requiring several thousand meters of penetration below the sea floor. Riser technology is the only way to collect samples and data from that depth.\n Well logging has been enhanced with the adoption of riser drilling, especially for logging-while-drilling (LWD). LWD has several advantages over wireline logging, and provides more opportunities for continuous measurements even in unstable boreholes. Because of the larger diameter of riser pipes and enhanced borehole stability, Chikyu can use several state-of-the-art downhole tools, e.g. fracture tester, fluid sampling tool, wider borehole imaging, and the latest sonic tools. These new technologies and tools can potentially expand the envelope of scientific ocean drilling.\n Chikyu gives us access to ultra-deep water riserless drilling. IODP Exp. 343/343T investigating the March 2011 Tohoku Oki Earthquake, explored the toe of the landward slope of the Japan Trench. This expedition reached the plate boundary fault target at more than 800 mbsf in water depths over 6900 m for logging-while-drilling, coring, and observatory installation. This deep-water drilling capability also expands the scientific ocean drilling envelope and provides access to previously unreachable targets.\n On top of these operational capabilities, Chikyu’s onboard laboratory is equipped with state-of-the-art instruments to analyze all science samples. X-ray CT creates non-destructive 3D images of core samples providing high resolution structural detail. The microbiology laboratory offers clean and contamination-free work environments required for microbiological samples.",

In the present data analysis, we took advantage of the IUGONET data analysis system. The Sq amplitude clearly showed a 10-12 year solar activity dependence and it tended to enhance during each solar maximum. During the minimum of solar cycle 23/24 in 2008-2009, the Sq amplitude became the smallest in the investigated period. The relationship between the solar F10.7 index and Sq amplitude is approximately linear but 64 percent of geomagnetic stations show a weak nonlinear dependence on the solar F10.7 index. In order to remove the effect of solar activity seen in the long-term variation of the Sq amplitude, we calculated a linear or second order fitting curve between the solar F10.7 index and Sq amplitude during 1947-2013, and examined the residual Sq amplitude, which is defined as the deviation from the fitting curve. As a result, a majority of the trends in the residual Sq amplitude that passed through a trend test showed a negative value in a wide region. This tendency was relatively strong in Europe, India, the eastern part of Canada, and New Zealand. The relationship between the magnetic field intensity and residual Sq amplitude showed an anti-correlation for about 71 percent of geomagnetic stations. On the other hand, the residual Sq amplitude in the equatorial station (Addis Ababa) was anti-correlated with the absolute value of the magnetic field inclination. This implies the movement of the equatorial electrojet due to the secular variation of the ambient magnetic field.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and simulating coupled water and heat transfer appropriately in the shallow subsurface is of vital significance for accurate prediction of soil evaporation that would improve the coupling between land surface and atmosphere, which consequently could enhance the reliability of weather and climate forecast. The theory of Philip and de Vries (1957), accounting for coupling between liquid water flow, vapor diffusion and heat transport, was considered physically incomplete and consequently extended by several researchers via taking into account more processes such as vapor convection, dispersion, air flow and dynamic phase change between liquid and vapor. Furthermore, the film flow process induced by adsorptive forces, which was also ignored in Philip and de Vries model for characterizing soil hydraulic parameters, was shown to be non-negligible for soil moisture and evaporation flux calculation in dry soils based on a recent synthetic analysis (Mohanty and Yang, 2013). In fact, the importance of these additional processes in arid and semiarid regions should be critically evaluated. Therefore, a general nonisothermal two-phase flow numerical model is developed to investigate the different conceptual model concepts, assumptions and processes regarding coupled water and heat transport in soils using two field data sets including Riverside, California and Audubon, Arizona. It is found that for the Riverside, California data sets, where the soil is relatively moist, the film flow effect is not very significant. However, for drier soils at the Audubon site in Arizona, the liquid film flow effect was significantly important. The airflow effect is important in both the Riverside site, California and Audubon, Arizona site data set and needs to be accounted for. In addition, the model taking into account non-equilibrium phase change effect is most complicated, however most accurate for both the sites in the study",

            "abstract": "The intermittent nature of strain at geological faults is a consequence of the loss of rigidity of the gouge. Due to the granular nature of the gouge, we take insight from granular physics in order to characterize the role of gouge in the generation of seismic events. In static granular packings, the loss of rigidity has been observed to be associated with an excess in low-frequency vibrational modes. The same holds true in both molecular and colloidal glasses, suggesting that excess low-frequency vibrational modes are a general feature in the failure of disordered solids. Therefore, we seek a relationship between these low-frequency modes and spatiotemporal patterns of failure by studying an experimental analog to a geological fault. Specifically, we measure the acoustic emissions from jammed, quasi-2D granular packings under shear. We use a split-bottom annular shear geometry, driven with a linear-ramp torque in order to generate stick-slip behavior, and observe intervals of both periodic and aperiodic slip. We investigate how low-frequency emissions are associated with both local and global slip events of various magnitudes and directions. Twelve piezoelectric acoustic receivers, an imaging system, and high-resolution stress/strain sensors enable direct comparison of acoustic properties as the system approaches failure. The use of photoelastic grains enables local measurement of changes to the internal stresses.",

As a first step to understanding the mechanism for this phenomenon, we address the question: what is the relation between impulsive electron precipitation events and lightning strokes? Two recent developments permit progress on this question, global lightning location networks that precisely locate and time lightning strokes, and the BARREL mission's acquisition of over 9000 hours of stratospheric bremsstrahlung observations. The analysis consists of identifying impulsive electron precipitation events in BARREL's bremsstrahlung record and relating those to immediately prior lightning strokes, with consideration for lightning network detection efficiency. A strong relation between impulsive precipitation events and lightning implies a primary role of the previously studied lightning-induced electron precipitation phenomenon. A weak relation implies another unrecognized mechanism is responsible for these isolated impulsive events. Understanding the conditions, mechanisms, and extent of isolated impulsive electron loss events is a part of an overall goal to comprehend magnetospheric trapped electron population variability.",

The region-wide drought in 2012 left surface soils disconnected from stream networks and restricted nutrient use by crops, resulting in an unusually large nitrogen pool in soil columns through the winter. When wet conditions returned to the Midwest in 2013, the unused fertilizer was mobilized, resulting in a six-week period of extremely high in-stream nutrient concentrations. This study analyses three synoptic samples from the Iowa-Cedar River Basin in 2013 to quantify patterns in nitrogen dynamics. We use multiple conservative ions as tracers to estimate dilution by lateral inflows. We also estimate nutrient spiraling metrics by treating the fertilizer pulse as a constant rate nutrient addition across the watershed—a scale on which these processes are increasingly modeled numerically, but on which standard nutrient addition experiments are simply not feasible. Results of this study compare patterns in dilution and uptake across spatial and temporal scales, and bound feasible explanations for each reach of the network.",

In this study, we compare three different types of mesh; the Chilean Coresa mesh mentioned above, a German mesh called FogHa-Tin, and an optimized mesh designed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a POSS-PEMA dipped metallic mesh (Park et al, 2013). These meshes vary greatly in composition, as well as price.\nIn order to determine which mesh is most optimal for fog collection in a variety of meteorological conditions, standard collectors of each type described above with a mesh area of 1.00 square meter have been placed at five locations around central California with accompanying meteorological instrumentation.

The exact nonlinear solution provides for an explicit comparison of features between linear and nonlinear waves such as dispersion relations and traveling wave speeds.

            "abstract": "The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is the second largest inland river basin in arid Western China. The Heihe river has been significantly modified to make human settlements possible, particularly involving regulating water flow and extracting groundwater to support irrigated agriculture. It remains unknown how these engineered modifications alter transfers of carbon and nutrients from the watersheds to the river. We sampled surface water and groundwater in the middle reach of the HRB during contrasting hydrology regimes. In addition to DOM and nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate), a series of parameters (δ18O, δD, cation, and DIC) were analyzed to constrain water sources. Five DOM fluorescence components were identified, including two terrestrial humic-like components (C1 and C2), two protein-like components (C3 and C4), and one component (C5) indicative of resistant compounds persisting in deep groundwater. During the period of high discharge, high fluxes of DOM and nutrients were observed, and DOM was characterized by higher %C1, %C2 and %C5, lower %C3 and %C4, greater values of humification index, and lower values of fluorescence index (FI). This observation suggests that high riverine flow mobilized soil-derived OM and resistant OM into the river but suppressed the contributions of autochthonous, microbial OM. δ13C-DOC values fell in a general range indicative of the dominance of C3 plants but became more enriched in agricultural areas, indicating the influence of corn OM. A positive correlation between nutrient concentrations versus FI values during the period of low discharge suggests that irrigation return flow was an important source for both nutrients and humic DOM in the river. Our data demonstrate that watershed exports of nutrients and DOM were collectively controlled by hydrology and watershed land use, and the influence of land use was more evident during low discharge regimes.

            "abstract": "In this study, we present a record of ice-sheet melt derived from space-borne gravity that spans over two decades—beyond the time-frame of the GRACE mission.\nGRACE fields are merged with conventional tracking data (SLR/DORIS) spanning 1992 to the present. They are provided as weekly global fields of degree and order five without C50 and S50 but with C61 and S61. Their multi-decade timespan complements the monthly fields of GRACE of degree and order 60 that start in 2003 and will end when the GRACE mission terminates. The two datasets are combined via an empirical orthogonal function analysis, whereby the conventional tracking data temporal modes are obtained by fitting the SLR/DORIS coefficients to the GRACE spatial modes via linear least squares. Combining those temporal modes with GRACE spatial modes yields the reconstructed global gravity fields.\nThe error budget of the reconstructions is composed of three components: the SLR/DORIS covariances, the errors estimated from the assumption that GRACE spatial modes can be mapped over the SLR/DORIS timeframe, and the covariances from the least squares fit applied to obtain the SLR/DORIS temporal modes.\nThe reconstructed surface mass changes in Greenland and Antarctica, predominantly captured in the first mode, show a rate of mass loss that is increasing since 1992. The trend of mass changes in Greenland over various epochs match with an overarching study assembling altimetry, gravimetry, and interferometry estimates of ice-sheet balance over a 1992-2011 time-frame [Shepherd et al., 2012]. Antarctica shows a trend that is different because of updated GIA models [A et al., 2013] compared to the other studies. We will also show regional mass changes over various other basins, as well as the influence of each SLR/DORIS coefficient on the reconstructions.\nThe consistency of these results underscores the possibility of using low-resolution SLR/DORIS time-variable gravity solutions as a way to continuously monitor the behavior of the polar ice-sheets in the absence of GRACE.\nShepherd, A., et al.

            "abstract": "The evolution of electron hole (EH) propagation in the presence of plasma density inhomogeneity is investigated by both particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation and theory. At the beginning of simulation, EH is generated by plasma blob injection. When EH passes inhomogeneous plasma region, the EH potential (1st order) increases monotonically in proportion to the background plasma density (0th order). With this 1st order growth, 2nd order back and forth oscillations of the potential are observed in faster time scale compared to EH propagation time scale. A bulk motion of trapped electrons due to density gradient produces these potential oscillations and the frequency of 2nd order oscillation is found to be comparable to the bouncing frequency of these trapped particles. Using the theoretical technique introduced by Schwarzmeier, we discovered a normal mode localized in the 1st order EH potential with frequency comparable to average bounce frequency of trapped particle. Such mode has an odd symmetry that is exactly consistent with simulation result. Furthermore, ions are pushed backward in coherence with 2nd order potential in simulation. These coherent ions form into a train of backward propagating ion acoustic solitary waves (IASWs) that evolve to ion hole in simulation. Finally, EH starts to dissipate by nonlinear Landau damping and converge to another stable EH as it reaches high-density, homogenous region.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor hydrothermal systems feature intricate interconnections among oceanic, geological, hydrothermal, and biological processes. The advent of the NEPTUNE observatory operated by Ocean Networks Canada at the Endeavour Segment, Juan de Fuca Ridge enables scientists to study these interconnections through multidisciplinary, continuous, real-time observations. The multidisciplinary observatory instruments deployed at the Grotto Mound, a major study site of the NEPTUNE observatory, makes it a perfect place to study the response of a seafloor hydrothermal system to geological and oceanic processes.\nIn this study, we use the multidisciplinary datasets recorded by the NEPTUNE Observatory instruments as observational tools to demonstrate two different aspects of the response of hydrothermal activity at the Grotto Mound to geological and oceanic processes. First, we investigate a recent increase in venting temperature and heat flux at Grotto observed by the Benthic and Resistivity Sensors (BARS) and the Cabled Observatory Vent Imaging Sonar (COVIS) respectively. This event started in Mar 2014 and is still evolving by the time of writing this abstract. An initial interpretation in light of the seismic data recorded by a neighboring ocean bottom seismometer on the NEPTUNE observatory suggests the temperature and heat flux increase is probably triggered by local seismic activities. Comparison of the observations with the results of a 1-D mathematical model simulation of hydrothermal sub-seafloor circulation elucidates the potential mechanisms underlying hydrothermal response to local earthquakes. Second, we observe significant tidal oscillations in the venting temperature time series recorded by BARS and the acoustic imaging of hydrothermal plumes by COVIS, which is evidence for hydrothermal response to ocean tides and currents. We interpret the tidal oscillations of venting temperature as a result of tidal loading on a poroelastic medium. We then invoke poroelastic theories to estimate the crustal permeability, a fundamental property of subsurface hydrothermal circulation, from the phase shift of the tidal oscillations of venting temperature relative to ambient ocean tides. These results together shed light on the influences of seismic and oceanic processes on a seafloor hydrothermal system.",

In South Korea, the national government provides infrastructures for industrial parks where various companies in manufacturing and other industries are concentrated . Because of their concentration, damages can aggravate in case of natural disasters such as typhoons. In this study, vulnerability indices for climate change were developed and evaluated using climate scenarios for the climate exposure of localized terrential downpour for eight industrial parks. The vulnerability indices were selected and reviewed through literature review and two in-depth interviews with experts in various industries, and the assessment of vulnerability to climate change was conducted by collecting relevant information including the Directory of Industrial Complexes. The vulnerability of each industrial park to climate change was assessed for four time serious such as the base line, 2020s, 2050s, and 2100s . As a result, even though the possibility of localized heavy rain was the highest in Yeosu(Southeast coast) at present, but it was predicted that Gwangyang(Southwest coast) will be higher in the future. For the influences of climate including sensitivity, Ulsan Mipo(Southeast coast) is currently under the highest influence of climate, but the Gumi(Inland area) was forecasted to be under the highest influence of climate in the future.  As a result of the assessment of vulnerability to climate change including adaptive capacity, Gumi and Myongji Noksan(Southeast coast) were most vulnerable to localized heavy rain. The degree of vulnerability of all the industrial parks except Ulsan and Yeosu was forecasted to increase in the future, albeit slightly. Policy suggestions for the management of industrial parks were derived based on these findings by considering the regions and industries that are vulnerable to localized heavy rain if existing industrial parks are renovated or new industrial parks are planning.",

In the this study, the turbulence in the troposphere and stratosphere were delineated by applying the raw data of temperature, pressure and humidity obtained from radiosondes to Thorpe analysis by taking into account the effect of saturation in the temperature profiles and also the instrument noise. The study shows that turbulence strength decreases with altitude in the troposphere and is found to be high during the Indian summer monsoon season in the altitude region 2 to 10 km. Thin layers of turbulence are persistently observed within the Tropical Tropopause layer (TTL). This study also showed that, the occurrence of turbulence is relatively large in the altitude region 10-15 km than in altitude region of 3 to 8 km. In the TTL region, occurrence of turbulence is very small and least in the stratosphere. The gross structure of turbulence in the troposphere and stratosphere at the two stations are similar. The mean structure of occurrence of the turbulence are closely associated with altitude structure of stability parameters. This study indicates that, the mechanisms responsible for the generation of turbulence in the troposphere at the two stations are the same. While the turbulence in the 10-15 km region is mainly governed by the convective instabilities, the turbulence in the TTL region is caused by both dynamic and convective instabilities. The generation of turbulence in the lower stratosphere could be due to strong wind shear. These features of turbulence will have different implications in determining the distribution of minor constituents and alter the composition and microphysics in that region.",

These reactions likely control the fate and lifetimes of organic compounds and influence the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from snow and ice. Triplet excited states of organic compounds (3C*) can be important aqueous oxidants in atmospheric drops and in surface waters, but little is known of this class of oxidants in frozen samples. When exposed to light, 3, 4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (DMB), a product from biomass combustion, is excited to its triplet state (3DMB*), which can either return to the ground state, react with oxygen to form singlet oxygen, or oxidize organics, such as phenol. In this study, we examine the photochemical loss of phenol due to reaction with 3DMB* in laboratory ice samples as a function of pH, temperature, total solute, and oxygen concentration. Our results show that the rate of phenol loss due to 3DMB* is significantly enhanced in ice compared to the equivalent liquid sample at the same photon flux. This suggests that reactions of triplet excited states in ice can be significant sinks for organics, and perhaps reactive inorganic species, in snow and ice.",

Especially, changes of sources and concentration of nitrate (NO3-) in river water were focused to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic nitrogen loadings from agricultural and residential areas. Stable nitrogen isotope ratio (δ15N) of aquatic organisms has also intensively been monitored not only to describe their food web structure, but also to detect the influences of extraneous nitrogen inputs. Field samplings an observation campaigns were conducted in the Arida river watershed located in central part of Japan at four different seasons from September 2011 to October 2012. Five observation points were set from headwaters to the point just above the brackish waters starts. Water samples for chemical analysis were taken at the observation points for each campaign. Organisms including leaf litters, benthic algae, aquatic insects, crustacean, and fishes were sampled at each point quantitatively.\nResults of the riverine survey utilizing 5 regular sampling points showed that δ15N of nitrate (NO3-) increased from forested upstream (˜2 ‰) to the downstream (˜7 ‰) due to the sewage loads and fertilizer effluents from agricultural area. Correspondingly the δ15N of benthic algae and aquatic insects increased toward the downstream. This indicates that primary producers of each reach strongly relied on the local N sources and it was utilized effectively in their food web. Simulation using a GIS based mixing model considering the spatial distributions of human population density and fertilizer effluents revealed that strongest impacts of N inputs was originated from organic fertilizers applied to orchards in the middle to lower parts of catchment. Differences in δ15N between primary producers and predators were 6-7 ‰ similarly at all sampling points. Food web structural analysis using food network unfolding technique based on observed δ15N suggested that the structure of nutrient pyramid did not differ significantly along the riverine positions, while the members of species in each trophic revel changed and the impact of anthropogenic N input was visible along the river.",

            "abstract": "As does Earth, Mars presents pronounced global atmospheric circulation patterns. Solar differential heating drives mean meridional overturning (Hadley) circulations which are deep and intense, are hemispherically asymmetric, and where a cross-equatorial single cell dominates. Within middle and high latitudes, thermally indirect eddy-driven (Ferrel) circulation cells have been indicated. Differently, however, large-amplitude orography on planetary and continental scales on Mars can force very non-Earth-like hemispheric circulation patterns. Recent observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, \"Mars Color Imager\" (MARCI) instrument are utilized that emphasize water ice clouds in ultra-violet (UV) wavelengths, and these measurements have been binned into \"daily global maps\" (DGMs) of water-ice cloud optical depth. The presence of large-scale, extratropical quasi-stationary atmospheric wave disturbances in middle and late winter of the northern hemisphere have been found to be present in such DGMs. In combination with such observations, a full-physics Mars global climate model (NASA ARC marsgcm 2.1) is applied to place the observations into context. During late northern winter, it is found that strong, forced Rossby modes (i.e., planetary waves) exist, and with direct correlation to column-integrated cloud opacity undulating spatial patterns. At this season, zonal wavenumber s = 2 dominates (in contrast to wavenumber s = 1), consistent with MGS/TES analyses at this particular season (Banfield et al., 2003). Large-scale, planetary waves dictate the \"coherence\" of the northern polar vortex. Fundamentally, such forced planetary waves influence the polar vortex's impermeability (wave-induced) to tracer transport (e.g., dust and water-ice aerosol) and temporal mean water vapor spatial variations. The large-scale dynamical features of such planetary waves will be highlighted and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Co-spectral budgets of turbulent sensible heat and momentum fluxes were recently combined to develop models that explain the variation of the turbulent Prandtl number with several forms of the Richardson number in stable atmospheric surface layers. The shapes of the vertical velocity and air temperature spectra, as well as a wave-number dependent relaxation time scale assumed to be the same for momentum and heat, are required in such budgets. Guided by these theoretical approaches, the shapes of the vertical velocity and temperature spectra are first examined with increasing flux Richardson number (Ri) using data from two field experiments. The focus is on the relation between spectral and co-spectral behavior in the vicinity of the so-called critical flux Richardson number (Ricr ≈ 0.2−0.25). In addition, the wave-number dependent relaxation time scales for momentum and heat fluxes are inferred and examined. Using the data and extensions to the co-spectral budgets, results pertaining to how the shapes of the vertical velocity and temperature spectra impact the relative importance of turbulent kinetic energy (in the vertical direction) and potential energy, as well as the origin of any dissimilarity between relaxation time scales for momentum and heat fluxes are presented. The findings here offer a new perspective on how to bridge the micro-states of the energy distribution of eddies (kinetic and potential) with macroscopic relations needed in practical problems such as determination of stability correction functions to the mean flow.",

            "abstract": "Estimating the landscape-scale exchange of ecologically relevant trace gas and energy fluxes from tower eddy-covariance (EC) measurements is often complicated by surface heterogeneity. For example, a tower EC measurement may represent less than 1% of a grid cell resolved by mechanistic models (order 100–1000 km2). In particular for data assimilation or comparison with large-scale observations, it is hence critical to assess and correct the spatial representativeness of tower EC measurements.\nWe present a procedure that determines from a single EC tower the spatio-temporally explicit flux field of its surrounding. The underlying principle is to extract the relationship between biophysical drivers and ecological responses from measurements under varying environmental conditions. For this purpose, high-frequency EC flux processing and source area calculations (≈60 h−1) are combined with remote sensing retrievals of land surface properties and subsequent machine learning. Methodological details are provided in our companion presentation “Towards the spatial rectification of tower-based eddy-covariance flux observations”.\nWe apply the procedure to one year of data from each of four AmeriFlux sites under different climate and ecological environments: Lost Creek shrub fen wetland, Niwot Ridge subalpine conifer, Park Falls mixed forest, and Santa Rita mesquite savanna. We find that heat fluxes from the Park Falls 122-m-high EC measurement and from a surrounding 100 km2 target area differ up to 100 W m−2, or 65%. Moreover, 85% and 24% of the EC flux observations are adequate surrogates of the mean surface-atmosphere exchange and its spatial variability across a 900 km2 target area, respectively, at 5% significance and 80% representativeness levels. Alternatively, the resulting flux grids can be summarized as probability density functions, and used to inform mechanistic models directly with the mean flux value and its spatial variability across a model grid cell. Lastly, for each site we evaluate the applicability of the procedure based on a full bottom-up uncertainty budget.",

During the same period, at least two phases of abrupt global sea-level rise - `meltwater pulses' - took place. Although the timing and magnitude of these events have become better-constrained, a causal link between ocean stratification, the meltwater pulses, and accelerated ice loss from Antarctica has not been proven. Here we simulate Antarctic ice sheet evolution over the last 25 kyr using a data-constrained ice-sheet model forced by changes in Southern Ocean temperature from an Earth system model. Results reveal several episodes of accelerated ice-sheet recession, the largest being coincident with meltwater pulse 1A. This resulted from reduced Southern Ocean overturning following Heinrich Event 1, when warmer subsurface water thermally eroded grounded marine-based ice and instigated a positive feedback that further accelerated ice-sheet retreat.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate precipitation uncertainty and to understand its impact on flood estimation, toward to further improve the accuracy of a real-time Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS,\nhttp://flood.umd.edu/\n). We investigate the precipitation uncertainty impacts on streamflow calculations through the Dominant river tracing-Routing Integrated with VIC Environment (DRIVE) model (the core of the GFMS) with a set of real precipitation products. These precipitation products include satellite-based, ground radar based, gauge based and reanalysis (with gauge data) based precipitation estimations. There are significant differences in the mean annual, seasonal, and IFloodS period precipitation estimation among the existing precipitation products. To estimate the bias in each precipitation products, a “reference” of mean annual precipitation was created. The simulated streamflow was compared to the observation, while the upstream basin-area-averaged mean annual precipitation at each location with USGS gauge observation was derived to compare with the “reference”.\nThe sensitivity of the DRIVE model performance in reproducing streamflow to precipitation inputs, clearly showed that better precipitation inputs (with less bias) tend to result in better streamflow simulations. This indicates better accuracy of the GFMS is expected when improved satellite-based real-time precipitation products are available through the GPM in near future. Real-time Satellite-based precipitation resulted in overall lower model performance scores than the conventional precipitation products and gauge-adjusted remote sensing precipitation estimations. However, the lower scores are mainly attributed to the inconsistency of precipitation estimation in a few extreme events. While precipitation bias mainly contributes to the over/underestimation of the flood magnitude, the DRIVE model tends to lead to faster flood waves for relatively larger floods in downstream part of the Iowa and Cedar River basin. Model calibration or a better representation of the overbank flow (for floodplain) is expected to further improve the flood timing estimation.",

            "abstract": "Under California’s Cap-and-Trade program, companies are looking to invest in land-use practices that will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a drained cultivated peatland system and a large source of CO2. To slow soil subsidence and reduce CO2 emissions, there is growing interest in converting drained peatlands to wetlands. However, wetlands are large sources of CH4 that could offset CO2-based GHG reductions. The goal of our research is to provide accurate measurements and model predictions of the changes in GHG budgets that occur when drained peatlands are restored to wetland conditions. We have installed a network of eddy covariance towers across multiple land use types in the Delta and have been measuring CO2 and CH4 ecosystem exchange for multiple years. In order to upscale these measurements through space and time we are using these data to parameterize and validate a process-based biogeochemical model. To predict gross primary productivity (GPP), we are using a simple light use efficiency (LUE) model which requires estimates of light, leaf area index and air temperature and can explain 90% of the observed variation in GPP in a mature wetland. To predict ecosystem respiration we have adapted the Dual Arrhenius Michaelis-Menten (DAMM) model. The LUE-DAMM model allows accurate simulation of half-hourly net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in a mature wetland (r2=0.85). We are working to expand the model to pasture, rice and alfalfa systems in the Delta. To predict methanogenesis, we again apply a modified DAMM model, using simple enzyme kinetics. However CH4 exchange is complex and we have thus expanded the model to predict not only microbial CH4 production, but also CH4 oxidation, CH4 storage and the physical processes regulating the release of CH4 to the atmosphere. The CH4-DAMM model allows accurate simulation of daily CH4 ecosystem exchange in a mature wetland (r2=0.55) and robust estimates of annual CH4 budgets. The LUE- and CH4-DAMM models will advance understanding of biogeochemisty and microbial processes in managed peatland systems as well as aid the development of a GHG protocol in the Delta that can provide financial incentive to farmers to reduce GHG emissions under California’s Cap and Trade program.",

            "abstract": "North America's largest glacier system, the Bering Bagley Glacier System (BBGS) in Alaska, surged in 2011-2013, as shown by rapid mass transfer, elevation change, and heavy crevassing. Little is known about the physics controlling surge glaciers' semi-cyclic patterns; therefore, it is crucial to collect and analyze as much data as possible so that predictive models can be made. In addition, physical signs frozen in ice in the form of crevasses may help serve as a warning for future surges. The BBGS surge provided an opportunity to develop an automated classification tool for crevasse classification based on imagery collected from small aircraft. The classification allows one to link image classification to geophysical processes associated with ice deformation. The tool uses an approach that employs geostatistical functions and a feed-forward perceptron with error back-propagation. The connectionist-geostatistical approach uses directional experimental (discrete) variograms to parameterize images into a form that the Neural Network (NN) can recognize. In an application to preform analysis on airborne video graphic data from the surge of the BBGS, an NN was able to distinguish 18 different crevasse classes with 95 percent or higher accuracy, for over 3,000 images. Recognizing that each surge wave results in different crevasse types and that environmental conditions affect the appearance in imagery, we designed the tool's semi-automated pre-training algorithm to be adaptable. The tool can be optimized to specific settings and variables of image analysis: (airborne and satellite imagery, different camera types, observation altitude, number and types of classes, and resolution). The generalization of the classification tool brings three important advantages: (1) multiple types of problems in geophysics can be studied, (2) the training process is sufficiently formalized to allow non-experts in neural nets to perform the training process, and (3) the time required to manually pre-sort imagery into classes is greatly reduced.",

Most recently, I applied stereo photogrammetric processes during the DEEPWAVE mission, which focused on deeply propagating atmospheric gravity wave dynamics upstream of the New Zealand Southern Alps. This field campaign, which took place in and around New Zealand between May 24th and July 27th, 2014, was based at Christchurch Airport, but used information from various ground-based research facilities. Two research aircraft equipped with instruments for airborne remote sensing were also involved; the NSF/NCAR HIAPER GV and the DLR Falcon. DEEPWAVE allowed for the intertwining of multiple fields of study and emphasizes the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to research.

            "abstract": "Many studies of future coastal flooding vulnerability consider sea level rise and tides only, typically applying a bath-tub type approach that omits key physical-forcing factors that elevate flood levels during storm events such as waves, surge and fluvial discharge. Here we present a new modeling approach that considers all the relevant factors that contribute to elevated water levels for open coast and embayment settings along the U.S. West Coast during projected 21stcentury storms.\nThe Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) is a numerical modeling system developed to predict coastal flooding due to both SLR and plausible 21st century storms for active-margin settings like the U.S. West Coast. CoSMoS applies a predominantly deterministic framework that encompasses large geographic scales (100s to 1000s of kilometers) yet models flood extents to a local resolution (2 m) so that storm related changes in water levels at the shore can be resolved. In the latest iteration of CoSMoS applied to San Francisco Bay, efforts were made to incorporate water level fluctuations in response to trapped coastal waves, low pressure systems, ocean swell energy penetrating through the Golden Gate, locally wind-generated waves, and backflow induced by river discharge. The end product is a web-based tool (www.prbo.org/ocof) where users can assess variations in flood extent, maximum flood depth, maximum current velocities and wave heights in response to a number of potential SLR and storm combinations, providing direct support for adaptation and management decisions. Future efforts in Southern California will feature a dynamic coastal DEM that evolves over decadal time scales to provide updated boundary conditions for future storm simulations.",

            "abstract": "Bangladesh is a country that comprises much of the world’s largest delta containing the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers. Flooding is a fact of life in Bangladesh where up to two-thirds of the country is flooded annually from combined monsoonal rains and Himalayan snowmelt. For this reason, understanding flood dynamics on both local and regional scales is critical. However, flood hazard studies to date typically rely on single flooding events to create flood maps and to evaluate flood hazards using satellite imagery. We use geographic information systems (GIS) to analyze hydrological time series data from the Bangladesh Water Development Board. Weekly data from 304 river gauges and over 1,200 groundwater gauges were used to map and model annual flooding events from 2003-2012. These data are useful because of the large temporal detail they will provide, which some satellite imagery can not. Spatial and temporal analysis techniques give insight into flooding and precipitation trends at the country and administrative district level. While precipitation has remained relatively constant through the time series, the average country-wide inundation depth has been decreasing. This trend could possibly be associated with improved flood management strategies in not only Bangladesh, but surrounding countries that are within the Ganges-Brahmaputra watershed.",

            "abstract": "Due to the combination of natural and anthropogenic sources of emission over the Nile Delta region, the air quality status is very poor and has a significant health hazards impacts on the population.  Here we focused on the optical and chemical characterizations of atmospheric aerosols in the Nile Delta using the online integrated Environmental-Climate Aerosols model (EnvClimA) during a 10 year period 2000-2010. Observations from MODIS and SeaWiFS measurements supplemented by CALIPSO and some ground-based data from AERONET, are used to validate the EnvClimA model and to illustrate the aerosol characteristics and their sources. CALIPSO measurements were used to characterize the vertical structure of aerosols and their shapes (spherical and non-spherical) for major dust storms and biomass burning events. In this study we discussed the synoptic patterns and features, which are associated with either the dust storm or high pollution events. We used MODIS derived aerosol parameters to study seasonal changes in aerosol parameters due to the influence of dust storms, anthropogenic pollution and biomass (crop residue) burning. MODIS derived deep blue AOD provided better representation of aerosol loading over north Africa (Sahara region) along with dark-target AOD and related parameters. AERONET data provided aerosol optical depth, angstrom, fine mode fraction, size fraction, volume, effective radius, refractive index, single scattering albedo, and radiative forcing during different seasons dominated by dust storms, anthropogenic pollution and biomass burning (black cloud phenomena).  The results indicated that the observed AOD decreases in the summer and increases again in the fall due to agricultural burning events. Ground-based AERONET data support the “Dark Product” MODIS retrievals, as they typically show a fall peak in the 500 nm region. The number of dust distribution frequencies over Egypt has more frequency in the southeast and northwest of Egypt (5-7.5 days/year) while it decreases over Sinai Peninsula with 4-7 days/year. The meteorological data from NCEP reanalysis and the HYSPLIT model were used to identify major aerosol transport pathways over the study area. The pathways are clustered into seasonal low and high (polluted: dust or biomass or anthropogenic) aerosol days.",

            "abstract": "Filtration is relevant to many disciplines from colloid transport in environmental engineering to formation damage in petroleum engineering. In this study we compare the results of the novel numerical modeling of filtration phenomenon on pore scale with the complementary experimental observations on laboratory scale and discuss how the results of comparison can be used to improve macroscale filtration models for different porous media. The water suspension contained glass beads of 200 micron diameter and flows through a packing of 1mm diameter glass beads, and thus the main filtration mechanism is straining and jamming of particles. The numerical model simulates the flow of suspension through a realistic 3D structure of an imaged, disordered sphere pack, which acts as the filter medium. Particle capture through size exclusion and jamming is modeled via a coupled Discrete Element Method (DEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach. The coupled CFD-DEM approach is capable of modeling the majority of particle-particle, particle-wall, and particle-fluid interactions. Note that most of traditional approaches require spherical particles both in suspension and the filtration medium. We adapted the interface between the pore space and the spherical grains to be represented as a triangulated surface and this allows extensions to any imaged media.\nThe numerical and experimental results show that the filtration coefficient of the sphere pack is a function of the flow rate and concentration of the suspension, even for constant total particle flow rate. An increase in the suspension flow rate results in a decrease in the filtration coefficient, which suggests that the hydrodynamic drag force plays the key role in hindering the particle capture in random sphere packs. Further, similar simulations of suspension flow through a sandstone sample, which has a tighter pore space, show that filtration coefficient remains almost constant at different suspension flow rates. This indicates that a balance between jamming mechanism for particle capture and hydrodynamic drag force for particle mobilization is more likely to take place in tighter porous media. Finally, we show preliminary simulations of surface forces that are required for this method to be applicable to wider range of sizes of suspended particulates.",

Column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 and CH4 (XCO2 and XCH4) are retrieved from the Short-Wavelength InfraRed (SWIR) spectral data observed with the Thermal And Near-infrared Sensor for carbon Observation - Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) onboard GOSAT. The present NIES full physics SWIR retrieval algorithm (ver. 02.xx) showed smaller biases and standard deviations (-1.48 ppm and 2.09 ppm for XCO2 and -5.9 ppb and 12.6 ppb for XCH4, respectively) than those of the ver. 01.xx by comparing with data of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). GOSAT retrievals from the GOSAT TANSO-FTS SWIR spectra for more than five years are now ready for scientific research, but may be still influenced by thin aerosols and clouds.\nUnder GOSAT validation activities, we made aircraft observation campaigns to validate the GOSAT products and calibrate TCCON FTSs installed in Japan. In their campaigns, we also made partial column measurements of CO2 with an airborne laser absorption spectrometer, and comparison of ground-based CO2Differential Absorption Lidars with aircraft measurement data. Their active remote sensing experiments are for development of new validation methodology for passive space-based mission and fundamental development for future active space-based mission.\nThe Ministry of the Environment, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and the National Institute for Environmental Studies also started the development of the follow-on satellite, GOSAT-2 in 2013. GOSAT-2 will be launched in 2017 – 2018. Instruments onboard GOSAT-2 are similar to current GOSAT.\nThe SWIR passive remote sensing of greenhouse gases would be more or less affected by aerosols and thin cirrus clouds. Therefore, active remote sensing is expected to solve it and extend observations during nighttime and to be complementary with passive remote sensing which is adequate to wider observations.\nIn this presentation, we will show results on GOSAT observations, validation activities, and lessons learnt from passive remote sensing of greenhouse gases for next-generation remote sensing.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic remanence directions recorded in the glassy sub-lithologies of mid-Miocene rheomorphic Snake River Plain ignimbrites are often discrepant compared to the more reliable directions in crystalline centers and underlying baked paleosols. The rocks have undergone no tectonic strain, and the rheomorphic deformation preserved in the rock occurs at ˜800°C, above magnetic blocking temperatures. Accounting for the discrepantly shallow directions is critical for the use of magnetic remanence for stratigraphic correlation and structural/tectonic reconstructions. Here we present paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data from the Grey’s Landing Ignimbrite that demonstrate a strong magnetic anisotropy carried by pseudo-single to single domain magnetite grains which deflect the remanence direction by up to 40°. Strongly lineated anisotropic samples collected at distant sections ( ˜20 km separation) have their remanence deflected toward the respective flow directions inferred from their directions of maximum magnetic susceptibility (K1). Shallow K1 directions in the basal vitrophyre cause a shallowing of magnetic remanence, while a range of steep to shallow K1 directions in the folded upper vitrophyre cause both a steepening and shallowing of the remanence, respectively. There is a strong relationship between the magnitudes of remanence deflection, anisotropy of thermal remanence, coercivity, and strength of natural remanent magnetization between individual samples. There is also a strong relationship between the magnitudes of partial anisotropy of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (pAARM) and the deflection of the remanence vector difference directions, which both increase significantly with higher alternating magnetic fields. Correction of the vector difference direction using the inverse of the pAARM tensor for the same AF range is moderately successful. Previous work suggests that curvilinear demagnetization trends in the basal vitrophyre of an ignimbrite were evidence of grain rotation below the unblocking temperature. This work, however, shows that this observation is sometimes caused by a magnetic anisotropy that is increasingly larger in grains with higher coercivity (and probably also unblocking temperature).",

            "abstract": "Stresses resulting from time-varying tidal forces have been advocated as a primary driver of tectonism on icy satellites in orbits with sufficient eccentricities. Diurnally varying tidal stresses can cause both dextral and sinistral shear during one orbit, presumably contributing to fault initiation and propagation in the icy shell. Observed strike-slip structures indicate the occurrence of mode II shearing; however, the role of bidirectional cyclic shear in fault initiation and development is poorly constrained. To more fully understand the kinematic evolution of faults as a consequence of diurnal bidirectional shear, we perform a set of analog experiments. We use a tectonic apparatus to induce cyclic bidirectional shear in unconsolidated heterogeneous sand, which has similar material properties (i.e., a Coulomb material) to ice when scaled. Using a suite of initiation directions and offset ratios (with a subsequent suite of net offsets), we perform experiments with dry sand and repeat with wet sand (10 wt. %) overlain by dry sand. Our results indicate that, regardless of the offset ratio, after only 1-2 cycles bidirectional shear results in the development of linear (dry sand) to curvilinear (wet/dry sand) fault traces with topographically low damage zones and high fault-flanking ridges. We consider that such ridges may be analogous to those found on Europa and Enceladus. Initial fault-flanking ridges are discontinuous, as is observed for some younger faults on Europa. After additional cycles, ridges mature into more continuous fault-flanking features, suggesting a possible granular mechanical origin for ridges on icy satellites. The rate of ridge maturation is dependent on displacement per offset and net offset per cycle. Experiments with larger displacements per offset, as well as those with net offset, result in more rapid ridge maturation. By utilizing estimated fault displacements and net offsets per orbital cycle (based on existing mechanical models), and assuming ridge formation is a mechanical process as our model suggests, we may infer tentative lower limits for the orbital ages of ridged faults on icy satellites. We compare our model results to a variety of features on Europa, the icy satellite displaying the most diverse expressions of deformation, and find geomorphic and structural similarities.",

            "abstract": "Poor management of rangelands has led to significant soil organic matter losses globally, and contributed to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Restoring and increasing soil carbon (C) content in rangelands offers an opportunity to mitigate climate change while improving soil conditions and increasing forage production. Organic matter amendments are used to improve soil properties, but predicting the resulting changes in soil C is challenging due to the interactions between amendment characteristics, climate, and soil characteristics. We used data from 10 pasture-based dairies in California and the DayCent model to test the impact of long-term (>30 year) manure additions on soil C pools and fluxes. Soils were sampled from 26 fields which had solid, liquid, solid and liquid, or no manure additions. These field data and management information provided by the ranchers were used to model the effects of manure amends on soil C storage and loss.\nSoil C was significantly greater in manured fields than non-manured fields when corrected for clay content and slope. Fields with higher clay had more soil C, as did those with lower slopes, and these effects were large enough to confound the manuring effect. DayCent was able to accurately estimate total soil C when parameterized with field-specific management practices, averaging only a 10±1% difference between measurement and modeled values. Using generalized management histories for manured and non-manured fields, as would be used for regional-scale estimates, produced less accurate results with a 24±3% average difference between measurement and modeled values. Modeling alternate scenarios for each field suggested that manure amendment increased soil C and forage production by 0.6 Mg ha-1 y-1 and 0.3 Mg ha-1 y-1, respectively. Forecasting to 2100 showed that in manure-amended fields, soil C increased until 2080 before stabilization, mostly through gains in the pool with slow turnover. The “passive soil C” pool generally declined due to a legacy effect of the historical shift in vegetation from perennial to annual grasses, and did not recover over the timespan considered here. These results demonstrate the potential of manure amendment to increase soil C in some rangelands and the ability of DayCent to reasonably approximate changes in soil C in response to management.",

Lasting only about 70 ka, the Jaramillo has frequently been missed (or is missing) from many magnetostratigraphic studies of the Early Pleistocene. We have examined two internally-drained basins with high sediment accumulation rates, that also contain Sanidine-bearing tephras. At Kit Fox Hills, in the Death Valley Basin, we sampled across 50m of tilted (45°) fine-grained sandstone/siltstone. A normal polarity magnetozone was delineated over ~12m of section (sedimentation rate of ~15cm/ka). We also collected 8 tephra beds, 4 of which are within the normal magnetozone, and 2 below and 2 above. To the east is the Tecopa Basin, which until the middle Pleistocene was internally-drained. We sampled through 36m of mudstones between the Tecopa Tuff (1.25 Ma) and the Bishop Tuff (0.77 Ma). A normal magnetozone was delineated over a 9m interval, ending 12.5m below the Bishop Tuff. A Sanidine-bearing tephra (previously unidentified) was found 4m above the base of the Jaramillo zone. There were 2 beds of reverse polarity within the Jaramillo zone, at 4.5m and 8m above the base. At least the lower one has been reported from other continental deposits (China, Spain). These sections should provide precisely calibrated chronostratigraphic tie points (approximately every 10-30 ka), providing sub-precessional level, direct geochronological control through the Jaramillo subchron. These sections are also being examined for paleo-environmental indicators (and minerals) that can be used to determine wetter or drier conditions (expanding saline lakes or dry playas).

Nevertheless, a direct link between Symbiodinium ROS production and coral bleaching has not been demonstrated. In fact, given the abundance and diversity of microorganisms within the coral holobiont, the concentration and fluxes of ROS within corals may involve several microbial sources and sinks. Here, we explore the role of increased light and temperature on superoxide production by coral-derived cultures of Symbiodinium algae and Oceanospirillales bacteria of the genus Endozoicomonas, which are globally common and abundant associates of corals. Using a high sensitivity chemiluminescent technique, we find that heat stress (exposure to 34°C vs. 23°C for 2hr or 24hr) has no significant effect on extracellular superoxide production by Symbiodinium isolates within clades B and C, regardless of the level of light exposure. Exposure to high light, however, increased superoxide production by these organisms at both 34°C and 23°C. On the other hand, extracellular superoxide production by Endozoicomonas bacteria tested under the same conditions was stimulated by the combined effects of thermal and light stress. The results of this research suggest that the sources and physical triggers for biological superoxide production within corals are more complex than currently assumed. Thus, further investigations into the biological processes controlling ROS dynamics within corals are required to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning coral bleaching and to aid in the development of mitigation strategies.",

            "abstract": "A 1-year pilot experiment using pressure-sensor-equipped inverted echo sounders (PIES) was conducted in Sermilik Fjord in eastern Greenland to test non-traditional methods for measuring the time-varying heat content in high-latitude seas, shelves, and fjords and for detecting the presence of ice. PIES, which are installed on the seafloor below the reach of destructive iceberg keels, present a promising and inexpensive way to improve understanding of fjord dynamics and shelf-fjord interactions and will increase long-term monitoring capabilities in high latitudes where remoteness and harsh conditions hamper traditional in situ observation techniques. The use of PIES to characterize variability at high latitudes is a novel application of an existing technology, but rests on the same principle as the traditional blue-water uses for PIES: due to the dependence of sound speed on temperature, the surface-to-bottom round-trip acoustic-travel-time associated with reflections between the PIES and the air-sea interface is an excellent proxy for heat content in the intervening water column. Furthermore, since reflections from seawater-ice interfaces are also detected when ice is present, PIES provide a means to characterize the ice component in high-latitude systems. The PIES deployed in Sermilik Fjord (August 2011 – September 2012) resolved changes in heat content at scales ranging from hourly to seasonal. Furthermore, during winter, the PIES logged about 300 iceberg detections and recorded a 2-week period of land-fast ice cover in March. The deepest icebergs in the fjord were found to have keel depths reaching to ~350 m and iceberg speeds averaged about 0.2 m/s but were as high as 0.5 m/s.",

This data set is employed to validate a 2D Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes model with VOF-tracking scheme and a k-ε turbulence closure. The numerical model is compared with measurements under different forcing conditions (H=0.6 m to 1.0 m and T=8 s to 14 s) over both rough and smooth steep (1/6) beach slopes. The depth and phase resolving model simulations are used to further investigate the cross-shore variability of turbulence dissipation and shear stress at the tip of the swash lens.

            "abstract": "A detailed paleomagnetic and rock magnetic investigation has been carried out on the Early Cretaceous Ponta Grossa dike swarm in southern Brazil. This formation seems an excellent target for paleomagnetic study. The dikes are widely distributed over a large area, easy to access, and they record faithfully the geomagnetic field at the time of the eruption.\nMost of them are fresh and have been dated by K-Ar and Ar-Ar. Thermomagnetic experiments (low-field versus temperature curves) suggest low-Ti titanomagnetites as main remanence carriers, and their domain structure is characterised by a mixture of singledomain and multi-domain grains. Characteristic paleomagnetic directions are retrieved from 28 out of 29 sites (235 standard paleomagnetic cores). 17 sites show normal polarity, 10 sites show reverse polarity and one site shows an oblique direction, with negative inclination, separated 79° of the mean normal directions. The reversal test is positive at the 95% confidence level which ensures that the secondary remanent magnetizations were successfully removed and the sampling adequately averaged the palaeosecular variation.\nThe paleosecular variation parameters values obtained in this study correlate with those determined for the Cretaceous Normal Superchron, between 125 to 84 Ma. The new paleomagnetic pole position (222.0° E, 88.1° S, N = 24, K = 35.68, A95 = 5.0°) agrees well (within uncertainties) with the reference poles determined from Besse and Courtillot (2002), and disagree with those reported in previous studies. The new results should be considered for estimating the Cretaceous paleomagnetic poles for stable South America.",

            "abstract": "Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano on Earth, has exhibited signs of unrest consisting of increased seismicity beginning in March 2013 and slow inflation starting in early 2014. A previous episode of unrest occurred during 2002–2009, with swarms of deep long-period (DLP) earthquakes at >30 km depth and inflationary deformation. Mauna Loa is currently in the longest period of repose in the last 200 years, its last eruption having occurred in 1984.\nSeismic precursors to eruptions of Mauna Loa eruptions in 1975 and 1984 included episodic volcano-tectonic (VT) events centered northwest of the summit at depths of ~7 km and to the south of the caldera at <5 km depth. Current seismic activity, which has also been episodic, has also consisted of VT events occurring in similar locations, but with much lower energy release than the 1975 and 1984 seismic activity. Beginning in late May 2014, there was also an increase in the occurrence of DLP events. While approaching the numbers of earthquakes seen during the 2002 swarm (31 events) the current number of DLPs thus far pales in comparison to the 2004-2005 swarm (2000 events). As of July 2014, subtle inflationary deformation is apparent in both InSAR and GPS data, although inflation rates are much less than those observed in the several years preceding and following the 1984 eruption, and also far less than during the height of the 2002-2009 unrest. The inflation is consistent with pressurization of the known 3-5-km-deep magma storage area beneath Mauna Loa’s caldera.\nSeismic event rates and deformation, though smaller in magnitude, are similar to the precursory activity seen in 1975 and 1984. Careful tracking of the current unrest by recently upgraded seismic and geodetic monitoring, regardless of whether or not it culminates in eruption, offers excellent prospects for unraveling Mauna Loa’s magma plumbing system and structure. In this presentation we will give a synoptic view of unrest associated with Mauna Loa as recorded on a recently upgraded seismic and geodetic monitoring network.",

            "abstract": "High-dimensional parametric uncertainty exists in many parts of atmospheric climate\nmodels. It is computationally intractable to fully understand their impact on the climate\nwithout a significant reduction in the number of dimensions. We employ Bayesian Compressed\nSensing (BCS) to perform adaptive sensitivity analysis in order to determine which\nparameters affect the Quantity of Interest (QoI) the most and the least. In short, BCS\nfits a polynomial to the QoI via a Bayesian framework with an L1 (Laplace) prior. Thus,\nBCS tries to find the sparsest polynomial representation of the QoI, i.e., the fewest\nterms, while still trying to retain high accuracy. This procedure is adaptive in the sense\nthat higher order polynomial terms can be added to the polynomial model when it is likely that\nparticular parameters have a significant effect on the QoI. This helps avoid overfitting and is much more computationally efficient.\nWe apply the BCS algorithm to two sets of single column CAM (Community Atmosphere Model)\nsimulations. In the first application, we analyze liquid cloud fraction as modeled by\nCLUBB (Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals), an atmospheric cloud and turbulence model.\nThis liquid cloud fraction QoI depends on 29 different input parameters. We compare main\nSobol sensitivity indices obtained with the BCS algorithm for the liquid cloud fraction in\n6 cases, with a previous approach to sensitivity analysis using deviance. We show BCS can\nprovide almost identical sensitivity analysis results. Additionally, BCS can provide an\nimproved, lower-dimensional, higher order model for prediction. In the second\napplication, we study the time averaged ozone concentration, at varying altitudes, as a\nfunction of 95 photochemical parameters, in order to study the sensitivity to these\nparameters. To further improve model prediction, we also explore k-fold cross validation\nto obtain a better model for both liquid cloud fraction in CLUBB and ozone concentration\nin CAM.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research under the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing program.",

            "abstract": "Upernavik Isstrøm (UI) in Northwest Greenland consists of 4 main marine terminating outlets terminating into the same fjord (Upernavik Isfjord). The individual glaciers at UI have shown general acceleration in ice speed since 1985 (Khan et al., 2013), however, the spatial and temporal patterns of these events are highly variable. The different response to similar climate forcings of the 4 marine terminating outlet glaciers makes UI a good study site for understanding processes important for the highly complex relation between climate and dynamic mass loss. Basal friction is one of the major controls of ice flow and is poorly known due to the inaccessibility of the bed. Basal friction depends on the origin and temperature of the bed, ice flow velocity, as well as basal hydrology including surface meltwater reaching the bed. Knowledge about the evolution of the basal friction pattern will increase our understanding of the relation between climate and ice dynamics. In this study we use the velocity maps from the MEaSURES Ice Velocity dataset (Joughin et al., 2011) to investigate velocity changes at UI from 2000 – 2013. With a focus on the seasonal changes from 2009 to 2013 where maps are usually available for February, April, July, August and November. The study show how the acceleration event at the northernmost glacier in 2006-2007 (Khan et al., 2013), continues into 2010. Furthermore, we see a large acceleration from 2008 and onwards on the second glacier, increasing the accelerated area dramatically and causing thinning of more than 2 m/yr upstream glacier (~30 km from the margin). The velocity maps will be used to obtain basal friction maps by inverting the full stokes solution in the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) as in Morlighem et al. (2010) to investigate the evolution of the basal friction throughout the period.",

Water samples from 40 deep-water stations south of 25˚N were collected during XIXIMI-2 cruise, July 2011, aboard BO/Justo Sierra. Vertical profiles of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen (DO) were further measured in each station. In the Stable Isotopes Laboratory at CICESE we determined the carbon isotopic composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (δ13CDIC). Remarkably, density, DO and δ13CCID profiles showed a clear difference between the Loop current and the deep-waters of the GM south of 25˚N. We found the following average δ13CCID values in the Loop current and in the deep-waters of the Gulf: subtropical underwater (SUW): 0.73±0.06‰ and 0.86±0.04‰; 18 degree water (18W): 0.76 ± 0.08‰ and 0.58± 0.06‰; North Atlantic central water (NACW): 0.77 ± 0.05‰ and 0.71 ± 0.09‰; South Atlantic central water (SACW): 0.80 ± 0.08‰ and 0.77 ± 0.07‰; Antartic intermediate water (AAIW): 1.00 ± 0.06‰ and 0.90 ± 0.08‰; North Atlantic deep water (NADW): 1.03 ± 0.06‰ and 1.01 ± 0.10‰. We will discuss how the biological component, δ13CCID-BIO, of subsurface water masses match very closely the apparent oxygen utilization relation described by Kroopnick, 1985, with the exception of SUW, and as a consequence the 18W is probably the water mass most affected by organic carbon remineralization processes in the GM south of 25˚N. We further show how these waters seem to store a larger proportion of anthropogenic carbon than the deeper water masses.",

            "abstract": "Flood prediction and mitigation are important aspects of watershed management, especially in New England where a 30-year upward trend in floods has been attributed to a combination of urbanization and climate change. In addition to urban development, New England is currently experiencing an increase in agricultural land development. The land surface component of gridded hydrology models captures how these land use changes alter elements of the hydrologic cycle, leading to changes in river discharge. In this study, we use a gridded hydrology model (WBM) and a physically based river model (CaMa-Flood) to quantify changes in fluvial regime due to past (1980-2010) and projected future (2010-2050) land use change.\nThe CaMa-Flood model originally has been developed and validated for continental to global scales, accurately modeling discharge and inundation of large rivers. Here, we suggest a methodology incorporating locally available survey data for applying the same model structure to regional studies of past and future flood risk assessments in six New England basins. Locally estimated river geometry parameters using direct measurement results in increased simulation accuracy as validated against USGS in-situ gauged discharge. In sensitivity analysis, we found that accurate calibration of the river geometry parameters is dependent upon the spatial scale of the simulation. In addition to calibrating river geometry parameters, we incorporated direct observational data from field surveys, and compared the resulting flood simulations.",

The sources of the ion temperature include elastic collisions with electrons, and energy exchanges with neutrals accounting for Joule heating and due to temperature difference. The model was constructed using a semi-implicit method on the thermal conduction and all of the temperature-dependent source terms [Huba and Joyce, 2000]. The Nov-24-2012 substorm is investigated using the improved model. The Joule heating and its effect on the ion and neutral temperatures in high-latitudes between the improved and basic models are compared. It is also shown that a decrease in the electron temperature exists in the region of the aurora oval with high electron densities. The partitioning of energy between different source terms and loss terms is investigated throughout the substorm and as a function of location.",

            "abstract": "Most intra-plate oceanic islands are considered to be expressions of partial melting of hot, ascending mantle plumes. Mantle plume activity is often evident by progressively-aged volcanic island chains, early flood basalts, or elevated mantle temperatures (hot-spots). However, some isolated volcanic islands lack these characteristics. Their mantle sources, causes of melting, and geodynamic settings remain elusive. Here we present petrologic and geochemical data for an example of this type of ocean island: Norfolk Island and neighbouring Phillip Island. These islands are only 7 km apart and are located in the Southwest Pacific. They are the only sub-aerial volcanic islands on the Norfolk Ridge, which extends roughly linearly south from New Caledonia and north from New Zealand. The Norfolk Ridge is a continental slice rifted from the eastern Australian margin during opening of the Tasman Sea and the on-going break-up of Gondwana. There are a few isolated, unexplored volcanic edifices trending NNW from the Norfolk Ridge north of Norfolk Island that may be a hot spot trace. Norfolk and Phillip islands are both composed of young (ca. 2-3 Ma), primitive basalts and basaltic andesites containing abundant phenocrysts of olivine and rare pyroxene and feldspar. Major element systematics are unique among the global spectrum of ocean island basalts, with low CaO, high Al2O3, and high Na/Ti indicating that melting processes and/or the mantle source differs from that of any other OIB. However, Fe/Mn are high, similar to other OIB, and REE patterns carry the typical OIB garnet signature. The highest MgO contents approach 9 wt%. The unusual major-element chemistry results in olivine-dominated crystallization extending to low MgO (ca. 6-7 wt%), hence little increase of incompatible elements with decreasing MgO, but surprisingly Ni and Cr also remain nearly constant with MgO. Isotopic compositions (Sr-Nd-Hf) indicate either a primitive mantle source composition (εNd=6-7), consisting of a pure FOZO end-member or depleted mantle (DMM) contaminated with Norfolk Ridge crustal material. We propose that Norfolk and Phillip Islands are a rare type of OIB that formed via low-degrees of melting of a mantle source unmodified by any of the typical enriched endmembers so often observed in other OIB.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increasingly stress water resources in drought-prone areas such as the American Southwest or Central America. Understanding patterns in precipitation frequency and intensity in the recent past are critical to accurately modeling groundwater recharge potential and managing diminishing resources in conjunction with rapid urbanization (e.g. Yucatan, Mexico). Wet and dry seasons on the Yucatan Peninsula are affected by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which can exacerbate drought as the climate warms. This study focuses on precipitation patterns during the late Holocene recorded in foraminifera (Ammonia beccarii, Elphidium sp., Quinqueloculina sp.) and ostracods (suspected Hemicyprideis nichuptensis) along a transect in Celestun Lagoon near Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Submarine groundwater springs feed the north terminus of the lagoon resulting in δ18O and Mg gradients toward the ocean which oscillate in response to increased or decreased precipitation. Mg/Ca ratios from the north (4.59) and south (3.08) lagoon suggest warmer waters in the shallow northern end, resulting in evaporation and confounding the δ18O values there (upper lagoon = 2.1‰, middle lagoon = 0.3‰, lower lagoon = 1.5‰). B/Ca ratios remain fairly constant (average range 27.3-33.2) despite increasing B concentrations toward the southern mouth, suggesting a concurrent increase in dissolved calcium down the lagoon and thus a lower Ca signal in spite of the karst source of springs. Of the four species tested, A. beccarii and H. nichuptensis yielded the most similar results ([Ca] ~ 150 ppm). Replicate analyses are needed for Elphidium sp. and Quinqueloculina sp. due to their low sample size and signal variability which suggests they may not be ideal candidates for paleoenvironmental reconstruction in Celestun Lagoon and possible other marginal environments around the Yucatan Peninsula.",

We present a new record from Antarctica for the past 1000 years, which provides a unique opportunity to establish a baseline of natural heavy metal concentration variability and allows us to distinguish anthropogenic contributions.\nAs part of the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project, a 764m deep ice core was drilled in 2012 and 2013 at Roosevelt Island. The site is located at the north-western edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, and as such is highly influenced by weather systems derived from the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. This presents the opportunity to develop a high-resolution record of background environmental contamination that is representative of the Southern Hemisphere. The isolation of Roosevelt Island from local sources of heavy metals results in a record that is indicative of large-scale source and transport changes.\nOver 2000 samples from the top 300m of the ice core, as well as snow pit and firn core samples, have been analysed for concentrations of 37 different elements. Analyses were made using a Thermo Scientific Element XR with front end modifications to maximise sensitivity to ensure high-quality data for the extremely low concentrations – parts per quadrillion (ppq) for some elements. The transition metal/metalloid elements selected for detailed investigation are Pb, Fe, Al, Co, Mn, Tl, As. High resolution (sub-annual) heavy metal data over the 20th Century are presented and contrasted with lower resolution (three year averaged) data for the past 1000 years.\nSnow samples collected during storm events at Roosevelt Island suggest heavy metal concentrations are associated with long range transport paths over the Southern Ocean, as modelled in Hysplit. By accounting for changes in source strength over the industrial period (using enrichment factors), the RICE heavy metal record can be used to infer large-scale transport changes. The relationships between heavy metal concentrations and ratios and major climate drivers such as the Amundsen Sea Low, the Southern Annular Mode, and the Southern Oscillation are investigated using ERA Interim reanalysis data from 1979 to the present, and the use of heavy metals as a proxy for these climate modulators is evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Although Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is regarded as the de facto method for the application of Kalman Filter in non-linear system, it's application to complex distributed hydrological models faces a lot of challenges. Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is often preferred because it avoids the calculation of the linearization Jacobian Matrix and the propagation of estimation error covariance. EnKF is however difficult to apply to large models because of the huge computation demand needed for parallel propagation of ensemble members. This paper deals with the application of EKF in stream flow prediction using the SWAT model in the watershed of Senegal River, West Africa. In the Jacobian Matrix calculation, SWAT is regarded as a black box model and the derivatives are calculated in the form of differential equations. The state vector is the combination of runoff, soil, shallow aquifer and deep aquifer water contents. As an initial attempt, only stream flow observations are assimilated. Despite the fact that EKF is a sub-optimal filter, the coupling of EKF significantly improves the estimation of daily streamflow. The results of SWAT+EKF are also compared to those of a simpler quasi linear streamflow prediction model where both state and parameters are updated with the EKF.",

            "abstract": "The 3000 km long Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) arc system is an outstanding example of an intraoceanic convergent plate margin. The IBM forearc is a typical nonaccretionary convergent plate margin; the inner trench slope exposes lithologies found in many ophiolites. To more clearly delineate the geology of the forearc, we have been investigating a ~500 km long region of the Mariana forearc south of ~13°N using the DSV Shinkai 6500 and deep-tow camera since 2006. Discoveries includes the presence of MORB-like basalts that formed during subduction initiation (~51 Ma) [Reagan et al., 2010, G3], a region of forearc rifting unusually close to the trench axis, the Southeast Mariana Forearc Rift [Ribeiro et al., 2013, G3], and a serpentinite-hosted ecosystem near the Challenger Deep, the Shinkai Seep Field [Ohara et al., 2012, PNAS].\nHowever, there have been no studies on the southern Mariana area west of the Challenger Deep except one [Hawkins and Batiza, 1977, EPSL], hindering our understanding of the IBM system. To advance our biogeoscientific understanding of this region, a Shinkai 6500 diving cruise (YK14-13) was conducted in July 2014 on two major sites: the inner trench slope west of the Challenger Deep (Site A), and the southwesternmost tip of the Mariana Trough (Site B). Dives at Site A recovered very fresh mantle peridotite associated with troctolite and limestone. The limestone preserves the remnants of corals, clearly indicating that the limestone is an accreted material originating from the incoming (colliding) Caroline Ridge. The freshness of the peridotites also indicates that the collision is an ongoing event, resulting in a protruding peridotite ridge along the inner trench slope west of the Challenger Deep. Dives at Site B recovered basalt and gabbro, which is either new backarc basin crust or rifted West Mariana Ridge crust. This cruise allowed for continued sampling of the inner trench slope of the Mariana Trench, from south of Guam to the Yap Trench junction, a distance of ~800 km. The future synthesis of the cruise results will bring us the first comprehensive biogeoscientific view of the southern Mariana area.\nYK14-13 science party included Y. Ohara, F. Martinez, M.

            "abstract": "Biofuels have the potential to meet future energy needs. Worldwide, up to 75% of biofuels produced are derived from woody sources. Coppiced hybrid willow is among the most promising woody biofuel sources due to its ability to rapidly regenerate after cutting, high biomass yields, low nutrient requirements and ability to be grown on marginal land, abandoned land and land easily erodible under annual cultivation. However, models used to assess the potential viability and sustainability of commercial biomass production by willow in the northeastern, northern and northwestern USA remain unsophisticated and lack key parameterization data. Most significantly, models do not explicitly represent the coppiced growth form. This study tests the ability of a canopy model to predict carbon and water fluxes in two highly productive, but structurally distinct hybrid willows (Salix miyabeana and Salix purpurea) grown in central NY. S. miyaneana has only a few, large diameter stems per stool prior to harvest, while S. purpurea maintains numerous, small diameter stems until harvest. Canopy structure also varies substantially within a growing season. For example, in S. miyabeana stem number decreased by 40% while total basal area increased by 50% within year 2 of the third coppice cycle. Model predictions of water use are compared with stand transpiration measured by sap flow. Model predictions of biomass production are compared to destructive harvest data. Sensitivity of predicted fluxes to variation between genotypes in key physiological parameters is also tested.",

            "abstract": "During the northern Spring 2014 (April-May), IODP Expedition 350 drilled a 1806.5 m deep hole at Site U1437 in the Izu-Bonin rear arc, in order to understand, among other objectives, the compositional evolution of the arc since the Miocene and track the missing half of the subduction factory. The good recovery of mostly fine grained sediments at this site enables a high resolution paleomagnetic and rock magnetic study. Particularly, variations in magnetic properties and mineralogy are well documented. The onboard magnetostratigraphy established from the study of the archive halves highlighted remagnetized intervals that produced “ghost” repetitions of geomagnetic reversals ~10’s meters below their actual stratigraphic position in specific intervals. Onboard paleo- and rock magnetic analyses showed that remagnetization is probably due to a chemical remanence carried by iron sulfides (putatively identified as greigite). The rock magnetic parameters, SIRM/k and the S-ratio are consistent with the presence of ferromagnetic iron sulfides in Site U1437. A mixture of iron oxides and iron sulfides was found within the sulfate reduction zone, which was identified by onboard pore water analyses at ~50-60 meters below sea floor (mbsf) by a minimum in sulfate (~5 mM) coupled with a maximum in alkalinity. Below 50 mbsf, the sulfate content increases up to ~29 mM at ~460 mbsf. The particular downhole profile of the sulfate content in Site U1437 is probably triggered by fluid circulation. Evolution of sulfate content, pyritization process and fluid circulation are closely linked. Onshore research is focusing on further downhole characterization of the iron sulfides including their abundance, grain size and composition. Routine magnetic properties (NRM, magnetic susceptibility) and rock magnetic analyses at high resolution (every ~20-50 cm), including hysteresis properties and low temperature magnetic measurements, have been conducted on about 400 discrete samples in the first 200 m of Hole 1437B (Cores 1H to 30X). As suggested by the onboard data, hysteresis measurements showed the occurrence of both single domain-pseudo single domain iron oxides and iron sulfides in the sulfate reduction zone. Preliminary results will be compared with the geochemical data.",

            "abstract": "Organic carbon availability is an important constraint on microbial activity in the subsurface. Since most sedimentary organic matter is likely high molecular weight and complex, bioavailability of organic carbon is closely tied to activities of extracellular enzymes that hydrolyze organic macromolecules into transportable sizes. In part due to methodological difficulties, few measurements of extracellular enzymatic activities have been made in marine sediments below ca. 20cm depth. We measured extracellular hydrolysis of specific polysaccharides in deep sediments from sapropel and non-sapropel sections of a single core from the Eastern Mediterranean. In order to counteract adsorption of the substrate onto sediment particles, we developed an extraction protocol utilizing competitive desorption and mild heating. This treatment improved substrate recovery from incubation subsamples 5- to 10-fold, and enabled us to detect enzymatic activity in deep subsurface sediments. The wide variation in TOC between proximal sediment layers in this core provided an excellent opportunity to investigate (i) the rate at which subsurface microbial communities can hydrolyze a diversity of organic substrates, and (ii) rates and ranges of enzymatic capabilities as a function of sediment depth, organic carbon load and microbial community composition. Our experiments were carried out in long-term incubations (3-6 weeks), in which substrates were readily hydrolyzed, but hydrolysis rates differed among substrates and among sediment sections. Activity was not correlated with depth, but was highest in sections with highest organic carbon content. Isolation of strains able to grow directly on the substrates of interest are underway, and provide a promising path forward to illuminate mechanisms driving potential hydrolytic activity in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "Induced seismicity is a class of crustal earthquakes resulting from human activities such as surface and underground mining, impoundment of reservoirs, withdrawal of fluids and gas from the subsurface, and injection of fluids into underground cavities. Within the Permian basin in southeastern New Mexico lies an active area of oil and gas production, as well as the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), a geologic nuclear waste repository located just east of Carlsbad, NM. Small magnitude earthquakes have been recognized in the area for many years, recorded by a network of short period vertical component seismometers operated by New Mexico Tech. However, for robust comparisons between the seismicity patterns and the injection well locations and rates, improved locations and a more complete catalog over time are necessary.\nWe present results of earthquake relocations for this area by using data from the 3-component broadband EarthScope Flexible Array SIEDCAR experiment that operated in the area between 2008-2011. Relocated event locations tighten into a small cluster of ~38 km2, approximately 10 km from the nearest injection wells. The majority of events occurred at 10-12 km depth, given depth residuals of 1.7-3.6 km. We also present a newly developed more complete catalog of events from this area by using a waveform cross-correlation algorithm and the relocated events as templates. This allows us to detect smaller magnitude events that were previously undetected with the short period network data. The updated earthquake catalog is compared with geologic maps and cross sections to identify possible fault locations. The catalog is also compared with available well data on fluid injection and production. Our preliminary results suggest no obvious connection between seismic moment release, fluid injection, or production given the available monthly industry data. We do see evidence in the geologic and well data of previously unidentified faults in the area.",

            "abstract": "In 1988, the Instituto Geofisico (IG) began a permanent surveillance of Ecuadorian volcanoes, and due to activity on Guagua Pichincha, SP seismic stations and EDM control lines were then installed. Later, with the UNDRO and OAS projects, telemetered seismic monitoring was expanded to Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, Cuicocha, Chimborazo, Antisana, Cayambe, Cerro Negro, and Quilotoa volcanoes.\nIn 1992 an agreement with the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Electrificacion strengthened the monitoring of Tungurahua and Cotopaxi volcanoes with real-time SP seismic networks and EDM lines. Thus, background activity levels became established, which was helpful because of the onset  of the 1999 eruptive activity at Tungurahua and Guagua Pichincha. These eruptions had a notable impact on Baños and Quito. Unrest at Cotopaxi volcano was detected in 2001-2002, but waned. In 2002 Reventador began its eruptive period which continues to the present and is closely monitored by the IG.  \nIn 2006 permanent seismic BB stations and infrasound sensors were installed at Tungurahua and Cotopaxi under a cooperative program supported by JICA, which allowed us to follow Tungurahua’s climatic eruptions of 2006 and subsequent eruptions up to the present.   \nPrograms supported by the Ecuadorian Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia and the Secretaria Nacional de Planificacion resulted in further expansion of the IG’s monitoring infrastructure. Thermal and video imagery, SO2 emission monitoring, geochemical analyses, continuous GPS and tiltmeters, and micro-barometric surveillance have been incorporated. Sangay, Soche, Ninahuilca, Pululahua, and Fernandina, Cerro Azul, Sierra Negra, and Alcedo in the Galapagos Islands are now monitored in real-time.\nDuring this time, international cooperation with universities (Blaise Pascal & Nice-France, U. North Carolina, New Mexico Tech, Uppsala-Sweden, Nagoya, etc.), and research centers (USGS & UNAVCO-USA, IRD-France, NIED-Japan, SGC-Colombia, VAAC, MIROVA) has introduced the use of new technologies and methods.  An agreement with the Secretaria de Gestion de Riesgos fortifies the communication flow to society, officials, and risk managers.  Today the IG has the challenge of offering real-time information through a web-based net of virtual observatories.",

            "abstract": "Carbon, which is one of the most important volatile elements in the solar system, is suggested to be stored in the deep part of the Earth. The evidence for the deep carbon is found in super-deep diamonds or estimations of carbon fluxes between the surface and interior of the Earth. The candidates of a carbon-source into the mantle are subducting slabs. Therefore, it is important for the studying of Deep Carbon Cycle to reveal the reactions related to carbon-bearing phases in the slabs descending into the lower mantle. The MgCO3-SiO2 system is considered to constrain the carbon-bearing phases in the slabs since following reactions can occur under the lower mantle conditions:\nMgCO3 (magnesite) + SiO2 (stishovite) → MgSiO3 (perovskite) + CO2\nCO2 → C (diamond) + O2\nThe phase boundary in the MgCO3-SiO2 system has ambiguity because of the contradiction between the previous studies. We aimed to reconcile this contradiction and determine the potential carbon-bearing phases in the deep subducting slabs.\nWe have investigated the reaction between MgCO3 and SiO2 up to about 100 GPa and 3000 K using the double sided laser heated diamond anvil cell combined with the in-situ synchrotron XRD technique and Raman spectroscopy. The starting material was a powered 1:1 (in mole fraction) mixture of natural magnesite (Brazil, Bahia) and reagent α-quartz. XRD patterns of high P-T samples and recovered samples were acquired at BL10XU, SPring-8. We measured the Raman spectra of the samples at high-P and room temperature and those recovered at an ambient condition.\nDiamond and MgSiO3 perovskite were observed at 70 GPa and temperatures above 1750 K. The high P-T XRD patterns showed the appearance of MgSiO3 perovskite at 50-60 GPa and around 2000 K. Our study revealed that magnesite could decarbonate to form diamond in cold slabs at the depths greater than 1800- km depth due to the above reactions in the MgCO3-SiO2 system.",

            "abstract": "Progress towards a quantitative and predictive understanding of the earthquake behavior can be achieved by improved understanding of earthquake cycles. However, it is hindered by the long repeat times (100s to 1000s of years) of the largest earthquakes on most faults. At fast-spreading oceanic transform faults (OTFs), the typical repeating time ranges from 5-20 years, making them a unique tectonic environment for studying the earthquake cycle.\nOne striking observation on OTFs is the quasi-periodicity and the spatial-temporal clustering of large earthquakes: same fault segment ruptured repeatedly at a near constant interval and nearby segments ruptured during a short time period. This has been observed on the Gofar and Discovery faults in the East Pacific Rise (EPR). Between 1992 and 2014, five clusters of M6 earthquakes occurred on the Gofar and Discovery fault system with recurrence intervals of 4-6 years. Each cluster consisted of a westward migration of seismicity from the Discovery to Gofar segment within a ~ 2-year period, providing strong evidence for spatial-temporal clustering of large OTFs earthquakes.\nMotivated by the observations at EPR, we conducted a global search for more repeating large earthquakes on OTFs, using surface-wave based determinations of the relative separations between earthquake centroids. We found that there are many more cases of repeating earthquakes on OTFs than previously reported.\nWe also built a numerical model with multiple fault segments in the frame of rate-and-state friction to understand the role of stress transfer on the spatial-temporal clustering of large earthquakes on OTFs. We used the Gofar and Discovery faults as a model. We found that static stress transfer alone can explain the clustering of earthquakes if these fault segments are close (< a few km). Otherwise, viscoelastic or dynamic stress transfer will play a more important role.",

            "abstract": "The Round Top Mountain peraluminous rhyolite, exposed at the surface in Sierra Blanca, Hudspeth County, west Texas, USA, is enriched in yttrium and heavy rare earth elements (YHREEs). Other potentially valuable elements in the deposit include Be, Li, U, Th, Sn, F, Nb, and Ta. Texas Rare Earth Resources Corp. proposes to extract the YHREEs from the host mineral variety yttrofluorite by inexpensive heap leaching with dilute sulfuric acid, which also releases some of the Be, Li, U, F, and Th from other soluble minor minerals.\nData: Feldspars and quartz comprise 90-95% of the rhyolite, with pheonocrysts of up to 250 microns set in an aphanitic matrix that hosts the typically sub-micron target yttrofluorite. Reverse circulation cuttings from some 100 drill holes, two drill cores, and outcrop and trench observations suggest striking physical homogeneity through this billion-plus ton surface-exposed laccolith, about 1200 feet high and a mile in diameter (375 x 1600 m). Gray to pink, and other minor hues, color variation derives from magnetite—hematite redox reaction.\nPlots of Y, 13 REEs, U, Th, and Nb analyses from over 1500 samples collected from 64 drill holes (color codes in figure) exhibit remarkably little variation in the concentration of these elements with geographic position or depth within the laccolith.\nImportance: Uniform mineralization grades help insure against the mining production surprises often associated with vein deposits and heterogeneous open pit deposits. At Round Top, mine feedstock can be relatively constant over the life of the mine (multiple decades), so the mechanical mining process can be optimized early on and not need expensive alterations later. Likewise, the chemical and physical parameters of the heap leach can be perfected. The sensitive and expensive process of extraction of elements and element groups from the pregnant leach solution and purification also can be optimized.\nOrigin: The remarkable homogeneity of the YHREE distribution through the laccolith suggest YHREE and associated mineralization from a late-stage fluorine vapor generated within the magma in situ, rather than from injection of a F-rich fluid from an external source. The micron-scale cavities that produce up to 5% original porosity in the rhyolite may be nano-analogues of the cavities associated with granite pegmatites.",

We performed experiments at physical conditions representative of deep-sea and subsurface systems (300°C and 1000 bar) and analyzed the effect of the mineral magnetite (Fe3O4) in systems with carboxylic acids, either phenylacetic acid or hydrocinnamic acid (a.k.a., phenylpropanoic acid). Control experiments were also conducted with the same organic compounds in the absence of magnetite. Whereas previous studies of carboxylic acid reactivity with minerals have focused exclusively on simple molecules such as acetic acid and valeric acid (Bell et al. 1994; McCollom et al. 2003), the carboxylic acids used in our study differ from previous experimental compounds by the addition of a phenyl ring, which allows for the investigation of the specific mechanistic pathways of product formation. Decarboxylation (i.e., RCO2H → RH + CO2) is one of the major reaction pathways for carboxylic acids in hydrothermal conditions without minerals. Under our experimental conditions, decarboxylation leads to the ~80% conversion of phenylacetic acid into toluene within ~50 hours and the ~8% conversion of hydrocinnamic acid to ethyl benzene within ~190 hours. We found that magnetite had a different effect on the two organic compounds studied. In experiments with phenylacetic acid, the presence of magnetite did not enhance the rate of toluene production from decarboxylation but did activate additional product pathways that include diphenyl alkanes, alkenes, and ketones, as well as benzoic acid, a carboxylic acid one carbon length shorter than the parent compound. Magnetite had even more noticeable effects on the hydrocinnamic acid system leading to an increase of its consumption at 190 hours from ~9% in magnetite’s absence to ~35% in the mineral’s presence. Products of the experiments with magnetite included an enhanced rate of decarboxylation product formation and activation of additional product pathways including diphenyl alkanes, alkenes, ketones and more. Our investigations involving reactivity of abundant functional groups, including carboxylic acids, reveal the varieties of processes available both on the Earth today and at the dawn of life.",

            "abstract": "During the peak of the Millennium Drought (1997-2010) pool-levels in the lower River Murray in South Australia dropped 1.5 metres below sea level, resulting in large-scale mass failure of the alluvial banks. The largest of these failures occurred without signs of prior instability at Long Island Marina whereby a 270 metre length of populated and vegetated riverbank collapsed in a series of rotational failures. Analysis of long-reach bathymetric surveys of the river channel revealed a strong relationship between geomorphic and hydraulic controls on channel width and downstream alluvial failure. As the entrenched channel planform meanders within and encroaches upon its bedrock valley confines the channel width is ‘pinched’ and decreases by up to half, resulting in a deepening thalweg and channel bed incision. The authors posit that flow and shear velocities increase at these geomorphically controlled ‘pinch-points’ resulting in complex and variable hydraulic patterns such as erosional scour eddies, which act to scour the toe of the slope over-steepening and destabilising the alluvial margins. Analysis of bathymetric datasets between 2009 and 2014 revealed signs of active incision and erosional scour of the channel bed. This is counter to conceptual models which deem the backwater zone of a river to be one of decelerating flow and thus sediment deposition. Complex and variable flow patterns have been observed in other mixed alluvial-bedrock river systems, and signs of active incision observed in the backwater zone of the Mississippi River, United States. The incision and widening of the lower Murray River suggests the channel is in an erosional phase of channel readjustment which has implications for riverbank collapse on the alluvial margins. The prevention of seawater ingress due to barrage construction at the Murray mouth and Southern Ocean confluence, allowed pool-levels to drop significantly during the Millennium Drought reducing lateral confining support to the over-steepened channel margins triggering large-scale riverbank failure.",

            "abstract": "The 2200 km3 Academy of Sciences ice cap, located on Komsomolets Island in the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago, is the largest ice cap by volume in the Russian High Arctic (Dowdeswell et al., 2002). We use remote sensing observations to examine velocity and elevation changes at its five major outlet glaciers over the past few decades.\nWe obtain glacier velocities by applying pixel-tracking (normalized amplitude cross-correlation) to orthorectified, high-resolution image pairs acquired by WorldView 1 and 2 with an ideal time separation of 1-3 months. We select imagery from the spring and summer periods where crevasses are clearly observed. We estimate uncertainties by examining apparent motion at bedrock outcrops adjacent to the glaciers, and use these off-ice offsets to correct for elevation-dependent errors. We compare our observations of velocities from high-resolution optical imagery between 2011 and 2014 with rates of motions measured in the 1990’s and 2000’s by Landsat, ASTER and SAR (Moholdt et al., 2012; Stewart, 2014) to determine if the velocities have changed.\nIce streams B, C, and D have maximum velocities of 2.8 m/day, 2.5 m/day and 2.3 m/day, respectively. Our velocities are similar to observations from 2009-2012 (Stewart, 2014), and higher than 1995 velocities (Moholdt et al.). We provide constraints on seasonal velocity variations at Ice Streams B, C and D.\nIce elevation change rates (determined using Worldview DEMs compared to a cartographically produced DEM) are consistent with those measured over the ICESat era between 2003 and 2009. In general the south and east of the ice cap is thinning, while the north and west is thickening. The main body of the land terminating Icestream A is continuing to slowly thicken, while thinning rates of more than 1-2 m/yr are occurring at the remaining marine terminating ice streams. Thinning extends to the highest altitude of the ice cap and crosses ice stream catchments boundaries.",

            "abstract": "A steady tendency towards decrease in the observed total ozone cannot be attributed to space sources of energy such as the sun and cosmic galactic rays because the energy of these sources is stable for several decades. The north-south asymmetry of ozone in the global structure of ozonosphere rules out man-made sources as a significant factor of the ozone decrease. Most of the pollutants come to the northern hemisphere; however, there is about 30% more ozone in it than in the southern hemisphere.\nWe jointly analyzed the global distribution of ozone from TOMS satellite data, the surface of the earth’s core from seismic tomography, and lithospheric plate movements from GPS and concluded the following: (1) There are sources of energy in the solid earth which contribute to the atmospheric ozone; (2) The large-scale geodynamics should be considered among the mechanisms responsible for the global structure of ozonosphere and its evolution with time. We also note similarities in the pattern of ozone caused by sources in the solid earth (“terrestrial ozone”) and the patterns of geomagnetic and gravity fields.\nThe global morphology of terrestrial ozone suggests a “breakup” in the initial ozone distribution at about the same time as a breakup of Pangea and subsequent spreading of the area of higher ozone content. A restored initial breakup is located in the oceanic region and runs northwest to southeast across Africa. We propose a large-scale geodynamic process: a convective flow in the mantle from the earth’s core surface provokes the breakup of Pangea and the breakup of ozone distribution",

            "abstract": "We present a methodology to infer the geometry of fluid-filled fractures (both aperture and length) using the interaction between tube waves in cylindrical fluid-filled conduits and trapped waves in fractures intersecting the conduit. This approach could be applied to study engineered fractures in oil and gas reservoirs as well as volcanic systems. We specifically investigate the reflection and transmission of tube waves, propagating along the cylindrical conduit, from fractures. Pressure changes carried by the tube wave can couple to resonant oscillations of the fractures, and the spectral properties of these oscillations carry information about fracture geometry.\nThe fracture is coupled to the conduit at the fracture mouth by balancing pressure and conserving mass as fluid flows into or out of the fracture. In our linearized theory, the fracture response is quantified through a frequency–domain transfer function relating fluid pressure and velocity at the fracture mouth. For a given transfer function, tube wave seismograms can be obtained using a single, inverse fast Fourier transform. Fracture transfer functions are obtained from numerical simulations of wave propagation along fluid-filled cracks. These simulations rigorously couple an approximate version of the linearized Navier-Stokes equation for a viscous, compressible fluid to the elastic wave equation in the surrounding medium. To solve this problem, we have developed a two-dimensional high-order finite difference method capable of handling complex fracture geometries. Fracture resonance is associated with standing crack waves (also known as Krauklis waves) propagating along the fracture. We find that although details of fracture properties can be revealed by recorded pressure or seismic signals, reductions in aperture, as occur at crack tips, can reduce the amplitude of high frequency resonant modes through increased viscous dissipation.",

C., and the 18-meter antenna at Westford, Massachusetts, have been upgraded with improvements to the digital back ends and adoption of the Mark6 recorder. These changes are primarily of operational benefit, but they provide significant addition to station diagnostics as well as reduction in complexity. The Mark6 allows recording of all four bands of VGOS data on one recorder at rates up to 16 gigabits per second. The new firmware in the digital back end (designated RDBE-G/3.0), of which four are required per station, provides for time-keeping at the few nanosecond level and extraction of the phase calibration signal for system verification. Several observing sessions have demonstrated achievement of the expected delay precision of a few picoseconds and baseline repeatability of a few millimeters. A delay measurement system for the reference frequency cable to the phase calibrator generator, which is the final new component needed for millimeter accuracy, is being tested. Monthly observations with the two antennas are planned to begin in the autumn 2014. Other VGOS systems will be added to the observations as they become operational.",

            "abstract": "We examine albedo perturbation and associated radiative forcing after a high-severity fire in a mature forest in the Oregon Cascade Range. Correlations between post-fire albedo and seedling, sapling, and standing dead tree (snag) density were investigated across fire severity classes and seasons for years 4-15 after fire. Albedo perturbation was 14 times larger in winter compared to summer and increased with fire severity class for the first several years after fire. Summer and winter albedo perturbation increased approximately linearly over the study period. Albedo correlations were strongest with snags, and significant in all fire classes in both summer and winter. The resulting annual radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere decreased (became more negative) linearly for the first 15 years after fire. These results suggest that snags, more than recovering vegetation, can control the shortwave energy balance of the burned land surface. As such, the dynamics of snag attrition may need to be included in coupled land-atmosphere models to properly represent the climate impacts of wildfire.",

In this paper, we set up a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model to analyze the transferring routes of TSPM emissions between regions through trades. TSPM emission from particulate source regions and sectors are identified by analyzing the embodied TSPM flows through monetary flow and carbon footprint. The track of TSPM from origin to end via consumption activities are also revealed by tracing the product supply chain associated with the TSPM emissions. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) as the most industrialized area of China is selected for a case study. The result shows that over 70% of TSPM emissions associated with goods consumed in Beijing and Tianjin occurred outside of their own administrative boundaries, implying that Beijing and Tianjin are net embodied TSPM importers. Meanwhile, 63% of the total TSPM emissions in Hebei Province are resulted from the outside demand, indicating Hebei is a net exporter. In addition, nearly half of TSPM emissions are the by-products related to electricity and heating supply and non-metal mineral products in Jing-Jin-Ji Area. Based on the model results, we provided new insights into establishing systemic strategies and identifying mitigation priorities to stem TSPM emissions in China.\nKeywords: total suspended particulate matter (TSPM); urban ecosystem modeling; multi-regional input-output (MRIO); China",

Although cropland burning contributes only a minor fraction to the United States particulate matter and black carbon emissions, it can have substantial impacts on local and regional air quality and visibility. During the 2013 burning season in the Pacific Northwest United States emissions were measured from a series of burns carried out on cropland. Kentucky bluegrass residues (Poa pratensis), winter wheat stubble (Triticum aestivum), and chemically fallowed winter wheat stubble were burned in field. Particulate matter, light absorption and scattering, and black carbon concentrations were measured at ground level downwind of the field. Although particulate emissions varied substantially by fuel type and even among fields of the same fuel with different treatments (i.e., light versus heavy residues) the black carbon fraction of particulate matter was consistently less than 5% and accordingly single scattering albedos were above 0.9. The emissions exhibited strong spectral variation, with absorption angstrom exponents in the range of 3 – 5 in the wavelength range of 405 to 532 nm. Laboratory burns with residues collected from the fields produced emissions that were considerably more absorbing with single scattering albedos near 0.65 and lower absorption angstrom exponents of 1 – 2.",

            "abstract": "The nitrogen isotopic composition of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) has been measured from several NOx emissions sources in prior studies. These measurements have utilized a variety of methods for collecting the NOx as nitrate or nitrite for isotopic analysis, but none of these methods have been verified for complete conversion of NOx. Less than 100% conversion can result in isotopic fractionations. We present a method for accurately measuring the nitrogen isotopic composition of NOx using a .25 M KMnO4 and 0.5 M NaOH solution. Based on laboratory tests, this technique has been found to collect all NOx passed through under a variety of conditions (e.g., air flow rate, NOx concentration, temperature, humidity), allowing for diagnosis of δ15N-NOx without correction for fractionation. The precision across the entire analytic technique is 1.5‰. This active collection method is advantageous for collecting NOx over short time scales in environments with highly variable NOx sources and concentrations. The major drawback of the NaOH/KMnO4 method is a significant nitrate background found in the KMnO4, but this background is consistent and can be easily accounted for. We aim to use this method to provide more robust constraints on the isotopic signatures of NOx emissions from different sources.\nInitial results will be presented from lab- and field-based collections of NOx emissions. Emissions from a diesel engine were measured in a laboratory smog chamber and yielded δ15N values with a mean of -18.0‰ (n = 5, 1σ = 0.97‰). Measurements of δ15N-NOx were also made on a rooftop between two highways in Providence, RI. The values ranged from -7.7 to -0.63‰ for different time periods sampled, with excellent reproducibility in side-by-side collections. Additionally, the NaOH/KMnO4 was deployed in a laboratory study of biomass burning (FLAME4) to analyze the nitrogen isotopic composition of NOx produced from the burning of variety of materials (e.g. trees, agricultural products, grasses). The δ15N of NOx ranged from -7 to +12‰, with a very strong relationship between the δ15N of the starting biomass and the δ15N of NOx produced. Finally, a comparison of the active KMnO4/NaOH method with passive diffusion NO2 and NOx collectors (Ogawa brand), conducted both in ambient urban air and in a diesel smog chamber, will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that ice nucleation by desert soil dusts composed largely of minerals plays an important role in forming ice crystals in mixed-phase clouds and subsequent precipitation. More recently, several studies have suggested that soil dusts having higher contents of soil organic matter (SOM) may also contribute significantly to atmospheric ice nucleation. In this study, we examine the ice nucleation properties of soil dusts derived from different locations in the world. Our results show that the ice nucleating ability of agricultural soil dusts derived from the largest dust source regions in North America is almost comparable to that of desert soil dusts at temperatures colder than about −15°C. We also confirm that the agricultural soil dusts can serve as effective ice nuclei (IN) at much warmer temperatures. On the other hand, our results indicate that the ice nucleating ability of the agricultural soil dusts is significantly reduced after H2O2 digestion, while the reduction is not significant for the desert soil dusts. In this regard, based on single particle analysis, we demonstrate that such a significant reduction observed in the agricultural soil dusts is mainly attributable to the removal of organic-rich particles (namely, SOM particles), which have much higher ice nucleating ability than mineral particles. Moreover, we discuss the potential contributions of these soil dusts to atmospheric IN populations.",

            "abstract": "Igneous processes involve multiphase magmas that contain crystals (suspensions) and sometimes exsolved volatile bubbles (emulsions). The difference in density between phases has deep implications for magma transport and differentiation. The ascent rate of magmas, and the rate of phase separation is also controlled by the rheology of the multiphase mixture. The rheology of suspensions and emulsions depends strongly on the bubble (or crystal) volume fraction and deformation, dilation and contraction due shearing, and mode alteration in crystal size distribution due breakage. Several experimental studies have been focusing on the rheology of magmatic systems, and they have constrained the impact of all mentioned factors. However, experimentally-based models remain difficult to use because they involve a significant number of free parameters (fitting procedure) that cannot be easily linked to the underlying dynamics in the suspension/emulsion. For example, these fitting parameters show a wide variability when fitted to different datasets. At this stage, we are lacking a unified theory that relates the dependence of the effective viscosity of multiphase magmas on particle volume fraction, strain-rate conditions and finally particle size distribution.\nTo this end, we study the rheology of crystal-bearing magma from a theoretical perspective, and aim to develop a self-consistent physical model to explain and predict quantitatively the rheology of emulsion and suspension. When compared to published experimental studies, our model can predict the rheology of magmatic systems over a wide range of particle volume fraction. It is based on a stepwise addition of particles and includes a minimal amount of free parameters to constrain the effect of volume fraction, shear rate and breakage of crystals (change in modality). Furthermore, the parameters in our model are related to either geometric or dynamic processes and can easily be constrained independently. The model accounts for both mono-disperse and bi-disperse suspensions/emulsions, and includes the effect of self and mutual crowding. We find an excellent agreement with experimental data while the model requires only constraints on the particle size distribution and particle volume fraction.",

The local time dependence of REP events is consistent with SAMPEX observations and previous balloon missions [ Comess et al., 2013, Foat et al., 1996, Millan et al., 2002, Clilverd et al., 2007]. This study collectively investigates the MLT correlation to the observed x-ray energy spectrum from previous balloon observations of REP events and those observed by the BARREL campaign. A series of relativistic electron precipitation events observed by the BARREL balloons on Jan. 17, 2013 shows a connection between these events and plasmapause boundary crossings. Therefore, this study is extended to consider the relationship between the observed REP x-ray energy spectrum and the plasmapause. Understanding the duskside dependence and relative location to plasmaspheric boundaries of these events may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism causing the observed precipitation.",

            "abstract": "This study investigated trend and interannual variability of summer (June, July and August) precipitation and the atmospheric water vapor convergence in the Arctic circumpolar region, with an emphasis on recent increase of those around the Lena river basin in eastern Siberia. Data used in this study are an archived precipitation data (PREC/L) and atmospheric re-analysis data (JRA-25, JRA-55). Previous studies have revealed a negative correlation in the summer atmospheric circulation pattern between the Lena and Ob river basins. However little is known about the atmospheric water cycles in the Arctic circumpolar region, including the Mackenzie river basin. Hence we compared the trend and interannual variability of summer precipitation and the atmospheric water vapor convergence in three large North Eurasian river (Lena, Yenisei, and Ob) basins together with the Mackenzie basin. The analyzed results are as follows.\n1) In the highest five-year summer precipitation in the Lena river basin during the period 1958 to 2012, the center of the cyclonic circulation shifted to the east, from the Kara and Barents Seas over the region across the Yenisei and Lena. In the years, significant cyclonic deviation was present. The deviation distribution of the height field and the atmospheric water vapor flux from the west to the Lena river basin were significantly increased, so as to form a positive deviation of summer precipitation.\n2) Significant increases (positive trend) in the summer precipitation were detected from 1984 to 2011 in the Lena, Yenisei, and the Mackenzie river basins. However, summer precipitation showed significant decreases (negative trend) over Mongolia and Europe/Russia. This was because anticyclones dominated in these regions.\n3) A significant enhancement of cyclonic circulation was detected from 2005 to 2008 on the Eurasian side of the Arctic Ocean. However, anticyclones appeared over Mongolia. These probably increased the atmospheric water vapor convergence over the Lena river basin in this period.\n4) A significant positive correlation in the summer precipitation appeared from around 1995 to 2005 between the Lena and Yenisei river basins. On the contrary, the negative correlation between the Lena and Ob river basins became unclear from 1993.",

Carbon dioxide in conjunction with other gas-phase and aerosol tracers can be used to differentiate these sources. Isoprene emissions were heavily dependent on vegetation type and temperature, with largest emissions over deciduous forests in Southeastern Missouri. Carbon dioxide uptake, however, was less dependent on vegetation type and more dependent on time of year with largest uptake in August. Emissions of other volatile organic compounds will be analyzed based on land use classification and meteorological conditions. For periods with strong biomass burning influence, variations in emissions are studied with respect to source fuel (from land use imagery) and combustion efficiency (from in situ CO and CO2 measurements). Agricultural fires (in the Mississippi River Valley) were found to have lower combustion efficiencies than wildfires indicating smoldering conditions. This resulted in higher particulate emissions & lower single scattering albedos.",

            "abstract": "Risk-based analysis has been developed for optimal levee design for economic efficiency. Along many rivers, two levees on opposite riverbanks act as a simple levee system. Being rational and self-interested, land owners on each river bank would tend to independently optimize their levees with risk-based analysis, resulting in a Pareto-inefficient levee system design from the social planner’s perspective. Game theory is applied in this study to analyze decision making process in a simple levee system in which the land owners on each river bank develop their design strategies using risk-based economic optimization. For each land owner, the annual expected total cost includes expected annual damage cost and annualized construction cost. The non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is identified and compared to the social planner’s optimal distribution of flood risk and damage cost throughout the system which results in the minimum total flood cost for the system. The social planner’s optimal solution is not feasible without appropriate level of compensation for the transferred flood risk to guarantee and improve conditions for all parties. Therefore, cooperative game theory is then employed to develop an economically optimal design that can be implemented in practice. By examining the game in the reversible and irreversible decision making modes, the cost of decision making myopia is calculated to underline the significance of considering the externalities and evolution path of dynamic water resource problems for optimal decision making.",

            "abstract": "The seismogenic character of the Northern Mariana Thrust Zone is unknown because of the absence of large historical megathrust earthquakes and the lack of appropriate geodetic data. Subduction seismicity in the Northern Mariana forearc shows clustering of events along strike and with depth. To further investigate the seismogenic characteristics of the region, we search for repeating earthquakes along the shallow thrust zone. Using the 2003-2004 Subduction Factory and 2012-2013 Mariana Trench Imaging Experiments, a cross correlation detection scanner is implemented to find repeating earthquakes. Template earthquakes are chosen from seismicity located within clusters along the shallow thrust zone and compared with continuous data from nearby ocean bottom seismometers using both conventional and subspace correlation detection methods. Preliminary results from scanning the 2003-2004 deployment have identified several families of repeating events. Many of these groups consist of repeating events that occur within a short time frame of the template event. In particular, several families have been detected in conjunction with the July 15, 2003 magnitude 5.1 earthquake, indicating detection of aftershock sequences. Repeating events that occur throughout the 2003-2004 yearlong deployment have also been detected, suggesting stable sliding of the plate with small asperities causing these repeating events. Further work may allow delineation of stable sliding regions as well as evaluation of the possible effects of several seamounts which are subducting within the study region.",

            "abstract": "Chronically elevated atmospheric nitrate deposition has increased nitrate export from forests worldwide. This problem is particularly evident in the eastern U.S., where elevated stream nitrate concentrations and export from forested watersheds has led to the suggestion that some forests may be at or nearing a state of nitrogen saturation. To investigate the utility of nitrate stable isotopes in assessing the nitrogen saturation status of forests, we measured monthly δ15N, δ18O, Δ17O, and concentrations of nitrate in precipitation and stream water from reference watersheds at Coweeta (North Carolina), Fernow (West Virginia), and Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire) Experimental Forests from August 2012 to July 2013. Long-term mean nitrate deposition ranges from 11 kg ha-1 yr-1 to 17 kg ha-1 yr-1 and is significantly different (p<0.05) among the sites. Nitrate concentrations and isotopic compositions of precipitation did not differ significantly among the sites during the study. Seasonal trends in δ18O and Δ17O of nitrate values were also similar among sites, and were indicative of seasonal variation in dominant NOx oxidation pathway. The study sites differed significantly with respect to stream nitrate concentration (p<0.05) and isotopic composition (p<0.05). The high deposition site (Fernow) had the highest mean stream water nitrate concentration during the study period but the lowest percentages of atmospheric nitrate in monthly samples and on an annual average basis. In contrast, the low deposition site (Coweeta) had the lowest mean stream nitrate concentrations during the study and the highest mean percentage of atmospheric nitrate in the stream. Unprocessed atmospheric nitrate was also present in Coweeta stream samples during every month that isotope analyses were conducted for this site. Among these watersheds, stream nitrate concentration was negatively related to the proportion of unprocessed atmospheric nitrate in streams (R2=0.23; p<0.05). We will explore potential explanations for the trends and differences in stream nitrate concentrations and isotopes, and present a conceptual model of ecosystem nitrogen saturation based on our observations within these watersheds.",

With the population and industry in northwestern China growing rapidly, anthropogenic pollution also impacts the aerosol composition and therefore optical properties and radiative effects. For instance, NOx emissions from Gansu province increased from ~195 Gg/yr in 2000 to ~323 Gg/yr in 2006 due to the fast growth of transportation vehicles, while SO2 emissions dropped from ~439 Gg/yr to ~338 Gg/yr because flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) devices are widely used in coal-fired powerplants. The WRF-Chem model with CBMZ chemistry mechanism, MOSAIC 8-bins aerosol module and GOCART dust emission algorithm, is applied to simulate the processes responsible for temporal changes in the aerosol distribution, aerosol optical properties and size distribution in Northwestern China due to the impact of dust and anthropogenic emissions during spring 2008, a time period during which an intensive field campaign was conducted at the Zhangye National Climate Observatory (39.082°N, 100.276°E, 1460 m above sea level) of the China Meteorological Administration. This field campaign provided observations of meteorological fields, radiative fluxes, trace gases concentrations, aerosol optical properties, and aerosol size distributions to evaluate the model simulation. The observational data showed a pronounced diurnal variation of trace gases and aerosols: low in the afternoon and high in the morning. Elevated pollutant levels were observed in several dust storms during this campaign. We will investigate the atmospheric processes that are responsible for the atmospheric composition, and assess the relative impact of dust and anthropogenic emissions on local air quality.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, LSMs for use in Earth system models (ESMs) only account for one-dimensional (1-D) vertical hydrological processes at very coarse resolutions (~100 km). Recently, there has been interest in simulating lateral exchange of surface and subsurface water, as the grid resolution of ESMs increases (currently towards ~20 km) due to advances in computational power.\nIn the current work, we present a new physically-based hydrological model capable of simulating lateral flow at a hyperresolution (1 km pixels) coupled with the vertical soil column of the Community Land Model (CLM), which has a much coarser resolution. Our new approach also uses sub-pixel topographic information to represent small scale lateral-flow processes. As input to our model, we use 1 km data of required surface and subsurface information, such depth to bedrock, hillslope width functions, fractional coverage of hillslopes/wetlands/riparian zones within each 1 km pixel, and a river network. Such data are largely derived from higher-resolution (30 m) topographic data, and will be made available to the community as global products.\nWe have tested our model against measurements over a well instrumented, artificial hillslope at the University of Arizona’s Biosphere 2 and found that both our approach and a full 3-D physically-based hydrological model can realistically simulate hydrological states and fluxes. However, computationally, our approach is 2 – 3 orders of magnitude faster than the latter. We are currently testing it for an ESM grid box that covers much of southeastern New York State, which includes the headwaters of the Delaware River, the Susquehana River, and parts of the Mohawk River Basin. Our approach improves upon the 1-D hydrological representation in CLM by representing the subgrid topographic and geomorphological variability in the grid box. The impact of representing such subgrid variability on surface water and energy fluxes will be discussed in our presentation.",

            "abstract": "In the boreal forest of Alaska, increased fire severity associated with climate change is altering plant-soil-microbial feedbacks and ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics. The boreal landscape has historically been dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana), a tree species associated with slow C turnover and large soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation. Historically, low severity fires have led to black spruce regeneration post-fire, thereby maintaining slow C cycling rates and large SOM pools. In recent decades however, an increase in high severity fires has led to greater consumption of the soil organic layer (SOL) during fire and subsequent establishment of deciduous tree species in areas previously dominated by black spruce. This shift to a more deciduous dominated landscape has many implications for ecosystem structure and function, as well as feedbacks to global C cycling. To improve our understanding of how boreal tree species affect C cycling, we quantified above- and belowground C stocks and fluxes in adjacent, mid-successional stands of black spruce and Alaska paper birch (Betula neoalaskana) that established following a 1958 fire near Fairbanks, Alaska. Although total ecosystem C pools (aboveground live tree biomass + dead wood + SOL + top 10 cm of mineral soil) were similar for the two stand types, the distribution of C among pools was markedly different. In black spruce, 78% of measured C was found in soil pools, primarily in the SOL, where spruce contained twice the C stored in paper birch (4.8 ± 0.3 vs. 2.4 ± 0.1 kg C m-2). In contrast, aboveground biomass dominated ecosystem C pools in birch forest (6.0 ± 0.3 vs. 2.5 ± 0.2 kg C m-2 in birch and spruce, respectively). Our findings suggest that tree species exert a strong influence over plant-soil-microbial feedbacks and may have long-term effects on ecosystem C sequestration and storage that feedback to the climate system.",

            "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that chorus whistler mode waves are fundamentally important in the acceleration of the relativistic particles within the outer radiation belt and are equally important factor in the loss mechanism of the same particles. To properly model the radiation belts and these wave particle interactions it is necessary to define the distributions of the wave amplitudes and power. Some theories suggest the wave particle interaction processes are impulsive and therefore influenced more by the largest of wave field strengths, where as others indicate a more stochastic effect and are dictated by consistent wave power. Likely both variations are in effect, and therefore understanding the distributions and occurrences of both the largest amplitudes and wave power distributions are important. Utilizing 2 years of Van Allen Probes Magnetic and Electric field measurements from the EMFISIS instrument we investigate the occurrence statistics of the peak field strengths in the chorus waves and the average wave mode power.",

            "abstract": "Spatial and temporal variations in the large-scale distribution of tropospheric CO2 provide valuable constraints on regional to hemispheric-scale carbon exchange between the atmosphere and land and ocean reservoirs. These constraints have been widely exploited in top-down inverse analyses that combine atmospheric measurements of CO2, prior information on component CO2 fluxes, and representations of atmospheric transport. The inversion procedure typically estimates surface carbon fluxes by minimizing the differences between measured and modeled atmospheric CO2 concentrations.\nHere we report on regional to hemispheric-scale inter-annual CO2 flux estimates for the period 1990-2012, derived from a hierarchy of top-down methods, ranging in complexity from a simple two-box hemispheric analysis, with mixing rates constrained by SF6 data, to Bayesian synthesis inversions developed using the GEOS-Chem atmospheric transport model. A primary aim of this inter-comparison is to investigate the impact on CO2 flux estimates, of recently derived prior ocean fluxes developed using pCO2 measurements from the SOCAT database (http://www.socat.info/). Sensitivity of flux estimates to assumptions on atmospheric transport, and in particular, inter-hemispheric mixing, will also be discussed.",

It particular, backazimuthal variations in P-to-SH converted phases can be used to infer the orientation of anisotropic symmetry axes at depth. Many prior studies have used a trial-and-error approach to forward modeling of receiver functions, making it impossible to explore model space in a systematic and quantitative manner. Here we present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for forward modeling of receiver functions. Synthetic examples with complex Earth structure are used to test the viability of the algorithm.\nWe use this methodology to investigate the anisotropic character of the seemingly pervasive mid-lithospheric discontinuities (MLDs) beneath the central United States. Previous receiver function results have revealed multiple mid-lithospheric discontinuities that correspond to sharp gradient in anisotropy, with a N- to NW- orientation of anisotropy in the upper mantle lithosphere. To place more quantitative constraints on Earth structure, as well as to bolster previous results, we apply the MCMC method to actual receiver function data from station WCI in the central United States. Ultimately, model space searches such as the MCMC algorithm presented here provide a framework for forward modeling of receiver functions to obtain estimates on Earth structure, and the orientation of anisotropy at depth, in a systematic and quantitative manner.",

            "abstract": "The impact of increased resolution on extratropical transition of tropical cyclones is analyzed using the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) with the variable-resolution Spectral Element (SE) dynamical core. Over the North Atlantic tropics, a high-resolution 28 km grid spacing allows the model to sufficiently resolve the structure of tropical cyclones, including sharp gradients in the eye wall. As the tropical cyclone travels beyond the high-resolution nest, the grid spacing transitions to 110 km. This approach is computationally efficient, while the resolution is high enough for the study of the extratropical transition of cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean.\nWe compare 23-year simulations with prescribed sea surface temperatures and sea ice according to the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocol using both the variable-resolution 28-110 km grid and a uniform-mesh 110 km simulation. In particular, we evaluate the climatology of extratropical transition throughout the simulations and compare to reanalysis data. Phase space analysis follows the structural evolution of storms as they transition from symmetric, warm-core tropical cyclones to asymmetric, cold-core extratropical storms. The precipitation rate and the distribution about the storm change throughout the storms’ lifecycles. An individual analysis of selected storms demonstrates the development of cyclone asymmetries, a cold-core structure, and precipitation extremes as the storm undergoes extratropical transition.",

The 2014 Oso mudslide was an extreme event costing nearly 40 deaths and damaging civilian properties. Landslides are often unpredictable, but in many cases, catastrophic events are repetitive. Historic record in the Oso mudslide site indicates that there have been serial events in decades, though the extent of sliding events varied from time to time. In our study, the combination of multi-source DEMs, InSAR, and time-series InSAR analysis has enabled to characterize the Oso mudslide. InSAR results from ALOS PALSAR show that there was no significant deformation between mid-2006 and 2011. The combination of time-series InSAR analysis and old-dated DEM indicated revealed topographic changes associated the 2006 sliding event, which is confirmed by the difference of multiple LiDAR DEMs. Precipitation and discharge measurements before the 2006 and 2014 landslide events did not exhibit extremely anomalous records, suggesting the precipitation is not the controlling factor in determining the sliding events at Oso. The lack of surface deformation during 2006-2011 and weak correlation between the precipitation and the sliding event, suggest other factors (such as porosity) might play a critical role on the run-away events at this Oso and other similar landslides.",

The relationship between the land composition and LST has been widely studied. Such researches generally employ medium or coarser spatial resolution remotely sensed data and primarily focuses on the effects of one land cover type on the LST. In this study, we explore the effects of land system architecture - composition and configuration of different land-cover classes - on LST in the central Arizona-Phoenix metropolitan area at a fine-scale resolution, focused on the composition and configuration of single family residential parcels. A 1 m resolution land-cover map is used to calculate landscape metrics at the parcel level, and 6.8 m resolution data from the MODIS/ASTER are employed to retrieve LST. We introduce the socio-economic factors at neighborhood level as explanatory variables to help control for potential neighborhood effects. Multiple linear regression models examine the effects of landscape configuration on LST at the parcel scale, controlling for the effects of landscape composition and neighborhood characteristics. Results show that the configuration of parcels affects LST, revealing significant variable relationships between that architecture and LST at nighttime and daytime, and the role of the neighborhood effects on the outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Generation of friction heat associated with fault slip is controlled by friction, slip distance and fault thickness. Nature of fault slip can be estimated from the record of frictional heating along a fault (e.g., Fulton et al., 2012). Purpose of this study is to detect the record of frictional heating along a microfault observed in on-land accretionary complex, Shimanto Belt, SW Japan using vitrinite reflectance (Ro) and to examine the characteristics of fault slip in deeper subduction zone.\nThe study area is located in Nonokawa formation, the Cretaceous Shimanto Belt, in Kochi Prefecture, Southwest Japan. We found a carbonaceous material concentrated layer (CMCL) in the formation. Some micro-faults cut the layer. The thickness of CMCL is about 3-4m. Ro of host rock is about 0.98-1.1% and of fault rock is over 1.2%.\nKitamura et al. (2012) pointed out that fracturing energy may control the high Ro within fault zone. To avoid the effect of fracturing on Ro, we tired to detect a diffusion pattern of frictional heating in host rocks. Distribution of Ro is mapped in thin sections to make the Ro-distance pattern perpendicular to the fault plane. Within the fracture zone, abnormally high Ro (about 2.0% or above) was observed. Ro was 1.25% at the wall of fracture zone and decreases to 1.1% at about 5cm from the wall. We interpreted that the Ro-distance pattern was resulted from the thermal diffusion.\nUsing this diffusion pattern, the characteristic fault parameters, such as friction, slip rate and rise time (Tr) was examined. We set parameters Q (= friction times slip rate). We have simulated frictional heating and Ro maturation on the basis of the method by Sweeny and Burnham (1990). Grid search was conducted to find the best fitted combination of Q and Tr at the smallest residual between simulated Ro and observed Ro. In the result, we estimated about 1500 (Pa m/s) of Q and about 130000(s) of Tr.\nBecause the base temperature is about 185˚C based on the 1.1% of Ro, the depth of fault activity can be corresponded to about 6 km. The effective pressure is estimated about 94MPa. If we put friction coefficient as 0.4-0.6, the friction is about 37.6-56.5MPa. Therefore, slip rate is calculated to be about 27-40µm/s. This very slow slip rate is consistent with that for very low frequency earthquake (VLFe) reported by Sugioka et al. (2012).",

            "abstract": "Climatic variability influence vegetation condition and growth, which are often characterized by satellite derived vegetation indices (VIs) such as normalized difference vegetation Index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation Index (EVI) and land surface water index (LSWI). A fourteen-year (2000 – 2013) of NDVI, EVI and LSWI data from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were analyzed for assessing grassland vegetation dynamics to climatic variability ( i.e., drought) and soil moisture over the time series at the Marena site, Stillwater Oklahoma,USA. This is also the Marena, Oklahoma In-situ Sensor Testbed (MOISST) site in support of NASA SMAP mission. Change in magnitudes of VIs provided the dynamics of inter-annual variability of the grassland vegetation. The magnitude of VIs declined in dry years (2006 and 2012) .Variation in NDVI and EVI over years resulting from climatic variability was strongly correlated to cumulative seasonal rainfall (NDVI, r = 0.82, EVI, r = 0.77) and average seasonal soil volumetric water content up to 60 cm depth. The EVI declined more than did NDVI during the dry events of 2006 and 2012, indicating that the use of EVI in place of NDVI appears to increase the performance of ecosystem models under drought condition. Furthermore, LSWI was the most sensitive index to drought among the three VIs tested. The LSWI values were negative (LSWI < 0) even within the middle of plant growing season in dry years, showing its potential to track the hydrological status of the ecosystem. Duration of LSWI < 0 in summer was greater in dry years (2006= 53 & 2012= 34 days) compared to wet years (2007 & 2013= 0 days). The result also revealed that LSWI values quantitatively corresponded well with the drought severity categories identified by the United States Drought Monitoring (USDM). In conclusion, the number of days with LSWI < 0 during the plant growing season and LSWI-based drought severity classification scheme can provide useful information for an assessment of the drought impacts over grasslands.",

Recent version of the Photon path-length Probability Density Function (PPDF)-based algorithm was used to estimate XCO2 and optical path modifications in terms of PPDF parameters. We also present results of numerical simulations for over-land observations and “sharp edge” tests for sun-glint mode to discuss the algorithm accuracy under conditions of strong optical path modification.\nFor the methane abundance retrieved from 1.67-µm-absorption band we applied optical path correction based on PPDF parameters from 1.6-µm carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption band. Similarly to CO2-proxy technique, this correction assumes identical light path modifications in 1.67-µm and 1.6-µm bands. However, proxy approach needs pre-defined XCO2 values to compute XCH4, whilst the PPDF-based approach does not use prior assumptions on CO2 concentrations.\nPost-processing data correction for XCO2 and XCH4 over land observations was performed using regression matrix based on multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The MANOVA statistics was applied to the GOSAT retrievals using reference collocated measurements of Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). The regression matrix was constructed using the parameters that were found to correlate with GOSAT-TCCON discrepancies: PPDF parameters α and ρ, that are mainly responsible for shortening and lengthening of the optical path due to atmospheric light scattering; solar and satellite zenith angles; surface pressure; surface albedo in three GOSAT short wave infrared (SWIR) bands. Application of the post-correction generally improves statistical characteristics of the GOSAT-TCCON correlation diagrams for individual stations as well as for aggregated data.\nIn addition to the analysis of the observations over 12 TCCON stations we estimated temporal and spatial trends (interannual XCO2 and XCH4 variations, seasonal cycles, latitudinal gradients) and compared them with modeled results as well as with similar estimates from other GOSAT retrievals.",

            "abstract": "Although dominated by erosion over long term, the tectonically active mountains of Taiwan commonly contain thick landslide and debris-flow gravels capping hillslopes or forming alluvial terraces. These deposits and their associated landforms serve to study ancient mass-wasting histories and their controls on fluvial processes. This study focuses on the Lao-nong River draining the 1000–3000 m high mountain areas in southwestern Taiwan (current tectonic uplift: 10–20 mm/yr). The Lao-nong River exhibits numerous terraces, many of which are of tributary-fan origins and consist of fluvial/debris-flow gravels 20–200 m thick. The development of such alluvial terraces can be observed during 2009 Typhoon Morakot, which brought record-setting 2000 mm of rain. Triggered by this heavy rain, almost all the tributaries of the Lao-nong generated alluvial fans at their mouths and consequently caused up-to-30 m aggradation along the trunk river.\nThe Lao-nong has yielded >100 radiocarbon dates (all <20 ka).These data reveal that the formation of the observed alluvial terraces (from deposition of thick gravels to subsequent incision) could proceed very rapidly (<1 ky), and that the trunk river has been characterized by repeated aggradation and incision. This fact highlights the significance of event-driven sediment supply in governing the river behavior, which has strongly obscured the effect of the concurrent tectonic uplift. Among the terraces consisting of thick gravels, the six with 100–200 m-thick gravels are dated~18ka, ~12ka (for two terraces), ~5.5ka, ~3.4ka, and ~1.4 ka. The seven terraces with 50–100 m-thick gravels are dated ~12ka, ~8.3ka, ~5.7ka, ~1.3ka and 0.2–1.6ka (two undated). These dates (and others) suggest the clusters of mass-wasting events around ~12ka, 5.5–5.7 ka, and <1.6 ka. However, note that most of the recorded mass-wasting events vary in time and magnitude among tributary catchments, which implies the controls of internal factors on the timing, magnitude, and frequency of the events. Our field observation suggests that at least some of the large Holocene tributary-fan terraces were sourced from pre-Holocene colluviums.",

By 2022, NGS intends that all orthometric heights in the USA will be determined in the field by using a reliable national gravimetric geoid model to transform from geodetic heights obtained from GPS. Several airborne campaigns have already been flown over Alaska and its coastline. Some of this Alaskan coastal data have been incorporated into a new NGS experimental geoid model - xGEOID14. The xGEOID14 model is the first in a series of annual experimental geoid models that will incorporate NGS GRAV-D airborne data. This series provides a useful benchmark for assessing and improving current techniques by which the airborne and land-survey data are filtered and cleaned, and then combined with satellite gravity models, elevation data (etc.) with the ultimate aim of computing a geoid model that can support a national physical height system by 2022.\nHere we will examine the NGS GRAV-D airborne data in Alaska, and assess its contribution to xGEOID14. Future prospects for xGEOID15 will also be considered.",

            "abstract": "Today’s climate datasets are featured with large volume, high degree of spatiotemporal complexity and evolving fast overtime. As visualizing large volume distributed climate datasets is computationally intensive, traditional desktop based visualization applications fail to handle the computational intensity. Recently, scientists have developed remote visualization techniques to address the computational issue. Remote visualization techniques usually leverage server-side parallel computing capabilities to perform visualization tasks and deliver visualization results to clients through network. In this research, we aim to build a remote parallel visualization platform for visualizing and analyzing massive climate data. Our visualization platform was built based on Paraview, which is one of the most popular open source remote visualization and analysis applications. To further enhance the scalability and stability of the platform, we have employed cloud computing techniques to support the deployment of the platform. In this platform, all climate datasets are regular grid data which are stored in NetCDF format. Three types of data access methods are supported in the platform: accessing remote datasets provided by OpenDAP servers, accessing datasets hosted on the web visualization server and accessing local datasets. Despite different data access methods, all visualization tasks are completed at the server side to reduce the workload of clients. As a proof of concept, we have implemented a set of scientific visualization methods to show the feasibility of the platform. Preliminary results indicate that the framework can address the computation limitation of desktop based visualization applications.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost soil stores twice the amount of carbon found in current atmosphere, leading to increasing concern about climate feedbacks due to thawing of organic carbon stored in arctic permafrost. Current climate models assume that CO2 outgassing occurs only at the site of thawing, overlooking the flushing of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from soils into surface waters, downstream transport, and the associated opportunities for photochemical transformations. To better understand the mechanisms producing CO2 and the effect of water flow on riverine photo-mineralization of DOC, we developed a stochastic particle-tracking model that characterizes the migration of DOC in arctic rivers and the concurrent photo-mineralization during downstream transport. We calibrated the model against field tracer measurements, and then applied the model to analyze the effects of river geometry and flow on rates of photo-mineralization of DOC to CO2 in the Kuparuk River, Alaska. We found that rates of photo-mineralization were dependent on vertical mixing in the water column and average residence times. When flow paths are restricted to areas near and beneath the river bed, where both flow velocity and light availability are low, the overall photo-mineralization of DOC is reduced. Using this model will improve our understanding of the interactions between hydrological and photochemical controls on CO2 production in surface waters, and provide tools that can be used more generally to assess redistribution and transformation of carbon in arctic and global climate models.",

            "abstract": "We report on the stress and strength at hypocenters at Tau Tona and Mponeng gold mines, South Africa. In the previous published reports on 3D stress tensor measurements, the ranges of depth and maximum principal stress (Sigma 1) were limited down to 2.7 km and less than 90 MPa, respectively (gray range in the attached figure; e.g. Stacey and Wesseloo 1998 SIMRAC, Handley 2013 J SAIMM). That has been because no cost-effective methods have been available suitable for routine measurements of local 3-dimeensional stress at sites where borehole breakout or core discing prevails and only small pneumatic machines for AX or BX drilling are available. Ogasawara et al. (2012 J SAIMM, 2014 ARMA) enabled in-situ measurements of local 3D stress beyond the limit, who have used a downsized Compact Conical-ended Borehole Overcoring technique (CCBO; Sugawara and Obara, 1999; ISRM suggested) in 60mm diameter holes. 3.4 km and 146 MPa were the largest depth and maximum principal stress that they succeeded in-situ stress measurements, respectively. The assumption of far-field stress vertical-gradient (Lucier et al. 2009 or Reches et al. this meeting 2014) was then well calibrated by the increased number of in-situ measurements. Hofmann et al. (RS2013) constrained the range of Sigma 1 of about 100 to 180 MPa for seven mining-induced events (ML = 2.1 to 4.0) located by the in-mine seismic network and inferred based upon the geological observation. Japanese German Underground Acoustic Emission Research in South Africa (JAGUARS; Nakatani et al. 2008) at Mponeng mine offered us a rare opportunity because the AE finely delineated the aftershock plane of a ML2.1 event that ran obliquely through a dyke on December 27, 2007 (Yabe et al. 2009 and Naoi et al. 2011). Hofmann et al. (SHIRMS 2012) found that Excess Shear Stress (or Coulomb Stress) was largest on the aftershock plane and successfully constrained the strength with which they successfully reproduced the fault ride equivalent to the seismic moment observed by the in-mine seismic system just after the completion of mining in December 2007. Yabe et al. (RS2013) drilled a hole intersecting the hypocenter, analyzing borehole breakout and core discing and successfully constraining the stress. The constrained stress was qualitatively in good agreement with the stress Hofmann et al. calculated.",

            "abstract": "Lead is a trace metal that is closely related to anthropogenic activity, mainly via leaded gasoline and coal combustion. The study of lead concentrations and isotopes in seawater, sediments, corals and aerosols allows for a systematic look at its sources and their time evolution in a natural environment. We will discuss results from two projects in Western and South East Asia, regions that have seen dramatic socio-economical changes over the past half-century that may have left environmental signals. These results highlight the usefulness of the method, indicate the degree of complexity of these systems, and point to the need for a continuous monitoring of anthropogenic trace metals in the small-medium coastal scale to be able to asses the larger scale effects of human activity.\nOn the one hand, coastal Kuwait is heavily influenced by the Shat al-Arab river and shows a clear anthropogenic signature from Kuwait city. A mix of two sources can be tracked through the coral and sediment chronological records, with Pb206/Pb207 ratios (1.202 and 1.151) that approach the suspected source values (1.21 and 1.12) and eliminate the possibility of other sources. Through a wide sediment geographic distribution, the strength of the anthropogenic signature is modulated.\nOn the other hand, Singapore offers a more complex system, where an apparent mix of two sources (extreme isotope ratios 1.215 and ~1.14) occurs also, but where either an unresolved potentially important third source (isotope ratio ~1.18), or an isotope exchange process should be invoked. The sediment and coral records allows us to track the changes through time; however, there seems to be incongruence with the aerosol isotope record. Further potential sources are being explored currently and will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation in the hyper-arid Ejina Delta of northwestern China plays irreplaceable role in preventing desertification and maintaining sustainable development in inland Heihe river basin . The groundwater mainly recharged by Heihe river provides the main water source for the vegetation survival in Ejina Delta. While due to extensive water use in mid and upper stream for local economic development, the Ejina Delta had experienced long-term no flow coming in each year and result in groundwater table great decline, which further lead to severely vegetation degradation during the 1990s. Ecological water allocation therefore was implemented in several arid inland basins to prevent ecological degradation. In order to wisely allocating water for ecological use, the relationship between vegetation and groundwater needs to be well understood, that is the aim of this paper. With the GMS software package, a groundwater flow model for the Ejina oasis was established and the spatial distributions of groundwater dynamics during 2000-2011 were simulated. Combing annual average groundwater table and NDVI during growing season on a per-pixel base, it was found that vegetation grew well and had a high biomass when the groundwater was in 1.5-3.8m and vegetation showed the best when the groundwater was about 2m. Further studies conducted at some locations with long-term ground water monitoring showed that when the groundwater table depth was more than 5 and 6 m, the vegetation conditions did not show an obvious response to groundwater table fluctuations; when the groundwater fluctuated between the proper intervals mentioned above, the correlation between vegetation condition and groundwater table were remarkably spatially heterogeneous. This result indicated that future ecological water allocation should consider more spatial heterogeneity of vegetation response to water environment for efficiently using the limited water.",

Efforts such as the SEARCH Sea Ice Outlook (SIO;\nhttp://www.arcus.org/sipn/sea-ice-outlook\n) and the Sea Ice for Walrus Outlook have provided a forum for the international sea-ice prediction and observing community to explore and compare different approaches. The SIO, originally organized by the Study of Environmental Change (SEARCH), is now managed by the new Sea Ice Prediction Network (SIPN), which is building a collaborative network of scientists and stakeholders to improve arctic sea ice prediction.\nThe SIO synthesizes predictions from a variety of methods, including heuristic and from a statistical and/or dynamical model. In a recent study, SIO data from 2008 to 2013 were analyzed. The analysis revealed that in some years the predictions were very successful, in other years they were not. Years that were anomalous compared to the long-term trend have proven more difficult to predict, regardless of which method was employed.\nThis year, in response to feedback from users and contributors to the SIO, several enhancements have been made to the SIO reports. One is to encourage contributors to provide spatial probability maps of sea ice cover in September and the first day each location becomes ice-free; these are an example of subseasonal to seasonal, local-scale predictions. Another enhancement is a separate analysis of the modeling contributions. In the June 2014 SIO report, 10 of 28 outlooks were produced from models that explicitly simulate sea ice from dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice models. Half of the models included fully-coupled (atmosphere, ice, and ocean) models that additionally employ data assimilation. Both of these subsets (models and coupled models with data assimilation) have a far narrower spread in their prediction, indicating that the results of these more sophisticated methods are converging.\nHere we summarize and synthesize the 2014 contributions to the SIO, highlight the important questions and challenges that remain to be addressed, and present data on stakeholder uses of the SIO and related SIPN products.",

            "abstract": "Pliocene-Quaternary basalt-dominated volcanic rocks of the San Francisco-Morman Mountain fields (SFMM) erupted at the southern margin of the Colorado Plateau (CP) of the USA, a region of high continental elevation. The volcanic field is aerially extensive (>8,500 km2), and the youngest portion is located above the depth where the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) shoals to ~70 km. The volcanic fields also lie above and inboard of a band of low Vsthat encircles more than half of CP at <80 to 150 km depth. We obtained comprehensive new geochemical data for magnesian basalts (9-13 wt.% MgO) in order to better understand mantle melting associated with foundering of continental mantle lithosphere.\nMelting of peridotite-dominated domains rather than lithologies that might have been introduced into the mantle by Laramide-aged shallow subduction are indicated by major element and transition metal signatures. The influence of subduction may nevertheless be recorded by moderately enriched isotopic compositions (εNd = -1.5 to +4.2; εHf= +5.5 to +11.8) that diverge from the mantle array. Trace element characteristics indicate variable mixtures of small degree melts (≤1%) generated in the garnet-stability field and melts generated at spinel stability conditions ± melt-rock reaction at the latter conditions.\nThermobarometry results for clinopyroxene-bearing SFMM basalts indicate magmatic temperatures of 1250-1330°C at or just below the Moho. Melting conditions delimited from olivine-melt equilibra mostly range from ~90 km to just above the seismic proxy for the LAB. More deeply equilibrated melts appear to have greater contributions from asthenosphere-derived melts, and melt contributions may by hybridized by localized convective upwelling in response to LAB migration. Melt equilibration temperatures are 80-130°C higher than for clinopyroxene crystallization, assuming that melts have water contents (~0.5 wt.%) inferred from mantle xenoliths. This could be reconciled by melting/melt reaction involving a more hydrous CP mantle, capable of producing melts with ~3 wt.% water, potentially the remnant of Laramide-aged flat-slab subduction.\nThis project is supported by NSF EarthScope Grant EAR-1109826.\n ",

            "abstract": "Suspended and dissolved trace elements are key determinants of water quality in estuarine and coastal waters. High concentrations of trace element pollutants in the San Francisco Bay estuary necessitate consistent and thorough monitoring to mitigate adverse effects on biological systems and the contamination of water and food resources. Although existing monitoring programs collect annual in situ samples from fixed locations, models proposed by Benoit, Kudela, & Flegal (2010) enable calculation of the water column total concentration (WCT) and the water column dissolved concentration (WCD) of 14 trace elements in the San Francisco Bay from a more frequently sampled metric—suspended solids concentration (SSC). This study tests the application of these models with SSC calculated from remote sensing data, with the aim of validating a tool for continuous synoptic monitoring of trace elements in the San Francisco Bay. Using HICO imagery, semi-analytical and empirical SSC algorithms were tested against a USGS dataset. A single-band method with statistically significant linear fit (p < 0.001) was chosen as the proxy for SSC values. The numerical models for WCT and the distribution ratio D were applied in MATLAB with terms to account for regional and seasonal effects, and results were used to calculate WCD. The modeled results were assessed against in situ data from the San Francisco Estuary Regional Monitoring Program. Quantile regression was used to evaluate model sensitivity to the distribution of regions, and outliers displaying regional aberrations were removed before robust regression was applied. Statistically significant and highly correlated results for WCT were found for 10 elements, with goodness of fit greater than or equal to that of the original models of seven elements. WCD was successfully modeled for six elements, with goodness of fit for each exceeding that of the original models. Concentrations of Arsenic, Iron, and Lead in the southern region of the Bay were found to exceed EPA water quality criteria for human health and aquatic life. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of monitoring programs using remote observation of trace element concentrations, and provide the foundation for investigation of pollutant sources and pathways over time.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen, next to water, is believed to be the main limiting resource in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) –a surface community of mosses, lichens and cyanobacteria-have been found to be the main influx of “new” nitrogen (N) into many dryland ecosystems. Controls on biocrust N fixation rates include climate (temperature and moisture), phosphorus availability, and disturbance factors such as trampling, yet a systematic examination of climatic and disturbance controls on biocrusts communities is lacking. Biocrust samples were collected along an elevation gradient in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed near Murphy, Idaho. Four sites were selected from a sagebrush steppe ecosystem with precipitation ranging from ≤250mm/yr to ≥1100mm/yr. Each site included 5 grazed plots and one historic exclosure plot that has been free from grazing for more than 40 years. Five samples each were collected from under plants and from interplant spaces from the grazed plots and exclosures and analyzed for potential N fixation using an acetylene reduction assay. We hypothesized that N fixation rates would be the highest in the exclosures of the two middle sites along the elevation gradient, due to the lack of disturbance and optimal temperature and moisture, respectively. As predicted, results showed higher rates of potential N fixation in exclosures than non-exclosures at a mid-elevation 8.4 ± 3.1 kg N/ha/yr in the exclosures compared to 1.8 ± 1.5 kg N/ha/yr indicating that grazing may reduce N fixation activity. Interestingly, rates were 2-5 times lower under plant canopies compared to interplant spaces at all but the highest elevation site. Findings from our study suggest that biocrust N fixation may be a dominant input of N into theses dryland systems and, in line with our hypotheses, that climate, location within the landscape, and disturbance may interact to regulate the rates of this fundamental ecosystem process.",

            "abstract": "Depletion of the volatile elements in the Earth relative to the CI chondrites is roughly correlated with volatility, or decreasing condensation temperature. For the heavy halogen group elements (Cl, Br and I), volatility alone does not account for their apparent depletion, which early data has suggested is far greater than predicted [1-2]. Such depletion has been used to argue for the preferential loss of halogens by, amongst other processes, impact-driven erosive loss from Earth’s surface [2]. Little consensus exists as to why the halogens should exhibit such preferential behavior during accretionary processes.\nEarly efforts to constrain halogen abundance and understand their behavior in both Earth and planetary materials [3-6] have been hampered by their typically low abundance (ppb level) in most geologic materials. We present the results of halogen analysis of 23 chondrite samples, selected to represent diverse groups and petrologic type. Halogen abundances were measured by neutron irradiation noble gas mass spectrometry (NI-NGMS). Significant concentration heterogeneity is observed within some samples. However, a single Br/Cl and I/Cl ratio of 1.9 ± 0.2 (x 10-3) and 335 ± 10 (x 10-6) can be defined for carbonaceous chondrites with a good correlation between Br and Cl (R2 = 0.97) and between I and Cl (R2 = 0.84). Ratios of I/Cl overlap with terrestrial estimates of Bulk Silicate Earth and Mid Ocean Ridge Basalts. Similarly, good correlations are derived for enstatite (E) chondrites and a sulfide- and halogen- rich subset of E-chondrites. Chlorine abundances of CI (Orgueil) in this study are lower by factor of ~ 3 than the value of ~ 700 ppm Cl (compilation in [1]). Our results are similar to early discarded low values for Ivuna and Orgueil from [5,6] and agree more closely with values for CM chondrites. Halogens may not be as depleted in Earth as previously suggested, or a high degree of heterogeneity in the abundance of these volatile elements in carbonaceous chondrites should be considered when we assess Earth’s halogen abundance relative to CI.\n[1] Lodders (2003) Astr J 591:1220-47.

            "abstract": "Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is a relatively recent development for measurement of ground motion by using a fiber-optic cable itself as the sensor. In September 2013 a field test was conducted at the NEES@UCSB Garner Valley field site in Southern California incorporating DAS technology. A 762 meter long fiber-optic cable was trenched to a depth of about 0.3 m in a rectangular design with two interior diagonal segments. Existing instruments at the field site include the Garner Valley Downhole Array (GVDA) surface and borehole accelerometers and pore pressure transducers. A PASSCAL seismometer array and four NEES@UCLA tri-axial accelerometers were also deployed along the two interior diagonal segments. These sensors also recorded most of the source events.\nOne goal of the field test was to study the response of the fiber-optic cable to various vibration sources, including a 45 kN shear shaker and a smaller 450 N portable mass shaker, both of which were available through NEES@UCLA. In addition to the shear sources, signals were recorded from a mini-Vibe source and hammer blows on a steel plate. The focus of this study is on the directivity and the sensitivity of the fiber-optic cable and the distributed acoustic sensor. Preliminary results indicate that the fiber-optic cable is most effective if oriented in the direction of maximum strain. Even with the directional response, signals were recorded throughout the array for different cable orientations at distances up to two-hundred meters. Move-out of different phases could be seen over several meters of traces recorded one-meter apart. Sensitivity of the fiber-optic cable relative to the other instruments is also presented.",

            "abstract": "During geological sequestration of CO2, fractures are expected to play a critical role in controlling the migration of the injected fluid in reservoir rock. To detect the invasion of supercritical (sc-) CO2 and to determine its saturation, velocity and attenuation of seismic waves can be monitored. When both fractures and matrix porosity connected to the fractures are present, wave-induced dynamic poroelastic interactions between these two different types of rock porosity—high-permeability, high-compliance fractures and low-permeability, low-compliance matrix porosity—result in complex velocity and attenuation changes of compressional waves as scCO2 invades the rock.\nWe conducted core-scale laboratory scCO2 injection experiments on small (diameter 1.5 inches, length 3.5–4 inches), medium-porosity/permeability (porosity 15%, matrix permeability 35 md) sandstone cores. During the injection, the compressional and shear (torsion) wave velocities and attenuations of the entire core were determined using our Split Hopkinson Resonant Bar (short-core resonant bar) technique in the frequency range of 1–2 kHz, and the distribution and saturation of the scCO2 determined via X-ray CT imaging using a medical CT scanner. A series of tests were conducted on (1) intact rock cores, (2) a core containing a mated, core-parallel fracture, (3) a core containing a sheared core-parallel fracture, and (4) a core containing a sheared, core-normal fracture.\nFor intact cores and a core containing a mated sheared fracture, injections of scCO2 into an initially water-saturated sample resulted in large and continuous decreases in the compressional velocity as well as temporary increases in the attenuation. For a sheared core-parallel fracture, large attenuation was also observed, but almost no changes in the velocity occurred. In contrast, a sample containing a core-normal fracture exhibited complex behavior of compressional wave attenuation: the attenuation peaked as the leading edge of the scCO2 approached the fracture; followed by an immediate drop as scCO2 invaded the fracture; and by another, gradual increase as the scCO2 infiltrated into the other side of the fracture. The compressional wave velocity declined monotonically, but the rate of velocity decrease changed with the changes in attenuation.",

            "abstract": "Hara (2007) showed that tsunami earthquakes could be characterized by long high frequency energy radiation (HFER) durations and small displacement amplitudes of P-waves in his analysis of tele-seismic data and suggested the possibility to discriminate tsunami earthquakes by measurements of HFER durations and displacement amplitudes. In this study, we investigated this possibility using waveform data recorded in a regional distance range (up to 30 degrees). We used a dataset compiled to develop a formula of Mhdd (Hara, 2013) for regional distance range (Hara, 2014, submitted). It consists of BHZ channel waveform data retrieved from the IRIS Data Management Center for 93 large shallow earthquakes that occurred between 1994 and July, 2013. Two tsunami earthquakes, the July 17, 2006 Java and October 25, 2010 Mentawai, were included. The distance correction for P wave displacements was done simply by a common logarithm of epicentral distance, although a slight different correction is adopted in the Mhdd formula. As was observed in the analysis of tele-seismic data, the tsunami earthquakes were characterized by long HFER durations and small displacement amplitudes measured from P waves. This suggests that it is possible to discriminate tsunami earthquakes by simple measurements of HFER durations and displacement amplitudes from regional P waves more rapidly than those from tele-seismic data. Since some strike slip events have the similar characteristics as tsunami earthquakes in terms of these measurements, rapid focal mechanism determination such as W phase source inversion would be helpful to distinguish tsunami earthquakes from these strike slip events.",

            "abstract": "Microorganisms are widely distributed in the subsurface environments. However, the distribution, role and rate of metabolisms, and the source of their activity are not well known. In this study, we investigated deep groundwater samples from sedimentary rocks, containing saturated methane and CO2, using boreholes at the Horonobe Underground Research Laboratory (URL), northern Hokkaido, Japan. The hydrochemical conditions of groundwaters, such as in-situ water pressure, temperature, electric conductivity, pH, redox potential, were monitored without degassing at multiple intervals along the borehole. Groundwater samples were taken periodically and chemical composition was analyzed using ICP-MS, etc. Cell counts were in the range of 103 to 105 cells ml-1. Molecular analyses revealed the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of the microbial population. Abundant methanogens were detected in the groundwater, and 80% of them were related to either Methanoregula boonei or Methanobacterium flexile that can utilize H2/CO2 by methanogenesis. Phylotypes clustered within the phylum Firmicutes, beta-Proteobacteria, delta-Proteobacteria and candidate division TM7 were dominant in the groundwater samples. Laboratory experiments using a culture technique showed that humic substances purified from the groundwater at Horonobe area appear to be degraded by microorganisms. Our results suggest that microbial spatial distributions in the subsurface environment were correlated closely with geochemical conditions, such as redox condition and carbon sources. In addition, it is inferred that humic substances are one of the important carbon sources for the subsurface microbial redox processes in the environment.\nThis study was partly funded by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.",

            "abstract": "Islands have provided insight into the ecological role of fire worldwide through research on the positive feedbacks between fire and nonnative grasses, particularly in the Hawaiian Islands. However, the global extent and frequency of fire on islands as an ecological disturbance has received little attention, possibly because ‘natural fires’ on islands are typically limited to infrequent dry lightning strikes and isolated volcanic events. But because most contemporary fires on islands are anthropogenic, islands provide ideal systems with which to understand the linkages between socio-economic development, shifting fire regimes, and ecological change. Here we use the density of satellite-derived (MODIS) active fire detections for the years 2000-2014 and global data sets of vegetation, climate, population density, and road development to examine the drivers of fire activity on islands at the global scale, and compare these results to existing pyrogeographic models derived from continental data sets. We also use the Hawaiian Islands as a case study to understand the extent to which novel fire regimes can pervade island ecosystems. The global analysis indicates that fire is a frequent disturbance across islands worldwide, strongly affected by human activities, indicating people can more readily override climatic drivers than on continental land masses. The extent of fire activity derived from local records in the Hawaiian Islands reveals that our global analysis likely underestimates the prevalence of fire among island systems and that the combined effects of human activity and invasion by nonnative grasses can create conditions for frequent and relatively large-scale fires. Understanding the extent of these novel fire regimes, and mitigating their impacts, is critical to reducing the current and rapid degradation of native island ecosystems worldwide.",

            "abstract": "The large-scale flows patterns like differential rotation and meridional circulation as well as the mean-field dynamo action in the Sun and solar-like stars are thought to have their origin in helical turbulent motions in the stellar convection zones. In this work we will present recent results of HD and MHD global simulations of stars whose stratification resemble that of the solar interior. The simulations are performed with the EULAG code (Smolarkiewicz et al. 2001). They include implicit modeling of the large-eddy contribution from the turbulent scales to the resolved scales, thus, allowing higher turbulent levels (e.g., Guerrero et al. 2013). In the HD regime, the value of the Rossby (Ro) number defines large-scale flow patterns. Large values of Ro result in an anti-solar differential rotation and a meridional circulation consistent with a single circulation cell per hemisphere. Lower values of Ro result in a solar-type differential rotation and a meridional flow with multiple cells in radius and latitude. Due to the low dissipation of the numerical scheme, the models are also able to reproduce the tachocline and sustain it over a longer time scale. In the MHD regime, both solutions are still allowed, however, the shift from anti-solar to the solar-like rotation happens at a larger value or Ro. A wide range of dynamo solutions is obtained for the magnetic field, including steady and oscillating modes (see e.g., Fig. 1). We also compare models with and without a stable stratified layer at the bottom of the convection zone. We notice that the presence of a naturally developed tachocline plays an important role in the dynamo solution, modifying the morphology of the magnetic field, the cycles period and influencing the large-scale flows.\n",

Using the CRU TS 3.21 datasets, we investigated regional climate change over a period from 1901 through 2012 with latitudes, elevation, and long-term mean annual precipitation, aridity index (AI), and annual air temperature (MAAT) in the Northern Hemisphere. We found that the amplified warming occurred in the mid-high latitude regions between 50 and 60 ºN, where air temperature increased by about 1.6℃; in semi-arid regions where annual precipitation between 200 and 500 mm; in mid-high altitude regions between 1000 and 1500 m with air temperature increase of about 1.2℃ and the changes in regions higher than 3500 m seemed to intensity with elevation. Over the transition regions between humid and semi-humid regions with AI between 0.5 and 1.0, air temperature has increased by 1.4℃. Cold regions, defined as the long-term MAAT at or below 0 ºC, air temperature has increased by 1.4℃.Cold regions are more sensitive to the warming, and regional temperature increased greater than that changes across the NH (1.11 ºC). The cryosphere in cold regions plays a critical role in the increased warming as well as in the positive feedback.",

            "abstract": "Exposures of the Miocene Chemehuevi detachment (CDF) system provide a natural laboratory to study the initiation of low-angle normal faults (LANF) active near the base of the seismogenic zone (5-15 km paleodepth). The regional fault system formed at ≤20° dip in heterogeneous gneissic and granitoid rocks, with ambient footwall temperatures from <200 to >400°C. The fault system is characterized by three stacked low-angle normal faults; the CDF preferentially localized ≥ 18 km of NE directed slip rendering the deepest fault, the Mohave Wash Fault (MWF), inactive after 1-2 km of slip. At outcrop scale, damage zones to each fault are planar, but at map scale both the MWF and CDF are corrugated parallel to slip. Detailed macro- and microstructural studies of the MWF, sampled over 15 km down dip, provide insight into strain localization at initiation. At outcrop scale, the MWF is defined by a damage zone 10s of meters thick of fractured host rock cut by anastomosing principal slip zones of cohesive cataclasite (≤2 m thick), locally hosting chlorite, epidote and quartz. At structurally shallow levels (T 200-250° C; 6-8 km paleodepth at initiation), the MWF cuts isotropic granitic rocks, and exhibits dominantly cataclastic deformation overprinting localized crystal plasticity. Five km down dip (T 300-350° C), cataclasis remains the primary deformation mechanism; syntectonic dikes show plastic deformation with no brittle overprint. Rare pseudotachylite is present within meters of the principle slip zone. At the structurally deepest exposures of the MWF (T ≥ 400°C; 12-15 km paleodepth), gneissic basement cut by syntectonic dikes host a well-developed mylonitic lineation parallel to the extension direction, both reworked by cataclasis. Oxygen isotope data collected from fault rocks hosting quartz-epidote pairs indicate early infiltration of surface-derived fluids. Calculated oxygen isotope temperatures from the fault rocks and footwall are consistently 50-200° C higher than the ambient footwall temperature at MWF initiation. The elevated temperatures are interpreted to reflect infiltration of fluids through the fractured hanging wall followed by heating, and subsequent migration up the LANF due to enhanced permeability and porosity in the damage zone, likely driven by syntectonic dike emplacement.",

            "abstract": "Peak global warmth during the early Eocene is a partial analog to the future structure of marine ecosystems in a high pCO2 world. Early Eocene oceans are generally regarded as supporting warmer oceans with lower overall productivity than today owing to the low concentrations of preserved organic matter in pelagic sediments. It has also been proposed that Eocene oceans were about as productive as now, but higher respiration rates in a warmer-than-modern ocean more efficiently recycled organic matter and nutrients. We investigated Eocene export productivity and its link to taxonomic diversity using the pelagic ichthyolith record. Ichthyoliths are calcium phosphate microfossils including fish teeth and shark denticles and their fragments, and are a unique paleoceanographic proxy because they represent a fossil record for marine vertebrates, a charismatic and tangible part of the ecosystem that generally goes unrepresented in the fossil record. Analysis of the ichthyolith record in Ocean Drilling Program Site 1258 (NE South America) shows a remarkable increase in accumulation rate of ichthyoliths from the Paleocene into the Eocene, suggesting that onset of the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum in the equatorial Atlantic was favorable to fish production. Our results suggest that, if anything, the early Eocene maintained higher productivity than in the late Paleocene. These results compare favorably with a record of ichthyolith accumulation in the South Pacific (DSDP 596), which also indicates unusually high rates of fish productivity in the peak of Eocene warm climates. Low resolution data sets from the Pacific suggest an explosion of morphotypes during the warm period associated with an increase in ichthyolith mass accumulation rates. Peak global warmth, therefore, appears to be associated with both higher fish production and higher taxonomic diversity than suggested by previous reconstructions of Eocene primary production.\nIncreasing the amount of continuous records of ichthyoliths and identifying morphotypes will improve our understanding of the pelagic community in deep time and specifically its response to global climate change, which will in turn inform us about fish evolution through time and their potential response to anthropogenic climate forcings.",

Holes at this site were drilled close to seamounts and intersected the volcaniclastic apron. Volcaniclastic breccia and sandstone at Site U1431 are dated as late middle Miocene to early late Miocene (~8–13 Ma), suggesting a 5 m.y. duration of seamount volcanism. The apron is approximately 200 m thick and is sandwiched between non-volcaniclastic units that represent the background sedimentation. These comprise dark greenish gray clay, silt, and nannofossil ooze interpreted as turbidite and hemipelagic deposits that accumulated at abyssal water depths. At its base, the seamount sequence begins with dark greenish gray sandstone, siltstone, and claystone in upward fining sequences interpreted as turbidites intercalated with minor intervals of volcaniclastic breccia. Upsection the number and thickness of breccia layers increases with some beds up to 4.8 m and possibly 14.5 m thick. The breccia is typically massive, ungraded, and poorly sorted with angular to subangular basaltic clasts, as well as minor reworked subrounded calcareous mudstone, mudstone, and sandstone clasts. Basaltic clasts include nonvesicular aphyric basalt, sparsely vesicular aphyric basalt, highly vesicular aphyric basalt, and nonvesicular glassy basalt. Mudstone clasts are clay rich and contain foraminifer fossils. The matrix comprises up to 40% of the breccia beds and is a mix of clay, finer grained altered basalt clasts, and mafic vitroclasts with rare foraminifer fossils. Some layers have calcite cement between clasts. Volcaniclastic sandstone and claystone cycles interbedded with the breccia layers have current ripples and parallel laminations indicative of high-energy flow conditions during sedimentation. The breccia beds were most likely deposited as a series of debris flows or grain flows. This interpretation is supported by their massive structure, poor sorting, and reverse-graded bases. The upper part of the apron grades back into the background clay, silt and nannofossil ooze sedimentation with minor volcaniclastic sand and silt.",

Where temporal monitoring is concerned, recent advances in data mining have allowed the recovery of remarkably time-coherent correlation functions from ambient noise, and have furthermore permitted the direct mapping of velocity changes due to large earthquakes. Though not directly representative of the Green’s function between stations, these time-coherent correlation functions have even been used to predict eruptive sequences on the Piton de la Fournaise volcano by detecting injection events. However, the exact nature of the correlation function in this case, particularly its coda, is unclear.Here, we seek to expand the concept of temporal monitoring to a more deterministic case, where we do in fact have a practical understanding of the correlation functions. In this study, we use a large network of short period and broadband instruments on Erebus volcano, Antarctica, to reconstruct inter-station correlation functions that converge towards a high degree of symmetry. We subsequently use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to iteratively resample the time windows on which are built the correlation functions for maximum symmetry and coherence in time. These resampled correlation functions are then scanned for changes in decoherence, and these changes are then mapped in time and space to the volcanic edifice. We compare these changes to other evidence of temporal variation on Erebus volcano.",

            "abstract": "Due to extreme weather conditions and remoteness to access, the great part of the Southern Ocean remains to be explored. Therefore, little is known about the Circum-Antarctic Ridge (CAR) system and its hydrothermal vent ecosystem underlying the Southern Ocean. We report the first discovery of a new deep-sea hydrothermal vent field and a new anomuran species from the Australia-Antarctic Ridge (AAR), the highest latitude (62°S; 158°E) explored in the Southern Ocean up to date. At this site, a new anomuran species which belongs to the genus Kiwa known as ‘yeti crabs’ was found. Morphologically, this species has characteristics of the genus Kiwa, including fifth pereopod inserted below sterna plastron, third sternite strongly produced anteriorly, and eyes extremely reduced. However, the new species differs from the other known species of Kiwa, K. hirsuta and K. puravida, showing relatively short rostrum and slender dactylus on second to fourth pereopods. Phylogenetic analysis using DNA sequences of eight genetic loci also supported the result of morphological analysis, confirming this species as a new Kiwa species, Kiwa n. sp. In addition, phylogenetic tree revealed the evolutionary relationship among the Kiwa species, presenting the Kiwa n. sp. as the sister species to K. puravida which inhabits the methane cold seep on the Pacific continental slope off Costa Rica. Considering the geography and the physicochemical environment, this unlikely result casts a mystery to be solved through further taxon sampling particularly from as-yet-unexplored vents and seeps. Discovery of the hydrothermal vent and Kiwa n. sp. from the AAR segment is significant because this site is located in the high latitude of the southern hemisphere and it is the region affected by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Future research on the relation of Kiwa n. sp. and the other Kiwa species affected by the ACC will provide an idea about the biogeography and the evolutionary connections of the vent faunas in the CAR system.",

In this research, flood events have been used as the source of stimulation and the source of the corresponding changes between the river infiltration and the groundwater level data in the river stage tomography to depict the large-scale heterogeneous distribution of the hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer. In previous researches, the feasibility of the river stage tomography had been confirmed in synthetic aquifer tests but it has never been used in-situ data, to investigate the effects of this method. For that reason, in this project, a site has been installed for monitoring the water level fluctuation of the groundwater, according to the fluctuation of the water level of the Hsin Hu Wei Stream in Yunlin County. Additionally, the cross-correlation method has been used, so that it can identify the correlation between the surface water and the groundwater. The results indicate that the river stage tomography can effectively inverse the basin-scale heterogeneous distribution of the hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer. Furthermore, the results of this research can be used for studying the groundwater of a basin and developing strategies for water resources management.\nKeyword:River stage tomography,Cross-correlation, River infiltration",

            "abstract": "An algorithm to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD), single scattering albedo (SSA), and aerosol loading height is developed for GEMS (Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer) measurement. The GEMS is planned to be launched in geostationary orbit in 2018, and employs hyper-spectral imaging with 0.6 nm resolution to observe solar backscatter radiation in the UV and Visible range. In the UV range, the low surface contribution to the backscattered radiation and strong interaction between aerosol absorption and molecular scattering can be advantageous in retrieving aerosol information such as AOD and SSA [Torres et al., 2007; Torres et al., 2013; Ahn et al., 2014]. However, the large contribution of atmospheric scattering results in the increase of the sensitivity of the backward radiance to aerosol loading height. Thus, the assumption of aerosol loading height becomes important issue to obtain accurate result. Accordingly, this study focused on the simultaneous retrieval of aerosol loading height with AOD and SSA by utilizing the optimal estimation method. For the RTM simulation, the aerosol optical properties were analyzed from AERONET inversion data (level 2.0) at 46 AERONET sites over ASIA. Also, 2-channel inversion method is applied to estimate a priori value of the aerosol information to solve the Lavenberg Marquardt equation.\nThe GEMS aerosol algorithm is tested with OMI level-1B dataset, a provisional data for GEMS measurement, and the result is compared with OMI standard aerosol product and AERONET values. The retrieved AOD and SSA show reasonable distribution compared with OMI products, and are well correlated with the value measured from AERONET. However, retrieval uncertainty in aerosol loading height is relatively larger than other results.",

Heating the lower ionosphere with high power HF waves allows for modulation of natural current systems.\nOur experiments were carried out at the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility in Alaska, USA. In this experiment, the ionosphere was heated with a vertical amplitude modulating signal and the modulation frequency was changed sequentially within an array of 40 frequencies followed by a frequency ramp.\nThe observed magnetic field amplitude and polarization of the generated ELF/VLF signals were analyzed for multiple sites and as a function of modulation frequency. Our three observation sites: Chistochina, Paxson and Paradise are located within 36km (azimuth 47.7°), 50.2km (azimuth -20°) and 99km (azimuth 80.3°) respectively.\nWe show that the peak amplitudes observed as a function of frequency result from vertical resonance in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide and can be used to diagnose the D-region profile. Polarization analysis showed that out of the three sites Paxson shows the highest circularity in the magnetic field polarization, compared to Chistochina and Paradise which show highly linear polarizations.\nThe experimental results were compared with a theoretical simulation model results and it was clear that in both cases, the modulated Hall current dominates the observed signals at Chistochina and Paradise sites and at Paxson there is an equal contribution from Hall and Pedersen currents.\nThe Chistochina site shows the highest magnetic field amplitudes in both experimental and simulation environments. Depending upon the experimental and simulation observations at the three sites, a radiation pattern for the HAARP ionospheric heater can be mapped",

            "abstract": "The Burma Arc is the northward continuation of the Sumatra-Anadaman subduction zone that gave rise to the 2004 M9.3 earthquake and tsunami. Near its northern end, it is colliding with the thick sediments of the Bengal Basin. The sediments of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta are folded and faulted, creating a subaerial 250-km wide accretionary prism. The deformation front is blind and reaches ½ way across the delta. Whether subduction is still occurring at this highly oblique plate boundary has been hotly debated. To investigate this, we combined our 25 continuous GPS receivers in Bangladesh with the campaign network in Myanmar, processing them together with GAMIT/GLOBK. We combined this data with 28 mostly campaign GPS sites in India (Gahalaut et al., 2012) by processing using the same IGS sites and performing a Helmert transformation to place all the data in same reference frame within ITRF2008. Published Indian plate poles yield a systematic residual for Bangladeshi sites believed to be on stable India. We estimated a new pole by combining 13 Indian stations (Mahesh et al., 2013) with 2 of our stations. Due to the rapid growth of the accretionary prism and the overthrusting by the Shillong Plateau, the Burma Arc changes shape from the backstop to the front folds. To project the GPS velocities into a profile, we have experimented with several projections that vary across the foldbelt, using the arc of the earthquakes and the topography as a guide. Strike-slip is mostly absorbed by the Sagaing and CMF faults, and some additional shear is distributed over the region. The best fitting suite of models for the shortening component yield 13-15 mm/y of shortening across the arc on a shallow-dipping megathrust. Additional shortening of ~4 mm/y is absorbed in the vicinity of the Kabaw Fault, where coverage is sparse. The dip of the megathrust and the depth of its downdip end trade off with one another in the different projections. The low range of dips of 6-10° is consistent with local intraplate seismicity. The downdip end of the locked zone of the megathrust is just east of Bangladesh-India border around ~92.5°E and is a very stable feature in all the models. The broad locked zone of ~250km suggests that the segment between Shillong and the coast, which has no historical record of a large earthquake, is capable of a M8.2-M8.8 earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Parallels exist between American environmental practice and those of our criminal justice system. Common among these are “throw-away” approaches, often yielding more complex problems then those attempted to solve. Personal change can be expressed via deepening sense of context and purpose, extending beyond concerns for self. Incarceration often exacerbates a thirst for new meaning-making, highly relevant to both criminal and ecological rehabilitation.\nPrimary field data was gathered from incarcerated men, with a focus on the Insight Garden Program in San Quentin State Prison. A mixed method was used, with open-ended qualitative interviews and three established multiple-choice survey instruments: an environmental literacy quiz; a Locus of Control test (a psychological survey measuring one’s sense of self-agency); and the “Six Americas” survey instrument, which stratifies responses of climate change opinion.\nTwo control groups in the same unit were included in the study: inmates taking other programs but not gardening, and inmates in no programming at all. This research explores patterns in the ways people come to terms with personal moral obligation, as well as how restorative ecological engagement may be transformational for humans in personal crisis.\nParticipants described prison programming in general as contributing profoundly to personal transformation. Beyond that, programming with a strong ecological focus offered vocational, intellectual, emotional and even spiritual change, which in turn has been shown to aid in reducing recidivism rates.\nGiven a sample size of 58 participants total, the 174 surveys conducted were not primarily intended to achieve statistical significances but augment the overall perspective, for individuals, or for groups. Some correlations of significance were observed, however, between control groups, survey data, and with general US population data.\nMost intriguing, analysis of the qualitative interview data yielded patterns of progressive change in personal and/or ecological relationship.\nThese survey results and compelling dialogues illustrate the degree to which prison programming experiences have profoundly expanded and nurtured participants’ healthy relationships to self, fellow humans, and our communities, including our larger shared ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Time-dependent borehole failure is a widely recognised problem in borehole geomechanics. Failure may be caused by pressure, temperature and chemical gradients introduced by the drill mud into the formation. The exact coupling between these thermodynamic parameters and the mechanical failure processes is not well understood, because (a) the impact of thermodynamic parameters is not routinely considered in rock mechanical testing and (b) repeat or “time-lapse” runs of borehole imaging tools over the same formation interval are rare. At the same time understanding time-dependant borehole failure can enhance the thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) characterization of a given formation and improve borehole stability predictions.\nIn this contribution we present a fully coupled material model that allows for diffusion driven weakening and strain. The material model is based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics and implements the material weakening via a damage parameter. This material model is implemented into a Finite Element simulation of near-well bore processes. A parameter study explores the possibilities of using in-situ observations (e.g. time-dependant widening of borehole breakouts in repeat image logs) for the inversion of THMC coupling parameters. We also discuss the implication of the forward modelling for borehole stability predictions.",

The GOES satellite images collected for vast territories at high temporal frequencies provide a consistent and reliable source for operational active fire mapping realized by the WF-ABBA algorithm. However, their potential to provide early warning or rapid confirmation of initial fire ignition reports from conventional sources remains underutilized, partly because the operational wildfire detection has been successfully optimized for users and applications for which timeliness of initial detection is a low priority, contrasting to the needs of first responders.\nWe present our progress in developing the GOES Early Fire Detection (GOES-EFD) system, a collaborative effort led by University of California-Davis and USDA Forest Service. The GOES-EFD specifically focuses on first detection timeliness for wildfire incidents. It is automatically trained for a monitored scene and capitalizes on multiyear cross-disciplinary algorithm research. Initial retrospective tests in Western US demonstrate significantly earlier identification detection of new ignitions than existing operational capabilities and a further improvement prospect. The GOES-EFD-β prototype will be initially deployed for the Western US region to process imagery from GOES-NOP and the rapid and 4 times higher spatial resolution imagery from GOES-R — the upcoming next generation of GOES satellites. These and other enhanced capabilities of GOES-R are expected to significantly improve the timeliness of fire ignition information from GOES-EFD.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires threaten ecosystems and urban development across the United States, posing significant implications for land management and natural processes such as watershed hydrology. This study investigates the spatial association between large wildfires and urbanization. Several geospatial dataset are combined to map wildfires (Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity for 1984 to 2012) and housing density (SILVIS Lab Spatial Analysis for Conservation and Sustainability decadal housing density for 1940 to 2030) relative to natural wildlands across the contiguous U.S. Several buffers (i.e. 25 km) are developed around wildlands (Protected Areas Database of the United States) to quantify the change and relationship in spatial fire and housing density patterns. Since 1984, wildfire behavior is cyclical and follows general climatology, where warmer years have more and larger fires. Ignition locations also follow transportation corridors and development which provide easy accessibility to wildlands. In California, both fire frequency and total acres burned exhibit increasing trends (statistically significant at 95%). The 1980s average wildfire frequency and total acres burned was 3100 fires and approximately 1200 km2, respectively. These numbers have increased to 2200 fires and over 1500 km2 in the 2010 to 2012 period alone. Initial observations also show that decennial population and area burned for four major Californian counties (Los Angeles, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta) show strong correlation between the last decade of burned area, urban-fringe proximity, and urbanization trends. Improving our understanding of human induced wildfire regimes provides key information on urban fringe communities most vulnerable to the wildfire risks and can help inform regional development planning.",

            "abstract": "As part of the GoAmazon2014 experiment, several aerosol and trace gas monitoring stations are being operated for at least one year before and after the Manaus plume. Three sites are being operated in pristine conditions, with atmospheric properties under natural biogenic conditions. These three sites called T0 are: ATTO (Amazon Tall Tower Observatory), ZF2 ecological research site and a third site called EMBRAPA. After the air masses are exposed to the Manaus plume, one site (called T2) is being operated right on the opposite side of the Negro River under the direct influence of the Manaus plume at 5 Km downwind of Manaus. Finally, at about 150 Km downwind of Manaus is the T3 Manacapuru site. Aerosol chemical composition is being analyzed using filters for fine (PM2.5) and coarse mode aerosol as well as three Aerodyne ACSM (Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitors) instruments. Aerosol absorption is being studied with several aethalometers and MAAP (Multi Angle Absorption Photometers). Aerosol light scattering are being measured at several wavelengths using nephelometers. Aerosol size distribution is determined using scanning mobility particle sizers. The aerosol column is measures using AERONET sunphotometers before and after the Manaus plume, as well as several Lidar systems.\nThe three sites before the Manaus plume show remarkable similar variability in aerosol concentrations and optical properties. This pattern is very different at the T2 site, with large aerosol concentrations enhancing aerosol absorption and scattering significantly. The aerosol is very oxidized before being exposed to the Manaus plume, and this pattern changes significantly for T2 and T3 sites, with a much higher presence of less oxidized aerosol. Typical ozone concentrations at mid-day before Manaus plume is a low 10-12 ppb, value that changes to 50-70 ppb for air masses suffering the influence of Manaus plume. A detailed comparison of aerosol characteristics and composition for the several sites will be presented together with air mass trajectories following the evolution of aerosol and trace gases in GoAmazon2014.",

            "abstract": "The Soundings of Ozone and Water in the Equatorial Region (SOWER) has been accumulating observational evidences of atmospheric dehydration taking place in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) since initiation in 1998. SOWER data successfully characterize the nature of TTL dehydration in which the cold-trap is effectively functioning between 360 K and 380 K isentropes while some moistening taking place before the air parcel reaches 400 K. The first attempts of the TTL water vapor ‘match’ suggest the threshold of nucleation being 146 ± 19 % in relative humidity with respect to ice with the typical dehydration time scale of about an hour in the lower TTL. Simultaneous observations by lidar and Optical Particle Counters near the cold point tropopause reveale cirrus clouds within the aerosol layer composed of liquid phase aqueous sulfuric acid particles. The estimated concentrations of cloud particles and aerosols are not consistent with the interpretation of cloud formation in liquid phase aerosol particles.\n In February 2014, a series of ozone (ECC) and water vapor (CFH) sonde observations was conducted at Biak (1.2oS, 136.1oE) collaborating with LAPAN, Indonesia. The sea surface temperature in the western tropical Pacific showed positive anomalies. The convective activities were relatively low in the eastern Indian Ocean to the Maritime Continent, while an eastward propagation of active convection associated with intraseasonal oscillation was observed. This campaign was not simply an extension of the previous ones, but was intended to provide correlative data for ATTREX/CONTRAST/CAST aircraft campaigns. Unfortunately the coordination did not run as originally intended. A sequence of independent sonde data, however, may provide some useful information for airborne observations. This paper presents an overview of the project and introduces the highlights of the findings obtained.",

            "abstract": "An aerosol retrieval algorithm for East Asia was developed from Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation-Cloud and Aerosol Imager (TANSO-CAI) launched in January 2009 onboard the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). To investigate aerosol optical properties over the East Asia, inversion products from AERONET sun-photometer observation were analyzed and look-up table (LUT) approach to retrieve optical properties of aerosol was adopted using the method from Kim et al. (2007). To define fine and coarse aerosols in calculating LUT, optical properties of aerosol such as refractive index and volume peak ratio (VPR) were validated by AERONET products with AOD values of 0.15, 0.45, 0.8, 1.2, 1.8, and 2.6, respectively. For the aerosol absorptivity, single scattering albedo (SSA) of 0.95 was used as a threshold, i.e. SSA greater than the threshold as non-absorbing aerosol and SSA less than the values as absorbing with VPR, respectively. The algorithm retrieves aerosol optical depth (AOD), size distribution of aerosol, and aerosol type in 0.015 degree x 0.015 degree resolution and surface reflectance was estimated using the clear sky composite method. To distinguish aerosol absorptivity, the reflectance difference method was considered using 4 channels of TANSO-CAI. In this study, the retrieved AOD was compared with those of AERONET and MODIS dataset from January 2012 and August 2014. The retrieved AOD shows reasonable correlation coefficient, however, the largest error sources in aerosol retrieval has been surface reflectance. The retrieved aerosol properties were provided to improve data availability and minimize the errors due to aerosol in carbon dioxide retrieval using TANSO-FTS onboard the same platform. Based on the results with CAI algorithm developed, we are continuously improving the algorithm for better performance.",

            "abstract": "This experimental study is designed to complement field observations of olivine-rich troctolites in ophiolites and from mid-ocean ridges. The olivine-rich troctolites are characterized by high volume proportion of olivine with interstitial plagioclase and clinopyroxene. Typically the clinopyroxene occurs in the form of few large, poikilitic grains. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of cooling process on the geometry of the interstitial phases (clinopyroxene and plagioclase). Experiments are conducted in a piston cylinder apparatus by first annealing olivine plus a basaltic melt with a composition designed to be in equilibrium with four phases at ~ 1 GPa and 1250ºC. Initially, we anneal the olivine-basalt aggregates at 1350 °C and 0.7 GPa for one week to produce a steady state microstructure. At this temperature only olivine and minor opx are present as crystalline phases. We then cool the samples over two weeks below their solidus temperature, following different protocols. The post-run samples are sectioned, polished, and imaged at high resolution and analyzed by using a field emission SEM. Initial observations show that under certain conditions clinopyroxene nucleates distributed throughout the aggregate at many sites, forming relatively small, rounded to near euhedral grains. Under certain conditions few cpx grains nucleate and grow with a poikilitic shape, partially or fully enclosing olivine grains, as is observed in natural samples. As for partially molten aggregates quenched form the annealing temperature, the microstructure will be characterized by tracing phase boundaries on screen by using ImageJ software. The geometry of the interstitial phases will be quantified by determining the grain boundary wetness, in this case the ratio of the length of polyphase to single phase (olivine-olivine) boundaries. Compositional data will also be used to study the change in major element compositions before and after the cooling process.",

In addition, we discussed the correlation between PM2.5, PM10, SO2 & NO2 and the smog days. At last, the situation of atmospheric circulation during a severe haze weather process between Jan, 2, 2013 to Feb, 4, 2013 was studied. Results show that: (1) from 2002 to 2012, the average smog days in Shanghai and in the outer suburb of Shanghai show a trend of fluctuating decrease generally with the rates of 6.031d/a and 5.89d/a, respectively. The smog days in the downtown of Shanghai decrease most quickly, with the rate of 15.418d/a. The smog days in the suburb of Shanghai decreased most slowly, with the rate of 2.495d/a. Smog happens most frequently in January, November and December (accounting for 31%) and least in August and September. The inter-annual variation of smog days shows the trend of decreasing in all four seasons. The smog days decreases most slowly in spring, with the ratio of 1.16d/a, it decreases most quickly in winter, with the ratio of 1.65d/a, and decreases at the medium ratio of 1.58d/a and 1.49d/a in summer and autumn respectively. (2) The number of monthly average smog days is positively related to the monthly average concentration of PM10, SO2, PM2.5 and NO2. The correlative coefficient between the number of monthly average smog days and the monthly average PM10 and NO2 concentrations are 0.756 and 0.610, respectively.

            "abstract": "Understanding how hydrologic and geochemical processes are coupled, and how this coupling is linked to geomorphic boundary conditions, remains a fundamental problem in the Geosciences, with implications from hydrology and ecosystem science to the geologic carbon cycle. In this study, we present paired measurements of water chemistry and river runoff in four nested catchments spanning the transition from the Andes Mountains to the foreland floodplain in Peru. These data provide insight into the linkages between catchment hydrology and weathering across a dramatic geomorphic gradient.\nAlong the studied gradient, bedrock-derived solute concentrations range from being nearly constant in the Andes to showing significant dilution in response to increasing runoff in the foreland floodplain. Mean catchment slope appears to be a robust predictor of the power law exponent relating solute concentrations and runoff, which implies that erosional processes are an underlying control on concentration-runoff relationships.\nA number of factors may explain the observed slope-dependency of concentration-runoff relationships, including both mineral and fluid residence times. Seasonal variation in the δD of the Andean rivers is significantly damped relative to variation in the δD of precipitation. Along with consideration of the annual water budget, these data suggest that water is transiently stored within fractured bedrock in the Andean catchments. Across the entire study area, the seasonal variation in the δD of tributaries (i.e. streams that drain only a narrow range of elevations) increases with decreasing mean catchment elevation, which suggests that fluid residence times are shorter in the foreland floodplain relative to the Andes. Together, we interpret these factors to suggest that erosional processes, by modulating both the residence time of water and minerals in the critical zone, control the hydrologic sensitivity of weathering processes along the Andes-to-Amazon gradient.",

            "abstract": "Recent decline of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean influences the climate system around the Northern polar region. One of the potential reasons of the sea ice decrease is the warming of Atlantic Water, which is transported to the subsurface layer in the Arctic Ocean through the Fram Strait. We utilize a realistically configured OGCM to investigate the mechanisms of the interannual variability of the inflow of the Atlantic water. The horizontal grid size of our model is less than 5 km around the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea Opening. The penetration of warm water to the subsurface layer through the Fram Strait is well reproduced in our model. The eddy activity around the Fram Strait, which enhances the recirculation to the Atlantic Ocean, is also simulated by the horizontally high resolution. Since there is significant correlation between the inflow of the Atlantic Water at the Fram Strait and the NAO index, the synoptic pattern of wind stress is one of the dominant factors on the heat flux between the north Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean. Here we also examine the other causes (e.g., eddy activity and sea surface cooling) of interannual variability of heat flux at the Fram Strait.",

Scientific riser drilling, with coincident control over drilling mud, downhole pressure, and returning drilling mud analyses, has now been in use aboard the scientific riser drilling vessel Chikyu since 2009. International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 348, as part of the goal of reaching the plate boundary fault system near ~5000 mbsf, has now extended the deep riser hole (Hole C0002 N & P) to 3058.5 mbsf.\nThe mud gas data discussed here are from two approximately parallel boreholes, one a kick-off from the other; 860-2329 mbsf (Hole C0002N) and 2163-3058 mbsf (Hole C0002P). An approximate overlap of 166 m between the holes allows for some slight depth comparison between the two holes. An additional 55 m overlap at the top of Hole C0002P exists where a 10-5/8-inch hole was cored, and then opened to 12-1/4-inch with logging while drilling (LWD) tools (Fig. 1). There are several fault zones revealed by LWD data, confirmed in one instance by coring. One of the defining formation characteristics of Holes C0002 N/P are the strongly dipping bedding planes, typically exceeding 60º. These fault zones and bedding planes can influence the methane/ethane concentrations found in the returning drilling mud.\nA focused comparison of free gas in drilling mud between one interval in Hole C0002 P, drilled first with a 10 5/8-inch coring bit and again with an 12 ¼-inch logging while drilling (LWD) bit is shown. Hole C0002N above this was cased all the way from the sea floor to the kick-off section. A fault interval (in pink) was identified from the recovered core section and from LWD resistivity and gamma. The plot of methane and ethane free gas (C1 and C2; ppmv) shows that the yield of free gas (primarily methane) was greater when the LWD bit returned to open the cored hole to a greater diameter. One possible explanation for this is the time delay between coring and LWD operations; approximately 3 days passed between the end of coring and the beginning of LWD (25-28 December 2013).",

            "abstract": "Topographic evolution can be used to infer geodynamic processes involved in orogensis. But, for a long time, the topographic history of the Tibetan orogen has remained controversial because of competing ideas of how the proxy record for elevation is interpreted and how exactly topography change can be related to geodynamic processes. Mounting evidence in the structural record across northern and eastern Tibet calls for the onset of crustal shortening to either precede or closely follow the ~ 50 Ma continental collision. Surficial records of climate proxies for paleoelevation also have been interpreted as the development of modern elevation of the Tibetan Plateau at an early stage in orogenesis. However, if the attainment of early high-elevation is reflective of achieving modern crustal thicknesses, then much of the continental convergence in the last 30-40 Myr did not contribute to thickening the Asian crust and as such, produces a paradox of missing crustal mass within the orogen. So, if modern elevations were reached in early Cenozoic time, we should be concerned with the mechanisms by which crust can be removed from the convergent system in large quantities. Alternatively, early deformation could produce local topography and proxy records could record these local elevation changes rather than the attainment of regional high topography.",

            "abstract": "The Hudson River estuary has been subject to many abrupt events throughout its history including hurricanes, droughts and pluvials. Hurricanes in particular are rare, discrete events that if fingerprinted can be used to develop better age models for Hudson River sediments. Proxies use observed physical characteristics or biological assemblages (e.g. diatom and foraminiferal assemblages) as tools to reconstruct past conditions prior to the modern instrumental record. Using a sediment core taken from the Hudson River (CDO2-29A), in New York City, drought and pluvial layers were selected based on Cs-137 dating while hurricane layers were determined from occurrences of tropical to subtropical foraminifera.\nContrary to previous studies (Weaver, 1970, Weiss et al, 1978), more than sixty different diatom species have been identified using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Cosmopolitan, hurricane and drought assemblages have begun to be identified after observing multiple layers (Table 1). Tropical foraminifera dominated by Globigerinoides ruber pink were also found in a hurricane layer that we infer was deposited during Hurricane Belle in 1976.

            "abstract": "The subduction of sediments and hydrated oceanic plates transports the primary flux of water into the interior of the Earth. As an oceanic plate sinks, water is progressively released by compaction and chemical dehydration reactions, a significant fraction of which is released during the initial stages of subduction. In order to map the flux of fluids at the Middle America Trench, we collected marine magnetotelluric and controlled-source electromagnetic data along a 280-km profile that spans the offshore component of the Nicaraguan margin. Fluids and volatiles present in the crust and mantle can decrease the bulk electrical resistivity by up to several orders of magnitude, making electromagnetic methods an ideal exploration tool for quantifying fluids along convergent margins. Our joint two-dimensional electrical resistivity model provides new constraints on the cycling of fluids at crustal depths. We image a variety of conductive channels that are indicative of: (1) crustal hydration along bending-induced normal faults at the outer rise, (2) the complete subduction of water-rich sediments, and (3) the vertical migration of fluids from the plate interface to the forearc seafloor. We estimate porosity from electrical resistivity using Archie’s law to show that the porosity of the lower crust is increased by 115% at the outer rise compared with the abyssal plain, suggesting that more pore water is being subducted than previously thought. At the margin toe, we observe the porosity of the underthrust sediment layer to decay exponentially with increasing depth of burial to 10-km inland of the trench, which agrees well with laboratory studies of compaction driven porosity loss. At 23-km into the forearc, our data reveal an anomalous conductor that extends from the plate interface into the overlying forearc crust, terminating 1-2-km below a high density region of active fluid seeps and mud mounds that have previously been mapped. The temperature and pressure regime in the vicinity of the anomalous conductor suggests it arises from diagenetic dewatering of subducted sediment and/or upper crust material, providing a flux of additional water that may be the source of fluids escaping on the forearc seafloor.",

Daily averaged PM2.5 and PM10 exceeded respectively 35μg/m3 and 100μg/m3 during this episode at Fukuoka, southeastern city of Japan. The continuous aerosol plumes were constructed by Asian dust and anthropogenic pollutants, and observed by many aerosol measurements, such as ground-based lidar, space-born lidar, Aerosol Chemical Speciation Analyzer (ACSA) and Polarization Optical Particle Counter (POPC). Regional chemical transport model was used to clarify the meteorological condition forming long-lasting aerosol plumes and the 3D structure.\nThe continuous aerosol plume was made by 2 sequential low pressure systems passing over desert area, and subsequently generated blocking high pressure system over Japan. The averaged aerosol depolarization ratio derived by ground-based lidar and POPC at around 0.5μm during this episode were 0.11 and 0.146, these values were very low for dust case. ACSA data at Fukuoka also showed that coarse model nitrate and fine mode sulfate concentration was very high (3~6μg/m3 for coarse mode nitrate, 5-15 μg/m3 for fine mode sulfate) during this episode. These results suggested that transport of anthropogenic aerosols were occurred during this event together with dust plume. Coarse mode nitrate might be made by internal mixing between dust particles and nitrate. Numerical chemical transport model could not reproduced high concentration of coarse mode nitrate because model did not consider the process of internal mixing between dust particles and nitrate. Further vertical structure and mixing state during long-lasting trans-boundary pollution are clarified.",

            "abstract": "Undulations of the heliospheric current sheet result in identifiable sectors at Earth where the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is directed predominantly toward or away from the Sun. When the IMF is directed toward the Sun magnetic reconnection results in open magnetic field lines in the northern polar cap that are directed upstream into the solar wind, providing a path of direct access for solar wind plasma into the northern polar cap and producing polar rain. At the same time, the reconnected field lines threading the southern polar cap are directed downstream, draping along the magnetotail and leading to low particle fluxes precipitating into the southern polar cap. The magnetic field asymmetry arising from a strong radial IMF component results in asymmetric particle fluxes in the north and south polar caps. At times, a very clear correlation exists between the number of echoes recorded by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) and the orientation of IMF in the solar sector. The polar cap that is connected upstream produces fewer ionospheric and ground echoes for the SuperDARN radars in that hemisphere. The echo occurrence is opposite in the north and in the south, and the high or low echo occurrence persists through the solar sector. The presence or lack of polar rain precipitation is expected to alter the ionospheric density profile and lead to different propagation of the radio waves through the ionosphere. Changes in tropospheric weather circulation have been linked to the passage of a solar sector boundary at Earth, and this direct solar-terrestrial influence at ionospheric altitudes may prove to be essential in understanding interplanetary influences on the troposphere.",

            "abstract": "Behavior of volatiles included in magma is well known to play an important role in volcanic activity. The buildup of gas overpressure is the driving force that leads to explosive eruption. During a sequence of eruptive activity, volcanoes display various styles of eruption with consequent wide variation in terms of magnitude and power. In Semeru volcano (Java, Indonesia), vulcanian eruptions explosively release large amounts of ash. They are preceded by about 200–300 s of inflation before the eruption suggesting volume expansion of the gas phase. In contrast, gas bursts, which rapidly emit water steam accompanied by explosive sounds, are preceded by about 20 sec of inflation before each emission. Tilt amplitudes increase with the magnitude of eruptions for both eruptive styles, but the two different inflation pattern suggest differences in the gas behavior within the same volcanic system. We develop a physical-based model to clarify how volatiles behavior affect the rate of inflation and magnitude observed at one given station. The availability of different scale of deformation related with the two different eruption styles allows us to perform a complete statistical analysis of physical parameters affecting the deformation. We show that it is possible to get reliable and quantitative information on the key physical controlling parameters, such as conduit geometry, magma and host rock properties, based on the large number of events recorded at one station.",

These regions extend beyond local boundaries (ie. cities, states) to incorporate areas with linked economies, infrastructure and land-use patterns and shared climate and environmental systems, such as watersheds. The corridor of densely connected metropolitan areas and surrounding hinterlands along the U.S. east coast from Maine to Virginia is the archetype of this type of unit: The Northeast Megaregion. The Northeast faces a unique set of policy challenges including: projections of a wetter, more extreme climate, aging and underfunded infrastructure and economically distressed rural areas. Megaregion-scale policy efforts such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and support for a regional food system have been recognized as strategic tools for climate change mitigation and adaptation, but decision-makers have limited information on the potential consequences of these strategies on the complex natural-human system of the Northeast, under various scenarios of global climate change. We have developed a Northeast Regional Earth System Model (NE-RESM) as a framework to provide this type of information. We integrate terrestrial ecosystem, hydrologic, energy system and economic models to investigate scenarios of paired regional socioeconomic pathways and global climate projections. Our initial results suggest that megaregion-scale strategic decisions in the Northeast may have important consequences for both local water management and global climate change mitigation.",

            "abstract": "The rapid physical and social changes currently underway in the Arctic - and changes in the way in which we study and manage the region - require coordinated research efforts to improve our understanding of the Arctic’s physical, biological, and social systems. At the same time, policy-makers and Arctic communities need decision-support tools and synthesized information to respond and adapt to the “new arctic”. There are enormous challenges, however, in collaboration among the disparate groups of people needed for such efforts. A carefully planned strategic approach is required to bridge the scientific disciplinary and organizational boundaries, foster cooperation between local communities and science programs, and effectively communicate between scientists and policy-makers. Efforts must draw on bodies of knowledge from project management, strategic planning, organizational development, group dynamics, and other fields. In addition, collaborations between scientific disciplines face challenges unique to scientific culture.\nThis poster presentation will discuss best practices of building and sustaining networks of people to catalyze successful cross-disciplinary activities. Specific examples and case studies – both successes and failures - will be presented that draw on several projects at the Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS; www.arcus.org), a nonprofit membership organization composed of universities and institutions that have a substantial commitment to research in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude of the isopycnal stirring coefficient ARedi is poorly constrained from data and varies greatly across Earth System Models. This paper documents the impact of such uncertainty on the oceanic carbon cycle. We compare six spatial representations of ARedi. Four constant values (400, 800, 1200 and 2400 m2/s) are used to explore the difference between using the low values found in many models and the higher values seen in observational estimates. Models are also run with two spatially dependent values of ARedi based on altimetry, one which captures the fully two-dimensional structure of the mixing coefficient, the other of which looks at the zonally averaged structure alone. Under global warming significant changes are seen in the biological pump in convective regions, but these changes are largely locally compensated by changes in preformed DIC. Instead, differences in anthropogenic uptake of carbon are largely centered in the tropics, and can be well described in terms of a relatively simple diffusive approximation. Using ideal age as a tracer can give insight into the expected behavior of the models. The rate of oceanic mixing represents a quantitatively significant uncertainty in future projections of the global carbon cycle, amounting to about 20% of the oceanic uptake.",

            "abstract": "Soils of the Arctic tundra near Barrow, Alaska are waterlogged and anoxic throughout most of the profile due to underlying permafrost. Microbial communities in these soils are adapted for the dominant anaerobic conditions and are capable of a surprising diversity of metabolic pathways. Anaerobic respiration in this environment warrants further study, particularly in the realm of electron cycling involving chlorine, which preliminary data suggest may play an important role in arctic anaerobic soil respiration. For decades, Cl was rarely studied outside of the context of solvent-contaminated sites due to the widely held belief that it is an inert element. However, Cl has increasingly become recognized as a metabolic player in microbial communities and soil cycling processes. Organic chlorinated compounds (Clorg) can be made by various organisms and used metabolically by others, such as serving as electron acceptors for microbes performing organohalide respiration. Sequencing our arctic soil samples has uncovered multiple genera of microorganisms capable of participating in many Cl-cycling processes including organohalide respiration, chlorinated hydrocarbon degradation, and perchlorate reduction. Metagenomic analysis of these soils has revealed genes for key enzymes of Cl-related metabolic processes such as dehalogenases and haloperoxidases, and close matches to genomes of known organohalide respiring microorganisms from the Dehalococcoides, Dechloromonas, Carboxydothermus, and Anaeromyxobacter genera. A TOX-100 Chlorine Analyzer was used to quantify total Cl in arctic soils, and these data were examined further to separate levels of inorganic Cl compounds and Clorg. Levels of Clorg increased with soil organic matter content, although total Cl levels lack this trend. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) was used to provide information on the structure of Clorg in arctic soils, showing great diversity with Cl bound to both aromatic and alkyl groups. Incubations were conducted in the laboratory providing arctic soils with Clorg, and measurements taken to assess rates of organohalide respiration show an increase in chloride production due to microbial activity. Investigating these soils with diverse techniques affirms the importance of Cl-cycling in a pristine arctic tundra ecosystem.",

This study focuses on enhancing spatiotemporal resolution of CO2, PM, and O3in near-surface (ground to 50m) air columns by using Arduino-based sensors. The city of Decatur, due to its proximity to the airport, is the study site for the investigation of target pollutant concentrations. The results of this study, combined with other metropolitan air quality data sets, can be used to verify projected trends and append seasonal data.

By combining the best features of these search algorithms in addition to a new algorithm developed over the past few years at UC, we have produced a second significant increase in the number of TGFs discovered, including more short events (< 100 microseconds) to which the previous algorithms were not as sensitive. We will report on the results and on the metrics we use to distinguish real events from instrumental artifacts and cosmic ray showers, both for a single TGF candidate and at the population level. Finally, we will report on the status of the RHESSI instrument after its fourth anneal to remove the effects of radiation damage, which took place in summer 2014.",

            "abstract": "Northeast Japan has an island arc structure where the Pacific plate subducts from the east. The helium isotope ratio is a good indicator to discriminate the origin of fluid carring helium, because the ratios in the mantle and crust are clearly different from each other. We performed a detailed study of helium isotope ratios in northeast Japan, and clarified the boundaries of the higher and lower helium isotope ratio distributions. The crustal components are dominant in the fore-arc region, whereas the mantle components dominate along the volcanic front and in the back-arc region. It is suggested that the clear contrast of the helium isotope ratio between the fore-arc and back-arc regions is due to the difference in whether helium isotope ratio of the wedge mantle or radiogenic helium-4 production rate in the crust. Specifically, we found the following characteristics; 1) comparison of the distribution between helium isotope ratios and faults revealed that the area along faults shows higher helium isotope ratios, 2) distribution of the helium isotope ratios is correlated with that of Li/Cl ratios which is the indicator of slab-derived water or magmatic water, suggesting that the mantle helium is transported by the slab-derived aqueous fluid. Important constraints on mantle helium upwelling are concluded as follows; a) the slab-derived water as the carrier of mantle helium, b) the faults, tectonic lines and volcanoes as the flow paths of slab-derived water, and c) crustal helium-4 contamination during upwelling process.\n*This research project has been conducted as the regulatory supporting research funded by the Secretariat of Nuclear Regulation Authority (Secretariat of NRA), Japan.",

            "abstract": "In wind energy applications the turbulent velocity field of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) is often characterised by Gaussian probability density functions. When estimating the dynamical loads on wind turbines this has been the rule more than anything else.\nFrom numerous studies in the laboratory, in Direct Numerical Simulations, and from in-situ measurements of the ABL we know, however, that turbulence is not purely Gaussian: the smallest and fastest scales often exhibit extreme behaviour characterised by strong non-Gaussian statistics.\nIn this contribution we want to investigate whether these non-Gaussian effects are important when determining wind turbine loads, and hence of utmost importance to the design criteria and lifetime of a wind turbine.\nWe devise a method based on Principal Orthogonal Decomposition where non-Gaussian velocity fields generated by high-resolution pseudo-spectral Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of the ABL are transformed so that they maintain the exact same second-order statistics including variations of the statistics with height, but are otherwise Gaussian. In that way we can investigate in isolation the question whether it is important for wind turbine loads to include non-Gaussian properties of atmospheric turbulence. As an illustration the Figure show both a non-Gaussian velocity field (left) from our LES, and its transformed Gaussian Counterpart (right). Whereas the horizontal velocity components (top) look close to identical, the vertical components (bottom) are not: the non-Gaussian case is much more fluid-like (like in a sketch by Michelangelo). The question is then: Does the wind turbine see this?\nUsing the load simulation software HAWC2 with both the non-Gaussian and newly constructed Gaussian fields, respectively, we show that the Fatigue loads and most of the Extreme loads are unaltered when using non-Gaussian velocity fields. The turbine thus acts like a low-pass filter which average out the non-Gaussian behaviour on time scales close to and faster than the revolution time of the turbine. For a few of the Extreme load estimations there is, on the other hand, a tendency that non-Gaussian effects increase the overall dynamical load, and hence can be of importance in wind energy load estimations.",

Recent seismic investigations have paid attention to this region, while we still can’t figure out the Moho depth as they give different results. To better understand the crustal structure in Northeast Tibet, our passive seismic experiment was carried out from Songpan-Ganzi block to Qilian block. After a series of data process on the receive function, we get a fine structure along this profile by joint inversion of receive function and surface wave with Bayesian Monte Carlo inversion. The final results show that the Moho depth uplifts from 65 km to 55 km from south to north, and there are double Moho reflections in the north. The crustal structure is various in Songpan-Ganzi block, Kunlun block and Qilian block, as the low velocity in middle and lower crust is remarkable beneath Songpan-Ganzi block, while there are no low velocity beneath Qilian block, which present the difference between plateau and surrounding regions, and indicate the lateral spreading of the Tibetan Plateau.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies for the period-dependent source characteristics of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (e.g., Koper et al., 2011; Lay et al., 2012) were based on the short and long period source models using different method. Kubo et al. (2013) obtained source models of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake using multi period-bands waveform data by a common inversion method and discussed its period-dependent source characteristics. In this study, to achieve more in detail spatiotemporal source rupture behavior of this event, we introduce a new fault surface model having finer sub-fault size and estimate the source models in multi period-bands using a Bayesian inversion method combined with a multi-time-window method.\nThree components of velocity waveforms at 25 stations of K-NET, KiK-net, and F-net of NIED are used in this analysis. The target period band is 10-100 s. We divide this period band into three period bands (10-25 s, 25-50 s, and 50-100 s) and estimate a kinematic source model in each period band using a Bayesian inversion method with MCMC sampling (e.g., Fukuda & Johnson, 2008; Minson et al., 2013, 2014). The parameterization of spatiotemporal slip distribution follows the multi-time-window method (Hartzell & Heaton, 1983). The Green's functions are calculated by the 3D FDM (GMS; Aoi & Fujiwara, 1999) using a 3D velocity structure model (JIVSM; Koketsu et al., 2012). The assumed fault surface model is based on the Pacific plate boundary of JIVSM and is divided into 384 subfaults of about 16 * 16 km^2.\nThe estimated source models in multi period-bands show the following source image: (1) First deep rupture off Miyagi at 0-60 s toward down-dip mostly radiating relatively short period (10-25 s) seismic waves. (2) Shallow rupture off Miyagi at 45-90 s toward up-dip with long duration radiating long period (50-100 s) seismic wave. (3) Second deep rupture off Miyagi at 60-105 s toward down-dip radiating longer period seismic waves then that of the first deep rupture. (4) Deep rupture off Fukushima at 90-135 s.\nThe dominant-period difference of the seismic-wave radiation between two deep ruptures off Miyagi may result from the mechanism that small-scale heterogeneities on the fault are removed by the first rupture. This difference can be also interpreted by the concept of multi-scale dynamic rupture (Ide & Aochi, 2005).",

            "abstract": "The origin of continental crust is still an unsolved mystery in the evolution of our planet. Although the best candidates to produce juvenile continental crust are intra-oceanic arcs these systems are dominated by basaltic lavas, and when silicic magmas are produced, the incompatible-element compositions are generally too depleted to be a good match for continental crust estimates. Others, such as the W. Aleutians, are dominated by andesitic melts with trace element compositions similar to average continental crust. In order to evaluate which intra-oceanic arcs produced modern continental crust, we developed a geochemical continental index (CI) through a statistical analysis that compared all available data from modern intra-oceanic arcs with global estimates of continental crust. Our results suggest that magmas from Costa Rica (<10 Ma) have a CI <50, closer to the CI (~20) computed from available average continental crust estimates. Transitional CI values of 50-100 were found in the Aleutians, the Iwo-Jima segment of Izu-Bonin, the L. Antilles, Panama, Nicaragua, and Vanuatu. The geochemical signature of the Costa Rican lavas is controlled by melts from the subducting Galapagos tracks. Iwo-Jima and Vanuatu are in a similar tectonic scenario with subducting intraplate seamounts. Melts from the subducting oceanic crust are thought to significantly control the geochemical signature in the W. Aleutians and Panama. In the L. Antilles and E. Aleutians the continental signature may reflect recycling of a component derived from subducting continental sediments. Most of Izu-Bonin, Marianas, S. Scotia and Tonga arcs with a CI >100 have the least continent-like geochemical signatures. In these arcs the subducting plate is old (>100 Ma), not overprinted by enriched intraplate volcanism and the geochemistry may be dominated by slab-derived, aqueous fluids. We also found a strong correlation between the CI and average crustal P-wave velocity, validating the geochemical index with the available seismic data for intra-oceanic arcs. In conclusion, the production of young continental crust with compositions similar to Archean continental crust is an unusual process, limited to locations where there are especially voluminous partial melts of oceanic crust.",

            "abstract": "Arctic tundra soils store large quantities of organic carbon that are susceptible to decomposition and release to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4. Decomposition rates are limited by cold temperatures and widespread anoxia; however, ongoing changes in soil temperature, thaw depth, and water saturation are expected to influence rates and pathways of organic matter decomposition. In order to predict greenhouse gas releases from high-latitude ecosystems, it is necessary to identify how geochemical factors (e.g. terminal electron acceptors, carbon substrates) influence CO2 and CH4 production in tundra soils. This study evaluates spatial patterns of aqueous geochemistry in the active layer of low- to high-centered polygons located at the Barrow Environmental Observatory in northern Alaska. Pore waters from saturated soils were low in sulfate and nitrate but contained abundant Fe which may serve a major terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic microbial metabolism. Relatively high concentrations of soluble Fe accumulated in the middle of the active layer near the boundary between the organic and mineral horizon, and we infer that Fe-oxide reduction and dissolution in the mineral horizon produced soluble Fe that diffused upwards and was stabilized by complexation with dissolved organic matter. Fe concentrations in the bulk soil were higher in organic than mineral horizons due to the presence of these organic-Fe complexes and Fe-oxide precipitates. Dissolved CH4 increased with increasing proportions of dissolved Fe(III) in saturated soils from transitional and low-centered polygons. The opposite trend was observed in drier soils from flat- and high-centered polygons where deeper oxidation fronts may inhibit methanogenesis. Using multiple spectroscopic and molecular methods (e.g. UV-Vis, Fourier transform infrared, ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry), we also observed that pore waters from the middle of the active layer contained more aromatic organics than in mineral soils near the permafrost boundary, where pore waters were depleted but soils were enriched with aromatic organic moieties. The geochemical depth gradients we document for tundra soils influence organic matter degradation and are pertinent for understanding C dynamics as thaw depth and duration increase in high-latitude soils.",

            "abstract": "The aerosol transports from China largely contribute to high PM (Particulate Matter) concentration in Korea. Especially, secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) such as nitrate, sulfate and ammonium are largely transported from China to Korea during haze event. The measured PM2.5 (Particle Matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5㎛) concentrations at the supersite monitoring stations in Korea are normally over 100 ug/m3 and SIAs are major chemical species with more than 70% of PM2.5 during the event. According to our air quality forecast model, sulfate concentrations are largely under-predicted in winter and slightly over-predicted in summer. Those discrepancies between model predicted and observed sulfate concentrations are mainly due to uncertainties of precursor emissions of NOx, SO2, and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) and chemical mechanism of the sulfate formation in the chemical forecast model of CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality Model).\nFormation of sulfate is chemically linked to primary emissions of sulfur dioxide and to be abundancy of atmospheric oxidants such as hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, ozone, methyl hydroperoxide, and peroxyacetic acid. All of these oxidant species are formed via photochemical reactions with NOx and VOCs.\nThe aim of this work is to investigate the dependency of sulfate formation on oxidant levels in winter and summer during episode event using CMAQ and its sulfate tracking probing tool. The sensitivity of the precursor emissions of SO2, NOx, VOCs and NH3 was also tested to understand the pathways of the sulfate formation.\nThe results show that long range transport from China is a major factor to determine sulfate level in Korea during haze events and dominant mechanisms in the sulfate formation are the gas-phase OH and aqueous phase H2O2 reactions. NOx-SO2-VOCs chemical regimes for the sulfate formation is the VOCs limited regimes in Korea. The further details of the sensitivity run of the precursor emissions and improvement in the sulfate prediction will be discussed in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "Sonic anemometry is fundamental to all eddy-covariance studies of surface energy and ecosystem carbon and water balance. While recent studies have shown that some anemometers underestimate vertical wind, we hypothesize that this is caused by the lack of transducer shadowing correction in non-orthogonal models. We tested this in an experiment comparing three sonic anemometer designs: orthogonal (O), non-orthogonal (NO), and quasi-orthogonal (QO); using four models: K-probe (O) and A-probe (NO) (Applied Technologies, Inc.) and CSAT3 (NO) and CSAT3V (QO) (Campbell Scientific, Inc.). For each of a 12-week experiment at the GLEES AmeriFlux site, five instruments from a pool of twelve (three of each model) were randomly selected and located around a control (CSAT3); mid-week all but the control were re-mounted horizontally. We used Bayesian analysis to test differences between models in half-hour standard deviations (σu, σv, σw, and σT), turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and the ratio between vertical/horizontal TKE (VHTKE). The K-probe experiences horizontal transducer shadowing which is effectively corrected using an established wind-tunnel derived algorithm. We constructed shadow correction algorithms for the NO/QO anemometers by applying the K-probe function to each non-orthogonal transducer pair (SC1) as well as a stronger correction of twice the magnitude (SC2). While the partitioning of VHTKE was higher in O than NO/QO anemometers, the application of SC1 explained 45-60% of this discrepancy while SC2 overcorrected it. During the horizontal manipulation changes in the NO/QO were moderate in σu (4-8% decrease), very strong in σv (9-11% decrease), and minimal in σw (-3 to 4% change) while only σu measurements changed (3% decrease) with the K-probe. These changes were predicted by both shadow correction algorithms, with SC2 better explaining the data. This confirms our hypothesis while eliminating others that attribute the underestimate to a systematic bias in the w-axis. All flux sites that employ these non-orthogonal sonic anemometers will underestimate vertical fluxes of mass and energy, but since 1) the correction is a function both of sensor geometry and local wind and 2) the true shadow correction function is unknown at this time, the actual underestimate is uncertain and will vary between sites.",

            "abstract": "Loess deposits in the sedimentary record of the Late Paleozoic tropics are anomalous because Quaternary loess is commonly glaciogenic, and thus confined to mid-high latitudes. The only loess in the tropics today is associated with mountain glaciation. Given the icehouse conditions of the Late Paleozoic, tropical loess could perhaps reflect sourcing from glaciogenic weathering in the Central Pangaean Mountains. Our goals are to constrain spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric “dustiness” and loess/dust provenance. To test the glacial weathering hypothesis and evaluate loess provenance, we collected preliminary data from two intervals (Moscovian or middle Pennsylvanian) of the Copacabana Formation, Madre de Dios Basin (Bolivia). Two 15-m sections representing carbonate inner platform environments were processed to separate the fine-grained silicate mineral fraction (SMF). Given the proximity to arc volcanism, ash fall could complicate the wind-blown weathering signal; initial work is aimed at assessing the volcanic versus continental inputs to the basin. Visual inspection and initial physical - chemical measurements of the dust-loess size fraction indicates discrete differences between the two sections, as well as between ash-rich and ash-poor intervals. The lower section has intervals with up to 72% suspected ash and SMF (non-ash) of 1-7%. The suspected ash layers in the lower section have higher grain sizes (20-40 µm) and distinct 143Nd/144Nd isotopic compositions (εNd = -3.5, -3.8) compared to the ash-poor intervals (8 µm, εNd = -5.0 to -8.8). The upper section, free of visible ash layers, has high SMF (mean 4-7% up to 41%) with similar size distributions (6-11 µm) and εNd (-7.4 to -7.7) to the lower section, but more radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr compositions (0.797 versus 0.71 - 0.75). The distinct physical and isotopic characteristics of the ash and SMF in the sections and sub-intervals suggests that deconvolving ash and loess/dust inputs will be possible using isotopic means and that we will be able to assess variability in loess/dust provenance that might ultimately help address the genesis of this voluminous loess.",

            "abstract": "Development in coastal tropical watersheds (especially unpaved roads) has led to increased turbidity and runoff of land-based sediment into coastal bays with coral reefs. Unlike other threats to coral reefs, land-based sedimentation can be managed locally through sound watershed management practices. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of watershed restoration projects or track how future watershed building or changing climate affect land-based sedimentation, it is necessary to adapt monitoring approaches that will effectively capture marine sediment dynamics at appropriate temporal and spatial scales.\nSince 2007 we’ve monitored rainy-season sedimentation (tube sediment traps) and turbidity (TSS) (26-day intervals) in eastern St. John, USVI. More recently (2013-14) we added SedPods and a program of terrestrial-marine integrated monitoring including shoreline runoff (stream and crest gauges) and current meters and nephelometers, which measure sediment deposition, turbidity, and hydrographic parameters at minute resolution. Our 15 shoreline and reef sites are below developed and undeveloped “reference” watersheds and ARRA-funded watershed restoration projects completed in 2011. Through examples from our study, we will compare monitoring approaches and share lessons learned.\nOur sediment trap data resolved greater mean terrigenous accumulation below developed compared to undeveloped watersheds, increases in terrigenous accumulation in response to storm events, and reductions in terrigenous accumulation following watershed restoration during storms. However, they lacked the temporal resolution to capture the sedimentary response to ephemeral runoff or re-suspension events. They also dampen short-term acute sedimentation events that have the greatest impact on coral condition. Based on our studies, we recommend: a) monitoring over periods which capture the natural variability of the system; b) combining time-averaged approaches (long term [core], gross [sed. traps] and net [SedPods] deposition) that provide sample material, with high temporal-resolution instrumentation (nephelometers and current meters); c) integrated monitoring of the watershed-bay-coral reef by an inter-disciplinary team of experts working together; and d) community participation.",

            "abstract": "Disaster-causing natural hazards such as floods, erosions, earthquakes or slope failures were particularly observed to be concentrated in certain geographical regions. In the Asia-pacific region, coastal ecosystems were suffering because of perennial threats driven by chronic fluctuations in climate variability (e.g., typhoons, ENSO), or by dynamically occurring events (e.g., earthquakes, tsunamis). Among the many people that were found prone to such a risky condition were the ones inhabiting near the coastal areas. Characteristically, aside from being located at the forefront of these events, the coastal communities have impacted the resource by the kind of behavioral patterns they exhibited, such as overdependence and overexploitation to achieve their wellbeing. In this paper, we introduce the development of an approach to an assessment of the coupled human- environment using a multi- agent simulation (MAS) model known as Coastal Vulnerability Dynamic Simulator (COVUDS). The COVUDS comprised a human- environmental platform consisting multi- agents with corresponding spatial- based dynamic and static variables. These variables were used to present multiple hypothetical future situations that contribute to the purpose of supporting a more rational management of the coastal ecosystem and their environmental equities. Initially, we present the theoretical and conceptual components that would lead to the development of the COVUDS. These consisted of the human population engaged in behavioral patterns affecting the conditions of coastal ecosystem services; the system of the biophysical environment and changes in patches brought by global environment and local behavioral variations; the policy factors that were important for choosing area- specific interventions; and the decision- making mechanism that integrates the first three components. To guide a future scenario-based application that will be undertaken in a coastal area in the Philippines, the components of the model will be presented within a platform following a parameterized architecture.",

Precipitation and its future change over the TP pose a large socio-economic impact on the surrounding nations. Using multiple precipitation datasets and CMIP5 model simulations, summer (June to September) precipitation over the TP and Indian continent is investigated. We note a close linkage of rainfall over the southwestern Tibetan Plateau (SWTP) and central-eastern India. Such a linkage is maintained by frequent propagation of convective systems from northern Indian lower lands over the high mountain range into SWTP. An objective propagation identification method suggests such propagation contributes nearly half of the total summer rainfall in SWTP. The propagation is prominent from late June to mid-September. Its occurrence is rather stable and appears not to be strongly modulated by Indian monsoon strength. The propagation also modifies the rainfall diurnal cycle with a second peak near midnight in addition to the late afternoon peak induced by localized convective systems. Favorable environmental conditions for propagations are also explored.",

            "abstract": "Surge-type glaciers are very important to understanding of glacier dynamics and mass balance. They generally experience well-defined cyclical non-steady flow, with alternation between short active phases (months to years) and a longer quiescent phase (years to decades). Previous studies reported that most of surge-type glaciers in the High Asian Mountain were detected in the Himalayas and Karakoram, however, few studies were carried out in the central Tibetan Plateau (TP).\nThis study is focused on identification and characteristics of surge-type glaciers by using satellite InSAR technique on the Puruogangri Ice Field (PIF) in the central TP, the largest modern ice field over the TP. Firstly, a very high-resolution DEM was retrieved by applying bi-static InSAR to a pair of TerraSAR-X/Tandem-X data in 2012, then elevation changes were estimated by subtracting SRTM-X DEM (2000) from it. Secondly, bi-temporal surface velocities were measured by D-InSAR technique with a pair of ERS tandem data in 1996 and a pair of ALOS PALSAR data in 2009.\nThe preliminary results of elevation changes show that a significant thickness increase of approximate 70 meters was detected at terminus of the glacier (WGMS id: 5Z213E0012) between 2000 and 2012. In particular, an analysis of glacier elevation changes with altitude exhibits that this glacier experienced a surging before 2012. Moreover, the results of surface velocity demonstrate that the ice-flow velocity amplitude of this glacier was relatively slow with average values of about 3.5 m/yr in 1996 and 3.0 m/yr in 2009. A synergistic analysis of the changes in elevation and velocity infers that the glacier surge event might occur between 1996 and 2009. But at the present we could not make sure of its exactly active and quiescent phase, and further studies are required.",

            "abstract": "The basic physics of a glacier's response to small perturbations in climate forcing is of longstanding and intrinsic interest in glaciology, and it is also of some applied importance for predicting future glacier change and for inferring the climate history that drove past glacier fluctuations. In order to understand the fundamental parameters governing glacier advance and retreat, and also the spectral properties of fluctuations in glacier length in response to noisy weather, we examine outputs of a numerical flowline model solving the shallow-ice equations with sliding. The numerical results reveal a surprising simplicity: the time evolution and spectral shape of glacier\nexcursions depend on a single parameter, a time constant determined by the geometrical properties of the glacier. Furthermore, the numerical results reveal that perturbations in mass balance over the glacier surface set in motion a sequence of events that can be roughly described as occurring in three overlapping stages: (1) changes in interior thickness drive (2) changes in terminus flux, which in turn drive (3) changes in glacier length. A simple, third-order linear differential equation, which extends previous models in the literature, successfully captures these important features of the glacier flow. This three-stage linear model is readily invertible to recover climate history. It provides clear physical insight and analytical expressions for some important metrics of glacier behavior, such as variance, sensitivity and excursion probabilities. Finally, it facilitates uncertainty analysis. The linear model can also be\nadapted for arbitrary catchment geometry, and is applied to Nigardsbreen, Norway.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric Rivers (ARs), the large plumes of moisture transported from the tropics, impact many aspects of society in the Western U.S. When ARs make landfall, they are often associated with torrential rains, swollen rivers, flash flooding, and mudslides. We demonstrate that by viewing precipitation events associated with ARs as \"objects\", calculating their physical characteristics (mean intensity (mm/hr), speed (km/hr), etc.), assigning environmental characteristics (e.g. phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation) for each system, and then performing empirical analyses, we can reveal interactions between different climate phenomena. To perform this analysis, we use a unique object oriented data set based on the gridded, satellite precipitation data from the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) algorithm known as PERSIANN-CONNECT, for the period 3/2000 to 12/2010. The data is segmented into 4D objects (longitude, latitude, time and intensity). Each of the segmented precipitation systems is described by over 72 characteristics. A search of the PERSIANN-CONNECT database for all Western U.S. large-scale precipitation systems returns 626 systems. Out of the 626 large-scale precipitation systems, 200 occurred at the same time as documented Western U.S. land falling ARs (a list of ARs provided by Dr. Martin Ralph). Here we report the physical and environmental characteristics for these 200 storms including a comparison to the 426 non-AR storms. We also report results of an analysis of the δ18O measurements collected from Giant Forest, Sequoia National Park in the Southwestern Sierra Nevada Mountains (McCabe-Glynn et al., in prep.) for the 200 AR precipitation systems. For an overall assessment of the impacts of climate variability on all 626 precipitation systems, we focus on ENSO, and show that during El Nino/La Nina, as compared with Neutral phases of ENSO, the systems are larger (9505, 9097, vs. 6075km^3), faster (44.6, 46.9 vs. 43.7km/hr), longer lasting (62.7,62.1 vs. 54.4hr), and begin slightly further East (153.5,152.7 vs. 148.7W) in the Pacific Ocean.",

            "abstract": "The spectacular lightning strokes observed during eruptions testify to the enormous potentials that can be generated within plumes. Related to the charging of individual ash particles, large electric fields and volcanic lightning have been observed at Eyjafjallajokull, Redoubt, and Sakurajima, among other volcanoes. A number of mechanisms have been proposed for plume electrification, including charging from the brittle failure of rock, charging due to phase change as material is carried aloft, and triboelectric charging, also known as contact charging. While the first two mechanisms (fracto-emission and volatile charging) have been described by other authors (James et al, 2000 and McNutt et al., 2010, respectively), the physics of tribocharging--charging related to the collisions of particles--of ash are still relatively unknown.\nBecause the electric fields and lightning present in volcanic clouds result from the multiphase dynamics of the plume itself, understanding the electrodynamics of these systems may provide a way to detect eruptions and probe the interior of plumes remotely. In the present work, we describe two sets of experiments designed to explore what controls the exchange of charge during particle collisions. We employ natural material from Colima, Mt. Saint Helens, and Tungurahua.\nOur experiments show that the magnitude and temporal behavior of ash charging depend on a number of factors, including particle size, shape, chemistry, and collisional energy. The first set of experiments were designed to determine the time-dependent electrostatic behavior of a parcel of ash. These experiments consist of fluidizing an ash bed and monitoring the current induced in a set of ring electrodes. As such, we are able to extract charging rates for ash samples driven by different flow rates. The second experimental setup allows us to measure how much charge is exchanged during a single particle-particle collision. Capable of measuring charges as small as 1 fC, this device allows us to methodically to characterize charges on particles with diameters down to 100 microns. Employing this instrument, we quantify the effect of particle pre-charging, mineralogy, and impact energy on the charge exchange between two colliding particles.",

            "abstract": "On October 15th 2006, two large earthquakes (Kiholo Bay, M­­w = 6.7 and Mahukona, M­­w = 6.0) occurred below the northwest coast of the Big Island of Hawaii in a region that has not been typically associated with large earthquakes. While the 2006 earthquakes occurred only ~28 km and six minutes apart in space and time, their distinct focal mechanisms and source depths (~40 km and 20 km, respectively) suggest an interesting main shock-aftershock association. These two mantle (non-volcanic) earthquakes in Hawaii provide a rare opportunity to investigate lithospheric stresses associated with long-term flexural loading. Here, we use GPS observations and a semi-analytic dislocation model to estimate the co-seismic and post-seismic slip of these two events. For the Kiholo Bay event, we find that 0.5 m of net slip, occurring between 39 - 51 km depth on a nearly 30 km east-west striking fault that dips south at 45°, fits the data well with an RMS residual of 0.87 mm (~10 % of the observed maximum surface displacement). This geodetically estimated fault attitude matches with one of the nodal planes in the Global CMT catalog. Furthermore, positive Coulomb stress changes are predicted in the Mahukona source region due to the Kiholo Bay mainshock, suggesting an elastic stress triggering relationship. GPS time-series data will be used to investigate possible postseismic viscoelastic relaxation by mantle flow in response to these coseismic stress changes.",

            "abstract": "It is critically important to determine how extreme precipitation events may be altered in a changing climate. We present recent research to develop an atmospheric river (AR) detection algorithm to investigate the downstream modulation of the eastern North Pacific ARs by another weather extreme, the East Asian cold surge (EACS), in both reanalysis data and high-resolution global model simulations. It is shown that following the peak of an EACS, atmospheric disturbances of intermediate frequency (IF; 10–30 day period) are excited downstream. This leads to the formation of a persistent cyclonic circulation anomaly over the eastern North Pacific that dramatically enhances the AR occurrence probability and the surface precipitation over the western U.S. between 30°N and 50°N. A diagnosis of the local geopotential height tendency further confirms the essential role of IF disturbances in establishing the observed persistent anomaly. This downstream modulation effect is then examined in the two simulations of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and U.S. Dept. of Energy Community Climate System Model version 4 with different horizontal resolutions (T85 and T341) for the same present-day period (1979–2005). The connection between EACS and AR is much better captured by the T341 version of the model, mainly due to a better representation of the scale interaction and the characteristics of IF atmospheric disturbances in the higher-resolution model. The findings here suggest that faithful representations of scale interaction in a global model are critical for modeling and predicting the occurrences of hydrological extremes in the western U.S. and for understanding their potential future changes.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater management and remediation requires the implementation of numerical models in order to evaluate the potential anthropogenic impacts on aquifer systems. In many situations, the numerical model must, not only be able to simulate groundwater flow and transport, but also geochemical and biological processes. Each process being simulated carries with it a set of parameters that must be identified, along with differing potential sources of model-structure error. Various data types are often collected in the field and then used to calibrate the numerical model; however, these data types can represent very different processes and can subsequently be sensitive to the model parameters in extremely complex ways. Therefore, developing an appropriate weighting strategy to address the contributions of each data type to the overall least-squares objective function is not straightforward. This is further compounded by the presence of potential sources of model-structure errors that manifest themselves differently for each observation data type. Finally, reactive transport models are highly nonlinear, which can lead to convergence failure for algorithms operating on the assumption of local linearity. In this study, we propose a variation of the popular, particle swarm optimization algorithm to address trade-offs associated with the calibration of one data type over another. This method removes the need to specify weights between observation groups and instead, produces a multi-dimensional Pareto front that illustrates the trade-offs between data types. We use the PEST++ run manager, along with the standard PEST input/output structure, to implement parallel programming across multiple desktop computers using TCP/IP communications. This allows for very large swarms of particles without the need of a supercomputing facility. The method was applied to a case study in which modeling was used to gain insight into the mobilization of arsenic at a deepwell injection site. Multiple data types (e.g., hydrochemical, geophysical, tracer, temperature, etc.) were collected prior to, and during an injection trial. Visualizing the trade-off between the calibration of each data type has provided the means of identifying some model-structure deficiencies.",

            "abstract": "Temperature increase under climate change is expected to affect photosynthesis of tree species. Biochemical models generally suggest that the elevated temperature increases the photosynthetic carbon fixation, however, many opposing results were reported as well. We aimed to examine the photosynthetic responses of four coniferous seedlings to projected future temperature increase, by conducting an open-field warming experiment. Experimental warming set-up using infra-red heater was built in 2011 and the temperature in warming plots has been regulated to be consistently 3oC higher than that of control plots. The seeds of Abies holophylla (AH), A. koreana (AK), Pinus densiflora (PD), and P. koraiensis (PK) were planted in each 1 m × 1 m plot (n=3) in April, 2012. Monthly net photosynthetic rates (Pn; µmol CO2 m-2 s-1) of 1-year-old seedlings (n=9) from June to November, 2013 were measured using CIRAS-2 (PP-Systems, UK) and photosynthetic parameters (the apparent quantum yield; ф; µmol CO2 mol-1, the dark respiration rate; Rd; µmol CO2 mol-1, and the light compensation point; LCP; µmol mol-1 s-1) were also calculated from the light-response curve of photosynthesis in August, 2013. Chlorophyll contents were measured using DMSO extraction method. Monthly Pn was generally higher for PD and decreased for AK in warmed plots than in control plots (Fig. 1). Pn of AK and PK did not show any significant difference, however, Pn of PK in October and November increased by experimental warming. Pn of PD also showed the highest increase in November and this distinct increase of Pn in autumn might be caused by delayed cessation of photosynthesis by temperature elevation. ф and Rd in warmed plots were higher for PD and lower for AK, while LCP did not significantly differ by treatments for all species. Because ф is considered to be related to the efficiency of harvesting and using light, the change in ф might have caused the response of Pn to warming in this study. Decreases in chlorophyll contents resulted from heat stress were observed for PD and PK. We found the species-specific responses of Pn related to the change in photosynthetic parameters following experimental warming of four 1-year-old coniferous seedlings.",

Global Lightning and Sprite Measurements from ISS is a mission to observe lightning and sprite from CMOS camera, Photometer, VLF and VHF interferometeric measurements as a part of the multi-mission consolidated equipment on Japanese Exposure Module. In this mission, CMOS cameras measure the optical emissions from sprite at 762 nm and lightning at 740-830 nm in order to discriminate lightning and sprite signals. Photometeric measurements at six channels (150-280 nm , 337+/-5 nm, 762+/-5 nm, 600-900 nm, 316+/-5 nm, 392+/-5 nm) also provide information on the detection and identification of sprite and lightning process. From these measurements, global distribution of sprite has been derived and some implications to discriminate ground and cloud flashes from space borne platforms are presented. VLFR measurements on GLIMS adds information on the charge moment of the parent lightning based on the whistler wave of the VLF waves that the lightning generates. While VLF observation does not locate the sources of the radiation, VLFR serves an important role as a bridge in coupling the occurrence of TLEs to lightning. The VHF measurements consists of two antennas and from this observation with photometric measurements, location of VHF emission from lightning from space station was successful for the first time. In this presentation, mission overview and some scientific results are briefly summarized using these equipments.",

            "abstract": "Ultramafic bodies ranging from <1 to 2500 m in length occur in multiple settings across the northern part of the Nason Terrane in the North Cascade Mountains of Washington State. Within the Wenatchee Ridge Orthogneiss (WRO) the bodies are approximately equidimensional, ranging from dm-scale metasomatized lenses up to an exposed diameter of (typically) approximately 40 m. Some bodies are completely serpentinized, but others include dunite, harzburgite, and rare seams of pyroxenite. Many are rimmed by blackwall (talc, phlogopite, tremolite, chlorite, serpentine) coinciding with the Late Cretaceous metamorphism. The Napeequa Ultramafic Body (NUB), cut through and well exposed by the Napeequa River west of Lake Wenatchee, is within the White River Shear Zone (WRSZ, Magloughlin & McEwan, 1988). Though highly variable, it consists of dunite and peridotite and is variably serpentinized with common Mg-amphibole. Assemblages include serp+carb+chl+talc+opq and suggest upper greenschist to low amphibolite facies overprinting. Rare high-strain zones resemble relict pseudotachylyte veins. More common are ultramylonitic zones with olivine grain sizes of <5 microns, suggesting terrane-boundary paleostresses of >250 MPa.\nThe Nine Mile Creek Ultramafic Body (NMCUB) and Grave Ultramafic Body (GUB) are the largest bodies outside of the White River Shear Zone, and are approximately 300 m and 800 long, respectively. Both are characterized by ol+talc+amph along with chlorite pseudomorphs, commonly cut by <40 micron thick ribbons of calcite, and rarely containing Si defined by chromite. These tectonites contain fine-grained olivine, but post-deformational, metamorphic cummingtonite and tremolite. In both bodies, a moderate to strong foliation is developed. It is suggested both bodies are retrogressed garnet peridotites.\nAn interesting problem is why the possible retrogressed garnet peridotite bodies are present south of the WRSZ and surrounded by the metatonalites of the WRO, but none are present within the WRSZ. The extreme variability of the ultramafic bodies south of the WRSZ, and their presence within the WRO pluton, suggests a possible stoping mechanism from a heterogeneous ultramafic-rich sole of the WRSZ, or a possibly now-eroded splay of that shear zone.",

The corresponding thermal bremsstrahlung emission was deduced on the basis of the temperature and column density values given by the SDO Differential Emission Messure (DEM) method. Then we obtained the non-thermal gyrosynchrotron emission profile by removing the thermal contribution from the NORH data at 17/34 GHz. We find that there was a dimming region at the cusp of the flare loop, corresponding to a maximum of hard X-ray emission observed by RHESSI, possibly caused by the presence of a magnetic null at the loop cusp. In addition, we also discovered several local maximum of microwave emission (termed as microwave islands) in the corona, possibly emitted by energetic electrons accelerated and confined within magnetically-closed structures (e.g., magnetic islands formed by magnetic reconnections). This is the first time such microwave features was reported.",

The data is cross -correlated to create time-distance impulse responses of wave propagation in the plasma. We focus on imaging the f-mode (surface gravity mode), which is separated from the other modes by k-ω filtering.\nRecent developments for surface wave imaging in earth-seismology include the development of an eikonal tomography technique. Eikonal tomography relies on evaluation of the local spatial derivatives of a traveltime surface to directly infer the slowness of wave-propagation.\nWhereas earth-seismology relies on increasing high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by cross-correlating long-time series, helioseismology relies on stacking over geometrically similar virtual sources. We assume there are two symmetries in the geometry of virtual sources around a sunspot. The first is a radial symmetry centered at the sunspot. The second is a radial symmetry of propagation around each virtual source. Because we are interested in the effect of sunspots on wave-propagation, we keep the averaging along the second symmetry axis to a minimum, and rely heavily on averaging each virtual source with equal distance from the sunspot.\nWe will investigate the spatial variation of f-mode dispersion in a radial geometry with the sunspot at the center by creating f-mode velocity maps at different frequencies.",

            "abstract": "The investigation of ion escape fluxes from Mars, resulting from the solar wind interaction with its upper atmosphere/ionosphere, is important due to its potential impact on the long-term evolution of Mars atmosphere (e.g., loss of water) over its history. In the present work, we adopt the 3-D Mars cold neutral atmosphere profiles (0 ~ 300 km) from the newly developed and validated Mars Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (M-GITM) and the 3-D hot oxygen profiles (100 km ~ 5 RM) from the exosphere Monte Carlo model Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (AMPS). We apply these 3-D model output fields into the 3-D BATS-R-US Mars multi-fluid MHD (MF-MHD) model (100 km ~ 20 RM) that can simulate the interplay between Mars upper atmosphere and solar wind by considering the dynamics of individual ion species. The multi-fluid MHD model solves separate continuity, momentum and energy equations for each ion species (H+, O+, O2+, CO2+). The M-GITM model together with the AMPS exosphere model take into account the effects of solar cycle and seasonal variations on both cold and hot neutral atmospheres. This feature allows us to investigate the corresponding effects on the Mars upper atmosphere ion escape by using a one-way coupling approach, i.e., both the M-GITM and AMPS model output fields are used as the input for the multi-fluid MHD model and the M-GITM is used as input into the AMPS exosphere model.\nIn this study, we present M-GITM, AMPS, and MF-MHD calculations (1-way coupled) for 2.5 GYA conditions and/or extreme solar conditions for present day Mars (high solar wind velocities, high solar wind dynamic pressure, and high solar irradiance conditions, etc.). Present day extreme conditions may result in MF-MHD outputs that are similar to 2.5 GYA cases. The crustal field orientations are also considered in this study. By comparing estimates of past ion escape rates with the current ion loss rates to be returned by the MAVEN spacecraft (2013-2016), we can better constrain the total ion loss to space over Mars history, and thus enhance the science returned from the MAVEN mission.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the influence of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the summer mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region of the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Analyses use the observed satellite temperature datasets from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument between 2002 and 2013, the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) between 2004 and 2013, and an ensemble of transient simulations from the Whole Atmospheric Community Climate Model version 3.5 (WACCM3.5) between 1953 and 2005. Significant temperature responses to ENSO are observed by SABER and MLS in the SH summer polar MLT region, characterized by an anomalous cooling in the upper mesosphere and an anomalous warming in the lower thermosphere in December and January during warm ENSO events. The observational patterns agree well with those in the WACCM simulations except that the observational magnitudes are clearly ~5 times stronger than model simulations. Analysis of the WACCM simulations indicates the following mechanism. The cooler temperatures in the tropical stratosphere associated with warm ENSO events affect the temperature gradient in the summer hemisphere leading to anomalous stratospheric easterly zonal wind in the SH high latitudes. The anomalous filtering of gravity waves (GWs) by the enhanced stratospheric easterly zonal wind in the SH high latitudes contributes to an anomalous eastward GW forcing in the SH upper mesosphere during warm ENSO events. Stronger forcing of the residual circulation enhances upwelling in the SH polar upper mesosphere and therefore cooler temperatures. This temperature anomaly in the SH summer upper mesosphere may impact the inter-annual variability in the formation of polar mesospheric clouds.",

            "abstract": "It is observationally known that the plasma density and temperature in plasma sheet are significantly changed by solar wind conditions [e.g., Terasawa et al., 1997]. Thus it is considered that the plasma sheet plasma is originated from the solar wind, and several entry mechanisms have been suggested. When the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is southward, the solar wind plasma enters the plasma sheet mainly through magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause. In contrast, for the northward IMF, the double-lobe reconnection [Song et al., 1999], abnormal diffusion [Johnson and Cheng., 1997], and plasma mixing through the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability caused by viscous interaction [Hasegawa et al., 2004] have been proposed. Relative contribution of each process is, however, far from understood.\nIn the present study, we use magnetotail observations by the Geotail spacecraft at radial distances of 10-32 Re during 12-year period from 1995 to 2006 to investigate properties of the plasma sheet. We conducted a statistical analysis with calibrated LEP-EA [Mukai et al., 1994] ion and electron data. We selected central plasma sheet observations and derived electron and ion temperature and density using the same method and criteria as Terasawa et al. [1997]. In addition, OMNI solar-wind data are used. The results show that the plasma sheet density (both ion and electron temperatures) has a good correlation with the solar wind density (kinetic energy) over the whole solar cycle. We find clear dawn-dusk asymmetry in the temperature ratio Ti/Te, i.e., the average Ti/Te is higher on the duskside than the dawn. The density also shows the dawn-dusk asymmetry and higher on the duskside than on the dawnside. A previous study by Wang et al. [2012] showed that Ti/Te is high (typically 5-10) in the magnetosheath. The statistical results, therefore, suggest that the shocked solar wind plasma can easily enter the duskside plasma sheet rather than the dawnside. We will discuss the possible mechanisms of the entry of the cold plasma into the duskside plasma sheet.",

            "abstract": "The El Nino-South Oscillation (ENSO) is an important phenomenon occurring every 3-7 years in the tropical Pacific Ocean and plays a role in the regional and global climate changeThe conventional El Nino is characterized by the maximum sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies located at the eastern tropical Pacific. Recent studies have suggested that a different type of El Nino, characterized by a westward shift of the maximum SST anomalies to the central Pacific and thus called central Pacific (CP) El Nino, has occurred more frequently since 1990s and has different weather /climate impacts on the countries surrounding the Pacific However, the mechanism of this decadal change of El Nino is still elusive. In this study, we first report evidence that the tide energy has decreased over the past several decades as observed by the tidal stations at western Pacific, which is consistent with the weakening of the lunar tidal forcing during the same period as determined by the relative position of the moon, the earth and the sun. We then hypothesize that the decrease of tidal energy is responsible for the more frequent occurrence of CP El Nino through the role of tidal mixing in the ocean during the past several decades. The GFDL coupled model is employed to test this hypothesis through sensitivity experiments on the change of tidal mixing. The experimental results as well as the corresponding analysis demonstrate that the weakening of the tidal mixing does lead to the more frequent occurrence of CP El Nino. This finding makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the mechanism of decadal variability of El Nino observed in recent decades and the future projection of the decadal change of El Nino.",

            "abstract": "Magnetopause shadowing is regarded as one of the major reasons for the loss of relativistic radiation belt electrons, although this has not yet been fully validated by observations. Previous simulations on this process assumed that all of the electrons encountering the magnetopause are simply lost into the magnetosheath just as ring current ions can be and did not examine details of the particle dynamics across and inside the magnetopause which has a finite thickness. In this paper, we perform test particle orbit calculations based on a simplified one-dimensional magnetopause model to demonstrate specifically how relativistic electrons arriving at the prenoon side of the magnetopause can be lost. The calculation results indicate that the loss process is determined by two factors: (i) a gradient of the magnetic field magnitude, B, along the magnetopause and (ii) a component of themagnetic field normal to the magnetopause. First, without a normal component of the magnetic field as in a tangential discontinuity, electrons can cross the magnetopause by the magnetic gradient drift motion due to the existence of B-gradient along the magnetopause. However, this process is not too strong in the sense that electrons have to drift rather a long distance along the magnetopause before entering the magnetosheath unless the B-gradient along the magnetopause is unusually strong, or the particle energy is very high like above 3 MeV. In contrast, if a normal component of the magnetic field exists inside the magnetopause, as in a rotational discontinuity, electrons can cross the magnetopause far more easily along the guided field line inside the magnetopause. This is effective for even a very small magnitude of normal component field such as somewhat less than 1 nT regardless of its direction and for a rather low energy of particles such as 0.5 MeV. Also, the loss occurs over more than half of the pitch angle domain, i.e., in the range between ~80° and 180° or 0° and ~100°, depending on the direction of normal component. Therefore, we suggest that radiation belt electron loss by the magnetopause shadowing process can be substantial (or can be effective) when a substantial area of the magnetopause is given a finite normal magnetic field component as well as B-gradient along the magnetopause.",

            "abstract": "We present a multi-scale scheme for full elastic waveform-difference inversion. Using a wavelet transform proves to be a key factor to mitigate cycle-skipping effects. We start with coarse representations of the seismogram to correct a large-scale background model, and subsequently explain the residuals in the fine scales of the seismogram to map the heterogeneities with great complexity. We have previously applied the multi-scale approach successfully to body waves generated in a standard model from the exploration industry: a modified two-dimensional elastic Marmousi model. With this model we explored the optimal choice of wavelet family, number of vanishing moments and decomposition depth. For this presentation we explore the sensitivity of surface waves in waveform-difference tomography. The incorporation of surface waves is rife with cycle-skipping problems compared to the inversions considering body waves only. We implemented an envelope-based objective function probed via a multi-scale wavelet analysis to measure the distance between predicted and target surface-wave waveforms in a synthetic model of heterogeneous near-surface structure. Our proposed method successfully purges the local minima present in the waveform-difference misfit surface. An elastic shallow model with 100~m in depth is used to test the surface-wave inversion scheme. We also analyzed the sensitivities of surface waves and body waves in full waveform inversions, as well as the effects of incorrect density information on elastic parameter inversions. Based on those numerical experiments, we ultimately formalized a flexible scheme to consider both body and surface waves in adjoint tomography.

            "abstract": "Large number of recent studies has demonstrated strong anomalies in the low-latitude ionosphere during sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW) that occur primarily during the northern winter period (December-February). Such events occurred with unusually high frequency during the last decade, making it possible to take advantage of increasingly available GPS TEC data to make significant progress in studies of atmosphere-ionosphere coupling. We focus on the American longitudinal sector, where good quality GPS TEC data is available for extended period of time, and examine three wintertime (November – February) periods marked by major sudden stratospheric warmings, 2005/06, 2008/09, and 2012/13. The selected events represent wide variety of stratospheric and geophysical conditions, including a vortex-shift (wave 1) SSW during solar minimum (2005/06), vortex-split (wave 2) SSW during extreme solar minimum (2008/09), and vortex-split (wave 2) SSW during moderate-to-high solar activity. To clearly separate ionospheric anomalies associated with SSW from other types of variations, we also examine the winter of 2006/07, which was characterized by less disturbed middle atmosphere. Comparison of ionospheric disturbances for three SSW cases shows remarkably consistent response to all events, albeit with varying magnitude. This response has primarily a tidal character and lasts for extended period of time. WACCM-X simulations of these events demonstrate amplification in global tidal energy for all major tides (diurnal, semidiurnal, terdiurnal), with strongest enhancement of semidiurnal tide.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of seismic anisotropy such as shear wave splitting are commonly used to constrain deformation in the upper mantle; however, observations of anisotropy at mid-mantle depths are relatively sparse. In this study we probe the anisotropic structure of the mid-mantle (transition zone and uppermost lower mantle) in the northwest Pacific (Japan and Izu-Bonin) and South America subduction systems. We present source-side shear wave splitting measurements for direct teleseismic S phases from seismic sources deeper than 350km that have been corrected for the effects of upper mantle anisotropy beneath the receiver. In each region, splitting as large as 1 sec is consistently observed, indicative of seismic anisotropy at mid-mantle depths. Clear splitting of phases originating from depths as great as 600km argues for a contribution from anisotropy in the uppermost lower mantle, as well as the transition zone. Beneath Japan, fast splitting directions are perpendicular or oblique to the slab strike (opposite of what is observed in the shallower sub-slab mantle) and do not appear to depend on the propagation direction of the waves. Beneath South America, splitting directions vary from trench-parallel to trench-perpendicular and depend on propagation direction (that is, whether the shear waves travel in an up-dip or down-dip direction). This difference may reflect the different deformation styles of each slab as it interacts with the transition zone discontinuities; the subducting Pacific plate beneath Japan stagnates atop the 660km discontinuity, while the subducting Nazca plate beneath South America penetrates into the lower mantle. While the elasticity and fabric development for phases that are present in the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle remain imperfectly known, our results provide unequivocal evidence for the presence of anisotropy at mid-mantle depths in the vicinity of subducting slabs.",

            "abstract": "A recent ecosystem carbon sequestration assessment estimated that the conterminous United States (CONUS) stored 48.3 Pg of carbon, or 6.14 Kg of carbon per square meter covering all vegetated as well as arid lands in the 48 states. The CONUS is shown to be a strong C sink with an average rate of 431 Tg of carbon up-take per year (ranging from 148-667 TgC/yr) for the first half of 2000s as a baseline. Dissolved carbon transported through aquatic systems and emitted carbon dioxide from water surfaces averaged 142 Tg per year. Emissions from wildfires averaged 14 Tg per year based on a separate analysis using remotely sensed fire areas and burn severities. Wildfires are simulated under future climate scenarios and are projected to increase in area, intensity and emissions in future years. Under combinations of future land use/land cover change and climate scenarios, the net ecosystem carbon balance is projected to remain as a carbon sink for the CONUS but could become weaker by 2050 as compared to the baseline, ranging from 44-579 TgC per year. However, a separate analysis of the assessment noted that future potential rate of carbon sequestration by CONUS ecosystems could be higher (increasing to 503-676 Tg of carbon per year by 2060, depending on climate scenarios) than the present rate. This assumes the ecosystems would be managed with active fire suppression, maintained for natural vegetation cover, and benefited from increased water use efficiency of increased atmosphere carbon dioxide concentration.",

            "abstract": "A 2350 meter deep rhyolite lava dome and surrounding intermediate-mafic complex on the Alarcon Rise mid-ocean ridge in the Gulf of California was sampled extensively during a 2012 MBARI expedition. The dome is predominantly composed of sparsely vesicular (<10%) obsidian with local deposits of pumiceous breccia. Pumiceous lapilli comprise highly vesicular (40-60%) fracture networks that separate non-vesicular obsidian “pseudoclasts”. Textures and major element geochemistry suggest that both lithologies originated from the same magma that formed the majority of the dome. This is corroborated by comparable major element compositions (~75% SiO2) and near-equilibrium phenocryst assemblages including olivine (Fo10) and plagioclase (An17). Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and transmission FTIR spectroscopy was used to measure H2O concentrations in olivine and plagioclase melt inclusions as well as host glasses (CO2 was below detection, <30 ppm). Rhyolite host glass contains 1.5-2.0 wt% H2O, similar to nearby andesite and dacite. These concentrations agree with saturation limits for H2O (1.7%) at the depth of Alarcon Rise, but are slightly less than what is predicted by fractional crystallization modeling. Melt inclusions from plagioclase and olivine in rhyolite contain a maximum of 3.5-4.5% H2O suggesting that up to 3.0% H2O exsolved into bubbles during a 3 km ascent. Hydrostatic pressures (23 MPa) at the eruptive vent would have permitted 53% vesiculation in agreement with petrographic observations. Although ~50% vesiculation and exsolved H2O contents of 3.0 wt% are less than the ideal threshold for magmatic fragmentation, the presence of highly vesicular ash particles representing fragmented pumiceous breccia argues otherwise. We posit that decoupled volatiles from a deeper magma body migrated through fracture networks to the surface causing mild explosivity.",

            "abstract": "Stable oxygen (δ18O) and hydrogen (δD) isotopologues of atmospheric moisture are strongly influenced by large-scale synoptic weather cycles, surface evapotranspiration and boundary layer mixing. Atmospheric water isotope variation has been shown to empirically relate to relative humidity (Rh) of near surface moisture, and to a less degree, air temperature. Continuous δ18O and δD measurements are becoming more available, providing new opportunities to investigate processes that control isotope variability. This study shows the comparison of δ18O and δD measured at a continental location and over coastal waters for 3 seasons (spring to fall, 2014). The surface moisture isotope measurements were made using two LGR spectroscopy water vapor isotope analyzers (Los Gatos Research Inc.), one operated in an old-growth coniferous forest at Wind River field station, WA (45.8205°N, 121.9519°W), and another sampling marine air over seawater at the Scripps Pier in San Diego, CA (32.8654°N, 117.2536°W), USA. Isotope variations were measured at 1Hz and data were reported as hourly averages with an overall accuracy of ±0.1‰ for δ18O, ±0.5‰ for δ2H. Day-to-day variations in δ18O and δD are shown strongly influenced by synoptic weather events at both locations. Boundary layer mixing between surface moisture and the dry air entrained from the free troposphere exerts a midday maximum and a consistent diel pattern in deuterium excess (dx). At the forest site, surface moisture also interacts with leaf water through transpiration during the day and re-equilibration at night. The latter occurs by retro-diffusion of atmospheric H2O molecules into leaf intercellular space, which becomes intensified as Rh increaes after nightfall, and continues until sunrise, to counter-balance the evaporative isotopic enrichment in leaf water on a daily basis. These vegetation effects lead to negative dx values consistently observed at nighttime in this continental location that were not seen in marine air. This study shows strong evidence suggesting the utility of applying these isotope tracers and, provides data to quantify atmospheric moisture variability in land surface models.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing concern about the implications of climate change on water resources. Climate change has posed significant challenges to watershed management by changing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as heat/cold waves, storms, floods and droughts. In this study, a regional climate model (PRECIS) is used to generate high resolution climate change scenarios over the province of Ontario, Canada. An advanced step-wise cluster approach, as a surrogate of the hydrologic model, is then developed to establish the precipitation-runoff relationship and address uncertainty in hydrologic cycles, providing a robust support for hydrologic prediction. To explore the potential interactions among hydrologic parameters, an ANOVA-based probabilistic collocation method is also proposed for uncertainty propagation in a reduced dimensional space. Multivariate inference is conducted to reveal statistical significance of model terms in the five-dimensional second-order and third-order polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs), respectively. A set of truncated PCEs can thus be generated through discarding insignificant terms, leading to a remarkable reduction in computational efforts. Results reveal that the truncated PCEs are good functional representations of the precipitation-runoff processes in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The performance of the third-order PCEs is better than the second-order PCEs through a comparison with Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the impacts of climate change on watersheds in Ontario are evaluated and analyzed by using the future climate projection as the inputs of the surrogate models. This study meets the need for watershed adaptation to the changing climate. The outputs from this study will significantly improve our understanding of the challenges that Canadian watersheds are facing under various climate change scenarios, and provide scientific basis for watersheds management and adaptation.",

            "abstract": "The environment and sustainability of deltaic lowlands have been threatened by combined impacts of climate changes, human activities and land subsidence. The Mekong delta has also been disturbed by the construction of upstream river dams and fluvial dredging, and we have a limited knowledge of its morphodynamics response to fluctuations in Asian monsoons that governs the coastal sediment dynamics. In order to understand the recent shoreline changes of the Mekong delta, we attempted to reconstruct the prehistoric changes based on landform records and their chronology. Thirteen optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of chenier, a record of past shoreline, were obtained from the Soc Trang coastal plain, southwestern part of the delta. The OSL ages are younger than 2770 yr BP, and become younger seawards concordantly with the coastal progradation that cheniers document. The progradation rate has changed drastically; it was 8 m/yr, 31 m/yr, and 5 m/yr during periods of 2770–1370 yr BP, 1370–590 yr BP, and 590 yr BP to present, respectively. The rapid progradation during 1370–590 yr BP did not form cheniers, resulting in an extensive inter-ridge swale. Cheniers generally form in relations to erosion of muddy coast. The chenier distribution and drastic changes in progradation rate were resulted from fluctuations in relative importance of longshore sediment removal to seaward sediment accretion. Beach ridges in the Tra Vinh coastal plain, northeast of the Soc Trang, also indicate similar and synchronous fluctuations in the longshore sediment transport. The dominance of the longshore sediment transport after 590 yr BP is thought caused by the strengthened winter monsoon that drives the southwestward longshore current, which is possibly related to the beginning of the Little Ice Age. Many cheniers occur along the present shoreline in relation to the low progradation rate, and possibly some sporadic erosion after 590 yr BP. Some evidences have suggested that the winter monsoon has weakened in the South China Sea after the Little Ice Age, and thus human-induced decrease of sediment supply in recent decades would have hindered the coastal progradation or even caused erosion.",

            "abstract": "The complex nature of turbulence produced by the interaction between plant canopies and atmospheric surface layer winds has been a challenge for the development of reduced-complexity models. The drag force exerted by the canopy elements on the flow field produces profound modifications on the turbulence structure and on the mechanisms of momentum transport. These changes can be characterized by the distribution of sweeps and ejections and can be linked to the skewness of the velocity fluctuation distribution. Second-order closure approaches for the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations yield good predictions for the mean velocity and the turbulence kinetic energy components, but do not include predictions for the skewness of the velocity fluctuation distributions. In this work we adapt a one-dimensional turbulence model to study of canopy flows. The model is based on a one-dimensional version of the filtered Navier-Stokes equations. In the model, the resolved nonlinear and pressure terms are represented by stochastic eddy events, which are implemented as simple mappings. The canopy drag and viscous effects are represented explicitly. The subgrid-scale stresses are parameterized using an eddy-viscosity approach. The resulting equations are solved numerically. Vertical profiles of statistics produced by the model compare reasonably well with experimental data for crops and forests. The model is capable of capturing the main features of the skewness of the streamwise velocity. The model is also extended to study scalar transport within the canopy region. Preliminary results and potential uses of the model are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring and understanding ongoing changes in Antarctic mass balance is of great interest, as the melting of the ice sheet would significantly contribute to global sea level changes. While scientists agree that the West Antarctic ice sheet is losing mass, opinions about the East Antarctic ice sheet are more widespread, with some areas showing an increase in mass. In recent years satellite missions have significantly contributed to the understanding of ongoing changes within the polar ice sheets, and became an important tool in detecting variations in ice height, ice mass and bedrock isostasy. The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission detects mass loss in regions where the ice sheet has its bed well below sea level and where warmer ocean water penetrates beneath the ice sheet, melting it from the base. Meanwhile an increase in mass has been observed in regions along the East Antarctic coastline, raising the question whether GRACE detects glacial isostatic adjustment due to ice mass loss or an actual increase in snowfall, contributing positively to surface mass balance. To improve our understanding on the contribution of glacial isostatic adjustment and surface mass balance to mass variations, we developed a new approach on how to subtract elevation changes observed by satellite altimetry from observed mass changes as detected by GRACE. We have established our own firn compaction model that we apply to the altimetry data to subtract changes due to the densification of snow, before using the ICESat observations. We will present results of the firn compaction model and our approach on combining GRACE and ICESat observations to separate the contribution of glacial isostatic adjustment from ongoing surface mass changes in East Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "It has long been believed that most of energy transferred from the magnetosphere and deposited in the ionosphere-thermosphere system occurs in the auroral zone, the region of strong field-aligned current density. Recent observations of the Poynting flux to the ionosphere and theoretical investigations of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling show that the strongest energy transfer may be in the polar cap proper where the plasma flow speed is high and not where the flow reverses. This implies that the field-aligned current is not the primary agent of the energy transfer into the ionosphere-thermosphere system and that other physical progresses are at play. Recent simulation studies using an inductive-dynamic approach (including self-consistent solutions of Faraday’s law and retaining inertia terms in the ion momentum equations) on the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling indicate that the energy transfer is through Alfven waves propagating to the ionosphere/thermosphere and the energy deposition is via the frictional heating caused by relative motion between ions and neutrals. In this study we assess the locations of the energy transfer and deposition by employing a self-consistent inductive-dynamic ionosphere-thermosphere model. In a 2-D numerical simulation (dawn-dusk meridian plane), we solve the continuity, momentum, and energy equations for multiple species of ions and neutrals including photochemistry and Maxwell’s equations. By simulating responses of the ionosphere-thermosphere system to enhanced magnetosphere convection, we show that the strongest energy transfer occurs in the polar cap proper instead of the auroral zone.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Rockies Watershed Project (SRWP) was established to document the magnitude and recovery from the severe 2003 Lost Creek wildfire along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada. Hydrology and water quality have been studied in seven instrumented catchments (4-14 km2) encompassing burned, burned and salvage logged, and unburned (reference) conditions since 2004.\nAcross 9 years, the mean total nitrogen (TN) concentration and yields in the unburned catchments were lower than in the burned catchments and the salvage logged catchments. Differences were most pronounced in the first 3 years (2004-2006) after the fire – TN concentrations were 3.0-times greater in the burned catchments (760.2 μg/l) and 2.2-times greater in the salvaged logged catchments (571.1 μg/l) compared to the unburned catchments (257.1 μg/l). Similarly, the TN yields were 3.8-times greater in the burned catchments (14.0 kg ha/yr) and 2.5-times greater in the salvaged logged catchments (9.1 kg/ha/yr) compared to the unburned catchments (3.7 kg/ha/yr). Nitrate (NO3-) constituted the majority of TN in the unburned catchments (71%) and the burned catchments (64%), but was a minor component of TN in the salvage logged catchments (33%). Across the 9 years of the study, the mean NO3- concentration in the unburned catchments (121.8 μg/l) was lower than in the burned catchments (223.1 μg/l), but slightly higher than in the salvage logged catchments (106.0 μg/l). In the first 3 years after the fire the NO3- concentrations were considerably lower in the unburned catchments (106.0 μg/l) compared to both the burned catchments (432.7 μg/l) and the salvage logged catchments (271.4 μg/l). Trend analysis showed no significant trend in TN and NO3- concentrations and yields in the unburned catchments over the 9 year study, but showed a significant decreasing trend in TN and NO3- in both the burned and salvage logged catchments.",

            "abstract": "In this study, NIR and SWIR EO-1 Hyperion data acquired over two large Alaskan forest fires are used to detect active fires, map their immediate vicinity, and retrieve fire temperatures. The study sites are located in black spruce stands within the 2004 Boundary fire (215,000 ha total affected area) and the 2009 Wood River 1 fire (50,000 ha). Even though fires in the North American boreal forest ecosystem contribute greatly to global carbon cycling and large-scale air pollution, they have been less studied so far using satellite-borne imaging spectroscopy. We adapted the Hyperspectral Fire Detection Index (HFDI) so that it worked well for the high-latitude Hyperion data. This involved selecting suitable bands which best separated fire from non-fire pixels and averaging them to further improve the detection signal. Resulting fire detection maps compare favorably to uniform radiance thresholding of the Hyperion data and are consistent with fires detected on near-simultaneous Landsat 7 ETM+ data. Unsupervised classification of the vicinity of the active fire zones served to delineate 5 to 6 well separated classes: high- and low-intensity fire, various unburnt vegetation classes, recent fire scar, and a transitional zone ahead of the active fire front that shows evidence of fire impact but no emitted radiance component. Furthermore, MODTRAN5 was used for atmospheric correction to retrieve fire temperatures by modeling a mixture of emitted and reflected radiance signatures of the fire and background areas, respectively. As most of the carbon consumption and subsequent emissions in boreal forest fires stem from the combustion of dead plant material on the forest floor, estimates on fire intensities and high/low intensity burn areas provide valuable insight into the amount of carbon cycling in the system. Imaging spectroscopy can therefore contribute an important step forward in quantitative studies of boreal fires and their impacts. These techniques are set to advance further as future hyperspectral satellite missions start delivering a time series of Hyperion-like data at higher signal-to-noise levels.",

            "abstract": "We and others have previously identified anomalous Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) spectra confined to narrow altitude ranges near the F-region peak and correlated with dynamic auroral precipitation [Isham et al., 2012; Akbari et al., 2012, 2013]. The radar echoes are attributed to beam-generated Langmuir turbulence. In this work we used a 1-dimentional Zakharov simulation to constrain the range of physical mechanisms underlying these observational features. Our results suggest the presence of a local F-region energy source, possibly produced by non-linear wave-wave interactions.\nIn details we have found that:\n1) Simultaneous enhancements in ion-line and plasma-line channels of the PFISR can be produced by strong Langmuir turbulence and caviton collapse generated by relatively strong soft electron beams (< 1 keV) that lack the electron population directly resonant with the detectable waves.\n2) Except for cases of very high electron to ion temperature ratios (Tr > 6), caviton collapse would give rise to a dominant zero-frequency peak in the ion-line channel. In these cases simulated spectral features do not match those measured by ISRs.\n3) Observations of enhanced ion-acoustic shoulders and lack of observation of such high temperature ratios in ISR measurements, therefore, suggest that the Parametric Decay Instability (PDI) operates at the observations wavenumbers. This in turns requires local energization of lower energy electrons (< 20 eV) at ~250 km.\n4) The existence of other modes and processes is also supported by observations of non-linear features in the plasma-line measurements.",

            "abstract": "The Pamir Mountains, located at the western end of the Indo-Asian collision zone, are one of the most tectonically active regions in central Asia. The Kongur Shan extensional system (KES), located in the Chinese Pamir, accommodates EW extension due to the India/Asia collision and has been the focus on numerous Cenozoic studies, whereas there are very few late Quaternary studies. The KES is mostly normal, except towards its NW end, where it becomes right-lateral strike-slip, along the Muji segment. From Muji to Tashkorgan, we investigated 6 sites, where active normal and/or strike-slip faults cut and offset abandoned river channels or alluvial fans and terraces, which allows us to quantify both the normal and strike-slip motions at different locations along the KES. Our preliminary results yield vertical and right-lateral rates of ~1.8 and >3.2 mm/yr along the northern KES (Muji to Bulunkou) during the Holocene, and of ~1.9-2.7 and ~1 mm/yr along the southern KES (near Taheman) since ~30 ka. These preliminary rates, consistent with GPS data and Cenozoic rates, imply that the EW extension rate due to the northward indentation of the Pamir salient as well as due to the clockwise rotation of the rigid Tarim basin, is partly accommodated by the Muji-Tashkorgan pull-apart basin, and is faster in the north than in the south (from ~5 to ~2 mm/yr).

Some uncertainties about forest cover maps still exist in China, so an accurate and updated forest cover distribution map is necessary as a baseline for carbon cycle estimation, especially at a fine spatial resolution. In this study, we developed a decision tree classification algorithm to identify forest and non-forest land cover, based on the signature analysis of 50 m ALOS PLASAR backscatter data in 2010 for a few land cover types. We used MODIS-based NDVI dataset in 2010 (MOD13Q1) to generate a map of annual maximum NDVI and used it to mask out built-up lands, barren lands, and sparsely vegetated lands. We applied the PALSAR-based algorithm and produced a forest cover map in China in 2010. Several comparisons in forest area and spatial distribution between the resultant forest map with other forest maps were carried out. The results show that the total forest area in China from the PALSAR-based forest map in 2010 is close to those of JAXA, FAO FRA, and National Forestry Inventory, and there are good linear relationships between the PALSAR-based forest map with the JAXA, MCD12Q1, and NLCD-China forest areas at province and county scales. All the forest maps have similar forest/non-forest distribution, but our PALSAR-based forest map recognizes well the agro-forests. The results of this study provide a baseline map of forest cover in China in 2010, which can be used for the studies of forest disturbance, carbon cycle, and ecological restoration projects in China.",

When operated at a 3-m altitude, this system maps seafloor topography with a 1-cm lateral resolution and simultaneously collects 2.5-mm resolution color photography. We have twice mapped an 80-m by 80-m area of a chemosynthetic clam community located at 2850-m depth in the Monterey Canyon axis. Both the topography and the photomosaics resolve changes in the clam community over a six-month interval. Many individual animals have moved, and tracks of those animals are visible in the lidar topography. No other changes in the seafloor at this site can be discerned. We have also performed single surveys of bedforms and scours at both 1850-m and 2850-m depths in Monterey Canyon.\nThe highest resolution bathymetry data are collected using a 3DatDepth SL1 lidar laser scanner. This system has a 30° field of view and ranges continuously, achieving a 1 cm sounding spacing at a 3 m altitude and 0.3 m/s speed. Bathymetry data are also collected using a 400-kHz Reson 7125 multibeam sonar. This configuration produces 512 beams across a 135° wide swath; each beam has a 0.5° acrosstrack by 1.0° alongtrack angular width. At a 3-m altitude, the nadir beams have a 2.5 cm acrosstrack and 5 cm alongtrack footprint. Dual Prosilica GX1920 2.4 Mpixel color cameras provide color stereo photography of the seafloor. Illumination is provided by dual xenon strobes. The camera housings have been fitted with corrective optics achieving a 90° field of view with less than 1% distortion. At a 3-m altitude the raw image pixels have a 2.5 mm resolution. Position and attitude data are provided by a Kearfott SeaDevil Inertial Navigation System (INS) integrated with a 300 kHz Teledyne RD Instruments Doppler velocity log (DVL). A separate Paroscientific pressure sensor is mounted adjacent to the INS. The INS Kalman filter is aided by the DVL velocity and pressure data, achieving navigational drift rates less than 0.05% of the distance traveled during surveys. The sensors are mounted pointed vertically down into a frame that can be installed into toolsleds on ROV Doc Ricketts and ROV Ventana.",

However, not clearly understood are at what altitudes NPF actually occurs, what the spatial scale of NPF is, and what are the good meteorological conditions that lead to NPF. In this study, we analyze the data that will be obtained from a 300 m meteorological observation tower to have a better understanding of where NPF occurs and the meteorological conditions that lead to NPF. The tower is installed at the National Center for Intensive Observation of severe weather (NCIO) at a southern coastal rural town of Boseong, Korea (34.76N, 127.16E) and is equipped with measurement platforms at 11 altitudes. Aerosol number concentration and size distribution will be measured at 300 m and 10 m altitudes.

The basic meteorological variables (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity, wind direction and speed) measured at each of the 11 measurement platform altitudes of the tower will be jointly collected. Comprehensive analysis of these continuous and vertically aligned measurement data will give us an opportunity to look at the details of NPF mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale picture of formation and subduction of Central Mode Water (CMW) and Transition Region Mode Water (TRMW) in the North Pacific has been presented by recent analyses of Argo float data. We further need to update the picture by clarifying the relation of the mode water formation and subduction to thermohaline fronts and mesoscale eddies. For such purpose, synoptic observation data with enough horizontal resolution are indispensable.\nWe analyzed hydrographic data east of Japan from five research cruises and Argo floats in spring 2003 to examine the relation of the formation of CMW and TRMW in the late winter of 2003 to fronts and eddies. TRMW and the denser variety of CMW (D-CMW) were formed continuously just south of the subarctic frontal zone between 155ºE and 165ºW with little relation to eddies, suggesting that the absence of the permanent thermocline and halocline in this area is essential for the formation. The lighter variety of CMW (L-CMW) was formed south of the Kuroshio bifurcation front and east of 165ºE, partly in an anticyclonic eddy associated with the Kuroshio Extension. Some portion of D-CMW and L-CMW likely had been subducted to the permanent pycnocline by crossing southward the Kuroshio bifurcation front and the Kuroshio Extension front, respectively. In contrast, the formation of these waters in the western regions was inactive and was significantly different from that described previously using multiyear Argo float data. West of 155ºE, TRMW and D-CMW were formed only in two anticyclonic eddies that had been detached from the Kuroshio Extension one to two years ago. L-CMW was hardly formed west of 165ºE, which might be related to the upstream Kuroshio Extension being in its stable state characterized by low regional eddy activity.\nWe also conducted a hydrographic observation in the TRMW/D-CMW formation region in April 2013 using R/V Hakuho-maru. The KH-13-3 cruise was disrupted by cyclones seven times, and we had to focus on the westernmost part of the TRMW formation region where deepest winter mixed layers in the North Pacific have been observed. Along a zonal section between 42ºN, 151ºE and 41ºN, 161ºE, we observed thick TRMW and D-CMW just after formation at an interval of 10’ in longitude. We revisit the L-CMW and D-CMW/TRMW formation regions in June 2015 to complement the 2013 observation.",

The arid landscape in the western Tarim Basin, NW China, preserves suites of fluvial terraces crossing many of the Late Neogene active structures, creating fault and fold scarps. We present new deformation rates on five faults and folds, which in combination with previous studies, highlight the spatial and temporal patterns of deformation during the Late Quaternary. Suites of terraces spanning ~130 ka to ~8 ka document the basinward propagation of deformation, with the fastest rates currently located on actively deforming structures at the interface of the Pamir-Tian Shan orogens. During the last ~6 ka, the Pamir deformation front has stepped north, creating the Mingyaole South Thrust, which produced the 1985 M7.4 Wuqia Earthquake. Trenching on several sections of this fault reveal an earthquake reoccurence interval of ~1.0 ky. The Late Quaternary deformation rates on faults and folds along the Pamir-Tian Shan collision zone indicate that the locus of deformation was not concentrated on a single structure, but rather was concurrently distributed across a zone of structures. Despite numerous structures accommodating the shortening and the locus of deformation shifting throughout the Late Quaternary, the total shortening across the Pamir-Tian Shan collision zone since ~0.35 Ma has remained steady and is approximately equal to the current geodetic rate of 6-9 mm/a, as well as broadly similar to preliminary InSAR-derived deformation rates across the region.",

            "abstract": "Along the eastern Australian seaboard, changes to both landscapes and climate are altering the hydrological cycle and impacting catchment outflows. The region supports 80% of the human population and regularly experiences extreme events such as tropical cyclones, floods and droughts. These changes in the hydrological cycle affect water supply for urban population centres, reduce economic activities and threaten water-dependent ecosystems. An important question that emerges from these issues is how human-modified, spatially heterogeneous catchments are responding to hydrological changes and which biophysical factors are driving the streamflow response. In order to organize and classify heterogeneous catchments with regard to their hydrological functioning, this study utilizes daily streamflow and rainfall time series to quantify hydrological similarity across 402 catchments located along the east coast of Australia. We computed several metrics such as runoff ratio, slope of the Flow Duration Curve, and streamflow elasticity to describe how catchments respond to rainfall input over a period of 30 hydrologic years (1980 to 2010). We used ordination analysis and mixed-effect models to evaluate how the landscape and climatic characteristics of catchments are controlling both individual hydrological signatures and the dominant streamflow response. This work provides new insights into how catchments characteristics and climate variability are interacting to control hydrological behaviour.",

Calcite and carbonatitic melt inclusions occur in clinopyroxene and olivine. Clinopyroxene in these xenoliths generally have a relatively higher Mg# (92.3–93.0) than that of olivine (Mg# = 90.8). Clinopyroxene is characterized by enrichments in LREE and zonations of REE, Li and Sr increasing from the cores to the rims. Furthermore, they have high Ca/Al (8.4–8.7), Zr/Hf (69.9–78.4) and (La/Yb)N (21–36) ratios and low Ti/Eu (618–755) ratios, which are features of mantle peridotite metasomatized by carbonatitic melt. These observations indicate that the peridotitic mantle beneath the Changle area could have suffered a carbonatitic metasomatism.\nClinopyroxene, othopyroxene and olivine in these peridotites exhibit variably low δ7Li (+3.9 to -27.2‰) and slightly high 87Sr/86Sr (0.7030–0.7036), suggesting involvement of recycled crustal material. It has been previously suggested that the Mesozoic destruction of the eastern NCC was closely related to the hydration and mantle upwelling associated with Pacific plate subduction. The Cenozoic Changle basalt locates at the eastern margin of the NCC. Thus, we suggest that the carbonatitic metasomatism of the lithopheric mantle beneath the Changle area could have been induced by the westward subduction of the Pacific plate. The subduction-related carbonatitic metasomatism can transform the depleted harzburgite/dunite mantle to clinopyroxne/orthopyroxene-rich mantle, which could have played an important role in the lithospheric thinning of the NCC.",

In SWD pilot data preprocessing, it is very important that effective signals are abstracted from bit. Also, noises are abstracted from rigs and machines on ground. Source signal from bit, because of the broad range of frequencies and short time duration, can be easily affected by noises from rigs and machines. In order to avoid the affection and recover the bit source signals, the source function associated with the surface record is the key approach for processing the SWD signals.\nCepstrum analysis is a nonlinear filtering technology, can change the convoluted signals in time domain to added signals in frequency domain. This method can remove the structural reverberation to abstract the source signals by selecting a window function. We discussed the cepstral filtering and abstracted the transient source signals according to the data of drill string simulated experiment.\nIndoor simulation experiment verifies reliability of cepstrum analysis technology, stifles reverberation of pipe string, and obtains source signal and transfer function. On the basis of noise elimination, analyze vibration signals received by the top of drilling string using cepstrum, stifles long time cycle reverberation, highlights periodic characteristics of signals, which supplies convenience for analysis of drill bit feeble vibration and spreading characteristics. Correlate extracted drill bit source signal with ground records, which improves signal-to-noise ratio of SWD data processing. Although cepstrum can not recover exact source signals, preliminary estimates can still be given for transient source signal in accordance with amplitude and width of the recovered signals, which supplies a feasible way for SWD data processing.",

This study attempts to provide observational evidence of the SM-P feedback based on the state-average of 11-year (2003-2013) daily SM and P data from 14 measurement stations in Illinois. Correlations above 5% level of the significance were obtained during the late-spring to late-summer period, peaking at r2 = 0.8 at top 50-cm SM and 21-days accumulated subsequent P. The high positive correlation corresponds to the timing of soil drying in early summer. Contrary to the previous study, there is greater correlation between SM and future P at deeper soil layers than that at the surface layers, which is indicative of the influence of SM memory in the future P. Comparisons of the correlations between the antecedent P to SM and the autocorrelation of P itself show that, while the prior P significantly forces surface SM, its influence decreases at deeper layers where the influence of SM to future P increases. This main findings of this research are (1) the important role of deep soil layers in influencing future precipitation, and (2) the timing of the onset of soil drying in exerting the influences on future P.",

            "abstract": "Ganymede's atmosphere is a surface-bounded-exosphere composed mainly of molecular oxygen. The bulk density of the O2 atmosphere is inferred from the diagnostic ratio between far-UV auroral emission line brightnesses observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), but this measurement is relatively uncertain owing to a lack of information available for the energies of the electrons in Ganymede's magnetosphere that dissociatively excite the OI 130.4 nm and 135.6 nm emissions. Only a few other species such as H have been detected, and the abundance of atomic oxygen has been constrained only in relation to lower limits for the O2 density based on the line ratios. The New Horizons (NH) spacecraft observed Ganymede with the Pluto-Alice (P-Alice) instrument during the Jupiter flyby in spring of 2007. HST Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) far-UV images of Ganymede complement the P-Alice far-UV spectroscopy at this time. OI 130.4 nm and 135.6 nm emissions were detected in both data sets. The ACS Ganymede images are consistent with previous Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) imaging. P-Alice observed two Ganymede eclipse events, viewing the sunlit sub-Jupiter and nightside anti-Jupiter hemispheres, separately, from before ingress through after egress. Through comparisons of the P-Alice spectra in sunlight to those in eclipse we are able to disentangle the component of the OI 130.4 nm emission line brightness attributed to processes other than electron impact dissociation of O2, namely a combination of solar reflectance and solar resonant scattering by atomic oxygen atoms. The CII 133.5 nm solar emission feature in the sunlit hemisphere dataset also disappears in eclipse and was not detected in the nightside hemisphere spectra, as expected, providing distinct fits to the solar reflectance component. We thereby provide the first meaningful constraint on the atomic oxygen atmosphere revealed through the solar resonant scattering emission source. We briefly discuss the potential of similar far-UV measurements with the upcoming Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) for better understanding Ganymede’s atmosphere and auroral interaction processes.",

            "abstract": "P-wave seismic velocity is well known to be up to 7.0 km/s and over 7.5 km/s in the lower crust and in the mantle, respectively. There is a large velocity gradient at the Moho discontinuity between the crust and mantle. In this paper, we investigates the configuration of Moho discontinuity defined as an iso-velocity plane with large velocity gradient derived from our fine-scale three-dimensional seismic velocity structure beneath Japanese Islands using data obtained by dense seismic network with the tomographic method (Matsubara and Obara, 2011).\nWe calculate the P-wave velocity gradients between the vertical grid nodes. The largest velocity gradient is 0.078 (km/s)/km at velocities of 7.2 and 7.3 km/s. In this study, we define the iso-velocity plane of 7.2 km/s as the Moho discontinuity. However, it is difficult to identify the Moho discontinuity of the Eurasian plate where the lower crust of the Eurasian plate contacts with the subducting oceanic crusts of the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates since there is no mantle high-velocity material. Beneath these contact zones, the Moho depth derived from the iso-velocity plane denotes the Moho within the subducting oceanic plates. We discuss the Moho discontinuity above the upper boundary of these subducting oceanic plates with consideration of configuration of plate boundaries of prior studies (Shiomi et al., 2006; Kita et al., 2012; Nakagawa et al, 2012).\nThe Moho discontinuity deepens over 35 km in the collision zone like as Kanto Mountains, the volcanic underplating zone as the Tohoku backbone range, and non-tension region like as Chugoku Mountains. These regions associated with deep Moho are characterized by the crustal seismicity within the depth range from 20 to 30 km.\nThe Moho discontinuity shallower than 30 km depth is distributed within the tension region like northern Kyushu and coastal line of the Pacific Ocean in the Tohoku region and the tension region at the Cretaceous as the northeastern Kanto district. These regions have low seismicity within the upper crust. Northeastern Kanto district has positive Bouguer anomaly and it indicates that the ductile material with large density in lower crust exist in the shallower portion and the crust is aseismic.",

            "abstract": "Instability of jets on the bottom, such as those formed under large-amplitude lee waves or overflows (density currents), is one of mixing processes in bottom boundary layers. Numerical experiments by Abe and Nakamura (2013) showed the two types of shear instabilities in jets on the bottom, that is, Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) waves and Tollmien-Schlichiting (TS) waves. Their wavelengths and phase speeds were almost the same, suggesting that KH and TS waves combine to form another unstable mode, which we call combined mode hereafter. However, no studies have dealt with the interaction between these instabilities.\nIn this study, we consider the possible mechanism of the combination of KH and TS waves and confirm the combination mechanism by numerical experiments using a two-dimensional model.\nDevelopment of KH waves is explained by interaction of a pair of vorticity waves propagating in opposite directions on two vorticity interfaces. Similarly, TS waves consist of two modes interacting with each other: a vorticity wave propagating on a vorticity interface and a viscous mode near the bottom, which arises to satisfy a no-slip condition at the bottom. Combining these, we propose the mechanism of a new unstable mode in jets on the bottom, which have two vorticity interfaces in the shear layer; that is, if all of the two waves on the interfaces and the viscous mode on the bottom have the same phase speed, these interact with each other, and the combined mode may develop. In the experiment where the background shear flow had an idealized form of that in the experiments of Abe and Nakamura (2013), the two vorticity waves and the viscous mode grew simultaneously with their phase relations that agreed with the proposed mechanism. Moreover, the wavelength and phase speed of the fastest growing perturbations were consistent with the KH and TS waves in the experiments of Abe and Nakamura (2013). These facts suggest that combined modes could affect mixing near the bottom.",

These units are the alluvial fan material (ALF), fractured light-toned surface (FLT), cratered plains/surfaces (CS), smooth hummocky plains (SH), rugged unit (RU) and striated light-toned outcrops (SLT) (Grotzinger et al., 2014; DOI: 10.1126/science.1242777). The goal of this project was to characterize and determine the origin of the CS. The CS is a thin, nearly horizontal, erosion resistant capping unit. HiRISE mosaics were utilized to subdivide the CS into four geomorphic sub-units. Crater densities were calculated for each sub-unit to provide a quantifiable parameter that could aid in understanding how the sub-units differ. Mastcam images from many locations along Curiosity's traverse show fields of dark, massive boulders, which are presumably erosional remnants of the CS. This indicates that the CS was likely more laterally extensive in the past. In situ CS outcrops, seen at Shaler and multiple locations near the Zabriskie Plateau, appear to have a rough, wind-sculpted surface and may consist of two distinct lithologies. The lower lithology displays hints of layering that have been enhanced by differential weathering, whereas the upper lithology consists of dark, massive rock. When present, the outcrops can extend laterally for several meters, but Mastcam images of outcrops do not always reveal both sections. ChemCam data show that CS targets have concentrations of Al, Na, and K that are indicative of an alkali feldspar phase. The physical and chemical characteristics of the CS suggest a massive deposit that has seen little to no chemical alteration. Physical characteristics of the CS do not allow us to unambiguously determine its geologic origin; possible emplacement mechanisms would require the ability to spread laterally over a nearly horizontal surface, and include inflating lava (e.g., pāhoehoe) or a distal delta deposit. The Cratered Surface represents an intriguing, complicated portion of the geologic history of Mars at Gale Crater.",

The concentrations were obtained every 5 minutes, from June to August 2014, for the first and second and every 12 hours for the third. The experiment took place in a site at the University of São Paulo which is located in the Southeast part of the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP). MASP is one of the biggest urban centers of the world, with more than 20 million inhabitants, 10 million vehicles and high values of some regulated pollutants, as particulate matter, especially in winter. Ambient fine particles associated with vehicle emissions have been linked to adverse health effects. Black carbon has a significant share of particulate mass concentrations. Previous studies showed a contribution of more than 30% for São Paulo. This year the climate was atypical in São Paulo. The summer was the driest of the last 30 years. The winter was hot and also dry. Dust trak monitor showed peaks of more than 120 μg/m3 for PM2.5. For a specific period, black carbon concentrations from the MAAP monitor were compared to black carbon measured by optical reflectance on teflon filters collected by the Partisol sampler. Monitor values were around 30% higher, but specific characteristics can influence this value. In the past, optical reflectance and thermal techniques for black carbon were compared. The reflectance technique showed higher results for the fine fraction than the thermal method. Now, reflectance is being compared to instrument measurements and results are also satisfactory.",

            "abstract": "We have applied seismic interferometry to three-component ambient noise data recorded around the Ise bay area, central Japan, to validate published three-dimensional S-wave velocity models. For the bay area, detailed seismic velocity structure models have been constructed based on P-wave reflection surveys. There is no direct information on the S-wave velocities beneath the bay and the parameters are assigned by reference to those in a land area. We used one-year continuous data from 20 permanent stations of the NIED Hi-net (High-sensitivity seismograph network) to obtain stacked cross-correlation functions (CCFs) of ambient noise between station pairs that cross the bay. The CCFs were calculated, using one-hour data in the radial-radial (R-R), transverse-transverse (T-T) and vertical-vertical (Z-Z) directions for time lags of ±500s. Horizontal distances between the stations range form 15 km to 103 km. Although the Hi-net stations deploy seismometers with the natural period of 1 s, we found that the yearly stacked CCFs for selected 101 Hi-net station pairs are comparable with those derived from neighboring broadband seismic stations in the frequency range between 0.1 and 0.5 Hz, by deconvolving the instrument response. The CCFs shows clear Rayleigh waves from all directions in the R-R and Z-Z components, and clear Love waves in the T-T component with reasonable signal-to-noise ratios. The derived group velocities and waveforms of the wave trains are variable in the higher frequency range (> 0.2 Hz), indicating deep sedimentary basin beneath the bay. We compared obtained group velocities with theoretical ones to find systematic differences between the expected structure model from the CCFs and the published models in the northwest part of the bay, while the agreements are generally good for many other station pairs. This result indicates that the seismic interferometry technique provides valuable information for validation and improvement of a velocity structure model beneath bay or ocean areas.\nAcknowledgements: We used continuous waveform records from Hi-net of the National Research Institute for Earthquake Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED).",

            "abstract": "A number of studies of the spatial correlation of log permeability (Y) in different sedimentary aquifers are reviewed showing that the spatial correlation structure can be defined by how the proportion of lag transitions crossing different facies (i.e. the cross-transition probability structure) increases with increasing lag distance. The common underlying cross-transition structure can contain substructures with different correlation ranges corresponding to different scales of sedimentary facies within the hierarchy of the sedimentary architecture. For each substructure, the standard deviation in facies length relative to the mean can mostly define the shape, and the proportions and mean length of facies define the range. An illustrative example from the Borden research site shows the horizontal spatial bivariate correlation of Y and of reactive attributes (R) affecting subsurface transport are both defined by the same underlying cross-transition probability structures. Thus, the horizontal Y and R autosemivariograms and the R-Y cross-semivariogram have the same underlying composite correlation structure and substructures (shape and range in the rise to a sill). Such cross-transition probability based correlation structures are used in the companion Part 2 presentation (Soltanian et al.) to develop models which relate the time-dependent effective retardation and the particle displacement variance to hierarchical sedimentary architecture.",

It is expected that the wetland hydraulics vary along the middle reach of the Congo River, including the floodplains with distinct boundary from the Kisangani to the intersection between the mainstem and the Lulonga River, and the vast wetlands in the Cuvette Centrale. In this study, we will use repeat-pass multi-temporal interferometric SAR measurement from ALOS PALSAR data to investigate spatial and temporal variations of dh/dt and examine how the dh/dt patterns are related to topographic relief from SRTM DEM. Early results over the wetlands in the Cuvette Centrale show that two distinct dh/dt patterns exist: rapid changes of dh/dt perpendicular to a narrow band of floodplains along the mainstem, and slow and diffuse dh/dt changes over the interfluvial wetlands. It indicates that the hydrodynamics of the interfluvial wetlands cannot be governed by the fluvial process of river-floodplain exchange. Comparison of dh/dt patterns over the Cuvette Centrale and the upper middle reach of the Congo River will enable us to understand how their wetlands and floodplains are filled and drained during high-water and low-water seasons.",

Starting from the ETAS model with two exponential laws, the positive exponential laws for the expected number of earthquakes that an earthquake can trigger, and the well-known Gutenberg-Richter law (negative exponential distribution) for earthquake magnitude, this study shows that the magnitude distribution of the largest descendant from a given event determines the foreshock probabilities, which is close to the values in real seismicity. The båth law can alos be expressed as asymptotic forms of this magnitude distribution. These results are also verified by different analysis on real seismicity and synthetic catalogs that are simulated by the ETAS model.",

            "abstract": "Large-Scale surface mining is continuing in the Athabasca oil sands region in northern Alberta, Canada, causing significant ecosystem disturbances and changes in hydrology. Reclamation efforts in this region require understanding processes that control water, nutrient and salt fluxes through reclaimed landscapes which is critical to restoring their productivity. These processes were tested in a comprehensive mathematical model, ecosys, which was used to determine the effect of different cover thicknesses on water balance, water buffering capacity, salinity and the productivity in the South Bison Hills reclamation site of Syncrude Canada (SCL). This site was constructed in 1999 by capping peat mineral mix and secondary (glacial till) soil over saline sodic overburden. The site was constructed with three different soil cover thicknesses: 35 cm (thin), 50 cm (intermediate) and 100 cm (thick) along a 20% north facing slope. Model outputs were validated with field measured volumetric water content, runoff, snow data, electrical conductivity (EC) and plant productivity data recorded from 1999 to 2013. Model and field results show differences in horizontal and vertical water transport among the three reclaimed prototype covers. Lower water retention capacity in the 35 cm cover compared to the 50 cm and 100 cm covers caused greater soil moisture variation so that permanent wilting point was reached during dry years, decreasing plant growth due to water stress. In addition, the modeled and field-measured EC values indicated some upward salt movement from overburden to cover material over the time. This movement caused higher EC values (6 – 8 dS m-1) to be reached in the shallow rooting zone of the 35 cm and 50 cm covers than of the 100 cm cover several years after the covers were established. The determination of cost effective but ecologically sustainable cover depth is a challenge and will be a focus in future simulations.",

            "abstract": "Although sea level has fluctuated repeatedly over the Pleistocene by up to 120 meters, how (or whether) this cyclic base level forcing impacts the development of bedrock river profiles in tectonically active settings is poorly understood. A major reason for this uncertainty is that bedrock river channels in unglaciated locations are typically buried at their mouths under sediment resulting from the Holocene marine transgression, making direct observations impossible. Here we present a novel approach to constraining the influence of cyclical sea-level forcing on the development of bedrock river profiles in the Oregon Coast Range.\nUsing a 1 m LiDAR DEM, we estimate the depth to the buried bedrock longitudinal profile using measurements of valley width, elevation, wall slope, and present day river width for the Smith River and its tributaries where the river is currently buried by Holocene fluvial and marine sediments. Assuming the current river width is spatially and temporally constant, we calculate the depth to bedrock based on a trapezoidal geometry. In an effort to reduce the noise in our signal, we calculate linear regressions for valley and river width and hold the valley wall slope constant at its average value (~ 30 degrees) for all our calculations.\nSeveral important observations stem from this analysis. First, the bedrock profile of the Smith River projects to the same elevation (~ -110 m) as the bench cut into the continental shelf by the sea-level low stand of the last glacial maximum, suggesting the river is currently graded to the low-stand elevation. Second, almost all of the tributary bedrock profiles plot at the same elevation (~ 40 m below sea-level), which is much higher than the mainstem bedrock profile. One key exception is the significantly larger North Fork of the Smith River, which falls directly on the projected bedrock curve for the Smith. These observations suggest that sea-level low stands force incision of the entire bedrock river network, but that smaller tributaries, which are buried and/or flooded during highstands, cannot keep pace with the mainstem during these periods of brief down-cutting. Our results imply that difference in erosion rates between tributaries and the mainstem results in the formation of fluvial hanging valleys that are buried during marine transgressions.",

Climate change is expected to impact the primary emission and the secondary production of OA, as well as its transport and removal in the atmosphere. However, it is extremely difficult to quantify these impacts or to validate the model predictions of such. Here we diagnosed the sensitivity of surface OA to the interannual variability of meteorological variables over North America. We used a chemical transport model, driven by assimilated meteorology and current-best emission estimates, to simulated surface OA during 1990-2013 and compared the results against observations from the IMPROVE dataset. Observations show large interannual variabilities in surface OA concentrations, as well as its sensitivity to temperature, precipitation, and regional wind. The model underestimates surface OA concentration over the eastern U.S. The model reproduces the observed correlation between surface OA and temperature, but severely underestimates the sensitivity of surface OA to temperature. This implies that a future warming climate will lead to greater surface OA concentration increases than currently predicted.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of structural motions during large earthquakes is important to prevent secondary disasters. To evaluate such strong motion as accurately as possible, it is essential to infer the image of ground motion in the target area based on densely installed seismological networks. In the Tokyo metropolitan area of Japan, the dense seismological array “MeSO-net” was established in 2007, and has approximately 300 stations with several kilometer intervals. Mizusako et al. (2014, AGU) applies lasso, which is a linear regression modeling method using the L1 regularization, to the MeSO-net data during the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake to infer the spatially-high-resolution strong motions in the metropolitan area. Their method succeeds in reproducing the waveforms up to much higher frequency component than previous studies. However, there are two topics to deal with before practical use of their study. The first topic is that real azimuths of MeSO-net seismometers installed after 2009 have not been verified, while those installed in 2007 and 2008 were already verified based on cross correlation with nearby tiltmeters of Hi-net and/or seismometers of F-net (Shiomi et al., 2009). Since azimuths of seismometers obviously affect the data processing, we evaluate the azimuths of seismometers following Shiomi et al. (2009). The second topic is that we cannot directly obtain the ground motion data on surface since MeSO-net seismometers are installed at 20m depth. We have been also developing the method to estimate transfer functions that convert strong motion at 20m depth to that on surface, by utilizing continuous observations obtained both on surface and at 20m depth at two stations, and short-term observations obtained above the boreholes at more than 100 stations. A combination of this vertical transformation method and the horizontal estimation method (Mizusako et al., 2014), enables us to infer an image of ground motions in the whole Tokyo area.",

            "abstract": "The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core satellite was launched on February 27 2014. The core sensors dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) and microwave imager (GMI) are the state-of- the-art sensors that observe the precipitation over the globe. The DPR level 2 product provides both precipitation rates and phases. The precipitation phase information can help advance global hydrological cycle modeling, particularly crucial for high-altitude and high latitude regions where solid precipitation is the dominated source of water. The GMI is equipped with 13 different microwave channels, and has four more channels on the 166 GHz of a milli-wave zone (“Window” channel) and 183.31 GHz (water vapor absorption line) band than TRMM Macrowave Imgager (TMI), which has nine channels from 10.65 to 89 GHz. The GMI is expected to improve the estimation accuracy of light rain and snow. Goal of this study is to systematically evaluate the DPR and GMI by using the high resolution (1km/2.5min) NOAA/NSSL Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor System (MRMS/Q3) with recent dual-polarization upgrade over the CONUS from March to Aug. 2014. The system and random errors of DPR and GMI will be analyzed as a function of the precipitation rate and precipitation type (liquid and solid). The timely evaluation is expected to offer insights into performance of the two latest sensors and thus provide useful feedback to the algorithm developers as well as the GPM data users.",

            "abstract": "To accurately predict how the distribution of extreme events may change in the future we need to understand the mechanisms that influence such events in our current climate. Our current observing system is not well-suited for observing extreme events globally due to the sparse sampling and in-homogeneity of ground-based in-situ observations and the infrequent revisit time of satellite observations. Observations of weather extremes, such as extreme precipitation events, temperature extremes, tropical and extra-tropical cyclones among others, with temporal resolution on the order of minutes and spatial resolution on the order of few kms (<10 kms), are required for improved forecasting of extreme weather events. We envision a suite of low-cost passive microwave sounding and imaging sensors on CubeSats that would work in concert with traditional flagship observational systems, such as those manifested on large environmental satellites (i.e. JPSS,WSF,GCOM-W), to monitor weather extremes.\nA 118/183 GHz sensor would enable observations of temperature and precipitation extremes over land and ocean as well as tropical and extra-tropical cyclones. This proposed project would enable low cost, compact radiometer instrumentation at 118 and 183 GHz that would fit in a 6U Cubesat with the objective of mass-producing this design to enable a suite of small satellites to image the key geophysical parameters needed to improve prediction of extreme weather events. We take advantage of past and current technology developments at JPL viz. HAMSR (High Altitude Microwave Scanning Radiometer), Advanced Component Technology (ACT’08) to enable low-mass, low-power high frequency airborne radiometers.\nIn this paper, we will describe the design and implementation of the 118 GHz temperature sounder and 183 GHz humidity sounder on the 6U CubeSat. In addition, a summary of radiometer calibration and retrieval techniques of temperature and humidity will be discussed. The successful demonstration of this instrument on the 6U CubeSat would pave the way for the development of a constellation which could sample tropospheric temperature and humidity with fine temporal and spatial resolution.",

            "abstract": "Stress tensor inversions determine an optimal stress tensor from a population of fault-slip data or earthquake focal mechanism data (double couple component of focal mechanisms). Otsubo et al. (2013, RS2013 proceedings) proposed a stress tensor difference map technique to provide a visual representation of stress heterogeneity patterns in the crust based on the stress tensors. The technique displays calculated stress differences between stress tensors estimated from focal mechanism data processed using the stress tensor inversion and an established reference stress. The technique procedure consists of three steps: (1) We chose locations of earthquake event as grid points; (2) We treat states of stress that activates earthquake events at each location as stress tensors at each grid point; (3) We then map the difference between each tensor and a reference stress tensor. States of stress can be detected by the stress tensor inversions (e.g., Otsubo et al., 2008, Tectonophysics 457, 150-160). The technique uses the “stress difference” defined by Orife and Lisle (2003; Journal of Structural Geology 25, 949-957) to show the similarity or dissimilarity between the stress tensors, in which each stress tensor is represented by a point in the four-dimensional parameter space (i.e., the three Euler angles for the principal stress axes and the stress ratio (s2-s3/s1-s3)). We apply the technique to natural earthquake data in Japan island arc that is situated in a subduction zone where four tectonic plates converge. In this study, we show the stress map on the different spatial scales (regional and local scales). In the regional scale, the E-W compressional stress characterized in NE Japan arc is also mapped in central Japan, whose region is concordant with the high strain rate zone (i.e., Niigata-Kobe Tectonic zone). Results in the local scale indicate the spatial stress heterogeneity acting on fault planes of the active faults. The stress mapping technique provides important potential to compare the stress state and spatial geophysical information (e.g. geodesic data, seismic velocity structure and gravity anomaly).",

            "abstract": "Cities are increasingly important drivers in altering global biogeochemical cycles. Yet, we still have a limited understanding of the magnitudes and patterns of carbon profile in urban areas. The modelling of carbon profile enables the determination of the interactions between urban systems and natural ecosystems. In this study, we develop a systems approach to accounting for both economic and natural sources and sinks of carbon emissions. We quantify the carbon emissions associated with each economic sectors and household consumers and assess how these emissions changes with different climatic and socio-economic conditions between urban systems. In addition, the relationship between ecosystem services and carbon emissions is analyzed. The case study of a set of major global cities indicates that the value of ecosystem services has a negative correlation with carbon emissions. We argue that the modelling of urban carbon profile is vital not only for guiding cities towards more effective actions towards reducing carbon footprint, but also for looking into the changing ecosystem function and services in urban systems during urbanization.\nKeywords: carbon emissions, ecosystem services; urbanization; global cities",

            "abstract": "Middle to Late Holocene age, horizontally laminated clays and muds of lacustrine origin predominate the uppermost layers of the valley-fill sequence deposited in the lower Murray River’s bedrock gorge upstream of the set of lakes which separate Australia's largest river system, The Murray-Darling, from its discharge point to the Southern Ocean. The top surface of the Coonambidgal Formation muds is developed at a constant elevation approximately coincident with the Holocene sea-level maximum and the mud deposit thins progressively in thickness upstream from ~30 m to ~10 m over a distance of 150 km due to a gradual, upstream rise in the elevation of the unit's base. Radiocarbon ages for wood and charcoal fragments recovered from two cores indicates the uppermost four to five metres of these muds were deposited after the mid-Holocene sea-level maximum, at below sea-level elevations indicating that the discharge of the Murray-Darling fluvial system was contained and effectively dammed by an obstruction developed downstream of Lake Alexandrina where the present-day river mouth is located. This feature is suspected to be the precursor of the present-day dune and beach-barrier system which occasionally blocks the river mouth and diverts fresh-water flow into the Coorong Wetlands. Muddy sediment from the entire Murray-Darling catchment was effectively trapped in the lower Murray Gorge palaeolake, herein named Lake Mannum, during the mid to late Holocene. High rates of sedimentation (one to two meters per thousand years) produced exquisitely fine-scaled (1 mm to 1 cm) laminations in the upper Coonambidgal Formation. This material has not been disturbed by bioturbation and presents a sediment record with the potential to yield a high-resolution record of the Murray-Darling catchment’s discharge for much of the Holocene. The present-day lower Murray River channel currently presents a meandering but constant planform geometry upstream of Lake Alexandrina that developed as a thalweg incised and entrenched within the Coonambidgal muds, as a somewhat delayed response to the two metre fall in sea-level after the mid-Holocene maximum. The onset of this incision apparently occurred towards the end of the Holocene.",

These analyses have typically assumed that the climate response to land-use CO2 emissions is equivalent to that of fossil fuels and not sensitive to the source of the emission. However, land-use and land-cover change also affects properties such as surface albedo and the strength of terrestrial carbon sinks, which can afford significant feedbacks on both climate and the carbon cycle. Both albedo changes and terrestrial uptake have the potential to affect the climate response to land-use CO2 emissions and challenge the assumption that temperature will respond in a similar manner an equivalent CO2 emission from fossil fuel combustion. In the study, we use a coupled climate-carbon cycle model to assess the climate response to cumulative land-use CO2 emissions and compare it to the corresponding climate response to fossil fuel emissions.",

            "abstract": "For several years, the University of Costa Rica, NASA Centers (e.g., JPL, ARC, GSFC/WFF, GRC) & NASA contractors-partners have made regular in situ measurements of aerosols & gases at Turrialba Volcano in Costa Rica, with aerostats (e.g., tethered balloons & kites), & free-flying fixed wing UAVs (e.g., Dragon Eye, Vector Wing 100, DELTA 150), at altitudes up to 12.5Kft ASL within 5km of the summit. Onboard instruments included gas detectors (e.g., SO2, CO2), visible & thermal IR cameras, air samplers, temperature pressure & humidity sensors, particle counters, & a nephelometer. Deployments are timed to support bimonthly overflights of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) onboard the NASA Terra satellite (26 deployments to date). In situ observations of dilute plume SO2 concentrations (~1-20ppmv), plume dimensions, and associated temperature, pressure, & humidity profiles, validate detailed radiative transfer-based SO2 retrievals, as well as archive-wide ASTER band-ratio SO2 algorithms. Our recent UAV-based CO2 observations confirm high concentrations (e.g., ~3000ppmv max at summit jet), with 1000-1500ppmv flank values, and essentially global background CO2 levels (400ppmv) over distal surroundings. Transient Turrialba He detections (up to 20ppmv) were obtained with a small (~10kg) airborne mass spectrometer on a light aircraft—a UAV version (~3kg) will deploy there soon on the UCR DELTA 500. Thus, these platforms, though small (most payloads <500gm), can perform valuable systematic measurements of potential eruption hazards, as well as of volcano processes. Because they are economical, flexible, and effective, such platforms promise unprecedented capabilities for researchers and responders throughout Central and South America, undertaking volcanic data acquisitions uniquely suited to such small aircraft in close proximity to known hazards, or that were previously only available using full-sized manned aircraft. This work was carried out, in part, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology under NASA contract.

            "abstract": "Soil seasonal freeze/thaw is an important indicator of climate change and have significant influence on ground thermal and hydrological regimes, surface energy and moisture balance. In this study, we used data and information from more than 800 national meteorological stations across China to study soil seasonal frreze/thaw for the period from 1950 through 2010. Mean monthly grid air temperature data are used to investigate soil seasonal freeze/thaw state change and its response to climate change across China. The results show that mean annual air temperature(MAAT) and mean annual ground surface temperature (MAGST) are in the increasing trend by 0.029℃/year and 0.041℃/year respectively from 1967 to 2013; Declined trend of freeze day (FD) and freeze/thaw cycle (FTC) is significant, by -0.22 d/year, and -0.039 frquencies/year respectively. There is an inverse correlation between FD and MAAT and between FTC and MAAT; Mean annual area extent of soil seasonal freeze/thaw state shows a declined trend as MAAT increases. These results are important for understanding the soil freeze/thaw dynamics and effects in the ecosystem in the cold and arid regions.\nKey words: climate change; freeze/thaw state; freeze day; freeze/thaw cycle;",

            "abstract": "The Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory occupies a unique place in the history of the American Meteorological Society and the development of atmospheric science. Through its 129-year history, the Observatory has been operated by founder Abbott Lawrence Rotch (1861-1912), Harvard University, and the National Weather Service, and it is presently run by the non-profit Blue Hill Observatory Science Center. While daily temperature and precipitation records are available through the National Climatic Data Center, they do not include the full record of sunshine duration data that were measured using a Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder. We have recently digitized the Observatory’s original daily sunshine archives, and now present the first full collection and analysis of sunshine records extending from 1889 to the present. This data set is unique and salient to modern climate research because the collection represents the earliest and longest continuous measurements of insolation outside of Western Europe. Together the record provides an unprecedented glimpse into regional climate features, as well as important links between global phenomena and regional climate. Analysis reveals long-term fluctuations of cloud-cover and solar radiation, including signals of regional industrialization, global-dimming, volcanic eruptions, the 11-Year Solar Cycle, and the El Niño Southern Oscillation. Shorter period fluctuations include evidence of an intricate annual pattern of sunshine duration and correlations with the Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and galactic cosmic rays.",

Since April 2013, three seismic swarms have been detected in this area and more than 100.000 events are recorded since November 2013. The largest and more recent swarm has a daily average of 676 events between March and June 2014. Currently a seismic network of 8 seismic stations (5 in the Colombian and 3 in Ecuadorean side) are deployed in this area. Epicenters of more than 315 seismic events with magnitudes Ml>2.0 and 10 or more phases are located in an area 1-4 km south of Chiles volcano with shallow depths (up to 14 km). Most of events have magnitudes between 1.0 to 4.0. Nine events have magnitudes larger than 4.0 and the largest event occurred on April 30. 2014 with a local magnitude of 4.7 and inverse-transcurrent component focal mechanism. Waveforms and spectral patterns define these events as volcano-tectonic. Events with large magnitudes (above 3.0) show a very long-period component. Hot spring and deformation measurements also show signals of volcanic unrest.",

            "abstract": "Thermal boundary layers play a key role for the dynamics of the Earth’s mantle. They mark the transition between the core and the mantle and , at least locally and transient, the transition between the upper- and the lower mantle at a depth of 670 km. There is much evidence that these boundary layers do not resemble the picture of a simple thermal boundary layer, as known from thermal convection at high Rayleigh number. Especially the lower boundary seems to be of complex structure, possible induced by compositionally dense material. Present models of mantle convection, aiming at simulating the complex structure and dynamics of the lower boundary layer require several ad hoc assumptions. Especially the density excess and the mass of compositionally distinct need to be assumed. Both conditions are critical for the dynamics but hardly constrained. The internal boundary at 670 is usually implemented by specifying a density jump through a phase boundary, We have developed models where the internal boundary as well as a thermochemical CMB , displaying topography which result from compositionally distinct piles , develop self consistently without the named ad hoc assumptions. As a starting condition we assume that a chemically stratified mantle, as resulting from fractional crystallization in an early magma ocean , is heated by the hot core. Double diffusive convection in material with strongly temperature dependent viscosity leads then to layering and, in a later state to the formation of a rough lower thermochemical boundary layer.",

            "abstract": "Why do the geosciences suffer from low diversity in our students and workforce? We wonder if something is missing in the way we approach Earth Science learning. Diversity is important not only to produce a population of students that better reflects the overall US population, but also to draw on a diverse approach to understanding important concepts such as found in integrated approaches like Earth Systems Science or Environmental Science. By exploring social science research in culture and diversity, my exposure to Context Diversity Theory appears to show ways to enhance our ability to tackle these large-scale problems in Earth Sciences while attracting diverse students and helping them thrive in the academic setting. The theory postulates that a growing number of individuals now entering higher education bring with them a mix of characteristics described as their “cultural context” (high and low). Context Diversity Theory represents ways of knowing and doing as a binary continuum. One end member of this continuum has individuals approaching the world through a reductionist approach (e.g., low context). The other end member uses a more constructivist approach to science (e.g., high context). While both approaches are successful at describing various aspects of the natural world, our educational system emphasizes the low context perspective. However, many of our students from underrepresented groups may understand the world from a high context perspective. A Multicontextual model would use a balanced approach to evaluating our world, expanding on the commonly low context approach in education. Thus, a reframing process based on Context Diversity Theory may help develop strategies that expand disciplinary culture(s) while not changing the cultural approach of people participating in it. This Multicontextual approach may significantly enhance our ability to develop new approaches to interdisciplinary research while building a strong framework that allows all students to thrive in our programs.",

Past studies, such as Brown et al. [2004], have used a combination of gravity wave observations from all-sky imager data and ray-tracing techniques to study energy transport into the MLT by gravity waves arising from tropospheric sources. In the interest of furthering our understanding of the role gravity waves play in the polar MLT, we have applied those techniques to a large set of all-sky data obtained during the 2013 polar winter from an imager located at South Pole Station, Antarctica. Gravity waves are identified, and their horizontal and temporal characteristics are determined. These are then used as input parameters into the FOREGRATS ray-tracing model to determine possible wave sources outside of the polar MLT. We present the results of this work here.",

            "abstract": "Floods in large river basins are not the simple result of heavy rainfall; rather it is the confluence of the spatio-temporal pattern of single to multiple rainfall events, antecedent moisture conditions, and the river network. Increasing the routing model resolution can improve modeled flood peak, volume and duration; however this can be computationally intensive. We use a high-resolution river routing model coupled to the VIC land surface model over the Ohio and Danube Rivers, both of which are large, flood-prone river basins. Using detailed river channel data from across the Ohio River basin to parameterize the river routing model, we demonstrate that channel width parameters can be transferred to the Danube River, providing a potential strategy for implementing high-resolution models in data-poor regions. Spatial and temporal resolutions at which runoff is generated for the flood model has varying impacts for different sub-basins, and we hypothesize that this is tied to the scale of the flood-generating precipitation events. This modeling framework, which is able to accurately simulate peak flood rate and flood volume, then allows us to explore the relative importance of antecedent moisture conditions and the spatio-temporal pattern of rainfall. We find that working back from the annual maximum flood, we have high correlation with the 7-day runoff preceding the flood event for the Ohio. However starting with the annual maximum 7-day runoff does not necessarily result in a flood, pointing to the importance of considering both the rainfall patterns and river network for flooding in large river basins.",

            "abstract": "Carbonatite is an igneous rock containing greater than 50% carbonate minerals. These rocks are the most common host of REE mineralization and may contain other economic deposits such as uranium, fluorine and niobium. Several researchers have mentioned the presence of a carbonatite phase interspersed among the olivine melilitite-alnöite dikes and diatremes of southeast Missouri, yet a comprehensive validation of this occurrence has, so far, remained elusive. Here we present petrographic, cathodoluminescence, stable isotope and Vis-NIR analysis which support the presence of a carbonatite magma. We identify apparently single generation calcite groundmass surrounding country rock xenoliths and olivine-cored mafic spheroids altered to carbonate and opaque minerals. We present stable isotope data for twenty samples of intrusive and country rock from across the study area. δ18O values for all rock types exhibit little variation with values between 21.9 ‰ and 28.1 ‰ (VSMOW), possibly the result of outgassing during emplacement. Measured δ13C values of (1) carbonate country rocks are between -0.1 ‰ and -2.9 ‰ (VPDB), (2) ultramafic and carbonate-rich mafic rocks range from -3.0 ‰ to -4.6 ‰ (VPDB) and (3) carbonate-rich rocks with volcanic textures, as well as carbonate veins within mafic rocks, fall between -5.4 ‰ to -8.2 ‰ (VPDB). We suggest that this data and initial petrographic observations indicate (1) limited fluid-rock interaction as the host rock clasts have retained their original isotopic signature, (2) an initial ultramafic phase enriched in 13C by a small amount of sedimentary rock due to low initial C content, (3) mantle sourced carbonate fluids entraining fragments of the ultramafic phase and xenoliths. However, future electron microprobe studies may allow us to further constrain the causes for the observed isotopic shifts. We compare laboratory reflectance measurements of a dolomitic intrusive and adjacent dolomite country rock. Absorption bands in the 0.42-1.35 and 2.2-2.4 µm regions indicate unique Si, Fe, Mg, Al and possibly Cr mineralization in the intrusive rock. These features may indicate higher chemical content in addition to, or alternately, intrusive specific mineralogy. This data may allow for future carbonatite identification using remote imaging spectroscopy.",

            "abstract": "Recently, natural hazards has been more unpredictable with increasing frequency and strength due to climate change. Especially, coastal areas would be more vulnerable in the future because of sea-level rise (SLR). In case of Korea, it is surrounded by oceans and has many big cities at coastal area, thus a hazard prevention plan in coastal area is absolutely necessary. However, prior to making the plan, finding areas at risk would be the first step. In order to find the vulnerable area, local characteristics of coastal areas should also be considered along with SLR. Therefore, the objective of the research is to find vulnerable areas, which could be damaged by coastal hazards considering local environment and SLR of coastal areas.\nSpatial scope of the research was set up as 1km from the coastline according to the ‘coastal management law’ in Korea. The assessment was done up to the year of 2050, and the highest sea level rise scenario was used. For risk analysis, biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics were considered as to represent local characteristics of coastal area. Risk analysis was carried out through the combination of ‘possibility of hazard’ and the ‘level of damages’, and both of them reflect the above-mentioned regional characteristics. Since the range of inundation was narrowed down to the inundation from typhoon in this research, the possibility of inundation caused by typhoon was estimated by using numerical model, which calculated the height of storm surge considering wave, tide, sea-level pressure and SLR. Also the level of damage was estimated by categorizing the socioeconomic character into four factors; human, infrastructure, ecology and socioeconomic. Variables that represent each factor were selected and used in damage estimation with their classification and weighting value.\nThe result shows that the urban coastal areas are more vulnerable and hazardous than other areas because of socioeconomic factors. The east and the south coast are more vulnerable when a typhoon comes, on the other hand, the west and the south coast are the mostly inundated areas due to their large difference of tide and low lands. In conclusion, the south coast of Korea is the most vulnerable area. This research could support the efficient planning of coastal zone management plan across the nation.",

            "abstract": "What controls the earthquake rupture area of megathrust is one of the most fundamental questions in subduction zones. In the Nankai Trough, Japan, three major controlling factors have been proposed; surface topographic highs of the subducting plate such as seamounts, locally strong rigidity of upper plate, and friction property of the plate boundary megathrust with abnormal pore fluid pressure. For example, the topographic highs may control the location of asperity due to stronger coupling. The topographic highs also work as a barrier for rock deformation. From the geological point of view, plate boundary megathrust in the seismogenic zone must be composed of fault rock in the brittle regime because of its temperature range from ~150℃ to ~350℃. The friction behaviors of these fault rocks and the effects of abnormal pore fluid pressure are recently one of the major concerns. The third factor is the mechanical property of the upper plate. The property changes through geological time scale due to the growth of the accretionary prism or tectonic erosion. In the case of the Nankai Trough, a pultonic body is situated beneath the place of epicenter and is suggested to have been functioned as an asperity of 1944 and 1946 earthquakes. We examined the on-land geology of the Shikoku island and the Kii Peninsula, SW Japan, and their basement structure and composition beneath the forearc Kumano Basin. We conclude that middle to late Miocene episodic magmatic intrusion and extrusion now controls the rupture area segmentation of the great earthquakes in the Nankai Trough.",

            "abstract": "The aerosol transports from China and Mongolia along the Northwestern wind have large influence on the air quality in Korea and the assessment of the emission in the East Asia region is an important factor in air quality forecasting in Korea.\nIn order to obtain working PM10 emission inventory for the PM10 forecast modeling over East Asia, the Bayesian approach with CAMx (Comprehensive Air-quality Model with extension) forward model was applied. The surface observations of PM10 from EANET (Acid Deposition Monitoring Network in East Asia), API (Air Pollution Index) sites over China and AAQMS (Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations) in Korea were used for the inverse modelling. The predicted PM10 concentrations with a priori emission were compared with observations at monitoring sites in China and Korea. The comparison showed that PM10 concentrations with a priori emissions were generally under-predicted. The result also indicated that anthropogenic PM10 emissions in the industrialized and urbanized areas in China were under-estimated in particular.\nOptimized a posteriori PM10 emissions over East Asia from inverse modelling analysis ware proposed. A posteriori PM10 emissions were much lower than the a priori emission where the soil dust emissions were prevailing. This implied that the dust emission module still had large uncertainty and it was necessary to further research on the improvement of in-line emission modelling for the soil dust. In contrast, a posteriori anthropogenic emissions from industrialized areas such as Beijing and Shenyang sites were slightly higher than a priori emission at regions. Especially, a posteriori PM10 emissions increased in Korea and in Northeast region of China.\nThe predictions of PM10 with proposed a posteriori emission showed better agreement with the observations, implying that the inverse modelling minimized the discrepancies in the model estimation by improving PM10 emissions in East Asia. Further details of inverse modeling results and future research will be discussed in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "There is a dearth of studies investigating the temperature sensitivity of decomposition for decadally cycling soil organic carbon (SOC) (the dominant component of total soil carbon stocks and the most relevant to global change) mostly due to methodological constraints, which is a major issue for research on the potential link between global warming and the current global carbon cycle. We tackled this issue by using two 13C-labeled soils with decadal timescales and a much improved measuring system in a long-term incubation experiment. Results indicated that the temperature sensitivity (as measured by Q10 values) of SOC >23 years was significantly (P<0.001) higher (approximately 45% greater) than SOC <23 years for one soil, and that the temperature sensitivity of SOC >55 years was significantly (P<0.001) higher (approximately 80% greater) than SOC <55 years for the other soil. Furthermore, the temperature sensitivity of decomposition for SOC >23 years or >55 years was substantially higher than that for the entire SOC stocks which was apparently dominated by the fast cycling SOC with turnover times in the range of days to a few years. Because of the use of the improved methods, our data were clearly beyond the reasonable doubt as indicated by the low experimental errors. Overall, these results imply that the decomposition of decadally cycling SOC is highly sensitive to temperature change and vulnerable to loss caused by global warming.",

The streamflows of three downstream stations, Yichang, Shashi and Luoshan are studied to quantify the effect of TGR. Three schemes, including without TGR operation, with conventional and optimal TGR operating rules respectively, are compared of the Yichang station. The multi-input single-output systems models (MISO) are used to simulate the streamflows at Shashi and Luoshan stations with three different inputs of Yichang station, respectively. These streamflows are then analyzed by using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) and the Range of Variability Approach (RVA) to evaluate the hydrologic changes associated with TGR operation. Results indicate that: (1) The 1-day maximum flows of Yichang and Shashi stations are decreased significantly, while their 1-day minimum flows are increased with TGR operation. (2) On the contrary with the maximum flows at Yichang and Shashi stations, the 1-day maximum flow of Luoshan station can be increased caused by encountering between the intervening flood and the post-flood release of the TGR. These findings are beneficial to evaluate the hydrologic systems in the middle Yangtze River after the TGR construction, and provide a scientific foundation for deriving the TGR flood control rules.",

            "abstract": "The tropical Pacific Ocean has experienced significantly decadal changes in physical fields over the last 60 years, which is associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Particularly, observational studies have identified two possible regime shifts in physical processes around 1977 and 1998. However, little is known about their impacts on the equatorial Pacific biogeochemistry and ecosystem structure. Moreover, what are the possible feedbacks of the tropical Pacific biological and chemical changes to the global climate is not known?\nHere, we employ a basin-scale physical-biogeochemical model to study the responses of tropical Pacific ecosystem, biogeochemistry and carbon cycle to climate forcing over 1950-2013. We compare model results for three periods: 1950-1975, 1978-1995 and 1998-2013. Our results indicate significant changes in physics and biogeochemistry associated with the 1977 and 1998 PDO shifts. There was reduction in carbon uptake during 1978-1995, relative to other two periods, however, which is smaller than expected, due to phytoplankton photoadaption that leads to increased carbon to chlorophyll ratio in the upper euphotic zone. Photoadaption also results in clearer waters near the surface, allowing more solar radiation to penetrate to depth which enhances sub-surface production, and leading leads to less heating near the ocean surface. Our studies suggest that under a warm climate, the tropical Pacific Ocean releases less CO2, and absorbs more heat, creating negative feedbacks to the atmosphere.",

There is consistent and continual burning during the dry season in NSSA of many small slash-and-burn fires that, though may be relatively small fires individually, collectively contribute 20-25% of the global total carbon emissions from biomass burning. As a top-down method of estimating biomass-burning emissions, FEERv1.0 is able to yield higher and more realistic emissions than previously obtainable using bottom-up methods. Results of such comparisons performed in detail over Africa will be discussed in this presentation. This effort is carried out in conjunction with a NASA-funded interdisciplinary research project investigating the effects of biomass burning on the regional climate system in Northern Sub-Saharan Africa (NSSA). Essentially, that project aims to determine how fires may have affected the severe droughts that plagued the NSSA region in recent history. Therefore, it is imperative that the biomass burning emissions input data over Africa be as accurate as possible in order to obtain a confident understanding of their interactions and feedbacks with the hydrological cycle in NSSA.",

This suggested a significant gravity wave breaking possibly induced by the dynamic instability. The lidar zonal wind is compared with the wind observed by a meteor radar located at Wuhan, ~200 km west of lidar site, and the lidar temperature is compared with SABER temperature, the results further confirmed this possible significant gravity wave breaking event. After the wave breaking, the sodium density was suddenly enhanced by 10-12 times near 94km. Unlike most sporadic sodium layer (SSL) reported in the literatures, this SSL propagated upward, and passed the west lidar beam around 2min earlier than the east lidar beam (~ 50 km separated in the MLT region). The propagate direction of SSL is agreed with enhanced meridional wind observed by Wuhan meteor radar, indicating that this enhanced sodium layer is likely transported from the north of Hefei.",

            "abstract": "Comau fjord,located in southern Chile (42º22' S, 72º25' W), is a narrow and deep semi-enclosed basin of 68 km-long, 4 km-width and a maximum depth of 500 m. The fjord has a semi-diurnal tidal regime dominated by the M2 component, with maximum oscillations that reach 7,5 m. The stratification and mixing in the Comau fjord was examined in a field campaign during January 2014, using temperature and conductivity sensors and a down-looking ADCP. A very shallow salinity-controlled stratification was detected with a very strong and sharp density change at about 8 m-depth. Furthermore, a surface current of magnitude 5 cm·s-1 due to river discharge was measured and found to interact with both the tide and the wind forcing. A description of the fjord's hydrodynamic was performed using a general 1D vertical k-ε model, in which the stratification was forced by exchanges of energy and momentum with the atmosphere. In addition, the river currents and the effects of tidal influence were incorporated through adding terms in the momentum equation that account for non-linear interaction between current and tide, and a periodic barotropic pressure gradient due to the tide. A decomposition in vertical modes were carried out to analyze the velocity data and the results of the model, which showed that the energy is concentrated in the first barotropic mode, in agreement with the fact that the aspect ratio of stratification h1/(h1+h2) is close to 0. Field data and numerical simulations suggest that the energy injected to the system by external forcings is dissipated in the surface region as a consequence of the strong stratification, which acts as a buffer of the energy transfer, controlling the vertical mixing. The model implemented calculates the vertical dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, allowing the estimation of turbulent diffusion parameter, thus connecting the system's hydrodynamics response with the vertical transport of water quality parameters of the system.",

            "abstract": "Solar-terrestrial coupling is the study of processes which transfer solar wind energy to the magnetosphere creating geomagnetic activity. This coupling depends on properties of the solar wind and particularly on the discrete structures present in the solar wind. These include CMEs, CIRs, and HSS (high speed streams) which have very different characteristics causing different modes of response of the magnetosphere such as magnetic storm, substorms, steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) and others. Among these different modes of response, magnetic storms and substorms are two of the primary ones because they occur frequently and because they can cause considerable problems in technological systems.\nThe differences in solar wind driving conditions during CME, CIR, and HSS provide a good opportunity to examine how the properties of substorms change with solar wind structures and the activity they create. Since the probability of observing these structures is a function of solar cycle phase, the storm-substorm relationship changes with solar cycle phase. It is possible that the nature of solar wind coupling changes with the type of storm, storm intensity, and/or the phase of the storms.\nThe original hypothesis was that a magnetic storm is simply a superposition of substorms. However, some evidences have been found that storms begin to develop before substorms occur. Is substorm occurrence independent of storm development? This would suggest that substorms can be seen in any phase of a storm and even a storm without substorms. There are some recent studies suggest this is possible. However, most of the studies did not take into consideration different solar wind driving conditions. In this study, we will investigate several aspects of the relation of substorms to storms such as: Does the frequency and intensity of substorms change with phase of the solar cycle? Are there differences in these properties between cycles? Are the characteristics of substorms different if they occur within a storm or outside of a storm? Are CME storm time substorms different from CIR storm substorms? Do substorm properties change with phase of the storm?",

            "abstract": "The Kelud eruption was one of the strongest volcanic eruption of the decade. The eruption occurred on the 13th of February 2014 and ejected volcanic ash up to 20 km of altitude. The eruption also destroyed most of the instruments deployed in the near field. Therefore, not much information could be unraveled from the local volcano monitoring system. An explosion was clearly captured at many infrasound stations of the IMS network (and in Singapore), making it one of the biggest volcanic events recorded by the network. The high intensity, deep frequency, and infrasonic detection range of >10,000 km is characteristic of an eruptive column that injects ash into aircraft cruising altitudes and is an evident threat to aviation. The explosion signal was particularly rich in very long periods (~ 200s) and could be resolved as two distinct pulses at some sites. Interestingly, many broadband seismic instruments also recorded this event as far as 5000 kilometers. By inspecting the seismic data of the instruments located closer to the edifice (~ 150 km), we could clearly distinguish two different pulses separated by 17 minutes, followed by the arrival of very low frequencies (thanks to the coupling between ground and atmosphere). One pulse vs two pulses might have strong implications for the subsequent ash modelling. Due to the violence of the events, 4 stations out of 5 were destructed and the remaining one was saturated. This illustrates that data streams from broadband seismometers and infrasound sensors located at safe distances are extremely useful for deciphering the dynamic of the eruption and its implication in term of local, regional and global impact.",

            "abstract": "Coseismic landslide modeling of the Fiordland region of New Zealand explores potential triggers for the Green Lake rock avalanche (GLRA). The GLRA, which occurred post-deglaciation ~14,000 years ago, contains 27 km3 of debris, making it the largest identified landslide in New Zealand and one of the largest on Earth. Due to its large volume, the GLRA was most likely coseismically triggered. The only work to- date suggests MM IX-X shaking from an Alpine Fault event initiated collapse. However, as the Alpine Fault is >80 km from the GLRA, such high shaking intensities seem improbable. Coseismic landslide susceptibility was thus modeled using fuzzy logic and GIS for a number of potential earthquake scenarios to identify a more likely trigger. Existing coseismic landslide inventories for the 2003 and 2009 Fiordland earthquakes were used to determine relationships between landslide occurrence, slope angle, proximity to faults and streams, slope position, and shaking intensity. Slope position and proximity to streams were not found to correlate with the formation of landslides, leaving shaking intensity, slope angle, and proximity to faults to be used in the final models. Modeled earthquake scenarios include a M8.0 southern Alpine Fault rupture, a M8.0 Puysegur Trench earthquake, and a M7.0 on the nearby Hauroko Fault. Coseismic landslide susceptibility is highest at Green Lake for the Hauroko Fault earthquake, reaching values of >0.9 compared to ~0.5 and ~0.6 for the Alpine Fault and Puysegur Trench earthquakes. Consequently, we infer that the GLRA was potentially initiated by a large (M~7) earthquake on the Hauroko Fault and not an M8 Alpine Fault earthquake. This suggests that seismic hazard in the Southern Alps is not limited to the plate boundary.",

Progress in constraining this uncertainty is predicated on understanding how patterns of individual feedbacks aggregate into the regional and global response. A simple model combining regional feedbacks and diffusing both latent and sensible heat replicates the behavior of comprehensive climate models, and provides a framework for how uncertainty in feedback patterns combines to yield uncertainty in both local and nonlocal climate response: while uncertainty in tropical feedbacks induces a global response, the impact of uncertainty in polar feedbacks remains predominantly regionally confined. While the true patterns of the various climate feedbacks remain elusive, understanding these connections is a prerequisite for constraining uncertainty at regional scales, where the environmental and societal impacts of global climate change are predominantly experienced.",

The behavior of stratospheric (~10-mbar) and tropospheric (~100-400 mbar) temperatures is generally consistent with predictions of seasonal variability. These also appear to be long-term periodicities of tropospheric temperatures, with meridionally dependent amplitudes, phases and periods. Temperatures near and south of the equator vary least. There were no variations of zonal mean temperatures associated with any of the “global upheaval” or the corresponding “revival” events that have produced dramatic changes of Jupiter’s visible appearance and cloud cover, although there are colder discrete regions associated with the updraft events that marked the early stages of revivals. Changes visible albedo are accompanied by increases in cloudiness at 700 mbar and higher pressures, together with the mixing ratio of NH3 gas. In contrast to all these changes, the meridional distribution of the 240-mbar para-H2 fraction appears to be time-invariant. Jupiter also exhibits prominent temperature waves in both the upper troposphere and stratosphere that move slowly retrograde in System III. Unlike Saturn’s slowly moving waves, these waves are ubiquitous at certain latitudes and at all longitudes therein. The time scale for coherence of these waves is somewhere between a few days and 4 weeks. These waves are consistent with convectively generated Rossby waves.",

These methane hydrate crystals are very small and existed in the intergranular pores of sandy sediments in sand mud alternate layers. For gas production, several processes for recovering natural gas from the methane hydrate in a sedimentary reservoir have been proposed, but almost all technique are obtain dissociated gas from methane hydrates. When methane hydrates are dissociated, gas and water are existed. These gas and water are flown in pore space of sand mud alternate layers, and there is a possibility that the mud layer is eroded by these flows. It is considered that the mad erosion causes production trouble such as making skins or well instability. In this study, we carried out pore scale numerical simulation to represent mud erosion. This research aims to develop a fundamental simulation method based on LBM (Lattice Boltzmann Method). In the simulation, sand particles are generated numerically in simulation area which is approximately 200x200x200μm3. The periodic boundary condition is used except for mud layers. The water/gas flow in pore space is calculated by LBM, and shear stress distribution is obtained at the position flow interacting mud surface. From this shear stress, we consider that the driving force of mud erosion. As results, mud erosion can be reproduced numerically by adjusting the parameters such as critical shear stress. We confirmed that the simulation using LBM is appropriate for mud erosion.",

            "abstract": "The excess abundances of siderophile elements in the mantle can be explained by metal-silicate equilibrium at mid-mantle depths in magma ocean of the growing Earth. The final equilibrium pressure and temperature would reach 37-60 GPa and melting temperature of the mantle at this pressure (Wade et al. 2012; Siebert et al., 2013). Much severe conditions (>6000 K) have been supposed at the final stage of the Earth’s formation immediate aftermath the moon-forming giant impact (e.g. Canup, 2004), evoking the additional chemical equilibrium between core materials of the giant impactor and the surrounding silicate materials.\nPrevious studies on partitioning of U up to 20 GPa and 2700 K by multi-anvil press have shown very small partition coefficients (D ~10^-5) in S-poor system with oxygen fugacity at around IW-1.5 (Wheeler et al., 2006; Bouhifd et al., 2013). Such a very small D make it difficult to examine the partitioning at higher P-T using laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC) and electron microprobe since the small size of each phase introduce artificial error by such as secondary fluorescent effect (Wade and Wood, 2012). 1% contamination from surrounding silicate may increase D by three orders (i.e. D =10^-2), artificially. One solution is to use laser ablation ICP-MS by carefully ablating only a metallic portion.\nHere, we introduced FIB to isolate the metallic phase from the surrounding silicate melt by slicing off surrounding silicate potion. Consequently, we have successfully obtained the metal-silicate partitioning data of U and Th up to 138 GPa and 5500 K in S-free/S-poor system using LH-DAC. The results show a large temperature dependence of partition coefficient of uranium and thorium, approaching to 0.1~1 at temperature near 5500 K. The pressure dependence was not observed clearly. The large temperature dependence suggests that only the core material of the giant impactor can be enriched in U and Th, which may stratify at the top of the liquid core.",

Such lateral connectors could be formed from reactivated transform faults, transverse faults or lateral ramps. The Zipaquira Anticline (ZA) is a salt-cored structure, with a NE-SW axial axis direction, a clear defined map-view curvature. The Neusa Transverse Zone (NTZ) controls the kinematicof faults and folds. The Zipaquirá Transverse Zone (ZTZ) is located to the southern of the ZA. This transverse zone is a key feature in the area, controlling the ZA and allowing the ascend of diapirs and salt sheets to shallow deeps. Our study was focused on Cretaceous marine sediments and Cenozoic transitional to continental sedimentary sequence around the ZA. 224 oriented cores were collected using a gas portable drill. At each site we collected 10 cores, spaced in order to try to average out secular variation. All samples were oriented using a magnetic compass, corrected to account for the local magnetic field declination. Cores were cut into standard cylindrical specimens and magnetic fabric, rock magnetic and paleomagnetic measurements were done in the shielded room of the paleomagnetic laboratory of in the IAG in the Sao Paulo University. We measured the low-field (AMS) in a Kappabridge (MFK1-FA, AGICO). All samples were thermally demagnetized up to 680°C by a shielded oven, and the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of the specimens was measured. Magnetic mineralogy analyses were carried out to identify and characterize the main magnetic carriers. The ZA is an important example of natural connection between multiple factors controlling deformation and geological evolution. Interaction between salt, transverse zones and folding, the ZA could be considered as a scale model for the Eastern Cordillera. Our goal is related the ZA and the transverse zones using Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) and paleomagnetism to unraveal the kinematic evolution of the anticline and the temporal relationship between the transverse zones and the ZA.",

The assessment is made using dense experimental networks of rain gauges deployed at two, 0.25°×0.25°, sites that represent contrasting topographic features: the lowland plain (mean elevation of 719 m.a.s.l.) site and the highland mountain (mean elevation of 2268 m.a.s.l.). The investigation period covers the summer seasons of 2012 through 2014. Compared to the highland mountain site, the lowland plain site exhibits marked extremes of rain intensity, higher rain intensity, lower frequency of rain occurrence, and smaller seasonal rainfall accumulation. All the satellite products considered tend to overestimate the mean rainfall rate at the lowland plain site, but underestimate it at the highland mountain site. The satellite products miss more rainfall at the highland mountain site than at the lowland plain site. The satellite products underestimate the heavy rain rates at both sites. Both sites have uncertainty (root mean square error) values greater than 100% for 3 hour accumulations of less than 5 mm, or daily accumulations of less than 10 mm, and the uncertainty values decrease with increasing rainfall accumulation. Among the satellite products, CMORPH suffers from a large positive bias at the lowland plain site, and TMPA-RP and TMPA-RT miss a large number of rainfall events that contribute nearly half of the total rainfall at the lowland plain.",

What are effects of the different land management practices (such as those by national parks vs. national forests) on ecosystem disturbances and carbon balance? We present here the methods and results of a study on forest disturbance history over the GYE from 1984 to 2010 reconstructed from Landsat time series stacks and local management records. Annual forest fire, harvest and other disturbances were tracked and separated by integrating a model called Vegetation Change Tracker and the Support Vector Machine algorithm. Local management records were separated into training and validation data for the disturbance maps. Area statistics and rates of disturbances were quantified and compared across GYE land ownership over the multi-decade period and interpreted for implications of these changes for forest management and carbon analysis. Our results indicate that during the study interval (1984 - 2010), GYE National Parks (NPs) and Wilderness Area (WA) had higher percentages of area of forests disturbed compared to GYE National Forests (NF). Within the GYE NPs, over 45% of the forest lands were disturbed at least once during the study period, the majority (37%) was by wildfire. For GYE wilderness area, the total disturbance was 30% of forest with 19.4% by wildfire and 10.6% by other disturbances. In Bridger-Teton NF, 14.7% of forest was disturbed and 3.6%, 0.5% and 10.6% of forest were disturbed by fire, harvest and other disturbances, respectively. For Caribou-Targhee NF, 25% of total forest was disturbed during this time interval and 1.5%, 6.4% and 17.1% of forest were disturbed by fire, harvest and other disturbances, respectively.",

The hybrid geoid model is generally determined by fitting the gravimetric geoid to the geometric geoid undulations from GPS/Levelling data which were presented the local vertical level. For developing the gravimetric geoid model, we performed an optimal remove-restore technique based on the earth gravitaional model 2008 (EGM2008) reference surface. In remove-restore technique, EGM2008 model was analyzed up to harmonic degree and order 2,160, 4-band spherical fast fourier transformation (FFT) with modified stokes kernel and residual terrain model (RTM) reduction method were used for calculating the long, middle and short-frequency part of gravimetric geoid, respectively. A number of land and shipborne gravity data were compiled for modelling the middle-frequency part. A digital elevation model (DEM) gridded by 100m×100m were used for short-frequency part. The accuracy of gravimetric geoid model were evaluated by comparison with geometric geoid ontained from all available GPS/Levelling data in Korea which was about ± 0.107 m with a mean value of -0.360 m. Finally, we developed the hybrid geoid model in Korea, KGEOID12, corrected to gravimetric geoid model with a correction term derived from GPS/leveling data. The correction term is modelled using differences between gravimetric and geometric geoidal undulations at 1,185 GPS/Leveling data. The stochastic model used in the calculation of correction term is a least square collocation method based on second-order Markov covariance function. The post-fit error (mean and std. dev.) of the KGEOID12 was evaluated as 0.001 m ± 0.043 m. This result indicated that KGEOID12 can be used as a vertical datum to determine the height information with a few cm-leveled precision by combining a GNSS positioning technique in Korea.",

            "abstract": "The Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) invigorates the oceanic-atmospheric circulation in the tropics, with far-reaching climate impacts that extend into the high latitudes. A growing number of deglacial proxy reconstructions from the region have revealed the importance of both high- and low-latitude climate processes to IPWP rainfall during the late Pleistocene. Many of these proxies reconstruct the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of rainfall (δ18Oprecip, δDprecip), a powerful tool for understanding changes in climate. However, an increasing number of studies from the region have highlighted the tendency for δ18Oprecip and δDprecip to reflect regional and/or remote circulation processes rather than local rainfall amounts, complicating the reconstruction of IPWP hydroclimate. To better understand high- and low-latitude drivers of late Pleistocene hydroclimate in the IPWP, precipitation isotopic reconstructions must be constrained with both modern observations and independent proxies for rainfall amount.\nWe present a reconstruction of δDprecip using leaf wax compounds preserved in the sediments of Lake Towuti, Sulawesi, from 60,000 years before present to today. We interpret our proxy record with the aid of a new precipitation isotopic dataset from our study site, with daily rainfall isotope measurements to constrain the processes controlling δDprecip. Our Lake Towuti δDwax record is strikingly similar to a speleothem δ18O record from southern Indonesia (Ayliffe et al., 2013) and shares features with other nearby records spanning the Last Glacial Maximum to present. Together, these records indicate that monsoon circulation was intensified in central and southern Indonesia during the glacial period. However, other independent rainfall proxies from Lake Towuti indicate that dry conditions accompanied the intensified monsoon. Regional-scale isotopic depletion during the dry glacial period may have arisen from dynamical and other fractionating processes that are evident in our modern precipitation isotopic data during the monsoon season. We use these findings to reconcile some key differences among proxy reconstructions from the region, and to examine the influence of high-latitude and glacial processes on IPWP glacial climate.",

The ENTLN network is used due to its high detection efficiency for IC (intra-cloud) lightning.\nExamining all TGFs with strong ENTLN radio associations reveals three distinct timescales of activity. The shortest timescale component includes radio signals within ±200 µs of the TGF. The second component includes radio signals within ±6 ms of the TGF. The third component occurs after the TGFs out to ~800 ms.\nSignals in the first component are predominantly the TGFs themselves. The pattern of signals in the second and third components confirms the hypothesis in which IC lightning travels from the upper negative charge layer to the upper positive charge layer, generating a TGF, followed by a flurry of further lightning activity that propagates through both layers. Specifically, the second timescale component consists of vertical strokes, during which TGFs can occur randomly. The third component is the horizontal activity that follows.",

Our ongoing research aims at analyzing simulations of tropical convective activity and tropical cyclone development during one hurricane season over the North Atlantic Ocean, contrasting statistics obtained with a variable-resolution mesh against those obtained with a quasi-uniform mesh. Analyses focus on the spatial distribution, frequency, and intensity of convective and grid-scale precipitations, and their relative contributions to the total precipitation as a function of the horizontal scale.\nMulti-month simulations initialized on May 1st 2005 using ERA-Interim re-analyses indicate that MPAS performs satisfactorily as a regional climate model for different combinations of horizontal resolutions and transitions between the coarse and refined meshes. Results highlight seamless transitions for convection, cloud microphysics, radiation, and land-surface processes between the quasi-uniform and locally- refined meshes, despite the fact that the physics parameterizations were not developed for variable resolution meshes.\nOur goal of analyzing the performance of MPAS is twofold. First, we want to establish that MPAS can be successfully used as a regional climate model, bypassing the need for nesting and nudging techniques at the edges of the computational domain as done in traditional regional climate modeling. Second, we want to assess the performance of our convective and cloud microphysics parameterizations as the horizontal resolution varies between the lower-resolution quasi-uniform and higher-resolution locally-refined areas of the global domain.",

            "abstract": "We numerically simulate slow slip events (SSEs) along the Eurasian-Philippine sea plate boundary in southwestern Japan, to examine the behavior of SSEs in the seismic cycles of megathrust earthquakes within a single model. In our previous study (Matsuzawa et al., 2013), long- and short-term SSEs were reproduced in the Shikoku region, considering the distribution of tremor and the configuration of subducting plate. However, the variation in a seismic cycle was not discussed, because calculated duration is short and modeled region is not sufficiently large to simulate seismic cycles. In this study, we model SSEs and megathrust earthquakes along the subduction zone from the Shikoku to the Tokai region in southwestern Japan.\nIn our numerical model, the rate- and state-dependent friction law (RS-law) with cut-off velocities is adopted. We assume low effective normal stress and negative (a-b) value in the RS-law at the long- and short-term SSE region. We model the configuration of plate interface by triangular elements based on Baba et al. (2006), Shiomi et al. (2008), and Ide et al. (2010).\nOur numerical model reproduces recurrences of long- and short-term SSEs, and the segments of short-term SSEs. The recurrence intervals of short-term SSEs slightly decrease at the late stage of a seismic cycle, reflecting the increase of long-term averaged slip rate in the short-term SSE region as found in a flat plate model (Matsuzawa et al., 2010). This decrease is more clearly found in the Kii region than those in the Shikoku region. Perhaps, this difference may be attributed to the width between the short-term SSE region and the locked region of megathrust earthquakes, as the stress disturbance from transient SSEs, which occur between the locked region and the short-term SSE region (e.g. Matsuzawa et al., 2010, 2013), seems to be relatively small and infrequent due to the narrow width in the Kii region. In addition, as the plate configuration is relatively flat in the Kii region, the decrease of intervals may be easily recognized due to the small disturbance from the curved plate configuration.",

            "abstract": "Natural range of variability of forest fire frequency is of great interest due to the current changing climate and seeming increase in the number of fires. The variability of the annual area burned in Canada has not been stable in the 20th century. Recently, these changes have been linked to large scale climate cycles, such as Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phases and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The positive phase of the PDO was associated with the increased probability of hot dry spells leading to drier fuels and increased area burned.\nHowever, so far only one historical timeline was used to assess correlations between the natural climate oscillations and forest fire frequency. To counteract similar problems, weather generators are extensively used in hydrological and agricultural modeling to extend short instrumental record and to synthesize long sequences of daily weather parameters that are different from but statistically similar to historical weather. In the current study synthetic weather models were used to assess effects of alternative weather timelines on fuel moisture in Canada by using Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index moisture codes and potential fire frequency.\nThe variability of fuel moisture codes was found to increase with the increased length of simulated series, thus indicating that the natural range of variability of forest fire frequency may be larger than that calculated from available short records. It may be viewed as a manifestation of a Hurst effect. Since PDO phases are thought to be caused by diverse mechanisms including overturning oceanic circulation, some of the lower frequency signals may be attributed to the long term memory of the oceanic system. Thus, care must be taken when assessing natural variability of climate dependent processes without accounting for potential long-term mechanisms.",

The active coupling between subsurface hydrology, geochemistry and microbiology will soon be accessible via targeted drilling by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program and the Sloan Foundation, among others. In advance, we collected hyperalkaline fluids with millimolar concentrations of H2 and CH4 from 300-meter deep groundwater monitoring wells to characterize low-temperature reaction pathways in the aquifer. We are also conducting low-temperature serpentinization experiments (40°C, 55°C, 100°C) with crushed dunite and harzburgite from Oman to identify rock-derived energy sources for microorganisms. We are measuring H2 production (up to 400nmol/g), aqueous chemical changes and production of acetate and formate (40-80µM). The aqueous geochemical data from Oman fluids and experiments is coupled with detailed mineralogical investigation of natural samples (XRD, QEMSCAN and synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy of Fe speciation) to identify the operative reaction pathways. The Oman fluids are rich in dissolved H2, but there is an absence of magnetite formation associated with this; instead, we observe extensive serpentine. We are currently investigating the possibility that H2 production is associated with oxidized, Fe3+ in low temperature serpentine.\nWe have enriched stable cultures of methanogenic organisms from deep fluids from site NSHQ04 (pH 10.5, ~1.44 µm/mL CH4). This exciting discovery points to the possibility of deep subsurface life in Oman subsisting under energetic and C limitation. Quantifying the extent of in-situ methanogenesis will be critical to future investigations of microorganisms inhabiting the Oman aquifer to fully understand subsurface carbon cycling and the potential of microbes to control peridotite weathering rates, CH4 production, and carbonate formation.\n1.

            "abstract": "Soil water characteristic (SWC) curve is important for modeling unsaturated flow and reactive transport. SWC also likely influences mineral weathering by affecting water-mineral interactions in the critical zone. The depth profiles of SWC could form as a result of long-term chemical weathering and physical erosion processes. We measured SWCs on samples collected from soil pit and drill cores which captured the weathering profiles from ground surface to slightly weathered bedrock (~7m depth) on a hillslope in Laurel Preserve in West Chester, PA. The weathering profile represents the co-evolution of hydrological and physical properties with varied degrees of weathering and organic matter (OM) content. A WP4C Dewpoint Potentiameter was used to obtain the SWCs (matric potential range: -300 ~ -1.5MPa) for original and OM-removed samples, where OM was removed by heating samples to 350℃ for 24 h. From the WP4C measurement, soil samples from shallower depths (≤44cm) retained more water at a given matric potential, with water contents at shallower depths generally ~2-3 times more than that for saprolite samples from deeper depths at similar matric potentials, indicating that soil water retention increased with degree of weathering. The SWCs measured by WP4C were used to estimate the specific surface area (SSA) using the Tuller and Or (TO) model (Tuller and Or, 2005) , which is based on the assumption that water forms a film on micropore surfaces at the dry end (matric potential ≤ -1.5MPa). The SSA estimation from the TO model followed the same trend as SSA measured with the N2-BET method. However, the estimated SSA was greater than BET-based SSA, indicating possible underestimation of SSA by the N2-BET method. The comparison of SWC and SSA between original and OM-removed samples indicated the presence of a threshold depth of ~40cm. At depths shallower than 40cm, especially at A horizon (OM ≥ 9.5Wt%), OM removal significantly decreased estimated SSA and water content at similar matric potentials, while at deeper depths (OM ≤ 2.7Wt%), the OM-removal treatment resulted in either no change or a slight increase in SSA. The possible existence of a threshold depth indicates that the interactions between OM-mineral sorption and water-mineral interaction differ with depth and are particularly strong within OM-rich surface soils.",

Previous studies have shown that the sensitivity of the glacier mass balance to climate change varies based on climate regime. Here, we quantify the glacier length sensitivity to temperature and precipitation rate changes for idealized glaciers in the inner-tropics, outer-tropics, sub-tropics, and mid-latitudes, using a 1-D flowline model coupled to an energy balance model for ablation. We find that mid-latitude climate regime glaciers are the most sensitive to temperature changes and that sub-tropical climate regime glaciers are the least sensitive (Figure a). We find that sub-tropical climate regime glaciers are the most sensitive to precipitation rate increases and that mid-latitude climate regime glaciers are the least sensitive to precipitation rate decreases while inner-tropical climate regime glaciers are least sensitive to precipitation rate increases. Also, we find in some climate regimes that the direction of climate change (warming vs. cooling or increased precipitation vs. decreased precipitation) affects the magnitude of the glacier length response, suggesting feedbacks and non-linearities. With the exception of sub-tropical climate regime glaciers, of which there are few, glaciers in all other climate regimes retreat more due to a 1°C warming than advance due to a doubling in the precipitation rate, suggesting that continued glacier retreats will be a robust trend given current climate trends.",

            "abstract": "The process of subduction provides continuous chemical and thermal heterogeneity to Earth’s mantle. How heterogeneity is stirred, stretched and distributed depends on the detail of mantle convection as well as chemical and physical properties of mantle materials. Seismic observations have revealed heterogeneities in Earth’s mantle at varying scales. Seismic velocities are controlled by physical parameters such as density, bulk modulus and shear modulus, which are a function of temperature, pressure and composition. Thus, understanding the origin of seismic heterogeneities play an important role in understanding the thermal and chemical state of the present Earth’s mantle. Originating from the CIDER 2014 workshop, our goal is to take a multidisciplinary approach to tackle a variety of questions, foremost what length scales of heterogeneity might we expect from the convecting process and how do they manifest themselves in seismic imaging. This touches upon fundamental issues such as the composition of the mantle, the nature of stirring and mixing, and the nature of large-scale mantle upwellings (LLSVPs). We will investigate the development of heterogeneity in response to various compositions and redox states using existing and new thermochemical mantle convection simulations, and test the sensitivity of seismic measurements to different length scales of chemical heterogeneity. We try to reconcile large differences in length scales of heterogeneity as well as fractional perturbations of seismic velocity and density predicted by tomography and scattering seismic experiments. Preliminary results from the CIDER workshop initiate with conversion of geodynamic models to profiles of seismic velocity and density which are then taken as input models to predict multiply scattered, high frequency, P wave coda envelopes synthesized by a radiative transport technique. The predicted sensitivity of P coda envelopes to varying chemical compositions and heterogeneity length scales are used to constrain mantle composition and heterogeneity. We see that increased density contrast between components, increases the length scale of heterogeneity. Extensions of this work will attempt to systematically incorporate isotope and trace element data obtained by previous studies to sample mantle heterogeneities.",

            "abstract": "Pumice blocks and ash matrix sampled from the 1980 pyroclastic flows at Mt. St. Helens and the 2010 flow at Soufrière Hills, Montserrat, display magnetic Curie temperatures (TC) that vary strongly with depth in the flow. We demonstrate that these TC variations result from variable degrees of cation ordering within Mg- and Al-bearing titanomagnetites, and that the degree of ordering is dependent on the emplacement temperature and post-emplacement thermal history of the sample. Curie temperatures are lowest at the tops of flows where rapid cooling has quenched in a relatively low degree of cation order. Samples that cooled more slowly at depth in the flow evolved towards a higher degree of cation order with a correspondingly higher TC. Isothermal annealing experiments in the laboratory have allowed us to document the time-temperature evolution of the cation ordering and Curie temperature, and we use this data in combination with conductive cooling calculations to forward model stratigraphic variations in TC as a function of emplacement temperature (e.g., Fig.1). Preliminary results show that modeled emplacement temperatures (Templ) are reasonably close to measured or estimated emplacement temperatures. Thermal demagnetization data from lithic clasts incorporated into some flows supports the modeled emplacement temperatures; a low-temperature overprint in the direction of the present-day field is removed at ~Templ. However, the documented variation of TC with thermal history means that care should be taken in interpreting this more traditional lithic-based paleomagnetic paleothermometry data. Modification of Curie and blocking temperatures both during natural cooling and during laboratory thermal treatments could affect lithic-based emplacement temperature estimates.",

            "abstract": "One timeless challenge in rock magnetic studies, inclusive of paleomagnetism and environmental magnetism, is decomposing a sample’s bulk magnetic behaviour into its individual magnetic mineral components. We present a method permitting to decompose the magnetic behavior of a bulk sample experimentally and at low temperature avoiding any ambiguities in data interpretation due to heating induced alteration. A single instrument is used to measure the temperature dependence of the remanent magnetization and to apply different steps of AF demagnetizations and thermal demagnetization. The experimental method is validated on synthetic mixtures of magnetite, hematite, goethite as well as on natural loess samples where the contributions of magnetite, goethite, hematite and maghemite are successfully isolated. The experimental protocol can be adapted to target other iron bearing minerals relevant to the rock or sediment under study. One limitation rests on the fact that the method is based on remanent magnetization. Consequently, a quantitative decomposition of absolute concentration of individual components remains unachievable without assumptions. Nonetheless, semi-quantitative magnetic mineral concentrations were determined on synthetic and natural loess/paleosol samples in order to validate and test the method as a semi-quantitative tool in environmental magnetism studies.",

The highly capitalized energy industry has influenced major changes in the regulatory framework at federal and state levels and entered into mineral lease agreements 100-fold bigger that previously seen in Northern Pennsylvania. At the same time, the technical and scientific issues at play from geology and hydrology through ecology and sociology effectively block local citizens from fully understanding and participating in decision-making about their own futures.\nThe Marcellus Community-Based Performance Program engages adult residents, landowners, and local decision makers in knowledge-generating performances made collectively with those most impacted by shale gas development. Unlike traditional proscenium stage theatre, community-based performance is a collaborative means for exploring a collectively significant issue or circumstance. The choice to use a community-based theatre method, which engages the spectators in the performance itself as a way of making meaning, was based on the following goals\nto achieve good debate;\nto engage community participants in discussion through the exchange of ideas, argument and counter-argument, in an effort to further the education of all;\nto facilitate the perspectives of citizens in communities where different responses to the risk issues exist because of local economies and legacies with resource extraction.\nThe plays and performances, developed around the broad theme of Living with Risk and Uncertainty, use existing research, reports, newspaper articles, and interviews to present the range of perceptions, facts, and issues surrounding the environmental risks associated with natural gas drilling and focused on developing scientific understanding.\nPerformances have been assessed by seeking direct feedback from participants through pre-performance surveys, post-performance dialogues (talk-backs), and exit interviews. Participants have reported the highest levels of interest in performances related to the economy, health impacts of drilling, environmental impacts, and in learning from what other people have to say.",

            "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play an important role in local and regional air quality. A large source of VOCs comes from the oil and gas industry and the Denver-Julesburg Basin (D-J Basin) has seen a sharp increase in production in recent years primarily due to advances in horizontal drilling techniques. To help curb emissions with extraction and production of natural gas and its associated oil, emission control devices are required for facilities emitting over 6 tons of hydrocarbons per year. Within the ozone non-attainment area, which encompasses Denver and much of the front range, enclosed combustion devices (enclosed flares) are required to reduce hydrocarbon emissions by at least 95%. While certification tests indicate that these enclosed combustor devices provide high destruction removal efficiencies, there is considerable interest in knowing how well they perform in the field. As part of Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE) project conducted during the Summer of 2014, the Aerodyne Mobile Laboratory (AML) surveyed oil and gas operations within the Wattenberg gas field and the surrounding D-J Basin. The AML deployed a full suite of gas and particle phase instrumentation providing a comprehensive set of on-line, real-time measurements for the major natural gas components (methane and ethane) and their combustion products (CO2, CO, NOx) using a variety of spectroscopic techniques. Additional gas phase organic gas emissions were made using a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS). Particle number and composition were determined using a condensation particle counter and an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS). A summary of the number of enclosed combustor devices measured and their observed combustion efficiencies will be presented.",

In this study, we examined the physical properties of sediments using on-board data and laboratory experimental data on sediments obtained off Costa Rica margin to understand the distribution of compaction states. Target sites are in the Integrate Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 344 off Costa Rica, including reference sites (U1381 and U1414), frontal prism site (U1412), mid-slope site (U1380) and upper-slope site (U1413). Laboratory experiments for velocity and porosity measurements were conducted with variation of effective pressure.\nPorosity ranges from about 80% to about 53% during experiments. P-wave velocity ranges from about 1.4 to about 1.7 km/s. Velocity-porosity relationships from on-board data and from laboratory experiments are comparable nicely. This comparable trend in Vp-porosity relationship suggests that the relationship between porosity and effective pressure can be applied to most of sediments. The porosity-effective pressure curves under isotropic condition were converted to the curves under uniaxial condition (Teeuw, 1971). Using the normal consolidation curves under isotropic and uniaxial stress conditions, we converted the on-board porosity to effective pressure and fluid pressure.\nFor U1381 Unit I, hydrostatic fluid pressure was estimated as expected as a reference site.\nFor U1414 in another reference site, hydrostatic pressure was observed in Unit I, but lower fluid pressure than hydrostatic pressure was estimated in the upper part of Unit II. Below that, the pore pressure returned along hydrostatic pressure. This boundary can be weakened by higher fluid pressure below the boundary, suggesting that this boundary is likely a precursor of decollement.\nFor Unit 1412 in frontal prism, pore fluid pressure is lower than hydrostatic pressure, suggesting that they have lower porosity possibly caused by tectonic stress.\nFor 1380 in mid-slope andU1413 in upper slope, very low fluid pressure is observed. Because there is almost no age difference at the boundary, the extremely low porosity can be caused by rapid sedimentation and erosion on the seafloor or tectonic stress enhanced-dehydration.",

For example, the urban area with high population density is sensitive to any disturbance from drought and the rural area with unpopular tap water system is insensitive to disturbance of drought but highly risk to water shortage. The resilience of water supply relies on water storage from reservoirs or lakes and water management in urban area but relies on intake from groundwater in rural area. The strategies to water resources should be considered with the water mass flow between urban and rural area. To strengthen the whole water resources system, also, it is important to find where the vulnerability from, how to reduce it and how to build up the resilience for both urban and rural area.\nThis study aims to evaluate the vulnerability and resilience of water resources in different township and city but in the same system. An integrated tool – TaiWAP (Taiwan Water Resources Assessment Program) for climate change vulnerability assessment on water resources is used for climate impact assessment. For the simulation of the complex water supply system, the system dynamics model- VENSIM which is connected with TaiWAP is adopted to simulate a water supply system and evaluate risk of each township and city in a water supply system. The cause of vulnerability will be identified and discussed in both urban and rural. The strategies to reduce vulnerability of water resources for urban and rural will be proposed and discussed in this study.",

            "abstract": "Scientists, policymakers and science communicators generally work from an assumption that science communication, or ‘outreach’, is good and often work from a primarily practice-based knowledge. Meanwhile, the science, technology and society (STS) community, which is strongly grounded in theory and critical analysis, is critical of certain aspects of science communication, particularly in controversial areas of science. Unfortunately, these two groups rarely speak to each other, and when they do they don’t necessarily understand one another. Much of this confusion relates to different assumptions around the goals of science communication, as well as differing understandings of the various roles and responsibilities in both science and society. The result, unfortunately, is a lack of science communication practice and theory informing each other.\nThis research is a collaboration between a scientist communicator with a positive attitude to outreach, who works in the field of climate change; a political theorist with expertise in public dialogue around biotechnology and has been critical of motivations for engaging the public with science; and a science historian and science communicator who has uncovered surprising and significant changes in public attitudes towards nuclear science and technology in New Zealand. By exploring our understanding of science communication through these diverse disciplinary lenses, and considering three fields of science that are or have been highly controversial for different reasons, we have identified several subtleties in both the politics of communicating different areas of controversial science, and the difficulties of finding a common language across social and physical sciences. We conclude that greater reflexivity about our own roles and assumptions, and increased efforts at enhanced understanding across disciplines, is central to applying the theories in STS to the practice of communication by scientists.",

            "abstract": "Crustal extension in deep levels is usually characterized by localizations of extension strain, i.e., ductile detachment zones. These zones provide available information to insight into timing and mechanisms of crustal extension. Many ductile detachment zones, i.e., master detachments zones of metamorphic core complexes, occur widely across the northeastern section of continental Asia, from Transbaikalia (Russia), to SE Mongolia and to NE China. They are the major features in this province and resulted in the development of one of the largest extensional provinces in the world. This paper summarizes ages and major characteristics of these ductile detachment zones, and use them to constrain the polarity and processes of the deep crustal extension in NE Asia.\nMost Late Mesozoic ductile detachment zones in the Transbaikalia region, Sino-Mongolia border tract, and the northwest-central portion of the North China craton (NCC) show a top-to-the-southeast (SE) shear, whereas those in the eastern and southern NCC locally underwent top-to the-northwest (NW) shear. Our new and published zircon U–Pb ages and Ar–Ar ages of biotite and hornblende for pre- or syn- (mylonitized) and post-kinematic (unmylonitized) intrusions from these detachment zones suggest that the mid-lower-crustal extension probably initiated at ca. 150–145 Ma with a peak occurring 145–130 Ma and continued to 130–120 Ma.\nWe interpret the extension in the Transbaikalia, Sino-Mongolia tract to reflect late-orogenic collapse of thickened crust following Middle-Late Jurassic collision along the Mongol-Okhotsk suture. The southeastward extension is probably controlled by crustal-scale top-to-the-SE tangential shear. The combined effect of gravitational loading and thermal-uplifting is considered to be the origin of the late-or post-orogenic collapse. The top-to-the-NW extension in the NE China might reflect antithetic sub-extensional zones or Mesozoic back-arc extension as a far-field effect of Cretaceous Pacific plate subduction.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Dotta Canyon meadow, located in the Red Clover Meadow complex, upper Feather River Watershed, Plumas County, California, was studied to measure sediment volume and groundwater storage capacity in this mountain meadow environment. Groundwater resources in mountain meadows play an important role in providing baseflow to local stream systems during dry summer months. Degraded meadows reduce baseflow contributions to local streams throughout the year impacting the local flora and fauna and water resources downstream. Groundwater storage potential of meadows is a function of the total volume of meadow sediments, the types of sediment present and the effective porosity of those materials. Assessing these properties in meadows is difficult though as meadow environments are commonly sensitive to investigative disturbances like drill rigs and backhoes.\nWe applied seismic refraction techniques to measure the thickness of meadow sediments in the 8.3 km2 Dotta Canyon. Specifically we conducted 42 seismic surveys, utilizing forward and reverse profiles to create a depth to bedrock isopach map of the Dotta Canyon meadow. Using ArcGIS software, aerial photographs and field GPS data to measure and calculate the meadow area and limited hand augering, we were able to calculate the volume of sediment in the meadow to be about 2.5E7 cubic meters. Hand augering in the meadow produced a record of meadow stratigraphy and helped determine appropriate locations for the collection of representative core samples. Representative cores were processed for effective porosity using the water porosimetry method. A mean effective porosity of 38%.was applied to volumetric calculations with results suggesting a groundwater storage capacity of 9.4E6 cubic meters.",

            "abstract": "Rainwater harvesting and water reuse are receiving increasing attention as they hold the potential to effectively improve water conservation efforts. While many technical solutions have been developed, alternative water systems in built environments face significant challenges in the implementation and operational phases. The aim of this study is to examine obstacles to the implementation of alternative water systems in practice and identify criteria of feasible and sustainable solutions that allow bypassing of the identified obstacles. Interviews were conducted with planners, system designers and operators to find out which factors that central actors believe influence successful implementation of such systems. The results were analyzed in light of the literature. The actual performance of the water harvesting and reuse systems in four recently built green buildings in the Province of British Columbia, Canada was analyzed in light of the predicted outcome, according to the criteria identified in the interviews. It was found that the major obstacle to success is that the practical challenges involved in the implementation of alternative systems are underestimated. This, for example, leads to that education strategies for operational staff are not developed, and the staff is left floundering. This study highlights the importance of recognizing the need for strategic and directed educational programs for the human resources who are involved in operating and maintaining rainwater harvesting and water reuse systems.",

            "abstract": "Nitrophenols play important roles in the atmosphere, for example as light-absorbing organic matter, phytotoxins, precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and HONO. Besides emissions from primary sources, nitrophenols are important secondary products from the oxidation of aromatics in the atmosphere. Nitrophenols were measured along with many other organic acids using an acetate ion (CH3COO-) time of flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer (TOF-CIMS) at a site in an oil and gas producing region during Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Study (UBWOS) in 2014. Nitrophenol and methyl-substituted nitrophenols exhibited distinct diurnal profiles, with high concentrations at night and a minimum observed during the daytime. This is consistent with photolysis being the dominant sink of these species. For this study, nitrophenols are most likely formed in situ, while primary emissions (e.g. biomass burning, oil and gas emissions) are negligible during this campaign. We will quantify the contributions of gas phase reactions of phenols with OH and NO3 radicals to form nitrophenols. The importance of heterogeneous reactions resulting for nitrophenol formation, including N2O5 chemistry on surfaces and photolysis of nitrate in the snow will be also explored using vertical gradient measurements at two different heights (1.0 m and 18.5 m). In contrast with mono-nitrophenols, dinitrophenol showed a daytime maximum, indicating that the formation of dinitrophenol is driven by photochemistry in the atmosphere. The results of this study will be helpful to improving our understanding the budget of nitrophenols and oxidation mechanisms of aromatics in the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Solar energy installations in arid and semi-arid regions of India are rapidly increasing, due to technological advances and policy support. Even though solar energy provides several benefits such as reduction of greenhouse gases, reclamation of degraded land, and improving the quality of life, the deployment of large-scale solar energy infrastructure can adversely impact land and water resources. A major challenge is how to meet the ever-expanding energy demand with limited land and water resources, in the context of increasing competition from agricultural and domestic consumption. We investigated whether water consumption for solar energy development in northwestern India could impact other water and land uses, and explored opportunities to co-locate solar infrastructures and agricultural crops to maximize the efficiency of land and water use. We considered energy inputs/outputs, water use, greenhouse gas emissions and economics of solar installations in northwestern India in comparison to Aloe vera cultivation, a widely promoted land use in the region. The life cycle analyses show that co-located systems are economically viable in some rural areas and may provide opportunities for rural electrification and stimulate economic growth. The water inputs for cleaning solar panels and dust suppression are similar to amounts required for aloe, suggesting the possibility of integrating the two systems to maximize water and land use efficiency. A life-cycle analysis of a hypothetical co-location indicated higher returns per m3 of water used than either system alone. The northwestern region of India is experiencing high population growth, creating additional demand for land and water resources. In these water limited areas, coupled solar infrastructure and agriculture could be established on marginal lands, thus minimizing the socioeconomic and environmental issues resulting from cultivation of non-food crops (e.g. Aloe) in prime agricultural lands.",

            "abstract": "We present a generalized model for the origin of oceanic arc basalts (OAB) and oceanic island basalts (OIB). This is realized by an integrated study of their major-trace element and stable-radiogenic isotope compositions. Many continental basalts are geochemically indistinguishable from common OIB, a fact that requires part of the upper mantle to have been a common reservoir beneath both oceans and continents. In addition, this reservoir must have been isolated from the convective asthenosphere for preservation of geochemical anomalies. Common OAB and OIB show consistent enrichment of LILE and LREE relative to normal MORB. On the primitive mantle-normalized spidergram, however, OAB are characterized by negative Nb and Ta anomalies but a positive Pb anomaly, whereas OIB show positive or no Nb and Ta anomalies but a negative Pb anomaly. Such differences are attributed to the difference in the property of metasomatic agents (aqueous solutions, hydrous melts and supercritical fluids) derived from subducting crustal rocks. The metasomatic agents are highly enriched in fluid/melt-mobile incompatible trace elements such as LILE and LREE, transferring enriched components from the crustal rocks to the mantle sources of OAB and OIB. The stability of rutile in the subducting crustal rocks dictates the abundance of Nb and Ta in the metasomatic agents. Lead is preferentially partitioned into the metasomatic agents when released at subarc depths, whereas dehydrated Pb-poor restites were subducted to greater depths. This explains the positive Pb anomaly in OAB but the negative Pb anomaly in OIB. We accept the assumption that normal MORB are derived from partial melting of the normal asthenospheric mantle, a common reservoir of isotopic depletion. We extend the chemical reaction at the slab-mantle interface in subduction channel from subarc depths to those above the mantle transition zone, generating metasomatic ultramafic rocks (metasomes) in the upper mantle. The reaction at subarc depths produces serpentinized to chloritized peridotites, serving as the source of OAB; the reaction at greater depths produces pyroxene-rich peridotites, pyroxenite and hornblendite, serving as the source of OIB. These metasomes have low solidii and thus are more susceptible to partial melting than the peridotite at the same P-T conditions.",

US Geoscience Information Network (USGIN) is a freely available data integration framework, jointly developed by the USGS and the Association of American State Geologists (AASG), in compliance with international standards and protocols to provide easy discovery, access, and interoperability for geoscience data. USGIN standards include the geologic exchange language ‘GeoSciML’ (v 3.2 which enables instant interoperability of geologic formation data) which is also the base standard used by the 117-nation OneGeology consortium. The USGIN deployment of NGDS serves as a continent-scale operational demonstration of the expanded OneGeology vision to provide access to all geoscience data worldwide.\nUSGIN is developed to accommodate a variety of applications; for example, the International Renewable Energy Agency streams data live to the Global Atlas of Renewable Energy. Alternatively, users without robust data sharing systems can download and implement a free software packet, “GINstack” to easily deploy web services for exposing data online for discovery and access.\nThe White House Open Data Access Initiative requires all federally funded research projects and federal agencies to make their data publicly accessible in an open source, interoperable format, with metadata. USGIN currently incorporates all aspects of the Initiative as it emphasizes interoperability. The system is successfully deployed as the National Geothermal Data System (NGDS), officially launched at the White House Energy Datapalooza in May, 2014.

            "abstract": "The magnitude-9.3 Sumatra-Andaman Islands earthquake of December 26, 2004, increased global awareness to the destructive hazard of earthquakes and tsunamis. Post event assessments of global coastline vulnerability highlighted the Caribbean as a region of high hazard and risk and that it was poorly monitored. Nearly 100 tsunamis have been reported for the Caribbean region and Adjacent Regions in the past 500 years and continue to pose a threat for its nations, coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic seaboard of North and South America.\nSignificant efforts to improve monitoring capabilities have been undertaken since this time including an expansion of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Global Seismographic Network (GSN) (McNamara et al., 2006) and establishment of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Coordination Group (ICG) for the Tsunami and other Coastal Hazards Warning System for the Caribbean and Adjacent Regions (CARIBE EWS). The minimum performance standards it recommended for initial earthquake locations include: 1) Earthquake detection within 1 minute, 2) Minimum magnitude threshold = M4.5, and 3) Initial hypocenter error of <30 km.\nIn this study, we assess current compliance with performance standards and model improvements in earthquake and tsunami monitoring capabilities in the Caribbean region since the first meeting of the UNESCO ICG-Caribe EWS in 2006. The three measures of network capability modeled in this study are: 1) minimum Mw detection threshold; 2) P-wave detection time of an automatic processing system and; 3) theoretical earthquake location uncertainty. By modeling three measures of seismic network capability, we can optimize the distribution of ICG-Caribe EWS seismic stations and select an international network that will be contributed from existing real-time broadband national networks in the region.\nSea level monitoring improvements both offshore and along the coast will also be addressed. With the support of Member States and other countries and organizations it has been possible to significantly expand the sea level network thus reducing the amount of time it now takes to verify tsunamis.",

Stakeholder needs in the High Plains Region have evolved over time from simple data requests to inquiries about the impacts of various climate-related events. At this time, climate impacts may be reported in numerous locations such as newspapers, scholarly journals, and extension articles. In order to meet the increasing demand for climate impact information, HPRCC is beta-testing an online tool which synthesizes, archives, and displays impacts related to extreme climate events from multiple sources. The tool is intended to fulfill the needs of two general types of users – those who need a place to archive climate impact information and those seeking such information. As such, there are two main components to the tool: 1) a back-end interface where an impact information database is populated and 2) a front-end interface where users may browse the impacts. On the front-end, users can select an area (i.e. river basin, state, county warning area) and search for climate-related impacts within that area. Key impacts include the following sectors: agriculture, ecosystems, energy, human health, society, transportation, and water resources. In this regard, information can also be useful for future National Climate Assessment activities. Ultimately, an understanding of impacts to extreme events by sector will provide critical information for improved decision-making and adaptation strategies.",

We use Hestia, an innovative “bottom up” approach for estimating FFCO2 emissions in the Los Angeles (LA) megacity and Southern California Air Basin (SCAB) which account for ~53% of the FFCO2 emissions in California. Hestia-LA, in coordination with “top down” atmospheric CO2 measurements, will provide baseline FFCO2 emissions, help monitor changes in emissions, and develop emissions mitigation policies. Hestia-LA characterizes FFCO2 emissions at the building/street spatial scale (10-100 m) and at hourly time steps in the basin by combining data on residential and commercial building emissions, industrial processes, electricity production, and different transportation sectors. We report here on the construction of the spatial and temporal structure in two key transportation sectors within the SCAB: on-road vehicle (46%) and aircraft (2%) emissions.\nWe quantified on-road traffic emissions by merging traffic data from Southern California Association of Governments, California Freeway Performance Measurement System and modeled motor vehicle emissions from EPA’s NMIM model. Preliminary analysis shows that (1) LA and Orange counties dominate the annual FFCO2 emissions from urban freeways and arterials, and (2) LA county has a wider peak traffic period during weekdays (2-6pm) than the other four counties (4-5pm).\nWe characterized airport emissions by integrating information from Federal Aviation Administration, Los Angeles World Airports, and Airnav LLC for the temporal structure of aircraft arrivals and departures, and the National Emissions Inventory for total annual aircraft emissions. We categorized the 47 airports in LA basin based on the volume and type (commercial, general aviation and military) of aircraft traffic, and then assigned appropriate hour-of-day and day-of-week traffic volume-specific CO2 emission patterns to each airport. We found that Los Angeles international airport has a unique diurnal traffic pattern with a broad peak during 6am-9pm and differs from the more prevalent general aviation airports which peak in traffic during 10am-4pm.",

Linear analysis shows low predictability of EASM-WNPSM precipitation which is simply represented by Meiyu-Baiu rainbelt. Similar studies on nonlinear monsoon phases and dynamical interaction between local and large-scale phenomenon have not been performed previously because of difficulties in separating the irregular monsoon intraseasonal system. By applying a cluster analysis to daily monsoon circulation indices, we found four major intraseasonal phases named as pre-Meiyu&Baiu, Changma&Meiyu, WNPSM, and Monsoon Gyre modes. The dynamic-thermodynamic structure of four modes indicates that pre-Meiyu&Baiu and WNPSM are dominated by thermal advection resulted in midlatitude upper-level jet while Changma&Meiyu and Monsoon gyre are dominated by low-level moisture transport along the western North Pacific subtropical high which links tropics to midlatitude. Moreover, this method allows us to estimate the asymmetric ENSO response to intraseasonal monsoon variability providing a source of predictability. It is identified that Changma&Meiyu and Monsoon Gyre mode are closely linked to tropics through the subtropical pressure system while pre-Meiyu&Baiu and WNPSM mode have compartmental midlatitude system. The model experiments further support the interactive air-sea coupling over the Indian Ocean and western Pacific have a key role in generating WNPSH.",

HAWC’s primary purpose is the study of both: galactic and extra-galactic sources of high energy gamma rays. HAWC will consist of 300 large water Cherenkov detectors (WCD), each instrumented with 4 photo-multipliers (PMTs). The Data taking has already started while construction continues, with the completion projected for late 2014. The HAWC scaler system records the rates of individual PMTs giving the opportunity of study relatively low energy transients as solar energetic particles and the solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays. In this work, we present the observations of scaler rate enhancements associated with lightning activity observed close to HAWC (i. e. at high altitude). In particular, we present the time and space coincidence of the lighting strikes and the scaler enhancements and our preliminary speculations on the origin of the detector response to the lighting activity.",

            "abstract": "The Pegasus Basin, on the southern end of New Zealand’s Hikurangi margin, developed as a passive margin from the end of subduction along the Chatham Rise around 105 Ma to the initiation of the modern plate boundary around 25 Ma. Multi-channel seismic reflection data acquired by the New Zealand government in 2009 and 2010 show well-developed bottom-simulating reflections (BSRs) throughout the basin and also indications for deeply-sourced fluid migration.\nWe have used the seismic data, together with previously published age constraints, to identify and map key stratigraphic horizons from the ancient subduction margin (on the southeast), through the sedimentary basin, and up onto the modern subduction margin (on the northwest). We have also used BSRs to map the extent of the gas hydrate system throughout the basin. These interpretations are being used to construct a 3D geological model of the basin that will be converted to depth using seismic velocities from the available data. The geological model will provide the basis for modelling fluid flow processes through the basin and ultimately to simulate gas hydrate formation using Petromod. We will present the latest results of this project and outline the implications for gas hydrate formation in the Pegasus Basin.",

            "abstract": "Located at the northern part of Taiwan, Taipei is the most densely populated city and the center of politic, economic, and culture of this island. North of the Taipei basin, the active Tatun volcano group with the eruptive potential to devastate the entire Taipei is only 15 km away from the capital Taipei. Furthermore, the active Shanchiao fault located in the western margin of Taipei basin. Therefore, it is not only an interesting scientific topic but also a strong social impact to better understand the assessment and mitigation of geological hazard in the metropolitan Taipei city.\nIn this study, we use 12 high resolution X-band SAR images from the new generation COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation for associating with leveling and GPS data to monitor surface deformation around the Shanchiao fault and the Tatun volcano group. The stripmap mode of CSK SAR images provides spatial resolution of 3 m x 3 m, which is one order of magnitude better than the previous available satellite SAR data. Furthermore, the more frequent revisit of the same Area of Interest (AOI) of the present X-band missions provides massive datasets to avoid the baseline limitation and temporal decorrelation to improve the temporal resolution of deformation in time series. After transferring the GPS vectors and leveling data to the LOS direction by referring to continuous GPS station BANC, the R square between PS velocities and GPS velocities is approximate to 0.9, which indicates the high reliability of our PSInSAR result. In addition, the well-fitting profiles between leveling data and PSInSAR result along two leveling routes both demonstrate that the significant deformation gradient mainly occurs along the Shanchiao fault. The severe land subsidence area is located in the western part of Taipei basin just next to the Shanchiao fault with a maximum of SRD rate of 30 mm/yr. However, the severe subsidence area, Wuku, is also one industrial area in Taipei which could be attributed to anthropogenic effect. In the future, we will use all available images to monitor the temporal and spatial variation in deformation to better understand the activity of the Shanchiao fault.",

            "abstract": "We perform attenuation tomography of the Earth's uppermost inner core (~300 km below the inner core boundary) by means of linear inversion. By parameterising the uppermost inner core into blocks, each of which has a certain fixed value of quality factor Q, we performed synthetic tests assuming different attenuation models. For this we use a dataset of 51 global events. Synthetic tests showed that using current dataset and block parameterisation of 30 and 45 degrees it is possible to recover the underlying attenuation anomaly pattern in linear inversion. Attenuation models used for these tests include north-south hemispherical model with boundary at the equator, hemispherical model with boundaries defined by Tanaka and Hamaguchi (1997), a checkerboard model and various combinations of meridional and zonal sections of interchanging Q. All of these models are successfully recovered in linear inversion. Using the simulated annealing algorithm we obtain t* measurements from 51 events and use these observed data to perform tomography of the uppermost inner core.\nHowever, the limitation of block parameterisation is imposing strict boundaries in the model. We wish to avoid subjective parameterisation of the boundary between low and high Q values in the inner core and for this reason we employ different inversion methods. In this way we hope to resolve some of the ongoing debates regarding the attenuation structure of the inner core and mechanisms thereof, with a stress on recent observations pointing to a degree-two heterogeneity (Attanayake et al, 2013; Iritani et al, 2014) opposing the previous view of degree-one heterogeneity. By expanding our dataset including more global events we also aim to improve the resolution of our results.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic sea ice extent has dramatically decreased in recent decades, which has become one of the most distinct signals of the continuing climate change. Recently, a development of sea ice prediction models has been extensively studied, but the predictability for three months ahead or longer remains poor due to the complexity of the Arctic climate system. Here we show a new and simple seasonal prediction of the Arctic sea ice in summer. Since the thermodynamic process is important in the sea ice melting, our focus is to predict the summer Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) by using the observed total-sky Net Radiant Flux (NRF) at the top of the atmosphere that indicates the heat input into the open sea and sea ice surface. In the observation, SIC and NRF have a strong lagged correlation, that is, a decrease in SIC anomalies in late summer/early autumn (August-September-October) was followed by the increase in NRF in June (correlation coefficient, r ≈ -0.83 with a lag of 2 to 4 months). Thus, NRF in June can be used as a major predictor of SIC in the prediction model. The prediction model is based on the Markovian stochastic method characterized by a transition matrix describing the probabilities of particular transitions from NRF to SIC anomalies. As results, the area-averaged Arctic SIC predicted by the model is found to be more closer to the observation than that by the linear regression model. Moreover, the model proved considerably good results in regions, specifically Beaufort Sea and East Siberian Sea, although it has a limitation of predicting the extreme SIC anomalies in a regional scale. The results suggest that the present stochastic model designed with simplicity astonishingly has the great advantage that up to 4-months-ahead prediction of Arctic SIC in summer is possible with accuracy.",

            "abstract": "The Woodlark Basin is one of few places where it is possible to investigate an active transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading. The Papuan Peninsula began N-S extension at 8.4 Ma, followed by seafloor spreading at 6 Ma. To date, seafloor spreading has propagated west 500 km. In the proximity of the modern rifting to spreading transition the northern margin has subsided 2-3 km with minor brittle faulting. The southern margin has subsided a similar amount but is characterized by large faults. Previous work shows that the observed continental extension is half the amount resolved by seafloor-spreading kinematics. It has been proposed that this discrepancy is due to mid-crustal decoupling, where the mantle lithosphere and lower crust are detached.\nThe N-S profile across the current rifting to spreading transition is a natural laboratory for extensional environments. The work herein presented is a continuation of prior studies, but incorporates a new approach to extensional modeling, specifically the use of the Move software package. The profile presented includes ODP Leg 180 wells. Structural and stratigraphic interpretations originate from nearby seismic lines. Biostratigraphy and paleomagnetism data are the basis for age-depth relationships. Interpreted sedimentary packages permit backstripping and decompaction models that assume Airy Isostasy. Extension is estimated through the restoration of fault heaves and back rotation of fault blocks. From previous studies we know the width of the Papuan Peninsula to be 320 km in the vicinity of the profile presented. Furthermore, those studies estimate 220 km of extension across the margin based on Euler pole kinematics. This gives an original margin width of about 100 km, and Beta greater than 3. We present herein an extension estimate based on 2-D kinematic modeling, and contrast this with prior extension estimates of 111-115 km.",

            "abstract": "AGU’s demographic characteristics changed during the period 2006-2014 in response to the aging of the Baby Boom generation and an increase in the number of women geoscientists. This analysis deals only with the portion of AGU’s membership with mailing addresses within the US, a group that comprised 65% of the worldwide total in 2006 and 61% of the total membership in 2014. Using the US membership data that include both the members’ birthdate and gender, a comparison of the population structures in 2006 and 2014 reveals characteristics of the changing US workforce.\nSince 2006, the percent of the US membership represented by the Baby Boom has decreased 5.2%, from 37.2% to 32.0%. That trend will continue for the next 20 years and the rate will accelerate before slowing again. At the same time the Boomers are decreasing in number, the percentage of the membership represented by the more recent age-cohorts (born 1965-1989) has grown. For example, in 2006, the 1985-1989 cohort was barely represented (0.14%). By February 2014, the cohort had become 8.25% of the U.S. membership. The four cohorts covering birth years 1965 through 1984, each increased slightly in size. In addition, each had a larger number of women, reflecting AGU’s increased female membership from 22.5% to 25.3%. The 1985-1989 cohort is somewhat smaller than the previous four cohorts. If the smaller size of this represents a reversal of the growth trend over the last 25 years, the implications for the size of the US workforce are important.\nPerhaps the most significant change in the demographic structure of AGU’s US membership is that the general shape of the age-gender diagram, while still asymmetrical because of the larger number of men, is becoming more straight sided due to the similar size of recent cohorts. This shape is characteristic of stable populations when dealing with self-reproducing groups. The implications for the future of a scientific society are less clear, but the cause reflects a period of relative stability without radical changes (either growth or shrinkage). As the members who were born during the Baby Boom and those who reached the workforce during the petroleum bust of the 1980’s continue to leave AGU, the society’s US membership (and to some degree the size of the workforce) seems to have stabilized at something near current levels.",

At about 23km horizontal grid size, more realistic topographic effects included in the HiRAM benefit the monsoon modeling; for example, a substantial effect of the mesoscale mountain ranges in South Asia (includes Southeast Asia) on anchoring and enhancing precipitation as well as the monsoon circulation. The projected changes of the monsoon subsystems are significant in South Asia, East Asia, and the western North Pacific (WNP), and the changes are likely related. The monsoon response to global warming provides an avenue for exploring the monsoon internal connection. However, details about the potential interaction between various monsoon subsystems remain unclear; in particular, what it is sensitive to, and how it is connected to large-scale circulation.\nWe also focus on the modulation of the monsoon seasonality. In South Asia, direction of the monsoon precipitation response in the early summer (reduced) is opposite to in the late summer (enhanced). The projected precipitation changes of South Asia could be connected to the projected changes of the monsoon subseasons in the East Asia-WNP domain. The latter can be primarily characterized by the Meiyu-Baiu rainy season and the WNP monsoon. We are also finding that the changes of thermal and dynamical condition under global warming alter the extreme precipitation and the tropical cyclone formation. Mechanism leading to the regional and subseasonal contrast of the monsoon is being investigated.",

            "abstract": "IBEX and the Voyager spacecraft provide unique data sets that enable us to study plasma conditions in the key regions of the heliosphere: the termination shock (TS), at the heliospause and beyond. Whereas Voyager provides in-situ plasma data IBEX uses neutral atoms to remote sense the plasma conditions in interstellar space, the heliopause, and the termination shock. The IBEX data sets revealed a ribbon feature which was unexpected and which formation mechanism is still unknown. Even the location of the source is not known considering the fact that IBEX measures neutral along a line of sight. Aside from the ribbon feature the distributed ENA flux shows temporal variations that are unexplained, in particular at solar wind energies. Furthermore, Voyager observations questioned the role of the termination shock being the main accelerator for high-energetic ions. All of these outstanding science questions are associated with wave-particle interaction and turbulence in most likely different key regions of the heliosphere.\nHybrid simulations, which included all kinetic processes self-consistently on the ion level, are a proven to be a very powerful tool to investigate wave-particle interaction, turbulence, and phase-space evolution of pickup and solar wind ions. We performed 3D multi-species hybrid simulations for an ion/ion beam instability to study the temporal evolution of ion distributions, their stability, and the associated ENA generation under the influence of self-generated waves in the heliosheath. We investigated the energetization of ions downstream of the TS, the turbulence, and growth rate of instabilities in the heliosheath. The simulations show that ions can be accelerated downstream of the TS by trapping ions in coherent wave fronts.",

            "abstract": "Mafic sills and lavas of the c. 183 Ma Ferrar Large Igneous Province are assumed to have originated from the same parental magma source with minor differentiation during long-distance transport, storage, and emplacement. However, a brief field study by Marshak et al. (1981) reported that the Butcher Ridge Igneous Complex (BRIC), a ~6000 km3 glassy hypabyssal intrusion in the Cook Mountains of southern Victoria Land, reputed to be a significant magma distribution center within the Ferrar LIP, contains lithologies and structures consistent with a major episode of magma differentiation. At present, based on available data, it remains unclear whether production of compositionally diverse magmas, ranging from 53 to 73 wt. % SiO2, originated purely via fractional crystallization of a parental Ferrar magma(s) or whether crustal contamination, and/or re-melting of granitoid basement played a significant role in driving differentiation. In addition, the timing and duration of BRIC magmatism with respect to the main phase of Ferrar magmatism is debated. Here we present the results of new isotopic, major- and trace-element geochemical analyses for (n=130) BRIC samples that, when combined with detailed petrologic and thermodynamic modeling, delineate the geochemical diversity within the BRIC, and enable detailed comparisons with new and existing data for the remainder of Ferrar LIP. In addition, new high-resolution U-Pb ID-TIMS geochronology on baddeleyite from both the BRIC and Dolerite sills from the Ferrar LIP indicate magmatism occurred over a relatively short time span (<<100ka) and overlaps with the main phase of Ferrar magma emplacement. These data are combined with ongoing geochemical and thermodynamic modeling to develop a petrogenetic model for the BRIC and establish the origins and petrologic significance of silicic magmatism within the Ferrar LIP and other LIPs globally.",

            "abstract": "Global warming could decompose submarine methane hydrate and cause methane release into the ocean. The released methane causes oxygen depletion via oxidation; however, the global impact of this process is yet to be quantitatively investigated. We have projected the potential impact of oxygen depletion due to methane hydrate decomposition via numerical modeling. We find that the global methane hydrate inventory decreases by approximately 70% under four times CO2 concentration and is accompanied by significant global oxygen depletion on a timescale of thousands of years. In particular, we demonstrate the great expansion of suboxic and hypoxic regions, having adverse impact on marine organisms and ocean biogeochemical cycles. The expansion induced by methane release is half (same) of that induced by oxygen solubility decrease due to seawater warming, under the condition that half (all) the methane decomposed into free gas is released from the seafloor to the ocean. This is because methane hydrate decomposition primarily occurs in the Pacific Ocean, where present-day seawater has low oxygen concentration. Consequently, severe oxygen depletion occurs in this region, particularly in so-called oxygen minimum zones. Besides the decrease in oxygen solubility and reduced ventilation associated with global warming, the process described in this study is also important in oxygen depletion. We conclude that the ongoing emission of anthropogenic CO2 triggers ocean oxygen depletion on millennial timescales.\n",

Although several mechanisms, such as Rayleigh Taylor instability, unzipping, and rhythmic convection (e.g. Shibano et.al. 2012, 2013), have been proposed for characterizing upward migration process in a crystalline magma chamber, their contributions in the long geodynamical time scale are not clear yet. Thus we perform numerical simulations to investigate the thermal evolution of the magma chamber with basal intrusion in three dimensions.\nIn order to solve high-viscosity fluid and particle dynamics for modelling a melt--crystal jammed state of the magma, we have developed a coupled Stokes--DEM simulation code with two key techniques: formulation of particle motion without inertia and semi-implicit treatment of particle motion in the fluid equation (Furuichi and Nishiura 2014). Our simulation can successfully handle sinking particles in a high-viscosity fluid.\nWe examine different types of the granular media heated from the bottom with varying parameters. We especially focus on pattern of the settling particles against the melt density contrast between upper and lower region.",

            "abstract": "Fish removal was the earliest major human influence on the marine environment and global fishing effort has increased by orders of magnitude since its ancient origins, depleting predatory fish biomass by as much as 90% (Myers and Worm, 2003). It stands to reason that any impact this may have had on ocean biogeochemistry could have been preserved in existing high-resolution palaeoceanographic records. A severe depletion of upper trophic levels may result in a top-down ecological regime shift, manifesting in the form of trophic cascades and alterations to nutrient cycling and carbon export. Changes of this nature might be recorded in the sedimentary record through proxies such as fish remains, total organic carbon, 15N, and microfossil assemblages. However, these high-resolution proxies are more typically interpreted as reflecting climatic or oceanographic changes. This project searches for sedimentary signals of fish harvesting by compiling existing paleoceanographic data and comparing it to historical and archaeological records of ecosystem exploitation. Hypotheses of potential sedimentary signatures and methods of analysis will be discussed and results from case studies such as the Peruvian Upwelling Zone, North Sea, and Scotian Shelf will be presented. Identifying a sedimentary signature of fish harvesting will clarify interpretations of recent palaeoceanographic proxies and help define the role that fish can play in biogeochemical dynamics. This will aid in parameterizing upper trophic levels in ocean biogeochemical models and establishing pre-human baselines for ecosystem-based fisheries management.\n",

After early successes in helioseismology, laboratory studies and earth-seismology, this technique found broad application in global and regional seismology. This development came with an increasing understanding of pre-processing and cross-correlation workflows to yield an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Helioseismologist rely heavily on stacking to increase the SNR. Until now, they have not studied different spectral-whitening and cross-correlation workflows and relies heavily on stacking to increase the SNR.\nThe recordings vary considerably between sunspots and regular portions of the sun. Within the sunspot the periodic effects of the observation satellite orbit are difficult to remove. We remove a running alpha-mean from the data and apply a soft clip to deal with data glitches. The recordings contain energy of both flow and waves. A frequency domain filter selects the wave energy. Then the data is input to several pre-processing and cross-correlation techniques, common to earth seismology. We anticipate that spectral whitening will flatten the energy spectrum of the cross-correlations. We also expect that the cross-correlations converge faster to their expected value when the data is processed over overlapping windows. The result of this study are expected to aid in decreasing the stacking while maintaining good SNR.",

            "abstract": "The crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of quartz is of great significance because it records much valuable information pertinent to the deformation of quartz-rich rocks in the continental crust. The lineation-parallel c-axis CPO (i.e., c-axis forming a maximum parallel to the lineation) in naturally deformed quartz is generally considered to form under high temperature (> ~550 ºC) conditions. However, most laboratory deformation experiments on quartzite failed to produce such a CPO at high temperatures up to 1200 ºC. Here we reported a new occurrence of the lineation-parallel c-axis CPO of quartz from kyanite-quartz veins in eclogite. Optical microstructural observations, fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) techniques were integrated to illuminate the nature of quartz CPOs. Quartz exhibits mostly straight to slightly curved grain boundaries, modest intracrystalline plasticity, and significant shape preferred orientation (SPO) and CPOs, indicating dislocation creep dominated the deformation of quartz. Kyanite grains in the veins are mostly strain-free, suggestive of their higher strength than quartz. The pronounced SPO and CPOs in kyanite were interpreted to originate from anisotropic crystal growth and/or mechanical rotation during vein-parallel shearing. FTIR results show quartz contains a trivial amount of structurally bound water (several tens of H/106 Si), while kyanite has a water content of 384-729 H/106 Si; however, petrographic observations suggest quartz from the veins were practically deformed under water-rich conditions. We argue that the observed lineation-parallel c-axis fabric in quartz was inherited from preexisting CPOs as a result of anisotropic grain growth under stress facilitated by water, but rather than due to a dominant c-slip. The preservation of the quartz CPOs probably benefited from the preexisting quartz CPOs which renders most quartz grains unsuitably oriented for an easy a-slip at lower temperatures and the weak deformation during subsequent exhumation. This hypothesis provides a reasonable explanation for the observations that most lineation-parallel c-axis fabrics of quartz were found in veins and that deformation experiments on quartz-rich rocks at high temperature failed to produce such CPOs.",

            "abstract": "Broadband seismometers record ground motions, which can be induced by weather-related processes. Analyzing such signals might help to better understand those natural processes. Previously, abnormal seismic signals have been detected during rainfall and snowmelt events. The amplitudes of those seismic signals correlated with the variations of the discharge in a nearby river and scientists have proposed that such signals were generated by bed load transport. Here, we used the continuous seismic data from the Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS) to analyze the weather-related ground motions during rainfall events. The sampling rate for seismic data is 100 samples per second. We compared the seismic data with the precipitation data from the rain gauge stations in Taiwan in three select rainfall periods, Typhoon Kalmaegi in 2008, Typhoon Morakot in 2009 and the East Asian rainy season in 2012. During raining, the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of high frequency (> 1 Hz) seismic noises is apparently high, and the amplitude of the seismic noise also correlates with the local precipitation, especially at the stations in the drainage basins, and the PSD decreased gradually after peaks of precipitation. At some seismic stations, we observed vertical ground motions at several bands of frequencies: 0-1 Hz, 1-5 Hz, and 5-45 Hz. However, on horizontal components we found the 5-45 Hz energy splits into two bands: 5-25 Hz and 30-45 Hz. For stations near the ridge tops or on the coastal plain, the 30-45 Hz band energy is weaker or missing. Preliminary results show that the amplitudes of the seismic waves correlate with the stream flow discharge. Next, we plan to study the sources of the different bands of energy to examine if we can monitor and quantify natural processes, like precipitation and river discharge, using seismic signals.",

            "abstract": "Climate scientists predict (and have already observed) that in the Northeastern U.S., individual storms may be more intense, and that there will be more precipitation on an annual basis. In steep post-glacial terrain, erosion caused by floodwaters is the largest destructive force during high-intensity storm events, and the force most likely to drive major morphological changes to riverbanks and channels. What remains uncertain is which watersheds or river reaches may be subjected to increased damage from more intense storms. This presents a challenge for scientific outreach and management. Many New England states have developed systems for delineating the potentially geomorphically active zones adjacent to rivers, and Vermont has an excellent assessment and land use management system informed by process-based fluvial geomorphologic science. To date, however, Massachusetts has neither. In this project we survey existing protocols for accurately predicting locations of fluvial erosion hazard, including using LiDAR and DEM models to extract basic morphologic metrics. Particularly in states or landscapes with high river density, and during a time of tight fiscal constraints, managers need automated methods that require a minimum of expert input. We test these methods in the Deerfield river watershed in Massachusetts and Vermont, and integrate our knowledge with that of the basin’s agricultural and floodplain stakeholders. The results will inform development of a comprehensive river assessment and land use management system for the state of Massachusetts.",

To address the lack of offshore data at this plate boundary, we use Rayleigh waves recorded by a marine seismic array of 34 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) to tomographically image phase velocities beneath the oceanic and continental margin of the North America-Pacific plate boundary. The OBSs were deployed as part of the ALBACORE project offshore southern California on 18-32 Ma seafloor. The marine seismic array recorded data from August 2010 to 2011 and are combined with 82 land stations from the CISN network. We analyze ~100 teleseismic events at distances ranging from 30° to 120° for Mw ≥ 5.9, filtered at periods between 16 and 78 s. Strong structural gradients are present across this plate margin; therefore, we perform amplitude corrections for OBS stations that account for velocity variations in water, sediment layer, crustal thickness, marine fossil layers and lithospheric thickness as a function of seafloor age. We use a surface wave inversion that considers a two plane wave method and perform a grid search for inversion parameters. Our results indicate that averaged phase velocities are 1.3% lower than previous studies for the seafloor age bin 20-52 Ma. Phase velocities at lithospheric depths are 5% higher in the oceanic mantle compared to the continental mantle indicating compositional and structural differences due to formation history in the two tectonic environments. Anisotropy in the offshore region of our study is consistent with Pacific plate motion, N 78.5˚ W, except for periods longer than 40 s in the Borderland where anisotropy demonstrates N-S alignment. The Borderland, a transitional region between the continental and oceanic plate margin where rotation of the transverse ranges involved rifting and extension, shows unique velocity and anisotropic structure compared to the land and deep seafloor regions.",

We initiated a study to understand chemical changes occurring in the SML by studying photochemical formation of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical (OH), both of which react with various organic substances and determine their lifetimes. Since OH can be formed by reaction between hydrogen peroxide and Fe(II), Fe(II) photoformation was also studied. We collected SML samples using a widely-used glass plate method and bulk samples by using a polyethylene bottles near the coast of Okinawa Island, Japan. Results showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the SML were about twice those of bulk seawater samples. Hydrogen peroxide formation in the SML samples was ca. 2.8 times faster than the bulk seawater samples. On the other hand, Fe(II) and OH photoformation kinetics was similar for both SML and bulk samples. Although it was predicted that more OH could be formed from reaction between hydrogen peroxide and Fe(II), OH formation kinetics was similar in both SML and bulk, suggesting that either Fe(II) did not react with hydrogen peroxide or reaction is very slow, possibly by forming a complex with organic compounds in the SML and bulk.",

            "abstract": "Flow dynamics within peatlands support several internal processes such as water and carbon storage and are governed by variations in hydraulic conductivity (Kv, Kh), specific yield (ne), and bulk density (ρbulk). Peat carbon storage is estimated using the loss-on-ignition method whereas hydraulic parameters are measured using standard field and laboratory methods that are highly time consuming. Automatic methods such as the continuous measurement of physical properties using a Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL) would be a rapid alternative in estimating these variables. The aims of this study are to 1) evaluate the use of MSCL as a tool to measure ρbulk on peat samples, 2) derive analytical solution linking K, ne and organic matter to ρbulk using the same samples and 3) investigate the spatial variability of K, ne and organic matter in six peatland complexes formed in different hydrogeomorphological environments of the St. Lawrence lowlands (Quebec, Canada). The study sites were first characterised using fine scale LiDAR digital elevation data. Three cores were sampled at three different locations (upstream, intermediate and downstream), with a total of 48 peat cores collected using a stainless steel Box corer (8 x 8 x 100 cm). The cores were used to measure Kv and Kh (Modified Cube Method-MCM), organic matter (Standard method from Dean, 1974) and ρbulk (Gamma Ray Attenuation Method-GRAM with MSCL and Standard method from Dean, 1974). Piezometric variations were recorded at every 5 minutes and used to evaluate ne of the surface peat layer (acrotelm) following rain events. Preliminary results show ρbulk (GRAM) variations between 0.60 and 1.05 g/cm3 which compare well with laboratory-derived data. K (MCM) values vary from 0.59 cm/s to 1.30*10-5 cm/s. GRAM ρbulk are logarithmically correlated to K (MCM) (r2 = 0.75) and could therefore be used as a proxy to evaluate spatial variability of K within peatland complexes. Finally, analyses are under way to link GRAM ρbulk to ne and organic matter.",

            "abstract": "The increasing accessibility of high-resolution land data (< 100 m) and high performance computing allows improved parameterizations of subgrid hydrologic processes in macroscale land surface models. Continental scale fully distributed modeling at these spatial scales is possible; however, its practicality for operational use is still unknown due to uncertainties in input data, model parameters, and storage requirements. To address these concerns, we propose a modeling framework that provides the spatial detail of a fully distributed model yet maintains the benefits of a semi-distributed model.\nIn this presentation we will introduce DTOPLATS-MP, a coupling between the NOAH-MP land surface model and the Dynamic TOPMODEL hydrologic model. This new model captures a catchment’s spatial heterogeneity by clustering high-resolution land datasets (soil, topography, and land cover) into hundreds of hydrologic similar units (HSUs). A prior DEM analysis defines the connections between each HSU. At each time step, the 1D land surface model updates each HSU; the HSUs then interact laterally via the subsurface and surface. When compared to the fully distributed form of the model, this framework allows a significant decrease in computation and storage while providing most of the same information and enabling parameter transferability.\nAs a proof of concept, we will show how this new modeling framework can be run over CONUS at a 30-meter spatial resolution. For each catchment in the WBD HUC-12 dataset, the model is run between 2002 and 2012 using available high-resolution continental scale land and meteorological datasets over CONUS (dSSURGO, NLCD, NED, and NCEP Stage IV). For each catchment, the model is run with 1000 model parameter sets obtained from a Latin hypercube sample. This exercise will illustrate the feasibility of running the model operationally at continental scales while accounting for model parameter uncertainty.",

The three parameters are the proton specific entropy, the proton Alfven speed, and the proton temperature Tp compared with a velocity-dependent expected temperature. The scheme does not use the time history of the wind nor does it use heavy-ion charge states. The 3-parameter scheme is tested and is found to be more accurate than existing categorization schemes. The categorization scheme is applied to the 1963-2013 OMNI2 data set spanning 4 solar cycles and to ACE. The statistical properties of the 4 types of plasma are examined. The sector-reversal-region plasma is found to have statistically low alpha-to-proton density ratios and high Alfven Mach numbers. The outward-inward imbalance of the solar-wind fluctuations are high in coronal-hole-origin plasma, modest in streamer-belt-origin plasma, very low in sector-reversal-region plasma, and gone in ejecta. The statistical relations between the proton and alpha-particle specific entropies and the oxygen and carbon charge-state density ratios are examined for the four types of plasma: the patterns observed imply a connection at the Sun between sector-reversal-region plasma and ejecta and a connection between streamer-belt-origin plasma and coronal-hole-origin plasma. The magnetic structure and plasma structure of the solar wind for the four different types of plasmas are overviewed.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning aerosols have large impacts on regional and global climate that are partly determined by their optical properties. The optical properties of aerosol depend on their size and composition, which in turn are related to fire combustion processes. Here we investigate relationships between a large suite of trace gases and aerosol size and optical properties to better understand processes governing the optical properties of fresh biomass burning aerosol emissions. We examined over 100 individual burns of biomass fuels during the Fire Laboratory at Missoula Experiment 4 (FLAME 4). Emissions were measured directly from an exhaust stack designed to capture all emissions from relatively small-scale fires burned at the base of a large burn chamber. Trace gas species were measured using a combination of an open-path Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (OP-FTIR) and proton-transfer mass spectrometer (PTR-MS). Aerosol optical properties at 870 nm were measured using a photoacoustic extinctiometer (PAX) and particle size distributions were measured using a Fast Mobility Particle Sizer (FMPS) and Aerodynamic Particle Sizer. The rapid response of the instruments allowed for comparisons of the emissions and particle properties over the duration of the fire. For example, we observed correlations between aerosol absorption, particle size, and gas-phase species associated with different types of combustion such as flaming and smoldering. We also report fire-integrated emissions for aerosol absorption and scattering coefficients and compare these to other fire-integrated properties. Many of our burn experiments examined a number of fuels that had not before been characterized in laboratory conditions, including a number of peat fuels, African savanna grasses and crop residuals.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, regional frequency analysis methods were developed for stationary environmental conditions. Nevertheless, recent studies have identified significant changes in hydrological records, leading to the ‘death’ of stationarity. Besides, uncertainty in hydrological frequency analysis is persistent. This study aims to investigate the impact of one of the most important uncertainty sources, parameter uncertainty, together with nonstationarity, on design rainfall depth in Qu River Basin, East China. A spatial bootstrap is first proposed to analyze the uncertainty of design rainfall depth estimated by regional frequency analysis based on L-moments and estimated on at-site scale. Meanwhile, a method combining the generalized additive models with 30-year moving window is employed to analyze non-stationarity existed in the extreme rainfall regime. The results show that the uncertainties of design rainfall depth with 100-year return period under stationary conditions estimated by regional spatial bootstrap can reach 15.07% and 12.22% with GEV and PE3 respectively. On at-site scale, the uncertainties can reach 17.18% and 15.44% with GEV and PE3 respectively. In non-stationary conditions, the uncertainties of maximum rainfall depth (corresponding to design rainfall depth) with 0.01 annual exceedance probability (corresponding to 100-year return period) are 23.09% and 13.83% with GEV and PE3 respectively. Comparing the 90% confidence interval, the uncertainty of design rainfall depth resulted from parameter uncertainty is less than that from non-stationarity frequency analysis with GEV, however, slightly larger with PE3. This study indicates that the spatial bootstrap can be successfully applied to analyze the uncertainty of design rainfall depth on both regional and at-site scales. And the non-stationary analysis shows that the differences between non-stationary quantiles and their stationary equivalents are important for decision makes of water resources management and risk management.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) is perceived to be among the most stable forms of carbon (C) and is produced during forest fires via thermal decomposition of organic matter. The factors that contribute to BC formation during fires are poorly understood, although abundant evidence shows that BC may play an important role in nutrient availability when incorporated into soil. How will predicted increases in future wildfire frequency and severity impact the natural formation and ecological function of BC in forest soil? We investigated the effects of fire severity on forest soil in two forest cover types following a major 2011 wildfire event in the Boundary Waters Wilderness Area in northern Minnesota, USA. We sampled the organic horizon and mineral soil (0-10 cm) from stands dominated by jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb., hereafter: conifer) and stands dominated by aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx., hereafter: deciduous) within two months after fire. We used cross-polarization and Bloch decay 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a molecular mixing model to investigate soil organic matter (SOM) composition across a gradient of fire severity in both forest cover types. For both forest types, the BC percent of soil organic carbon (SOC) observed was greatest in moderate-severity areas for the organic horizon, whereas it was greatest in high-severity areas for the mineral soil. Our results to date show that total soil BC stocks increased with fire severity in conifer forest, whereas no clear trend was observed in deciduous forest. Carbohydrate stocks were similar in both forest types and decreased with fire severity. These results suggest that increases in fire severity expected to occur under future climate scenarios may lead to changes in SOM composition and dynamics that in turn influence post-fire forest recovery and C uptake.",

            "abstract": "Drylands account for ca. 35% of terrestrial net primary productivity and thus play a significant role in global water and biogeochemical cycles. Replacement of grasses by shrubs has been widespread in these systems and has altered rates of erosion and native plant biodiversity and productivity. The net effect of these changes on biogeochemical cycling is not well understood. Projected warmer and drier conditions may further alter the function and stability of these ecosystems and soil resources through direct effects on soil microbiota and plant-microbe interactions. We quantified microbial community responses to long-term livestock grazing and shrub encroachment in a Sonoran Desert grassland. We sought to characterize tipping points where biotic controls over ecosystem processes shift from being ‘grass-driven’ to ‘shrub-driven.’ We asked: How do livestock grazing (the predominant land use in dryland ecosystems) and shrub invasion (a predominant land cover change) interact to influence microbial biomass and the relative abundance of bacteria, archaea, and fungi and their extracellular enzyme activities? Surface soil from bare-ground patches, native and invasive grass rhizospheres, and bole and canopy dripline locations in patches of mature mesquite trees in long-term grazed and long-term (70+ y) protected pastures were collected and analyzed for microbial community composition, biomass, potential exoenzyme activities, and a suite of biogeochemical characteristics. We found no differences in microbial communities or the soils associated with native vs. exotic grasses. Overall, mesquite bole patches differed from other patches in all soil characteristics except potential enzyme activity: soil temperature was significantly lower, and total carbon (C) and soil moisture were significantly higher. Potential activities were lowest for bare ground and highest at shrub dripline patches for all seven exoenzymes tested. Mean potential activities for C and phosphorous (P) hydrolyzing enzymes in long-term protected pastures (C: 21.4 ug activity g-1 h-1 ± 2.3; P: 29.8 ug activity g-1 h-1 ± 3.5) were significantly higher than those in grazed pastures (C: 16.6 ug activity g-1 h-1 ± 2.1; P: 15.8 ug activity g-1 h-1 ± 2.5), suggesting long-term effects of past land use on current soil microbial populations.",

            "abstract": "It has long been recognized that marine biotic turnover events took place at around the Norian/Rhaetian boundary in the Late Triassic. Although the causes of these Norian to Rhaetian biotic turnover events are still the subject of debate, extraterrestrial impacts have been proposed to account for the biotic turnover. A Norian impact event has been inferred from a platinum group element (PGE) concentration anomaly, Os isotope negative excursion, and the presence of Ni-rich magnetite and microspherules, in claystone layer within middle to upper Norian bedded chert succession in the Sakahogi section, Mino Belt, central Japan. Previous osmium isotope studies have revealed that the anomalously high PGE abundances resulted from a large chondritic impactor (3.3–7.8 km in diameter). To evaluate the biotic and environmental effects of such an impact event, we report on new micropaleontological data from the Sakahogi section across the ejecta layer.\nDetailed high-resolution sampling and biostratigraphic data showed that the ejecta layer occurs at the base of the radiolarian Trialatus robustus–Lysemelas olbia zone and is correlated with the middle to late Norian boundary. The biostratigraphc analysis revealed that no mass extinction of radiolarians occurred at the impact event horizon. Only one species became extinct at the ejecta horizon and the extinction rate of radiolarians is estimated to be about 5% at the horizon. However, major turnovers in radiolarians occur above the ejecta horizon, in the Trialatus robustus–Lysemelas olbia zone; this turnover is associated with deposition of a spicular chert, suggesting temporal changes in marine ecosystems after the impact event.",

            "abstract": "The 1992 Flores earthquake (Mw=7.8) occurred on a back arc thrust near the island of Flores, Indonesia, causing widespread coastal uplift and subsidence, and generating a local tsunami with maximum runup height of over 25 meters that killed over 2,000 people. The event has been the subject of numerous publications on its various aspects, including the earthquake source mechanism determined from seismic data, and modelling of inundation and tide gauge study data to study generation of the tsunami. To date, however, no studies have quantitatively assessed the constraints placed on the source mechanism by all the different types of data - seismic, geodetic and tsunami tide gauge waveforms and inundation.\nThe seismic and coastal uplift data provide strong constraints on the location and orientation of the earthquake fault that are inconsistent with most published information on the “Flores Thrust”. In this talk we re-examine the constraints on the earthquake fault, and consider these in light of recent GPS and seismicity data, to suggest the existence of an active fault at depth beneath Flores Island itself.",

The Opportunity rover’s Pancam and Curiosity rover’s Mastcam have the ability to image inner-coma structure before and after closest approach (CA), and to search for meteors.\nThe CA occurs during day time for both rovers, early morning for Opportunity and late afternoon for Curiosity. During the sols (Martian solar days) leading up to CA, the comet is in the sky during early morning hours for both rovers; it is in the evening sky after CA. Curiosity’s closest view is from near 600,000 km range—at this time, the nucleus is expected to be observable, but to be unresolved (sub-pixel diameter). Mastcam’s M-100 camera has a 5° field-of-view (FOV) and a 0.05 mrad instantaneous FOV (iFOV)—52,000 km and 44 km at the rover-comet range, respectively—and the M-34 camera has a three times larger FOV and iFOV. Both cameras have RGB imaging capabilities. Opportunity’s closest view is the morning before CA, at 400,000 km. Pancam has a broadband filter, a 16° FOV, and 0.27 mrad iFOV, which project to 109,000 km and 106 km, respectively.\nDuring the hours immediately after CA, when meteor impact rates are expected to be near their peak, the radiant is well below the horizon for Curiosity and the Sun remains up for Opportunity. The meteor rate would have to be elevated >100 times the background to be detectable at night (about 8 hours after CA for Curiosity’s geometry).\nDetailed rover observing plans will not be made until near CA, and are subject to various operational constraints. Initial results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "A large pool of organic carbon (C) has been accumulating in the Arctic for thousands of years. Much of this C has been frozen in permafrost and unavailable for microbial decomposition. As the climate warms and permafrost thaws, the fate of this large C pool will be driven not only by climatic conditions, but also by ecosystem changes brought about by arctic animal populations. In this project we studied arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii), which are widely-distributed throughout the Arctic. These social mammals create subterranean burrows that mix soil layers, increase aeration, alter soil moisture and temperature, and redistribute soil nutrients, all of which may impact microbial decomposition. We examined the effects of arctic ground squirrel activity on soil C mineralization in dry heath tundra underlain by continuous permafrost in the Kolyma River watershed in northeast Siberia, Russia. Vegetation cover was greatly reduced on the ground squirrel burrows (80% of ground un-vegetated), compared to undisturbed sites (35% of ground un-vegetated). Soils from ground squirrel burrows were also significantly dryer and warmer. To examine effects of ground squirrel activity on microbial respiration, we conducted an 8-day incubation of soil from\nburrows and from adjacent undisturbed tundra. In addition, we assessed the impact of nutrient addition by including treatments with low and high levels of nitrogen addition. Microbial respiration (per gram soil) was three-fold higher in incubated soils from the undisturbed sites compared to soils collected from the burrows. The lower rates of respiration from the disturbed soils may have been a result of lower carbon quality or low soil moisture. High nitrogen addition significantly increased respiration in the undisturbed soils, but not in the disturbed burrow soils, which suggests that microbial respiration in the burrow soils was not primarily limited by nitrogen. These results demonstrate the importance of wildlife activity on soil C vulnerability in the Arctic. As C is moved from protected permafrost pools to thawed soils, burrowing animals, such as the arctic ground squirrel, may play an increasingly important role in regulating the transfer of C from soils to the atmosphere.",

The major difficulty with interpreting 14C measurements in ice cores stems from the fact that the measured 14C represents a combination of trapped paleoatmospheric 14C and 14C that is cosmogenically produced within the ice matrix. This in situ cosmogenic 14C component in ice is at present poorly understood. Prior ice core 14C studies show conflicting results with regard to the retention of cosmogenic 14C in polar firn and partitioning of this 14C among CO2, CO and CH4. Our new study aims to comprehensively characterize the 14C of CO2, CO, and CH4 in both the air and the ice matrix throughout the firn column at Summit, Greenland. We will present new measurements of 14C in Summit firn air (the first phase of this study) and discuss the implications for in situ cosmogenic 14C production and retention.",

            "abstract": "Ecogeomorphic studies have demonstrated that biota can exert influence over geomorphic processes, such as sediment transport, which in turn have biotic consequences and generate complex feedbacks. However, little attention has been paid to the potential for feedback to arise from evolutionary processes as population genetic composition changes in response to changing physical landscapes. In coastal ecosystems experiencing land loss, for example, shoreline erosion entails reduced plant survival and reproduction, and thereby represents a geomorphic response with inherent consequences for evolutionary fitness. To get at this topic, we examined the effect of genetic variation in the saltmarsh grass Spartina alterniflora, a renowned ecosystem engineer, on rates of shoreline erosion. Field transplantation studies and controlled greenhouse experiments were conducted to compare different genotypes from both wild and cultivated populations. Plant traits, soil properties, accretion/subsidence, and rates of land loss were measured. We found significant differences in rates of erosion between field plots occupied by different genotypes. Differences in erosion corresponded to variation in soil properties including critical shear stress and subsidence. Plant traits that differed across genotypes included belowground biomass, root tensile strength, and C:N ratios. Our results demonstrate the importance of genetic variation to salt marsh functioning, elucidating the relationship between evolutionary processes and ecogeomorphic dynamics in these systems. Because evolutionary processes can occur on ecological timescales, the direction and strength of ecogeomorphic feedbacks may be more dynamic than previously accounted for.",

            "abstract": "Treeline advance is an expected sensitive indicator of climate change effects on species distributions. However, little evidence of treeline advance has been shown due to past disturbance or geomorphological limitations. The Basin and Range Mountains of Nevada and eastern California have seen minimal human impact and have been free of major glaciation, making these mountains an ideal location to test for climate change impacts on treeline. Great Basin treelines are dominated by bristlecone pine but recent observations show that usually downslope-growing limber pine appears to be pushing treeline upslope. In this study, we used modified belt transects at above and below adult treeline and at stand mid-elevation to compare species regeneration with adult, cone-bearing tree basal area. Our results show that limber pine regeneration surpasses bristlecone pine regeneration at treeline in terms of raw numbers of individuals. When adult basal area is taken into consideration, it appears that the very few adult limber pines have far more regeneration success at treeline than the bristlecone pine adults. This may have long-term ramifications on community composition of bristlecone pine forests, as these long-lived individuals largely exclude one another once established. Limber pine appears to be far better adapted to take advantage of rapid climate change. Even if bristlecone pine is ultimately better adapted to treeline in the long-term and this “changing of the guard” at treeline is temporary, due to their long lifespan, this effect could last thousands of years.",

Most educators will be familiar with the notion that making accurate first impressions and being responsive, whilst maintaining pace is critical to engaging an audience. There are lessons to be learnt from industry that can significantly impact upon our teaching. Eisenkraft, in his address to the NSTA, proposed four essential questions. This presentation explores one of those questions: ‘Why should I care?’, and discusses why this question is crucial for engaging students by giving a clear purpose for developing their scientific understanding. Additionally, this presentation explores how The ISF Academy has adapted the NGSS, using the 14 Grand Engineering Challenges and the IB MYP, to provide current, authentic global contexts, in order to give credibility to the concepts, understandings and skills being learnt. The provision of global contexts across units and within lessons supports a platform for students to have the freedom to explore their own sense of social responsibility. The Science Department believes that planning lessons with tasks that elaborate on the student’s new conceptualisations, has helped to transfer the student’s new understanding into social behavior beyond the classroom. Furthermore, extension tasks have been used to transfer conceptual understanding between different global contexts.",

            "abstract": "As the construction of large dams for flood control purposes becomes no longer attractive due to their high cost and adverse environmental impacts, the use of spatially distributed flood retention ponds in both urban and rural settings is becoming an alternative flood management practice. However, little is known about how the spatial configuration of ponds and their storage and release capacities relative to their location in the drainage network affect the flood frequency at different locations in the catchment. In this study, we investigate this issue using a continuous simulation approach where a randomly generated rainfall time series is used to derive a hydrologic model that mimics the translation, aggregation, and attenuation of flows along the drainage network. We began by investigating how flood retention ponds that are configured either in series or in parallel affect the flood frequency using a hypothetical catchment (A=30 km2) whose drainage network is idealized using the deterministic Mandelbrot-Viseck tree. Our results show that ponds that are configured in parallel and placed at the upstream section of the basin offer a better peak flood reduction than ponds that are either configured in series along the main stem of the drainage network or a single bigger pond that is located at the outlet. The results also show that, for ponds that are configured in series, emptying the upstream dam first offers better regulation of flood peaks than emptying the downstream pond first. Moreover, our results show that, when the two ponds that are configured in series have different storage capacities, it is better to put the larger pond in the upstream section of the catchment. We further expanded the analysis to the Soap Creek catchment (A=660 km2) located in southeastern Iowa, and simulated a system of 132 flood retention ponds that have already been built across that catchment. Our results show how these ponds modify the flood frequency at different locations in the basin. Although the results show that the effect of distributed flood retention ponds on the flood frequency reduces in the downstream direction, the fact that they are distributing the flood control benefits across the catchment, as opposed to a single big reservoir located at the catchment outlet, makes them an attractive and viable flood mitigation alternative.",

Changes in stress state after large earthquakes were documented recently in the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake, Taiwan, and 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, Northeast Japan. If the temporal changes are common in the past and in the future, the change in paleostress related to large earthquakes are expected to be obtained from micro-faults preserved in outcrops or drilled cores. In this study, we show a change in paleostress from micro-fault slip data observed around the Chelung-pu fault in the Taiwan Chelung-pu fault Drilling Project (TCDP), which is possibly associated with the stress drop by large earthquakes along the Chelung-pu fault. Combining obtained stress orientations, stress ratio and stress polygons, stress magnitude for each stress state and difference in stress magnitude between obtained stresses are estimated.\nFor stress inversion analysis, multiple inversion method (MIM, Yamaji et al., 2000) was carried out. To estimate the centers of clusters automatically, K-means clustering (Otsubo et al., 2006) was conducted on the result of MIM. In the result, four stress states were estimated. The stress states are named C1, C2, C3 and C4 in ascending order of stress ratio (Φ). Stress ratio is defined as (σ1-σ2) / (σ1-σ3). To constraint the stress magnitude, stress polygons are employed combining with the inverted stress states. The principal stress vectors for four stress states (C1-C4) was projected to the SHmax or the Shmin and vertical stress directions. SHmax is larger than Shmin as definition. Stress ratio was estimated by inversion method. Combining those conditions, a linear function in SHmax and Shmin space respected to Sv is obtained from inverted stress states.\nWe obtained two groups of stress state from the slip data in the TCDP core. One stress state has WNW-ESE horizontal sigma1 and larger stress magnitude including reverse fault regime. Another stress state has WNW-ESE horizontal sigma 2 or sigma 3 and smaller stress magnitude within normal fault or strike slip fault regimes. The switch of horizontal principal stress in the direction of WNW-ESE from sigma 1 to sigma 2 or sigma 3 may be caused by the decrease of shear stress after earthquake as observed in Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Hasegawa et al., 2012, Lin et al., 2012).",

            "abstract": "Intensified sedimentary production of nitrous oxide (N2O), one of the most potent greenhouse gases, is one of the many possible environmental consequences of elevated nitrogen (N) loading into estuarine ecosystems. This study investigates the response to over 40 years of fertilization of nitrogen removal processes in the sediments of the Great Sippewissett Marsh in Falmouth, MA. Sediment slurries were incubated (1.5 hr) with trace amounts (< 10% of ambient concentration) of 15NH4+ + 14NO3- or 15NO3- + 14NH4+. An additional parallel incubation with 15NH4+ + 14NO3- and 1 mM of allylthiourea (ATU) was included to measure rates of anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox). Well-homogenized slurries filled about 10% of the volume in the gas-tight incubation vials, and the rest of the volume was replaced with an O2/He (20%/80%) mixture. The production of 29N2, 44N2O and 45N2O were determined using isotope ratio mass spectrometry.\nThe rate of total N2O production in fertilized sediments (0.89 nmol hr-1 g-1 wet weight) was 30-fold higher than in unfertilized sediments. The ratio of N2O to N2 production was also significantly higher in fertilized sediments (2.9%) than in unfertilized sediments (1.2%). This highlights the disproportionally large effect of long-term fertilization on N2O production in salt marsh sediments. The reduced oxygen level and higher ammonium concentrations in situ probably contributed to the significant rise in N2O production as a result of long-term fertilization. When detected, anammox and coupled nitrification-denitrification accounted for 10% and 14% of the total N2 production in fertilized sediments (30.5 nmol hr-1 g-1 wet weight), respectively, whereas neither was detected in unfertilized sediments. Thus these experiments indicate that N loading has important effects on multiple N cycle processes that result in N loss and N2O production.",

            "abstract": "We used a ring-shear apparatus to examine the perpendicular permeability of different type of sand for evaluating faults around methane hydrate reservoirs. The effect of effective normal stress on the permeability was investigated. We obtained measurements under constant effective normal stress ranging from 0.5 MPa to 8.0 MPa. The grain size distribution and particle shape in sand samples were performed by laser diffraction and optical microscopy method using the Morphologi G3, respectively. The median D50 and of median HSC (High Sensitivity Circularity) were obtained as 215.7µm and 0.758 in No.7 silica sand, 231.8µm and 0.789 in Toyoura sand. In No.7 silica sand, permeability after ring-shearing substantially decreased with increasing effective normal stress up to an effective normal stress of 2.0 MPa, and became gradually decrease for effective normal stress values greater than 2.0 MPa. In Toyoura sand, while, permeability after ring-shearing drastically decreased up to an effective normal stress of 3.0MPa. Although the relationships between the permeability after ring-shearing and the effective normal stress in both sand samples could be expressed by an exponential equation up to 3.0 MPa, the gradual change in slope was shown in Toyoura sand in comparison with No.7 silica sand. The both permeability in two sands had almost the same values for effective normal stress greater than 3.0 MPa. These results indicate that the influence of single particle crushing strength is more important than grain size and particle shape for understanding of different permeability up to 3.0 MPa between two sands.

            "abstract": "A littoral cell is a distinct area of a coastline in which sand enters the ocean (source), undergoes longshore transport, and is subsequently removed from the system (sink). Knowing the sediment budget of a littoral cell is an essential planning tool for coastal management, as an adequate supply of sand provides a buffer from seacliff erosion, one of the most pressing problems affecting coastal environments.\nIn California, littoral cells are typically bound in two different manners. First, prominent rocky headlands can block longshore transport around them. Second, and more commonly, submarine canyons may cross the continental shelf at a shallow enough depth as to intercept alongshore movement of sediment. In the Monterey Bay the largest sink is the Monterey Submarine Canyon, which is responsible for an estimated sand loss of -230,000 m3 each year.\nThis study presents the results of multiple, high-resolution, 3D Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) surveys conducted at Moss Landing Beach between Fall 2007 and Summer 2014. Direct measurements of beach volumetric changes and comparison with offshore wave data indicate that beach dynamics near a littoral cell sink are affected by both long-term seasonal oceanographic trends and small-scale storm-related variability.\nDuring the seven-year survey period, the beach showed the well-known seasonal trend of accretion during low-energy summer conditions and erosion during high-energy winter conditions, with a seasonal difference of up to 10,600 m3. However, winter conditions were also characterized by alternating episodes of accretion and erosion immediately following high-energy swell events and winter storms. Accretion was more pronounced during southwesterly swell events, as there was increased littoral transport and sand supply to the beach. This accretion was then followed by rapid erosion and flushing of sediment to the head of the submarine canyon and, ultimately, from the littoral cell. On average, this flushing occurred at a rate of more than -500 m3/day, with a maximum erosional rate of -1780 m3 over three days.",

Many sensor characterization techniques can be used for this such as prelaunch testing, on-board references, and vicarious calibration – the best being a mixture and understanding of all of these techniques. Among several forms of vicarious calibration, this work will show sensor intercalibration using terrestrial sites between the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emissive and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) which are two instruments on the Terra satellite. ASTER is a high-resolution, narrow-swath sensor and is sometimes called the zoom lens of MODIS. Despite differences in spectral band properties, this sensor pair provides the ideal case for sensor comparisons since viewing and illumination geometries are nearly identical. Intercalibration results shown here provide confidence in multi-sensor applications using measurements from these sensors as well as an assessment of the performance of intercalibration methodology.",

            "abstract": "This work aims to increase the efficiency of earthquake early warning (EEW) systems. Conventional EEW systems detect occurrence of earthquakes by means of detecting seismic P-waves; thus, they cannot make alert before P-waves reach the ground surface in principle. If we desires to break this limitation, we must observe other physical quantities including the electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational fields, variations of which propagate faster than elastic waves.\nThe present study focuses on changes in the magnetic field generated by co-seismic stress changes in the Earth’s crust. When magnetic minerals in the Earth’s crust are subjected to mechanical forces, increments or decrements of magnetization appear. This is called the piezomagnetic effect. Significant changes in values of the geomagnetic field has frequently observed between before and after major earthquakes or volcanic ground deformation, which is considered to be generated by the piezomagnetic effect. The problem is, however, whether or not co-seismic changes in the stress field generates earlier signals, that is, changes in the magnetic field at observation sites which occur before arrival of seismic waves.\nTo answer the question, a set of equations governing elastodynamics, electromagnetics, and the piezomagnetic effect, are solved for a whole space stuffed with a uniform physical properties. An impulsive double couple is assumed to represent the earthquake source mechanism.\nA set of solutions is derived in time-domain, and its features are investigated for several sets of parameters including electrical conductivity and seismic velocities. We can confirm that there are certain amount of changes in the EM field, even before arrival of seismic waves. EM signals before arrival of seismic waves (i.e. earlier EM signals) are relatively large in the case that the Earth’s crust is conductive (> 0.01 S/m). However, the appearance of relatively large EM signal is not simultaneous to the rupture; instead, it is only after seismic waves approach the observation site.\nThis result means detection of earthquakes by means of observing piezomagnetic signals is not easy at present in general, although it will be possible if sensitivity of EM sensors improves.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zones are a source for mantle heterogeneity within the convection system and there is mounting evidence that seismic signatures can be used to track slabs down from the surface throughout the mantle. Seismic studies of the mantle beneath Central America demonstrate that subducted slab material reaches the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB). The lowermost mantle beneath this convergent margin shows strong seismic evidence for heterogeneity. Tomographic models characterise subduction zones to be underlain by increased seismic velocities over 100s-1000s km laterally, in association with D′´ discontinuities 100-300 km above the CMB, consistent with phase transitions in the Bridgmanite system. Recent analyses have found evidence for isolated Ultra Low Velocity Zones in addition to prevalent fine-scale heterogeneity, on the order of 1-10 km, scattering high frequency waves. These techniques indicate thermal and/or chemical anomalies within the mantle on a range of scales. Numerical geodynamical simulations suggest small-scale mechanical mixing of initially coherent compositionally anomalous subducted material separating into entities of various sizes consistent with the range of heterogeneity sizes observed in the lower mantle.\nInvestigating seismic scattering, the re-radiation of a wavefront due to interaction with a sharply contrasting volumetric anomaly, is an effective method for studying small-scale elastic heterogeneities in the Earth's mantle. Studies commonly record structure with scale lengths of about 10 km. Here we analyse scattered energy related to PKPPKP — PKP•PKP (the • indicates the scattering location along the raypath) — sampling a large volume of the mantle beneath Central America. We reveal the character of heterogeneity in various frequency bands within the whole mantle using both broadband and short-period data. These observations will be placed in context with other studies in this region illustrating the large-scale background structure and localised phenomena. We interpret these findings in terms of the downwelling part of the whole mantle convection cycle, which is capable of introducing heterogeneities entrained by subduction, including basaltic oceanic crust, possibly altered by entrainment of hydrated phases from the upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Previously, we reported that reflectance increased across the whole PAR spectrum when plants were subjected to water stress. This effect was shown to exist in maize grown under greenhouse conditions and under field conditions. Greenhouse experiments showed that, in addition to leaf water content, the effect was strongly correlated with incident light intensity. Further, through the use of an integrating sphere, we demonstrated that the change in reflectance was due to a change in absorption rather than in a change scattering or other optical path effect. Time lapse microscopy showed lightening between leaf veins analogous to effects measured by researchers observing cross sections of stressed C4 plants. To further refine our study, additional leaf level and canopy level studies were undertaken. Excised leaf sections were separately exposed to red and white light in the laboratory as the leaf dried.  Increasing reflectance and transmittance were observed for the section exposed to white light, while little change was observed under red light. Each of these observations can be explained by chloroplast avoidance movement, a photoprotective response causing chloroplasts to aggregate along cell walls effectively hiding chlorophyll from observation. Chloroplast movement, for example, is driven by blue light; explaining the lack of observed change under red light. Estimation of biophysical parameters, such as chlorophyll content and greenness, are affected by the difference between the “apparent” chlorophyll content and the actual chlorophyll content of leaves and canopies. Up to 30% changes in the VARI remote sensing index have been observed morning to afternoon in field-grown maize. Ten percent changes in chlorophyll estimates have been observed in greenhouse maize. We will report on further research and on the extension of our work to include the impact of chloroplast avoidance on remote sensing of C3 plants, specifically soybean, at leaf and canopy levels.",

            "abstract": "Triggering mechanism of a seismic swarm has to be identified with great confidence in real time. Crisis response will not be the same whether magma is involved or not. The recent developments of a method based on the Seismic Amplitude Ratio Analysis enable a rapid and unambiguous diagnosis to detect migrating micro-seismicity. The beauty of this method lies in the fact that the ratio of seismic energy, recorded at different stations, is independent of the seismic energy radiated at the source and depends only on the location of the source and attenuation of the medium. Since drastic changes in attenuation are unlikely to occur at the time scale of magma intrusion, temporal evolutions in the measured ratio have to be explained by a change in the source location. Based on simple assumptions, this technique can be used to assess the potential of existing monitoring seismic network to detect migrating events in real-time. Of much importance, it can also be used to design monitoring seismic network based on the available number of sensors, as well as from field constraints.\nThe method will be implemented in MSNoise software (http://www.msnoise.org/). This allows us to mine existing datasets, to compare the different noise-based techniques, but also to use the method for monitoring purposes. We will present how the key question: “Migration or No Migration” could be answered in real time without need of complex calculation nor full knowledge of the site effect and attenuation of the medium.",

            "abstract": "Recognizing the reality of global warming and its origin in greenhouse gas emissions, what does one do about it? Individual action is commendable, but inadequate. Collective action is necessary--Citizens’ Climate Lobby proposes a “fee-and-dividend” approach in which a fee is imposed on carbon-based fuel at its sources of production. The fee increases annually in a predictable manner. The funds collected are paid out to consumers as monthly dividends. The approach is market-based, in that the cost of the fee to producers is passed on to consumers in the cost of carbon-based fuels. Downstream energy providers and consumers then make their choices regarding investments and purchases.\nCitizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) builds national consensus by growing local Chapters, led and populated by volunteers. The Chapters are charged with public education and presenting the fee-and-dividend proposal to their respective Representatives and Senators. CCL builds trust by its non-partisan approach, meeting with all members of Congress regardless of party affiliation and stance on climate-related issues. CCL also builds trust by a non-confrontational approach, seeking to understand rather than to oppose. CCL works both locally, through its local Chapters, and nationally, with an annual conference in Washington DC during which all Congressional offices are visited.\nCCL recognizes that a long-term, sustained effort is necessary to address climate change.",

Traditionally considered as a safe source, due to the “natural filter” that occurs in porous media, groundwater is commonly used without any treatment.\nThe Uruguayan law requires bacteriological analysis for most water uses, but virological analyses are not mentioned in the legislation. In the Salto district, where groundwater is used for human consumption and for agricultural activities, bacterial contamination has been detected in several wells but no viruses analysis have been performed.\nThe Republic University (UDELAR), with the support of the National Agency for Research and Innovation (ANII), is studying the incidence of virus in groundwater on an intensive agriculture area of the Salto district. In this area water is pumped from the “Salto Aquifer”, a free sedimentary aquifer. Below this sedimentary deposit is the “Arapey” basaltic formation, which is also exploited for water productions on its fractured zones.\nA screening campaign has been performed searching for bacterial and viral contamination. Total and fecal coliforms have been found on several wells and Rotavirus and Adenovirus have been detected. A subgroup of the screening wells has been selected for an annual survey. On this subgroup, besides bacteria and viruses analysis, a standard physical and chemical characterization was performed. Results show a significant seasonal variation on microbiological contamination.\nIn addition to field studies, rotavirus circulation experiments on columns are being performed. The objective of this experiments is to determinate the parameters that control virus transport in porous media.\nThe results of the study are expected to provide an insight into the impacts of groundwater on Salto’s viral gastroenterocolitis outbreaks.",

            "abstract": "Thermal inputs play a vital role in the management and seasonal distribution of stream-flows particularly in snow and glacier fed basins, therefore the signatures of the recent climate trends can also be observed in various hydrological variables in those basins. Upper Indus Basin (UIB) is located in the western part of Tibetan Plateau, and most of its flows are dependent on snow- and glacier-melt produced water, thus the analyses of historical stream-flows and climatic indicators in the snow-melt dominated rivers of UIB was carried out, which points towards an advance in the spring flow onset time over the past few decades. Trend results reveal that warm temperature spells in spring have occurred much earlier in recent years, which explains in part the trend in the timing of spring peak stream-flows owing to earlier occurrence of snow melt onset. The observed increase in spring stream-flows and decrease in summer stream-flows suggests a broad shift of snow-melt yield and spring peak flows. These trends are found to be strongest at lower elevations basins where winter temperatures are closer to the melting point, even modest variation in temperatures are capable to enforce large shifts in the basin hydrologic feedback. In addition, it appears that in recent years due to winter and spring warming, more of the precipitation is falling as rain rather than snow particularly in late winter and early spring seasons, consequently it is speculated that this shift in precipitation ratio (snow vs rain) and early warming spells might also affect local (basin-scale) Albedo via early recession and systematic decrease of snow cover area, which tends in lowering Albedo from an increased fraction of snow-free area, which instigate positive feedback on radiative balance that can perhaps causes local-scale heat redistribution, which collectively in turn augmented winter and early spring stream-flows in those basins. These observed hydro-climatological trends over UIB can have significant impacts on water resource planning and management.",

Receiver separation varied from 5 to 2,100m and maximum separation (array size) varied from 1,800 to 2,100 m. In each separation, 10 to 90 minutes ambient noise was recorded with sampling interval of 10 ms. Due to the security concern, data acquisition was performed in the day-time and in relatively quiet places such as in parks or less densely residential areas.\nA spatial autocorrelation was used for calculating phase velocity and clear dispersion curves were obtained in frequency range from about 0.3 to 10 Hz. Minimum frequency and corresponding maximum wavelength ranged from 0.32 to 0.48 Hz and about 2,180 to 5,140 m, depending on the site. An inversion consisting of a least squares method and a Genetic Algorithm was used to estimate Vs profiles from the dispersion curves to a depth of about 1,000 to 2,500 m depending on the sites.\nFigure 2 shows comparison of Vs profiles obtained by the inversion. We can see that a low velocity layer with Vs lower than 400 m/s exists between depths of 0 to 200 m at all sites. Intermediate bedrock with Vs higher than 1,000 m/s exists between depths of 240 to 1,250 m. Deepest bedrock with Vs higher than 2,000 m/s seems to exist at a depth of at least 1,600 m.",

            "abstract": "The fractures and pores in rocks are the fundamental units for calculations of flow and contaminant transport in fractured formations. Modeling and meshing of a fractured rock system are challenging tasks because mesh generations of fractured networks typically involve complex procedures for topological transformations and the modeling of such complex mesh system is computationally expensive. Due to technical and logical limitations it is difficult in reality to account for such small units for simulations of flow and transport in large-scale problems. The concept of continuum representation of fractured rocks can provide an alternative to resolve the limitations of highly computational costs for flow and transport simulations. For these types of approaches the evaluation of representative parameter such as the equivalent permeability for a fractured rock is critical for accurate predictions of flow and transport in large-scale fractured formations. This study aims to develop a three-dimensional discrete fracture network (DFN) model, an unstructured mesh generation system, and a finite element flow and transport model for fractured rock systems. The behavior of equivalent continuum permeability based on different fracture properties were then systematically discussed. Results of this study are expected to provide general insight into the procedures and the associated techniques for analyzing flow and transport in complex fractured rock systems.",

From the recent literature, the central estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity is ~2°C, while the climate model average is ~3.2°C, or an equilibrium climate sensitivity that is some 40% lower than the model average.\nTo the extent that the recent literature produces a more accurate estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity than does the climate model average, it means that the projections of future climate change given by both the IPCC and NCA are, by default, some 40% too large (too rapid) and the associated (and described) impacts are gross overestimates.\nA quantitative test of climate model performance can be made by comparing the range of model projections against observations of the evolution of the global average surface temperature since the mid-20th century. Here, we perform such a comparison on a collection of 108 model runs comprising the ensemble used in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report and find that the observed global average temperature evolution for all trend lengths (with one exception) since 1986 is less than 97.5% of the model distribution, meaning that the observed trends are significantly different from the average trend simulated by climate models. For periods approaching 40 years in length, the observed trend lies outside of (below) the range that includes 95% of all climate model simulations.\nWe conclude that at the global scale, this suite of climate models has failed. Treating them as mathematical hypotheses, which they are, means that it is the duty of scientists to, unfortunately, reject their predictions in lieu of those with a lower climate sensitivity.\nUnless (or until) the collection of climate models can be demonstrated to accurately capture observed characteristics of known climate changes, policymakers should avoid basing any decisions upon projections made from them. Further, those policies which have already be established using projections from these climate models should be revisited.",

The WPIA directly measures the quantity of energy transfer between whistler-mode chorus waves and resonant energetic electrons by using plasma wave vectors and velocity vectors of plasma particles. The phase differences of the WPIA require accurate phase angles of waves and electrons in order to statistically evaluate the significance of the quantity of energy transfer. We propose a technical method for efficient waveform processing in order to conduct the WPIA measurement precisely. In the WPIA measurement, the various waves detected by the onboard instrument appear as noise in the calculation of the quantity of energy transfer for whistler-mode chorus waves. The characteristic frequency variation of the chorus waves makes waveform processing difficult. A chorus waveform is used for the WPIA processing through passband filtering by selecting appropriate data processing length and frequency resolution. We implement overlapping processing of wave data in order to reduce the induced error of the wave phase. The results of waveform processing indicate that the phase errors are successfully reduced and statistical fluctuations are suppressed. The proposed waveform processing method is a necessary and applicative processing for the calculations of the WPIA in the ERG mission.",

This study focuses on identifying the main moisture sources for the anomalous wet season occurred in this region during this period and their association with the La Niña events observed in the equatorial Pacific. Our results suggest that the main moisture sources to this anomalous wet season were the Pacific Ocean (via the westerly flow of the Choco jet) and the Caribbean Sea (via the weakening of the Caribbean low-level jet).

This study aimed to examine the spatial distribution and abundance of planktonic archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA- and amoA genes in the northern South China Sea. Water samples were collected at different depths at six stations (maximum depth ranging from 1800 m to 3200 m）with four stations (B2, B3, B6, B7) located along a transect from the northeastern continental slope to the Bashi Strait and the other two (D3, D5) located southwest of this transect. Quantitative PCR of the 16S rRNA- and amoA genes was used to estimate the abundances of total Archaea, total Bacteria, and AOA and AOB, respectively. At the B series stations, the abundance of bacterial 16S rRNA gene was twofold to 36fold higher than that of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene while fivefold lower to sixfold higher at the two D stations, with both genes showing peak values slightly below sea surface (5-75 m depths) at all stations. The archaeal amoA gene had similar variations with the archaeal 16S rRNA gene, but was 1-4 orders of magnitude lower than the archaeal 16S rRNA gene at all stations. Bacterial amoA gene was below the detection at all stations. Our results also show the difference in depth profiles among these stations, which may be caused by the difference in water movement between these regions. The non-detection of bacterial amoA gene indicates that ammonia-oxidizing Archaea are the dominant group of microorganisms in nitrification of the South China Sea, which is consistent with observations in other oceans.",

            "abstract": "With the quick expansion of urban in size and population, its urban heat island intensity (UHII, expressed as the temperature difference between urban and rural areas) increased rapidly. However, very few studies could quantitatively reveal the effects of green space and land use/land cover (LULC) on urban thermal environment because of lacking of the detailed measurement. This study focuses on quantifying the effects of green space and LULC on urban Heat Island (UHI) in Shenzhen, a mega subtropical city in China. Extensive measurements (air temperature and humidity) were made by mobile traverse method in a transect of 8 km in length, where a variety of LULC types were included. Measurements were carried out at 2 hours interval for 2 years (totally repeated for 7011 times). According to LULC types, we selected 5 different LULC types for studying, including water body, village in the city, shopping center (commercial area), urban green space (well-vegetated area) and suburb (forest). The main conclusions are obtained as follows: (1) The temperature difference between the 5 different urban landscapes is obvious, i.e. shopping center > village in the city > urban water body > urban green space > suburb; (2) Air temperature and UHII decreases linearly with the increase of green space in urban; (3) Green space and water body in urban have obvious effects to reduce the air temperature by evapotranspiration. Compared to the commercial areas, urban water body can relieve the IUHI by 0.9℃, while the urban green space can relieve the IUHI by 1.57℃. The cooling effect of the urban green space is better than that of the urban water body; (4) Periodic activity of human being has obvious effects on urban air temperature. The UHII on Saturday and Sunday are higher than that from Monday to Friday, respectively higher for 0.65, 0.57, 0.26 and 0.21℃. Thursday and Friday have the minimum air temperature and UHII. These results indicate that increase in urban evapotranspiration by increasing green space could be a useful way to improve urban thermal environment and mitigation of UHI.",

We will illustrate our argument using examples from an Antarctic festival with public lectures and science cafes, outreach associated with an Antarctic expedition, the global launch of a climate change documentary that had a significant focus on Antarctica, and a series of \"Polar Weeks\" led by an international community of scientists and educators.\nWhile there is an excellent culture of accountability in both formal and informal science communication sectors, the same rigour is not applied to the majority of ‘outreach’ activities that are initiated by the science research community. Many of these activities are undertaken based on 'what feels right' and opportunism, and are proclaimed to be a success based on little or no formal evaluation. As a result, much of this work goes undocumented, is not evaluated from the perspective of the science community, and is rarely subject to peer-review and its associated benefits, including professional rewards. We therefore conclude with suggestions of new opportunities for publication in this field that would encourage science communication theory and practice to better inform each other, and for scientists to gain professional recognition for their efforts in this arena.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) is a ubiquitous component of the carbon cycle, yet controls on its landscape-level distribution, including the relative importance of mechanisms for transport across the terrestrial aquatic interface, are relatively unknown. In June 2012, the High Park Fire (HPF) burned 353 km2 of land in the Cache la Poudre (CLP) watershed just northwest of Fort Collins, CO. Following independent efforts of our group to quantify the effects of the HPF on biogeochemical pools and landscape geomorphology, we aimed to synthesize our respective datasets with two main objectives: 1. determine and relate BC content in different parts of the watershed including litter, soils, river bank sediments and dissolved and particulate organic materials in river water, 2. develop a conceptual framework for mechanisms that contribute to BC export from the CLP on short and long-term time scales.\nUsing the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method as a molecular proxy for BC concentrations, we found that the majority of BC deposited on the landscape by the HPF was located in the litter, coarse plant fraction of river bank sediments, and DOC, suggesting that BC mobilized on the landscape is transported downstream through the river network. In 2012, following the HPF, the 30-minute rainfall intensity required to mobilize sediment on hillslopes (critical I30) was 3.6 mm/hr, and in summer 2013, the critical I30 increased to 8.1 mm/hr, likely due to vegetation recovery. The low critical I30 in the first season following the fire indicated that BC could have been easily mobilized, even in small storms. Our working conceptual framework is that post fire, there are two phases of BC export from an ecosystem. In the first phase, BC export is primarily driven by transport of particulate material controlled by precipitation intensity and duration, along with the burn severity and slope of the landscape. The second phase of BC export is primarily in the dissolved form, and is driven by climatic controls such as precipitation amount and form, vegetation recovery and geologic features.",

            "abstract": "Incised alluvial terraces with a relatively uniform channel spacing are commonly found throughout the western United States. The characteristic spacing of low-order channels on these surfaces generally increases as the height of the surface increases with respect to base level. We measure the characteristic spacing of channels in parallel drainage networks on incised alluvial terraces and unconsolidated fill deposits in several locations throughout the western U.S. where incision is the result of a quantifiable change in base-level elevation. Mean channel spacing on terraces subjected to small amounts of base-level drop (e.g 20 m) can be more than three times smaller than that typically observed on terraces subjected to larger amounts (e.g. 100 m) of base-level drop. The relationship between the magnitude of base-level drop and mean channel spacing is further examined by using a numerical model. Numerical experiments suggest that the observed relationship between relief and channel spacing is the result of feedbacks between the depth of channel incision, mass wasting, and nonlinear increases in the rate of colluvial sediment transport on steep hillslopes that lead to valley widening. In extremely high relief cases, valley side slopes may lengthen sufficiently to support the formation of first order, tributary valleys, leading to the development of a trellis-like drainage system. The rapid widening of valley side-slopes can prevent the growth of adjacent, ephemeral channels and promote a greater mean channel spacing. Model results offer additional insight into the response of landscapes to rapid base-level fall and provide a preliminary basis for understanding how various amounts of base-level drop influence channel network morphology.",

            "abstract": "Chromite is one of the main reservoirs of chromium in the Earth, and is an essential important accessory mineral in upper mantle peridotites preserved in ophiolites. Generally, chromite is better preserved than silicates of the host peridotitic rocks, because it is more resistant to fluid-related processes; this has led to the widespread use of chromitites to track the evolution of Earth’s mantle convection.\nDeformed chromitites enclosed in serpentinized peridotites of Golyamo Kamenyane massif in SE Bulgaria have been studied as an example of chemical homogenization by deformation during metamorphism. Theses chromitites were affected by amphibolite-facies metamorphism and reacted with low fO2 fluids and subsequent oxidizing Fe3+-rich fluids (~ 1.0 GPa and 500-700ºC)(Gervilla et al., 2012).\nHere, we describe the details of how the microstructure was produced in chromite, showing the important role of deformation during metamorphism. They show porphyroclastic texture with coarse-grained porphyroclast (0.1 ~ 5 mm) and fine-grained neoblasts (> 100µm). Coarse-grained chromites show chemically zoned feature from core to rim, which preserve the initial igneous character, while at the rim a metamorphic signature is detectable. Our study using electron back-scattered diffraction reveals significant crystal-plastic deformation, such as inter-crystalline deformation defined by low-angle boundaries in the rim areas. Fine-grained chromites, both recrystallized and nucleated grains have higher Fe3+ and Cr and lower Mg# value compare to the core of coarse-grained chromites, which indicate that the fine- grained aggregates of chromite formed by both subgrain rotation and nucleation occurred in the presence of oxidizing fluids. Overall, deformation in a chemically distinct environment produced chemical homogenization of chromite.",

            "abstract": "Bursty Bulk Flows (BBFs) play an important role in the transfer of mass and energy from distances of roughly 20 RE or greater into the near earth plasma sheet. The braking region at around 10 RE where the flows are slowed and/or deflected is an important region in understanding the energy transfer in the magnetotail. From the BBF braking region energy can be transferred out of the region through Alfvén waves that propagate along the field lines to the aurora and deflected flow around the Earth and/or be dissipated by processes within the region itself and adiabatic heating of particles. Observational evidence is presented from the THEMIS spacecraft showing that BBF braking events are associated with enhanced electric field activity, which can reach up to ~500 mV/m. The Electric field activity is shown to contain nonlinear structures that are suggestive of the presence of field-aligned currents. Magnetic field activity is also found that appears to be Alfvénic in nature and have Poynting fluxes up to 1 mW/m2. A theory is considered in which turbulence in the BBF braking leads to the development of field-aligned currents that can destabilize into the observed nonlinear structures and thus provides a mechanism for the dissipation of BBF energy. The role of turbulence in facilitating the excitation of Alfven waves in the BBF braking region that can propagate out of the region and lead to Alfvénic aurora is also examined.",

The degree-day method can be used for reliable estimation of weather related building energy consumption and costs, as well as outdoor climatic thermal comfort. Here, we use U.S. Climate Normals developed by NOAA based on weather station observations along with Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model ensemble simulations. We add the projected change in heating and cooling degree-days based on the climate models to the estimates based on the NOAA U.S. Climate Normals to project future heating and cooling degree-days. We find locations with the lowest and highest combined index of cooling (CDDs) and heating degree-days (HDDs) for the historical period (1981 – 2010) and future period (2080 – 2099) under the Representation Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) climate change scenario. Our results indicate that in both time frames and among the lower 48 states, coastal areas in the West and South California will have the smallest degree-day sum (CDD + HDD), and hence from a climatic perspective become the best candidates for residential real estate. The Rocky Mountains region in Wyoming, in addition to northern Minnesota and North Dakota, will have the greatest CDD + HDD. While global warming is projected to reduce the median heating and cooling demand (- 5%) at the end of the century, CDD + HDD will decrease in the North, with an opposite effect in the South. This work could be helpful in deciding where to live in the United States based on present and future thermal comfort, and could also provide a basis for estimates of changes in heating and cooling energy demand.",

            "abstract": "Under anaerobic conditions, it is widely assumed that nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) reduction is primarily the result of microbial respiration. However, it has also been shown that abiotic reduction of nitrate and nitrite by reduced iron (Fe(II)), whether mineral-bound or surface-associated, may also occur under certain environmentally relevant conditions. With a range of experimental conditions, we investigated the nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope systematics of abiotic nitrite reduction by Fe(II) in an effort to characterize biotic and abiotic processes in the environment. While homogenous reactions between NO2- and Fe(II) in artificial seawater showed little reduction, heterogeneous reactions involving Fe-containing minerals showed considerable nitrite loss. Specifically, rapid nitrite reduction was observed in experiments that included reduced clays (illite, Na-montmorillonite, and nontronite) and those that exhibited iron oxide formation (ferrihydrite, magnetite and/or green rust). While these iron oxides and clay minerals offer both a source of reduced iron in the mineral matrix as well as a surface for Fe(II) activation, control experiments with corundum as a non-Fe containing mineral surface showed little NO2- loss, implicating a more dominant role of structural Fe in the clays during nitrite reduction. The isotope effects for 15N and 18O (15ε and 18ε) ranged from 5 to 14‰ for 15ε and 5 to 17‰ for 18ε and were typically coupled such that 15ε ~ 18ε. Reactions below pH 7 were slower and the 18ε was affected by oxygen atom exchange with water. Although little data exist for comparison with the dual isotopes of microbial NO2- reduction, these data serve as a benchmark for evaluating the role of abiotic processes in N reduction, particularly in sediment systems low in organic carbon and high in iron.",

Although high-precision GPS measurements in recent years have greatly refined the kinematics of crustal motion and strain partitioning among major faults in Southern California, the causes of such strain partitioning and fault evolution remain uncertain. Using a three-dimensional viscoelasto-plastic finite element model, we have explored how the plate boundary fault system evolves to accommodate the relative plate motion in Southern California. Our results show that, when the plate boundary faults are not optimally orientated to accommodate the relative plate motion, new faults will be initiated. In particular, the Big Bend of the San Andreas Fault (SAF), which is the main plate boundary fault, impedes the relative plate motion, thus forces the development of a system of secondary faults. The evolution of these secondary faults is to minimize the work needed to accommodate the relative plate motion, and this mechanism provides a framework for understanding the present-day strain partitioning and earthquake hazards. In particular, the Big Bend and the offshore parallel faults facilitate strain localization in the Western Transverse Ranges in the form of thrust faults and blind faults, and the bends on the southern SAF enhance the development of the dextral faults across the Mojave Desert, where a number of damaging earthquakes occurred in recent years.",

            "abstract": "The Late Cretaceous to mid Eocene (~85-45 Ma) evolution of the southwest Pacific has been the subject of starkly contrasting plate reconstruction models, reflecting sparse and ambiguous data. Disparate models of (1) west-dipping subduction and back-arc basin opening to the east of the Lord Howe Rise, (2) east-dipping subduction and back-arc basin closure to the east of the Lord Howe Rise, and (3) tectonic quiescence with no subduction have all been proposed for this time frame. To help resolve this long-standing problem we test a new southwest Pacific reconstruction using global mantle flow models with imposed plate motions. The kinematic model incorporates east to northeast directed rollback of a west-dipping subduction zone between 85 and 55 Ma, accommodating opening of the South Loyalty back-arc basin to the east of New Caledonia. At 55 Ma there is a plate boundary reorganization in the region. West-dipping subduction and back-arc basin spreading end, and there is initiation of northeast dipping subduction within the back-arc basin. Consumption of South Loyalty Basin seafloor continues until 45 Ma, when obduction onto New Caledonia begins. West-dipping Tonga-Kermadec subduction initiates at this time at the relict Late Cretaceous-earliest Eocene subduction boundary. We use the 3D spherical mantle convection code CitcomS coupled to the plate reconstruction software GPlates, with plate motions and evolving plate boundaries imposed since 230 Ma. The predicted present-day mantle structure is compared to S- and P-wave seismic tomography models, which can be used to infer the presence of slab material in the mantle at locations where fast velocity anomalies are imaged. This workflow enables us to assess the forward-modeled subduction history of the region.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative estimation of chemical weathering rate and evaluation of its controlling factors are critical to understand its role on landscape evolution and carbon cycle on a long time scale. In order to reconstruct the past changes in intensities of chemical weathering and erosion, it is necessary to establish a proxy for chemical versus physical weathering intensities based on chemical composition of sediments. However, the chemical composition of sediments is controlled not only by chemical weathering, but by type of source rock and grain size, too. This study aims to develop a method to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of chemical weathering relative to total denudation in the entire Yangtze River basin based on chemical composition of three different grain size fractions of river sediments. Chemical compositions of three different grain size fractions, and grain size distribution of suspended particles and river bed sediments as well as chemical composition of dissolved materials of water samples are analyzed. The result revealed that suspended particles and river bed sediments are composed of three components, aluminosilicate, quartz, and carbonate. K/Al is smaller in the smallest size fraction. We preliminary interpret that original composition of aluminosilcates within different size fractions of the same sample is the same, and the decrease in K/Al with decreasing grain size would reflect increasing influence of chemical weathering. If correct, K/Al of fine to coarse fraction can be used as an index of chemical weathering intensity. To test this idea, we examined the relationship between K/Al of fine to coarse fraction and the ratio of chemical weathering contribution to total denudation rate based on observational data. The result will be presented and its implication will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Recently, some authors have suggested that the absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) can be used to deduce the component aerosol absorption optical depths (AAOD) of dust, brown carbon, and soot carbon in the atmosphere. The premise behind this AAE approach is that AAE is a species-dependent aerosol property that does not depend upon particle size or mass, that absorbing aerosol species are externally mixed with one another, and that AAE is much less than 1 for black carbon. Other authors have found that AAE does not contain enough information to unambiguously speciate the absorbing aerosols. Thus, we explore this topic here, and point out some theoretical inconsistencies associated with using the AAE approach to deduce component AAODs from the AERONET retrievals.\nFor instance, Level 2.0 retrievals at 15 West African sites subsampled for AAE < 1.0 indicate that 86% of the fine volume fractions are less than 0.2, 56% of the depolarization ratios are greater than 0.2, and 94% of the Angstrom exponents are less than 1.0. This indicates that most of the West African data with AAE < 1 are dominated by coarse mode dust, and that low AAE does not indicate pure BC, and that therefore AAE can not be used to separate carbonaceous aerosols from dust. We obtained similar results at five Middle East dust sites subsampled for AAE < 1.0, with 59% of the fine volume fractions less than 0.2, 88% of the depolarization ratios greater than 0.2, and 73% of the Angstrom exponents less than 1.0.\nAdditionally, we find that AAE << 1 is very unlikely to occur for size distributions with fine volume fractions greater than 0.5 at nine southern Africa and South America sites, unless the imaginary refractive index at the 440 nm wavelength is less than the imaginary refractive index at the red and near infrared wavelengths (i.e., k(440) < k(rnir)). Since black carbon has a spectrally invariant imaginary refractive index at these wavelengths, it is unlikely to be the cause of k(440) < k(rnir) and AAE < 1 when the fine mode dominates. We conclude that AAE < 1 is not caused by pure BC, and that the AAE approach can not be used to separate carbonaceous aerosols from dust.",

            "abstract": "Malaria is a major public health problem throughout tropical regions of the world. Successful prevention and treatment of malaria requires an understanding of the environmental factors that affect the life cycle of both the malaria pathogens, protozoan parasites, and its vectors, anopheline mosquitos. Because the egg, larval, and pupal stages of mosquito development occur in aquatic habitats, information about the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is critical for modeling malaria risk. Potential sources of hydrological data include satellite-derived rainfall estimates (TRMM and GPM), evapotranspiration derived from a simplified surface energy balance, and estimates of soil moisture and fractional water cover from passive microwave imagery. Previous studies have found links between malaria cases and total monthly or weekly rainfall in areas where both are highly seasonal. However it is far from clear that monthly or weekly summaries are the best metrics to use to explain malaria outbreaks. It is possible that particular temporal or spatial patterns of rainfall result in better mosquito habitat and thus higher malaria risk. We used malaria case data from the Amhara region of Ethiopia and satellite-derived rainfall estimates to explore the relationship between malaria outbreaks and rainfall with the goal of identifying the most useful rainfall metrics for modeling malaria occurrence. First, we explored spatial variation in the seasonal patterns of both rainfall and malaria cases in Amhara. Second, we assessed the relative importance of different metrics of rainfall intermittency, including alternation of wet and dry spells, the strength of intensity fluctuations, and spatial variability in these measures, in determining the length and severity of malaria outbreaks. We also explored the sensitivity of our results to the choice of method for describing rainfall intermittency and the spatial and temporal scale at which metrics were calculated. Results demonstrate that information about the seasonality and intermittency of rainfall has the potential to improve our understanding of malaria epidemiology and improve our ability to forecast malaria outbreaks.",

            "abstract": "The volcanically active East African rift system in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania transects thick cratonic lithosphere, and comprises several basins characterized by deep crustal seismicity. The US-French-Tanzania-Kenya CRAFTI project aims to understand the role of magma and volatile movement during the initiation and evolution of rifting in cratonic lithosphere. Our 38-station broadband network spans all or parts of fault-bounded rift segments, enabling comparison of lithospheric structure, fault kinematics, and seismogenic layer thickness with age and proximity to the deeply rooted Archaen craton. Seismicity levels are high in all basins, but we find profound differences in seismogenic layer thickness along the length of the rift. Seismicity in the Manyara basin occurs almost exclusively within the lower crust, and in spatial clusters that have been active since 1990. In contrast, seismicity in the ~ 5 My older Magadi basin is localized in the upper crust, and the long border fault bounding the west side of the basin is seismically inactive. Between these two basins lies the Natron rift segment, which shows seismicity between ~ 20 and ~2 km depth, and high concentrations at Oldoinyo Lengai and Gelai volcanoes. Older volcanoes on the uplifted western flank (e.g., Ngorongoro) experience swarms of activity, suggesting that active magmatism and degassing are widespread. Focal mechanisms of the frequent earthquakes recorded across the array are spatially variable, and indicate a stress field strongly influenced by (1) Holocene volcanoes, (2) mechanical interactions between adjacent rift basins, and (3) a far-field ESE-WNW extensional stress regime. We explore the spatial correlation between zones of intense degassing along fault systems and seismicity, and examine the influence of high gas pressures on lower and upper crustal seismicity in this youthful cratonic rift zone.",

            "abstract": "The MW 7.1 Darfield (Canterbury) earthquake on 4 Sept 2010 in New Zealand generated widespread hydrological effects ranging from instantaneous changes of groundwater levels in wells, to more sustained (days to weeks) post-seismic changes in spring flow, river discharge and groundwater levels, as well as increased turbidity of water abstracted from wells and decreased well yields. Three years later, piezometric levels in deep (>70 m) aquifers were still elevated around the newly ruptured Greendale Fault. Eigen modelling suggests sustained high water levels are a real artefact, not due to changes in abstraction or land surface recharge. Investigation of the phenomenon include examining approaches to assess the types of responses as well as definition of a sustained rise/elevated levels. Step drawdown testing was carried out to determine whether the effects are related to a change in aquifer properties (transmissivity and storativity) or effects adjacent to the well. Other approaches, including recession analyses, have been explored to look for evidence of changes in aquifer properties. Step drawdown testing highlights potential changes in the various components of head losses both before and after the earthquake, and possible reasons for changes between tests. Sustained high groundwater and reduced well performance in some of the wells appear to be due to both a change in aquifer properties, and a decrease in well efficiency. There are different mechanisms occurring at different locations, with some reduction in permeability, and possibly storativity, at all locations tested. This paper investigates how earthquake-generated disturbances affected the hydrologic functioning of the Canterbury Plains aquifer system, using field measurements, data analysis, and modelling.",

            "abstract": "To understand the shallow part of plate interface between megathrust seismogenic zone and trench axis is very important for development of huge earthquake rupture and generation of tsunami. Monitoring of offshore seismicity near the Nankai trough by temporal ocean bottom seismographic observation in 2013 revealed that low-frequency tremor occurred associated with shallow very-low-frequency earthquakes (VLFEs) in the shallow part of plate interface. The shallow tremor episode lasted for approximately 1 month, which is almost consistent with the shallow VLFE activity observed from land broad-band seismic stations [Asano, 2014]. The horizontal location of shallow tremor estimate by envelope correlation method [Obara, 2002] shows a belt-like distribution along trench strike with narrow width than the deep tremor. The most remarkable feature of the shallow tremor activity is migration. There are two migration modes including diffusive slower migration and rapid tremor reversal (RTR), which are very similar to the deep tremor as a part of the ETS. This strongly indicates a possibility of the occurrence of episodic slow slip event in the shallow transition zone. That is to say, the migration of shallow tremor is supposed to be caused by migrating rupture front of SSE. In addition, the migration was detouring around the subducted Kyushu-Palau ridge. This suggests that the occurrence of tremor is sensitive to change in the shape of plate interface and seeks to propagate along almost the same depth range, in other word, a specified temperature and pressure condition. The narrow width distribution of shallow tremor also indicates that the shallow tremor is strongly related to dehydration process of a specified mineral under a narrow limited range of temperature and pressure condition compared to the deep tremor.",

            "abstract": "Gridded hydrometeorological forcing datasets are inherently uncertain due to myriad factors. These include interpolation from a sparse observation network, measurement representativeness, and measurement errors. Generally, uncertainty estimates are not included in gridded products; or if present, they may be included in an ad-hoc manner. A lack of quantitative uncertainty estimates for hydrometeorological forcing fields limits their utility to support land surface and hydrologic modeling techniques such as data assimilation, probabilistic forecasting and verification.\nWe present a first of its kind, gridded, observation-based ensemble of precipitation and temperature at a daily increment for the period 1980-2012. Statistical verification of the ensemble indicates that it provides generally good reliability and discrimination of events of various magnitudes, but has a small dry bias for high probability events. The ensemble mean is similar to another widely used hydrometeorological forcing dataset (Maurer et al. 2002) but with some important differences. The ensemble product is able to produce an improved probability-of-precipitation field, which impacts the empirical derivation of other fields used in land-surface and hydrologic modeling. Elevation lapse rates for temperature are derived directly from the observations, rather than specified a priori, resulting in different temperatures at higher elevations in the intermountain western US. Daily maximum, minimum temperature and precipitation accumulation uncertainty can be estimated through the use of the ensemble variance. These types of datasets will help improve data assimilation and probabilistic forecast components of land-surface and hydrological modeling systems and provide a quantitative estimate of observation uncertainty for use in NWP forecast verification. Finally, the software is extensible with future plans to incorporate remote sensing data (i.e. ground based precipitation radar, GPM, passive microwave) and NWP output depending on the application.",

            "abstract": "Changing socio-economic conditions and global environmental change continue to put pressure on critical natural resources necessary for sustaining ecosystems and human well-being – including water. Increasing variability in water availability, deepening droughts and continuing demands and consumptive use have posed problems for resource managers and policy makers in many regions. While in some regions it is still possible to enhance supply, such as in under-exploited water basins in Africa – the majority of the world’s heaviest water users are facing situations that call for more demand-side adjustments. This necessitates a change from engineering-focused solutions to more economic ones, especially where the costs of increasing supply (such as through de-salinization) are prohibitively expensive, or have unacceptable consequences for environmental sustainability.\nDespite many years and decades of studying water resource management problems, there is still too little guidance as to what institutional best-practices should be followed. Water resources tend to touch on a number of areas managed by different government departments and ministries (agriculture, aquaculture & fisheries, industry, natural resources, etc) – but there is still no common understanding of what the best governance arrangements are that lead to improved sectoral performance (however that is measured). Given the continuing efforts to invest in water resources management and development by major multi-lateral organizations such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank – this kind of institutional guidance is critical, if countries are to make the most of these investments.\nIn this presentation, we review a number of cases in which previously supply-side oriented approaches have to be dealt with from the demand side, and why institutional flexibility and innovation is so important. We draw from examples of community-based groundwater management in India, groundwater overdraft management in China and the US, and try and synthesize some key priorities for further research and policy dialogue that are needed to enhance the sustainability of water resources in critical basins.",

            "abstract": "Northern soil organic carbon (C) reserves continue to lose stability due to anthropogenic climate change. Often overlooked and deemed negligible, winter soil carbon dioxide (CO2) respiration is a significant and understudied component of the global C cycle. Datasets have shown that winter soil CO2 fluxes can be surprisingly variable owing to physical factors such as snowpack properties and wind. Using in-situ measurements and soil transport modeling, the purpose of our study was to explain high frequency CO2 fluctuations observed in snowpacks. Continuous measurements consisted of CO2 concentration gradients and meteorological data at two upland sites of differing snow cover in Nova Scotia, Canada. Periods of equilibrated snow depth were extracted to determine the relationship between CO2 in snow and wind speeds during these intervals. We adapted a soil CO2 diffusion model for the soil-snow system, and simulated step changes in transport rate over a broad range of plausible synthetic cases. The goal was to mimic changes we observed in CO2 snowpack concentration to help elucidate the mechanisms (diffusion, advection) responsible for observed variations. Field data results showed the effect of advective transport from wind on the concentration of CO2 in the snowpack. On short time spans (6-48 hrs) with varying winds and constant snow levels, a strong negative relationship between wind speed and CO2 concentration within the snowpack was often identified. This relationship was observed at both sites, though deeper snow resulted in more frequent and stronger occurrences. Modeling clearly demonstrated that diffusion alone was unable to replicate the high frequency CO2 fluctuations, but simulations using above-atmospheric snowpack diffusivities (simulating advective transport within the snowpack) reproduced snow CO2 changes of the observed magnitude and speed. This confirmed that wind-induced ventilation was contributing to episodic pulsed emissions from the snow surface and suppressed snowpack concentrations. This study improves our understanding of winter CO2 dynamics to aid in continued quantification of the annual global C cycle and will inform our use of measurement methodologies suited to winter environments.",

To investigate its complicated structure, we carried out a nearly south-north 300-km long seismic refraction/wide-angle reflection survey across the Red River fault from Yunxian to Ninglang. Three chemical explosions with charge from 1ton to 3 tons were fired, more than 150 seismic stations were deployed. The 2-D model of the seismic velocity structure along the profile was obtained by a combination of first arrival travel-time tomography and forward modeling of later arrivals. Our results show strong lateral variations in the crust. Crustal thickness increases from 45 km in the south to 54 km in the north. However, no abrupt crustal thickness change was observed across the Red River fault in our study area. The crust in the study area is thicker than average thickness of continental crust. The crustal thickening is mainly observed in the lower crust, whereas the upper and middle crustal crust possess nearly constant thickness. We observed strong seismic velocity contrast across the Red River fault. All those observations emphasize the role of the fault as an important tectonic boundary between Yangtze block and the Three Rivers geosynclinal system.",

            "abstract": "Polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), known to store excess phosphorus (P) as polyphosphate (poly-P), influence P transport in the environment. Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) from wastewater has long served as a basis to study bacterial PAOs, yet little research has genetically identified similar organisms in natural settings. Aerobic/anaerobic cycles, used to select for PAOs in EBPR, can result from changing environmental conditions such as night/day cycles for benthic biofilms. Benthic biofilms from eight Pennsylvanian streams were studied for naturally-occurring bacterial PAOs similar to those typically found in EBPR systems. PAOs were confirmed in the benthic biofilms by a characteristic yellow fluorescent emission from DAPI staining. Cells containing yellow fluorescence were separated from the rest of the sample using a flow cytometer, resulting in a physically enriched culture of PAOs from the benthic biofilms. Amplicon-based metagenomic sequencing will reveal the phylogeny of bacteria responsible for poly-P accumulation in these benthic biofilms. Sequencing data will be used to develop fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) probes, and hybridizations will be performed on DAPI-stained cells to confirm poly-P accumulation by targeted phylotypes. Identifying PAOs in natural settings is a critical step towards studying environments that support high concentrations of PAOs, serving as significant factors in the P cycle. PAOs can then be connected to P transport models to help understand and mitigate P pollution in agricultural watersheds.",

            "abstract": "The least-understood region of 100-200 km is crucial to the thermosphere, ionosphere and space weather. The roles of atmospheric gravity waves in transporting energy and momentum and causing atmospheric and ionospheric disturbances have been recognized by theoretical studies and observations. The thermospheric neutral Fe layers discovered by lidar observations at McMurdo, Antarctica, exhibit well-defined gravity wave signatures in the altitude range of 100-200 km. Another Fe lidar at Davis also observed Fe layers up to at least 150 km with a diurnal period of reoccurrence. These thermospheric metal layers provide an excellent tracer for measuring neutral temperatures and winds in the thermosphere as well as in studying wave dynamics. Our theory argues that the observed Fe layers are a result of coupling of electrodynamical, neutral dynamical and chemical processes.\nA time-dependent, 1-D, high-latitude Fe/Fe+ model has been developed to simulate the observed Fe layers based on the first principles of physics and chemistry. In this paper, we will provide quantitative analyses of the source, formation and transport of thermospheric Fe atoms and confirm that they are produced by neutralization of converged Fe+. The model shows that gravity-wave-induced wind shears converge Fe+ layers and the wave-induced vertical wind transports Fe layers to form the observed layer shapes. Furthermore, electric field causes upward flow transporting Fe+ ions from the main deposition region into the thermosphere. At the same time, electric field can help converge but can also destroy wind-shear-converged Fe+ layer, depending on the relative phase. In this paper, the competitions between wind-shear and electric field driving forces will be investigated to study the neutral-ion (Fe/Fe+) coupling. Our observational data also show that gravity-wave-driven neutral Fe layers are modulated by longer period waves or tides. These events will also be examined by our numerical model.",

The Sweet Briar College Land-Atmosphere Research Station (SBC-LARS) became operational in July, 2014 and features a 37-meter tower within a ~30 year-old loblolly pine plantation that is surrounded by mixed deciduous forest at the eastern edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The tower supports meteorological instruments at three different heights (2, 26, and 37 meters) and two air sampling inlets located above the canopy. The inlets draw air samples into a climate-controlled shed where precursor gas concentrations (ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides) are determined by gas analyzers. Aerosol size distributions between 10 and 470 nm are measured every 3 minutes by a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). For this study, aerosol size distributions from July through November 2014 were analyzed along with HYSPLIT backwards trajectories, meteorological measurements, gas concentrations, and the condensational sink, to investigate controls on new particle formation. This station and corresponding dataset will contribute to a better understanding of the contribution of biogenic and anthropogenic emissions to aerosol formation in the southeastern United States.",

            "abstract": "Does supercontinent break-up follow specific laws? What parameters control the success and the failure of rift systems? Recent analytical and geodynamic modeling suggests that oblique rifting is energetically preferred over orthogonal rifting. This implies that during rift competition, highly oblique branches proceed to break-up while less oblique ones become inactive. These models predict that the relative motion of Earth's continents during supercontinent break-up is affected by the orientation and shape of individual rift systems.\nHere, we test this hypothesis based on latest plate tectonic reconstructions. Using PyGPlates, a recently developed Python library that allows script-based access to the plate reconstruction software GPlates, we quantify rift obliquity, extension velocity and their temporal evolution for continent-scale rift systems of the past 200 Myr. Indeed we find that many rift systems contributing to Pangea fragmentation involved strong rift obliquity. East and West Gondwana for instance split along the East African coast with a mean obliquity of 55° (measured as the angle between local rift trend normal and extension direction). While formation of the central and southern South Atlantic segment involved a low obliquity of 10°, the Equatorial Atlantic opened under a high angle of 60°. Rifting between Australia and Antarctica involved two stages with 25° prior to 100 Ma followed by 50° obliquity and distinct increase of extension velocity.\nAnalyzing the entire passive margin system that formed during Pangea breakup, we find a mean obliquity of 40°, with a standard deviation of 20°. Hence 50% of these margins formed with an angle of 40° or more. Considering that many conceptual models of rifting and passive margin formation assume 2D deformation, our study quantifies the degree to which such 2D models are globally applicable, and highlights the importance of 3D models where oblique rifting is the dominant mode of deformation.",

The sink term has a cosine function for the oscillatory pumping. A general equation describing the head on the top of the three kinds of aquifers is considered. The analytical head solution of the model is derived by the direct Fourier method and the double-integral transform and in terms of a double series with fast convergence. With the aid of the solution, we have found that the vertical component of flow vanishes when Kv d2/(KhD2) > 1 where Kh and Kv are aquifer’s hydraulic conductivities, respectively, D is aquifer’s thickness, and d is a distance measured from the pumping well.

The energy sector in Canada is still primarily oil and gas, with huge tax breaks to the industry in spite of well known harmful regional and global impacts of fossil fuel pollution. One of the largest concerns for the climate science community is the variable and often complacent attitude many Canadians share on the issue of climate change.\nThe objective herein is twofold: (1) a survey tool will be used to assess the views and opinions of Canadians on climate change science and solutions; (2) develop better communication methods for industry, government and NGOs to share the science and solutions with the public. The study results will inform the Canadian public, policy makers and industry of practical, effective changes needed to address climate change challenges. A survey of Canadians' perspectives is an important step in policy changing research. The climate research and application community must know the most effective ways to communicate the science and solutions with a public that is often resistant to change. The AGU presentation will feature the results of the survey, while continued work into 2015 will be towards advancing communication.\nThis study is both timely and crucial for science communicators in understanding how Canadians view climate change, considering, for example, devastatingly extreme weather being experienced of late and its effect on the economy. The results will assist in recognizing how to encourage Canadians to work towards a more sustainable and resilient energy sector in Canada and abroad.",

This interaction, primarily through ion-neutral collisions, ties electrodynamics with hydrodynamics requiring a fully coupled ionosphere – thermosphere model to simulate and dissect the sequence of responses that occur in the neutral gas when a change occurs in the ionosphere. In particular, changes in the ion drag force prompt a hydrodynamic response that will alter several properties of the thermosphere, including neutral winds. Here, the fully coupled National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere-Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (NCAR TIEGCM) is used to evaluate how changes in mechanical coupling, through the ion drag force, alter thermosphere properties, with a focus on thermospheric neutral winds. The equatorial thermosphere anomaly (ETA) produces a transient wind system, and a dissection of the hydrodynamic processes responsible for its formation will be used to demonstrate the causal structure in neutral gas response to a change in field-aligned ion drag force. This well-behaved response elucidates processes that must be occurring in other regions of the thermosphere where more significant changes in the ion drag force occur.",

The instrument is designed to provide key trace gas measurements important to understanding tropospheric air pollution chemistry. The baseline data products are ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and formaldehyde (H2CO). The TEMPO instrument will provide hourly daylight measurements of these trace gases on urban-regional spatial scales. These remote sensing measurements augment current ground-based air quality measurements and enable improvements in air quality modeling and prediction. The TEMPO project recently completed its Preliminary Design Review (PDR). Current design parameters, instrument performance estimates and technical challenges will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Risk messages are intended to capture attention whether danger is almost certain or only a remote possibility. When used the right way, metaphor is an effective tool for getting people to pay attention to hazard and take the right course of action. Metaphor is effective because it immediately grounds what is unknown and abstract in terms what is known and concrete. For instance, when talking about a wildfire that is “swallowing up homes” we instantly understand that it is dangerous and destructive (not literally eating homes), or when talking about a drought “crippling California” we instantly know that it is leading to suboptimal agricultural and economic conditions. TV journalists often use metaphor in reporting climate information because it can vivify information. In contrast, government officials who work with risk are inclined to avoid it. The aim of this presentation is twofold: 1) to analyze and characterize types metaphors in climate discourse, especially messages about extreme wildfires and severe drought conditions, and 2) to discuss the utility of metaphor to framing risk messages for varied stakeholders across varied timescales. Many examples of risk messages in natural discourse about climate are analyzed and discussed, including examples from the TV News Archive.",

            "abstract": "Because the Earth is a “system of systems”, i.e., it is composed of many strongly coupled and complicated subsystems, Earth scientists must frequently collaborate beyond their individual focus areas. As a result, Earth Science data analysis typifies the four V’s of Big Data: 1) We need to analyze a great “variety” of data from all subsystems; 2) We need to analyze greater “volumes” of data because, to improve understanding, we are resorting to ever finer resolutions in both observations and model simulations; 3) We need to analyze these data with greater “velocity,” for climate change has imposed urgency and the current processes are taking too long to digest these data; 4) We need to analyze these data with “veracity” lest we contribute more to confusion than solution. However, current data-analysis practices exhibit numerous inefficiencies and are poorly suited to many interdisciplinary collaborations. We demonstrate, using a realistic science scenario, a prototype system that integrates a collaborative infrastructure with Big Data techniques to address these inefficiencies. This system has great potential to provide higher return on investment and boost significantly science data analysis productivity. We will discuss its implications for the (near) future of scientific data analysis.",

            "abstract": "The northwestern South American plate shows a complex tectonic setting whose causes and relationship to mantle structure are still debated. We combine different techniques to elucidate some of the links between slabs and surface deformation in Colombia. Crustal structure beneath the Northern Andes was inferred from receiver functions where we find thicknesses of nearly 60 km beneath the plateau of the Eastern Cordillera and underneath the southern volcanic area of the Central Cordillera. We infer that such crustal thickening resulted from shortening, magmatic addition, and accretion-subduction. Analyses of relative teleseismic travel time delays and estimates of residual surface topography based on our new crustal model suggest that there are at least two subduction segments underneath the area. The Caribbean slab lies at a low angle beneath northernmost Colombia and steepens beneath the Eastern Cordillera. Such steepening is indicated by negative travel time relative residuals in the area of the Bucaramanga Nest, implying a cold anomaly in the upper mantle, and by positive residual topography just off the east of this area, perhaps generated by slab-associated return flow. Results for the western Andes and the Pacific coastal plains are consistent with “normal” subduction of the Nazca plate: travel time relative residuals there are predominantly positive, and the residual topography shows an W-E gradient, going from positive at the Pacific coastline to negative at the Magdalena Valley, which separates the eastern cordillera from the rest of the Colombian Andean system.\nAzimuthal analysis of relative travel time residuals further suggests the presence of seismically slow materials beneath the central part of the Eastern Cordillera. Azimuthal anisotropy from SKS splitting in that region indicates that seismically fast orientations do not follow plate convergence, different from what we find for the western Colombian Andes and the Caribbean and Pacific coastal plains. This may possibly indicate slab-continental keel interactions and N-S squeezing of the asthenosphere. This area has an associated young volcanism of alkaline affinity that probably suggests some type of asthenospheric mantle input.",

This algorithm is for derivation of an ozone profile divided into 24 layers, with three layers in the troposphere (0-3km, 3-6km, 6-9km). In this study, we report results for the analysis of lower tropospheric ozone over CEC using the OMI ozone profiles mentioned above. First, we show good correlation of OMI-derived ozone with aircraft measurements and ozonesonde measurements. Second, we show significant enhancement of ozone derived from OMI over CEC. To interpret this remarkable enhancement of ozone, we show correlation of ozone with carbon monoxide (CO) and hotspot numbers suggesting the effects of crop burning on ozone enhancement. Third, we also show complementary data obtained in the field campaign at Mt. Tai in 2005 and 2006 (Kayana et al., 2013) to demonstrate ozone enhancement in June every year and show the relationship with residue burning in fields over Shandong and Hebei Provinces. Finally, we show important evidence of transboundary pollution transport from China to Korea and Japan.\n",

            "abstract": "Double spike techniques are widely used for determining calcium isotopic compositions of natural samples. The most important factor controlling precision of the double spike technique is the choice of appropriate spike isotope pair, the composition of double spikes and the ratio of spike to sample（CSp/CN）. We propose an optimal 42Ca-48Ca double spike protocol which yields the best internal precision for calcium isotopic composition determinations among all kinds of spike pairs and various spike compositions and ratios of spike to sample, as predicted by linear error propagation method. It is suggested to use spike composition of 42Ca/(42Ca+48Ca) = 0.44 mol/mol and CSp/(CN+ CSp)= 0.12mol/mol because it takes both advantages of the largest mass dispersion between 42Ca and 48Ca (14%) and lowest spike cost. Spiked samples were purified by pass through homemade micro-column filled with Ca special resin. K, Ti and other interference elements were completely separated, while 100% calcium was recovered with negligible blank. Data collection includes integration time, idle time, focus and peakcenter frequency, which were all carefully designed for the highest internal precision and lowest analysis time. All beams were automatically measured in a sequence by Triton TIMS so as to eliminate difference of analytical conditions between samples and standards, and also to increase the analytical throughputs. The typical internal precision of 100 duty cycles for one beam is 0.012‒0.015 ‰ (2δSEM), which agrees well with the predicted internal precision of 0.0124 ‰ (2δSEM). Our methods improve internal precisions by a factor of 2‒10 compared to previous methods of determination of calcium isotopic compositions by double spike TIMS.\nWe analyzed NIST SRM 915a, NIST SRM 915b and Pacific Seawater as well as interspersed geological samples during two months. The obtained average δ44/40Ca (all relative to NIST SRM 915a) is 0.02 ± 0.02 ‰ (n=28), 0.72±0.04 ‰ (n=10) and 1.93±0.03 ‰ (n=21) for NIST SRM 915a, NIST SRM 915b and Pacific Seawater, respectively. The long-term reproducibility is 0.10‰ (2 δSD), which is comparable to the best external precision of 0.04 ‰ (2 δSD) of previous methods, but our sample throughputs are doubled with significant reduction in amount of spike used for single samples.",

Until now, there has been no equivalence for water quality. Optics based systems now open the possibility to obtain data at a temporal resolution in par with that commonly used in quantitative hydrology (e.g. 15 min – 1 hr). We show that absorbance measured in the field using spectrophotometers can be statistically correlated with light- and none- absorbing constituents in the water. Water quality rating curves for 6-12 parameters can be derived as such using a single spectrophotometer, opening access to continuous water quality data for many parameters at a time. We then show that attaching such probe in the field with multiplexed pumping systems driven by Arduinos can expand the high temporal resolution capabilities to space as our systems can sample up to 12 different water sources located within 15 m of the water quality probe.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale teleconnections, particularly the El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), have a strong influence on rainfall patterns in Hawai‘i. Over the last century, we have observed statistically significant declines in rainfall across the state, and it is unknown whether these declines are due to changes in these natural large-scale variations in climate, or whether these downward trends can be explained by anthropogenic effects. To better aid managers and decision-makers, it is important to understand what is driving current trends. Here we use an empirical approach to study long-term trends in a geographically complex region and diverse climate. Using a time series of month-year rainfall maps for Hawai‘i starting in January 1920 at 250 m resolution, an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was performed to study the spatiotemporal variations and trend patterns. We further correlate the leading spatial and temporal components with ENSO and PDO indices, linear trends, and secular trends. More of the variability is contained in the first component in the winter (December-January-February) than in the summer (June-July-August), especially in the northern islands (Kaua‘i and O‘ahu) suggesting that natural climate variability has a stronger effect on the spatiotemporal rainfall patterns during the winter season than the summer season. Currently, independent efforts to downscale future climate projections for Hawai‘i have produced different future outlooks for rainfall. In the absence of adequately designed control experiments with regional climate models, we propose evaluating differences between observed and projected trend patterns as an alternative criterion for measuring the significance and plausibility of future climate change projections. Our results show the difficulties of separating anthropogenic and natural rainfall trends, e.g., identifying spatial (and seasonal) patterns of the trends that are different from the rainfall modes controlled by ENSO and PDO variability. In future work, we will apply formal detection and attribution methods with the aid of regional climate model simulations.",

            "abstract": "This study develops a strategy for tracing a target water mass, and applies it to analyzing the pathway of the North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) from the subarctic gyre to the northwestern part of the subtropical gyre south of Japan in a simulation of an ocean general circulation model. This strategy estimates the pathway of the water mass that travels from an origin to a destination area during a specific period using a conservation property concerning tangent linear and adjoint models. In our analysis, a large fraction of the low salinity origin water mass of NPIW initially comes from the Okhotsk or Bering Sea, flows through the southeastern side of the Kuril Islands, and is advected to the Mixed Water Region (MWR) by the Oyashio current. It then enters the Kuroshio Extension (KE) at the first KE ridge, and is advected eastward by the KE current. However, it deviates southward from the KE axis around 158°E over the Shatsky Rise, or around 170ºE on the western side of the Emperor Seamount Chain, and enters the subtropical gyre. It is finally transported westward by the recirculation flow. This pathway corresponds well to the shortcut route of NPIW from MWR to the region south of Japan inferred from analysis of the long-term freshening trend of NPIW observation.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from biogenic sources can influence optical properties of ambient aerosol by altering its hygroscopicity and contributing to light absorption directly via formation of brown carbon and indirectly by enhancing light absorption by black carbon (“lensing effect”). The magnitude of these effects remains highly uncertain. A set of state-of-the-art instruments was deployed at the SEARCH site near Centerville, AL during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) campaign in summer 2013 to measure the effect of relative humidity and temperature on aerosol size distribution, composition and optical properties. Light scattering and absorption by temperature- and humidity-conditioned aerosols was measured using three photo-acoustic extinctiometers (PAX) at three wavelengths (405 nm, 532 nm, and 870 nm). The sample-conditioning system provided measurements at ambient RH, 10%RH (“dry”), 85%RH (“wet”), and 200 C (“TD”). In parallel to these measurements, a long residence time temperature-stepping thermodenuder (TD) and a variable residence time constant temperature TD in combination with three SMPS systems and an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) were used to assess aerosol volatility and kinetics of aerosol evaporation. We will present results of the on-going analysis of the collected data set. We will show that both temperature and relative humidity have a strong effect on aerosol optical properties. SOA appears to increase aerosol light absorption by about 10%. TD measurements suggest that aerosol equilibrated fairly quickly, within 2 s. Evaporation varied substantially with ambient aerosol loading and composition and meteorology.",

            "abstract": "Flow duration curves (FDCs) are an important tool for watershed management and their prediction in ungauged catchments is a challenging problem. Selecting the most appropriate model for prediction the FDC is itself a challenge that determines how theoretical improvements in prediction are transferred into engineering practice. Available performance metrics (e.g., Nash Sutcliffe Coefficient, error on flow moments) typically consider the aggregated ability of the model to predict all streamflow quantiles. These metrics may be inappropriate for model selection in practice because watershed management decisions are typically driven by a limited number of streamflow quantiles that may be poorly represented by an aggregate performance metric.\nAs an illustrative case study, the performance of three distinct FDC prediction approaches -- graphical, statistical and process-based -- are compared for ungauged streams in Nepal. The practical application of these predictions is to inform the design of run-of-river hydropower plants. The process-based approach provides the best prediction of the observed flow distribution and results in significantly higher Nash coefficients. However, the graphical approach provides the best prediction of the flow quantiles that are most relevant for hydropower design and reduces the design error caused by streamflow estimation. To assist in an application driven model selection process, we propose a novel model selection framework.",

            "abstract": "The California Tsunami Program has continued to build upon past preparedness efforts, carried out year-round, while leveraging government support at all levels during National Tsunami Preparedness Week, the last week of March. A primary goal is for everyone who lives at or visits the coast to understand basic safety measures when responding to official tsunami alerts or natural warnings. In 2014, more so than ever before, many local, coastal jurisdictions conducted grass-roots activities in their areas. When requested, state and federal programs stepped in to contribute subject matter expertise, lessons learned, and support. And, this year, the new website,\nwww.TsunamiZone.org\n, was developed. With a goal of establishing a baseline for future years, this website builds on the successes of the Great Shakeout Earthquake Drills (\nwww.ShakeOut.org\n) by allowing people to locate and register for tsunami preparedness events in their area. Additionally, it provides a central location for basic tsunami preparedness information, and links to find out more. The idea is not only to empower people with the best available, vetted, scientifically-based public safety information, but also to provide ways in which individuals can take physical action to educate themselves and others. Several broad categories of preparedness actions include: official acknowledgement of National Tsunami Preparedness Week, local “tsunami walk” drills, simulated tsunami-based exercises, testing of sirens and notification systems, outreach materials (brochures, videos, maps), workshops, presentations, media events, and websites. Next steps include building on the foundation established in 2014 by leveraging ShakeOut audiences, providing people with more information about how they can participate in 2015, and carrying the effort forward to other states and territories.",

            "abstract": "Conventional wisdom holds that the direct cost of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is low, indicating that its technical barrier is small. This is one of the reasons why SAI is receiving so much attention from natural and social scientists alike. Such estimates are, however, few and subject to appraisal optimism or optimism bias.\nHere we review the literature on the SAI and synthesise published estimates of the related parameters in order re-examine the SAI direct cost and operational scale, another measure of the technical barriers. Although references are often made to a \"few billion dollars\" as the SAI cost, our re-analysis shows that the cost of a 2 W/m2cooling could reach 100 billion dollars per year in the case of aircraft-based SAI with sulfates, with a required fleet size of about 1000 airplanes. There are approaches to trim the cost and scale, such as using soot instead of sulfates and developing dedicated, new aircraft. The choice of black carbon, however, would present significant environmental risks.\nSince the cheapness of SAI underlies the governance debate, our results point to the need of a more systematic analysis of the engineering aspects of SAI.",

            "abstract": "The duration of strong shaking is particularly important for assessing building performance, potential landslides and liquefaction hazards. The results of this investigation can potentially help reduce related fatalities and economic losses. In this study, we analyzed the acceleration seismograms of the Taiwan Strong Motion Network to characterize the strong shaking duration associated with earthquake sources, propagation paths and site effects. This study proposes a new definition for the strong shaking duration called “effective shaking duration” (ESD), which considers the amplitude and radiation energy decays. We first consider the window of a time series during which the amplitude is greater than or equal to 0.01 g, and we then defined the ESD as the length of the interval of the dissipated energy within 5-95% of the total energy during this time frame We calculated the strong shaking duration for 495 inter-plate events with magnitudes of ML > 5.0 and focal depths < 50 km in the Taiwan region from 1994 to 2012. Using a nonlinear regression procedure, we thus obtained an empirical equation for strong shaking durations. The equation is a function of earthquake magnitude, distance and site conditions, which are defined by the Vs30 value (the S-wave velocity structure of the top 30 m of the site). The results indicate that the shaking durations significantly increase with magnitude and also decrease with distance and Vs30. Compared with empirical equations from global datasets, our empirical equation is applicable to earthquakes in other regions and will produce smaller but more applicable duration values for smaller earthquakes. However, for larger events, our ESD values are comparable with those derived from other definitions (e.g., significant duration). Although the empirical relationship is mainly based on Taiwanese events, in view of the massive dataset, this empirical equation could provide important information to the global community regarding the ground shaking duration estimation in the ground motion prediction of future earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Unoriented samples from the ~12.7 Ma Tiva Canyon (TC) tuff from Yucca Mountain, Nevada are studied in terms of magnetic properties and geomagnetic paleointensity. The magnetic mineralogy and magnetic properties of the TC tuff have previously been well documented, and the remanence-carrier in ~15-m thick zones at the top and bottom of the unit is dominantly is single domain (SD) to superparamagnetic (SP) magnetite, which may be considered ideal for absolute paleointensity studies. Among one of the several episodic volcanic eruptions of the Southwestern Nevada Volcanic Field (SWNVF), the welded TC tuff belongs to the Paintbrush Group. Here we present magnetic properties from two previously unreported sections of the TC tuff, as well as Thellier-type absolute paleointensity estimates. Samples were collected from the lower ~7 m at the base of the flow. Magnetic properties studied include hysteresis, bulk magnetic susceptibility, frequency-dependent susceptibility, and anhysteretic remanent magnetization acquisition. Magnetic property results are consistent with earlier work, showing that the main magnetic mineral is magnetite. SP samples are dominant from the lower ~1 m to ~3.6 m basal unit while the middle unit of ~3.7 m to 7.0 m mainly consists of SD samples. The paleointensity results are closely tied to the stratigraphic height and magnetic properties linked to domain state. The SD samples have consistent absolute paleointensity values 32.40±0.22 uT, VADM 5.74*1022 A.m2 and behaved ideally during paleointensity experiments. The SP samples have consistently higher paleointensity and less ideal behavior, but would likely pass many traditional quality-control tests. Since the magnetite has been interpreted to form by precipitation out of the glass post-emplacement, but at temperatures higher than the Curie temperature, we tentatively interpret the SD remanence to be a primary thermal remanent magnetization and the paleointensity result to be a valid estimate of geomagnetic paleointensity for the Miocene. Post-emplacement vapor-phase alteration might be expected to alter magnetic mineralogy and magnetization, and has been reported in the upper portions of the TC tuff, but not in the lower sections discussed here.",

            "abstract": "Stratigraphic and structural observations of newly acquired seismic reflection data along the offshore south Java reveal the structural style of deformation along the forearc and the role of subducting bathymetric highs to the morphology of the forearc region. The forearc region can be divided in to two major structural units: accretionary wedge and forearc and forearc basin where a backthrust marks the boundary between the accretionary wedge and the forearc basin sediments. The continuous compression in the subduction zone has induced younger landward-vergent folds and thrusts within the seaward margin of the forearc basin sediments, which together with the backthrust is referred as the Offshore South Java Fault Zone (OSJFZ), representing the growth of the accretionary wedge farther landward. Seaward-vergent imbricated thrusts have deformed the sediments in the accretionary wedge younging seaward, and have developed fold-thrust belts in the accretionary wedge toward trench. Together with the backthrusts, these seaward-vergent thrusts characterize the growth of accretionary wedge in South of Java trench. Based on these new results, we suggest that accretionary wedge mechanic is not the first order factor in shaping the morphology of the accretionary wedge complex. Instead the subducting bathymetric highs play the main role in shaping the forearc that are manifested in the uplift of the forearc high and intense deformation along the OSJFZ. These subducting highs also induce compression within the accretionary sediments, evident from landward deflection of the subduction front at the trench and inner part of accretionary wedge in the seaward margin of the forearc basin. Intense deformation is also observed on the seaward portion of the accretionary wedge area where the bathymetric highs subducted. We suggest that these subducted bathymetric features define the segment boundaries for megathrust earthquakes, and hence reducing the maximum size of the earthquakes in the Java subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "How strongly the dayside high-latitude convection is controlled by the orientation of the IMF for periods of the steady IMF is well established. However, the nature of the transition that the convection makes when the IMF changes sharply is still not fully understood. In the present paper, we report the characteristics of the transient nature of the reverse convection on the basis of observations from multi-spacecraft and ground magnetometer stations. During a period of northward IMF on 22 April 2006 the magnetic field observations from three ST-5 spacecraft identified distribution change in the polar cap field-aligned current which responds to a quick IMF turning from the purely northward orientation to the duskward orientation. At this time ST-5 flew over one of the Greenland magnetometer stations located near 1200 MLT. The analysis of the ground magnetic perturbations shows that the field-aligned current distribution, which is closely related to the reverse convection pattern, was changing gradually during about 10 min before reaching a steady state. When the steady state was going on, the IMF changed sharply from the duskward orientation to the dawnward orientation. Immediately after this IMF turning, three DMSP spacecraft (F13, F15, and F16) traversed the dayside polar cap in the northern hemisphere. The ion drift observation indicates that the polar cap convection changed from the clockwise circulation to the counter-clockwise circulation during about 10 min. The data from the Greenland magnetometer stations show that a transient state, i.e., deformation or reduction of the clockwise circulation started in the near-noon and postnoon sectors almost simultaneously when the ion drift consisting of the clockwise circulation is still seen in the prenoon polar cap by the DMSP spacecraft. We discuss the changing global patterns that occurred over the whole dayside polar cap during the course of the 10-min transient state for both cases.",

Mean net ecosystem productivity, NEP, in the conifer stand is 145 (range 35 to 277) g C m2 y-1 over the 2003 to 2013 period, while mean NEP in the deciduous stand is 271 (226 and 317) g C m2 y-1 from 2012 to 2013. The study period experienced four distinct extreme weather patterns: warm and dry springs in 2005 and 2012, extremely wet and warm summer in 2006, a summer drought in 2007 and warm summers in 2010 and 2012. In February-March 2012, the conifer stand was selectively thinned and approximately 30% of trees were removed to improve light and water availability and stimulate growth of remaining trees. Thinning reduced NEP in the first post-thinning year, with mean annual NEP of 48 g C m2 y-1 in 2012. Increased supply of dead organic matter and warm temperatures in 2012 increased ecosystem respiration much more than photosynthesis, resulting in lower annual NEP. Heat stress and drought in spring of 2005 reduced NEP of the conifer stand to 35 g C m2 y-1. The impact of this extreme weather event on NEP was similar to that observed in 2012 when the stand experienced a drastic structural change, a dry spring and warm temperatures throughout the growing season. Observed fluxes from this forest and other Fluxnet sites were used to develop and validate a C and N coupled dynamic vegetation model, CLASS-CTEM-N that was applied to simulate terrestrial ecosystem’s carbon, water and energy budgets at 0.5 x 0.5 degree spatial resolution across the globe from 1901 to 2010 as part of North American Carbon Program (NACP) site-level and model intercomparison initiatives. The inclusion of the N processes in CLASS-CTEM model has improved model response to changing climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration levels.",

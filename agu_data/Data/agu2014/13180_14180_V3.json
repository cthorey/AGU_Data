            "abstract": "Real-time location of seismic events requires a robust and extremely efficient means of associating and identifying seismic phases with hypothetical sources. An association algorithm converts a series of phase arrival times into a catalog of earthquake hypocenters. The classical approach based on time-space stacking of the locus of possible hypocenters for each phase arrival using the principal of acoustic reciprocity has been in use now for many years. One of the most significant problems that has emerged over time with this approach is related to the extreme variations in seismic station density throughout the global seismic network. To address this problem we have developed a novel, Bayesian association algorithm, which looks at the association problem as a dynamically evolving complex system of “many to many relationships”. While the end result must be an array of one to many relations (one earthquake, many phases), during the association process the situation is quite different. Both the evolving possible hypocenters and the relationships between phases and all nascent hypocenters is many to many (many earthquakes, many phases). The computational framework we are using to address this is a responsive, NoSQL graph database where the earthquake-phase associations are represented as intersecting Bayesian Learning Networks. The approach directly addresses the network inhomogeneity issue while at the same time allowing the inclusion of other kinds of data (e.g., seismic beams, station noise characteristics, priors on estimated location of the seismic source) by representing the locus of intersecting hypothetical loci for a given datum as joint probability density functions.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic observations of interseismic deformation near dip-slip faults may be used to estimate slip rates on both isolated structures and across geometrically complex thrust systems. Interpreting these kinematic measurements requires integrating the effects of interseismic elastic strain accumulation from quasi-static earthquake cycle models. While a kinematically consistent theory for planar thick-skinned models has been widely applied the theory for thin-skinned models has remained less satisfactory due to an inadequate treatment of vertical velocities. Here we develop a kinematically consistent model of horizontal and vertical interseismic deformation in thin-skinned thrust systems including non-planar faults. The key aspect of this model is the integration of kinematic structural evolution models with elastic deformation models. Predictions include localized interseismic hanging wall uplift as well as smoothly varying horizontal and vertical velocities. Additionally, this model implies slightly modified patterns of elastic coseismic deformation in the hanging wall including coseismic folding. The interseismic deformation model described here provides a step toward more unified interpretation of both decadal-scale geodetic observations and long-term tectonic uplift.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing of particulate matter concentration with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 um(PM2.5) by using ground-based optical measurements of aerosols is investigated based on 6 years of hourly average measurements of aerosol optical properties, PM2.5, ceilometer backscatter coefficients and meteorological factors from Howard University Beltsville Campus facility (HUBC). The accuracy of quantitative retrieval of PM2.5 using aerosol optical depth (AOD) is limited due to changes in aerosol size distribution and vertical distribution. In this study, ceilometer backscatter coefficients are used to provide vertical information of aerosol. It is found that the PM2.5-AOD ratio can vary largely for different aerosol vertical distributions. The ratio is also sensitive to mode parameters of bimodal lognormal aerosol size distribution when the geometric mean radius for the fine mode is small. Using two Angstrom exponents calculated at three wavelengths of 415, 500, 860nm are found better representing aerosol size distributions than only using one Angstrom exponent. A regression model is proposed to assess the impacts of different factors on the retrieval of PM2.5. Compared to a simple linear regression model, the new model combining AOD and ceilometer backscatter can prominently improve the fitting of PM2.5. The contribution of further introducing Angstrom coefficients is apparent. Using combined measurements of AOD, ceilometer backscatter, Angstrom coefficients and meteorological parameters in the regression model can get a correlation coefficient of 0.79 between fitted and expected PM2.5.",

            "abstract": "The Willamette is a gravel-bed river that drains ~28,800 km^2 between the Coast Range and Cascade Range in northwestern Oregon before entering the Columbia River near Portland. In the last 150 years, natural and anthropogenic drivers have altered the sediment transport regime, drastically reducing the geomorphic complexity of the river. Previously dynamic multi-threaded reaches have transformed into stable single channels to the detriment of ecosystem diversity and productivity. Flow regulation by flood-control dams, bank revetments, and conversion of riparian forests to agriculture have been key drivers of channel change. To date, little has been done to quantitatively describe temporal and spatial trends of sediment transport in the Willamette. This knowledge is critical for understanding how modern processes shape landforms and habitats. The goal of this study is to describe large-scale temporal and spatial trends in the sediment budget by reconstructing historical topography and bathymetry from aerial imagery. The area of interest for this project is a reach of the Willamette stretching from the confluence of the McKenzie River to the town of Peoria. While this reach remains one of the most dynamic sections of the river, it has exhibited a great loss in geomorphic complexity. Aerial imagery for this section of the river is available from USDA and USACE projects dating back to the 1930’s. Above water surface elevations are extracted using the Imagine Photogrammetry package in ERDAS. Bathymetry is estimated using a method known as Hydraulic Assisted Bathymetry in which hydraulic parameters are used to develop a regression between water depth and pixel values. From this, pixel values are converted to depth below the water surface. Merged together, topography and bathymetry produce a spatially continuous digital elevation model of the geomorphic floodplain. Volumetric changes in sediment stored along the study reach are then estimated for different historic periods. Additionally, HEC-RAS is used as an independent measure of sediment transport given prescribed flow, sediment and geomorphic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Advances in optical isotope techniques have enabled near-continuous determination of leaf transpiration isotopic composition (δT), allowing researchers to trace water movement through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum at fine temporal scales. However, to date very few direct measurements of δT are available. We applied a novel flow-through chamber method developed by Wang et al. (2011) to monitor short-term variability in leaf transpired water isotopic composition of two African savanna trees, Vachiella tortillis and Senegalia mellifera, in response to variable irradiance and soil water content. Single leaves were inserted into a custom cuvette connected to an off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (IA-ICOS) water vapor isotope analyzer and allowed to reach isotopic steady-state. Measurements were taken on alternating species every 10 minutes for two hours during mid-morning when plants were most active. Above-canopy irradiance and soil moisture at rooting depth were recorded daily at 1- and 10-minute intervals, respectively. We found that shading initiated rapid depletion of δ2H and δ18O in both species, though differences were more pronounced in V. tortillis. Similarly, an increase in irradiance caused δ18O enrichment of transpired water by up to 5‰ on the order of minutes. Interestingly, soil water content was positively correlated with δ2H: in drier conditions transpired water was more depleted relative to wetter conditions. Our results suggest that the isotopic composition of leaf water within a canopy may vary considerably depending on leaf location and amount of radiation received. These findings have important implications for models of plant water isotopes and underscore the need for additional direct observations of δT . ",

            "abstract": "The Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) distribution, logN=a-bN, is commonly used to describe the magnitude-frequency distribution (MFD) of earthquakes. The b-value, which characterizes the relative number of large vs. small earthquakes, is typically around 1 for tectonic earthquakes, but higher values have been reported for earthquake swarms and volcanic events. Both geometric and dynamic arguments have been used to explain why the b-value tends to be close to 1.\nThe earthquake catalog detection threshold is usually based on a break in b-value, but this has the important disadvantage of assuming the form of the underlying MFD a priori. Moreover, it’s difficult to discern spatial variations in the detection threshold or to document time-dependent changes, and it's silent about the detection threshold where no earthquakes are detected. We use the approach of Schorlemmer and Woessner [2008] to determine catalog completeness levels by calculating the detection probability as a function of magnitude and distance. We also develop a catalog by using template matching against known earthquakes. Template matching allows us to both lower the detection threshold, and to calculate more precise event magnitudes.\nWe apply this method to the Guy earthquake sequence in central Arkansas, which shows spatial and temporal correlation with injection wells. Our template matching technique leads to a remarkable increase of the number of earthquakes and significantly improves the magnitude of completeness. The earthquakes continuously migrated since late September, 2010 and eventually illuminated a ~ 13 km long fault in central Arkansas [Horton, 2012].\nWe have undertaken this study of earthquakes induced by fluid injection to determine whether their MFD is well described by G-R statistics, and if so, whether there are significant differences between induced and tectonic earthquakes. We will also explore whether there are temporal changes in b-value that might be diagnostic of changes in deformation patterns of induced seismicity.",

            "abstract": "Volcanoes are the largest natural source of SO2 in the world and volcanic SO2 is an important aerosol precursor in many atmospheric composition and climate simulations. The current AeroCOM database for volcanic SO2 has been compiled from both publications and assumptions about volcanic degassing behavior and includes over 36,000 named and unnamed volcanic sources. However, satellite observations compiled from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), aboard NASA’s Aura satellite, the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS), aboard NOAA/NASA’s Suomi NPP satellite, and other satellite based SO2 observing instruments do not support many of the estimates made for volcanic SO2 in the current database. For example, the current database significantly overestimates SO2 from Barren Island in December 2008 and significantly underestimates the SO2 erupted from Ambrym during the same month. Additionally, all of the volcanoes in the database are assumed to be degassing continually to some extent, an assumption that is not supported by satellite observations.\nWe present three CTM GEOS-Chem simulations, run from 2007 to 2008, in order to highlight these issues. The first simulation includes the existing AeroCOM SO2 database and a few select eruptions from this simulation will be compared in detail to satellite observations made over the same period of time. The second simulation will be run with all of the volcanic SO2 removed in order to examine the sensitivity of the global SO2 budget to volcanic contributions. Finally, the third simulation will be run with updated values of volcanic SO2 at specific sources that are based on satellite observations during the corresponding time period. The existing AeroCOM volcanic SO2 database is robust but, in many cases, is also based on outdated degassing estimates and assumptions that do not agree with our increasing body of satellite observations. Improving the database has the potential to improve model chemistry for a wide community of users.",

            "abstract": "Light absorbing constituents of organic aerosol, or “brown carbon (BrC)”, have been recently recognized as an important contributor to climate forcing. However, little is known about fundamental relationship between the chemical composition of BrC and its light absorption properties. Furthermore, both composition and optical properties of BrC are highly variable for SOA generated from different precursors. It has been suggested that among the myriad constituents of organic aerosol only few strong chromophores may determine the overall light absorption properties, making the identification of the chromophores particularly challenging. Toluene is one of the major anthropogenic VOCs in urban air. Chamber studies have shown that secondary organic aerosols (SOA) generated from photo-oxidation of toluene under high NOx conditions exhibit BrC properties in contrast to those formed under low NOx conditions. In this study, liquid chromatography coupled with UV/Vis spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry was used to identify the light absorbing organic molecules in toluene SOA. It is demonstrated that nitroaromatic compounds with 2 or 3 nitro-groups are major BrC chromophores of toluene SOA in visible light range. Their structures are predicted by highly accurate measurement of elemental compositions and fragmentation spectra obtained from MS/MS analysis.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a high fidelity ``Satellite-beacon Ionospheric-scintillation Global Model of the upper Atmosphere\" (SIGMA) which is a full 3D EM wave propagation model to simulate GPS scintillations globally. We demonstrate in this work that the results from this model can form a basic framework on the use of inverse method to understand the physics of high latitude irregularities using GPS scintillations. We are using SIGMA and an inverse method to understand the physics of the irregularities observed with GPS receivers from six different inter-hemispheric high latitude stations during a geomagnetic storm on 9 March 2012, and from Autonomous Adaptive Low-Power Instrument Platform (AAL-PIP) Antarctic stations during a substorm on 9 January 2014. We utilize ancillary observations from SuperDARN, ISRs, riometers etc. to obtain some of the input parameters of SIGMA. Further, we implement a uniform-grid SIGMA simulation or a non-linear optimization of the model to obtain the rest of the unknowns that give us the best fit with data. The input parameters of SIGMA thus derived represent the physical and propagation parameters related to the physics of the irregularity that produced those GNSS scintillations. Some of our findings from this investigation include that the spectral indices and outer scales for ionospheric heights of 350~km are higher than those at 120~km. The best fits we obtained from our inverse method mostly agree with the observations except for some cases, which might be because the spectral model we use is insufficient to describe irregularity physics. We need more auxiliary data in order to facilitate the possibility of accomplishing a unique solution to the inverse problem.",

We place some of the stratospheric composition measurements in perspective, by using merged datasets that include the Aura MLS data. Global monthly zonal mean stratospheric data records from satellite-based remote measurements were created by NASA's Global Ozone Chemistry and Related Trace gas Data Records for the Stratosphere (GOZCARDS) project. These data records were drawn from high quality satellite-based measurements of stratospheric composition starting in 1979 for ozone and in the early 1990s for other data records. Merged data records were obtained by combining the instrument-specific (source) data records, taking into account the mean biases between them during time periods of overlap. We briefly review the construction of GOZCARDS merged data records and provide observational results for various species (HCl, H2O, O3, N2O, HNO3). We use two model versions of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), a free-running (FR-WACCM) and a \"specified dynamics\" (SD-WACCM) version, to highlight differences in the level of agreement between the models and the observations.",

            "abstract": "The upper part of the Brushy Basin Member in the Four Corners region of the U.S. was deposited in an ephemeral alkaline saline lake system with copious input of volcanic ash. The variegated shale formation provides a setting for the study of early diagenetic iron cycling that records the action of alkaline saline fluid chemistries reacting with volcaniclastic sediments in the presence of microbes. A bull’s-eye pattern of authigenic minerals with increasing alteration towards the basinal center similar to modern alkaline saline lakes provides evidence for an extreme paleoenvironmental interpretation. The purpose of this research is to document specific factors, such as reactive sediments, microbial influences, and grain size that affect concretion formation and iron cycling in an ancient extreme environment.\nThree broad diagenetic facies are interpreted by color and associated bioturbation features: red, green and intermediate. Diagenetic facies reflect meter-scale paleotopography: red facies represent shallow water to subaerial, oxidizing conditions; green facies reflect saturated conditions and reducing pore water chemistry shortly after deposition, and intermediate facies represent a combination of the previous two conditions. Evidence of biotic influence is abundant and trace fossils exhibit patterns associated with the diagenetic facies. Red diagenetic facies typically contain burrows and root traces and green diagenetic facies exhibit restricted biotic diversity typically limited to algal molds (vugs). Microbial fossils are well-preserved and are in close proximity to specific iron mineral textures suggesting biotic influence on the crystal morphology.\nThree categories of concretions are characterized based on mineralogy: carbonate, iron (oxyhydr)oxide and phosphate concretions. Concretion mineralogy and size vary within an outcrop and even within a stratigraphic horizon such that more than one main category is typically present in an outcrop. Variation in concretion mineralogy and morphology within the Brushy Basin Member suggests that alkaline saline fluid chemistries in concert with microbial interaction created diagenetic microenvironments within a larger lake system to influence iron cycling and these reactions can be spatially variable even on 10s of cm scales.",

These fluctuations have been correlated with diel cycles of environmental forcing (e.g., soil temperature), or with synoptic weather events (e.g., rain events and pressure-induced ventilation). We used an extensive suite of observations to examine these phenomena over two months in a subalpine forest in Colorado, USA (the Niwot Ridge AmeriFlux site). Measurements included automated soil respiration chambers and automated measurements of the soil gas profile. We found 1) no diel change in the d13C of the soil surface flux or the CO2 produced in the soil (despite strong diel change in surface flux rate), 2) no change in d13C following wetting (despite a significant increase in soil flux rate), and 3) no evidence of pressure-induced ventilation of the soil. Measurements of the d13C of surface CO2 flux agreed closely with the isotopic composition of soil CO2 production calculated using soil profile measurements. Temporal variation in the d13C of surface flux was relatively minor and unrelated to measured environmental variables. Deep in the soil profile, results conform to established theory regarding diffusive soil gas transport and isotopic fractionation, and suggest that sampling soil gas at a depth of several tens of centimeters is a simple and effective way to assess the mean d13C of the surface flux.",

            "abstract": "The southern Appalachian region is experiencing increasing air temperature, CO2, and precipitation variability, but the magnitude and direction of the forest carbon and water cycling responses are unknown. Examining the interannual variability of these environmental drivers can offer insight into the mechanisms that are likely to dominate the longer-term responses. Higher temperatures in these mature, energy-limited, deciduous forests can lengthen the growing season, leading to higher gross primary productivity; however, these gains may be offset by increased respiration rates. Longer growing seasons may also increase evapotranspiration, particularly if warmer temperatures also increase vapor pressure deficit. On the other hand, evapotranspiration may decrease if more variable precipitation patterns lead to more frequent water-limited and energy-limited conditions. We examine the effects of climate on phenology and fluxes of water and carbon using several years of data from the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory. In an attempt to constrain and identify sources of these fluxes, we combine data from a vertical profile eddy covariance system with a subcanopy eddy covariance system and soil CO2 efflux measurements. Analysis of temporal variability in fluxes is examined at daily to interannual scales. Higher air temperature in February and March of 2012 corresponded with leaf expansion occurring approximately two-weeks earlier than in 2013 and 2014. Overall, seasonal variability in climatic drivers appears to have a greater effect on net carbon exchange than on evapotranspiration.",

Observations also suggest hazy exoplanets are common (Sing et al. 2011, Kreidberg et al 2014), so hazy planet spectra will be relevant to future exoplanet spectral characterization missions. Here, we consider the implications of hydrocarbon aerosols on the spectrum of Archean Earth, examining the effect of a haze layer on the detectability of spectral features from putative biosignatures and the Rayleigh scattering slope. We also examine haze's impact on the spectral energy distribution at the planetary surface, which may be important to the co-evolution of life with its environment. Because the atmospheric pressure and haze particle composition of the Archean Earth are poorly constrained, we test the impact of atmospheric pressure and particle density on haze formation. Our study uses a modified version of the 1-D photochemical code developed originally by Kasting et al. (1979) to generate a fractal haze in the model Archean atmosphere. The 1-D line-by-line fully multiple scattering Spectral Mapping Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Model (SMART) (Meadows and Crisp 1996) is then used to generate synthetic spectra of early Earth with haze. We find (Fig 1) that haze scattering significantly depletes the radiation at short wavelengths, strongly affecting the spectral region of the Rayleigh slope, a broadband change in spectral shape detectable at low spectral resolution. At the surface, the spectral energy distribution is shifted towards longer wavelengths, which may be important to photosynthetic life. Thus, the haze may have significant effects on biology, which in turn produces the methane that leads to haze formation, creating feedback loops between biology and the planet.",

In application to stations of the TA, outcomes from WG and fk all show similar arrival angle anomalies. However, phase velocity determined from fk is higher and is spatially coarser than results from WG. Performance of WG improves with decreasing frequency as expected.

            "abstract": "Interhemispheric asymmetry has been identified in a number of studies with hemispheric power (HP) and convection pattern between the two hemispheres. The asymmetry of geomagnetic forcing in the two hemispheres can strongly influence the magnetosphere–ionosphere–thermosphere coupling process. Subsequently the responses of the thermospheric dynamics and density to geomagnetic storms between the two hemispheres were reported to be different as well. In our study, the asymmetry has been examined in both ionosphere and thermosphere. First, the Pedersen conductance at high latitudes has been estimated from the electron density profiles (EDPs) of the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) satellites observations during 2008 to 2011. The ratio of the height-integrated Pedersen conductivities between E (100–150 km) and F (150–600 km) regions has been calculated. The analysis shows that the ratio reaches maximum in local winter and minimum in local summer, but the variation of the ratio from local summer to local winter in the southern hemisphere is larger than that in the northern hemisphere, which indicates that the energy partition between the E and F regions in the southern hemisphere changes more significantly than that in the northern hemisphere. Secondly, the seasonal variation of F region neutral wind from the mid-latitude conjugate Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) observations has been studied. The neutral winds from Palmer station (64◦S, 64◦W) have been compared with those from the geomagnetic conjugate location, Millstone Hill (MH). At equinox, the local time variation of neutral wind shows a very good conjugacy between these two locations. But at June solstice, the similarity in the zonal wind becomes less clear. The annual variation of daily average neutral wind from Palmer and MH has also been compared. The annual variation of neutral wind, especially the zonal component, is much less symmetric between the two sites than the local time variation. The empirical horizontal wind model shows a good agreement with the observations in both local time and annual variations. The results of this study will greatly advance your understanding of the physical processes and improve our capability to describe the atmosphere response to external drivers.",

Thus, the high pressure melting curve of Fe0.9Ni0.1 is considered to be an important reference for characterizing the cores of terrestrial planets. We have determined the melting points of fcc-structured Fe and Fe0.9Ni0.1 up to 86 GPa using an in-situ method that monitors the atomic dynamics of the Fe atoms in the sample, synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy (Jackson et al. 2013). A laser heated diamond anvil cell is used to provide the high pressure-high temperature environmental conditions, and in-situ X-ray diffraction is used to constrain the pressure of the sample. To eliminate the influence of temperature fluctuations experienced by the sample on the determination of melting, we develop a Fast Temperature Readout (FasTeR) spectrometer. The FasTeR spectrometer features a fast reading rate (>100 Hz), a high sensitivity, a large dynamic range and a well-constrained focus. By combining the melting curve of fcc-structured Fe0.9Ni0.1 alloy determined in our study and the fcc-hcp phase boundary from Komabayashi et al. (2012), we calculate the fcc-hcp-liquid triple point of Fe0.9Ni0.1. Using this triple point and the thermophysical parameters from a nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering study on hcp-Fe (Murphy et al. 2011), we compute the melting curve of hcp-structured Fe0.9Ni0.1. We will discuss our new experimental results with implications for the cores of Venus, Earth and Mars.\nSelect references:\nMcDonough & Sun (1995): The composition of the Earth. Chem.

To advance our understanding of the evolution of permeability accompanying serpentinization reactions, we performed a series of flow-through experiments at a temperature of 260˚C, a confining pressure of 50 MPa, and a pore pressure of 20±2 MPa on cylindrical cores of ultramafic rocks (18 mm in diameter and 23 mm length) containing a single through-going tensile fracture. Pore fluid flow was in one direction and was collected routinely for chemical analysis. A 7.5 mm thick layer of the same rock, crushed and sieved (0.18-1.0 mm) was placed on the inlet end of the sample to produce a reactive heated reservoir for the pore fluid before entering the fracture. Multiple peridotite samples were tested, to investigate the effect of mineral assemblage on fluid-rock interaction and permeability.\nThe initial effective permeability of the samples varied between 10-(15-18)m2, and it decreased by about 2 orders of magnitude in 7-10 days, showing that serpentinization reactions result in an initially rapid decrease in permeability. The best fit equation for the observed rate of change in permeability (k) is in the form of dk/dt=Ae-0.01t, where A is a constant and t is time. This result suggests that the rate of serpentine formation is largely controlled by the initial permeability rather than the properties of the reacting rock. Assuming flow between parallel plates, we find the effective crack width decreases by approximately 2 orders of magnitude during the experiments. The fluid chemistry and mineralogy data support the occurrence of serpentinization reactions. The early peak and monotonic decrease in the concentration of Mg, and Si in pore fluid collected from all samples is consistent with an initial phase of rapid Mg-silicate dissolution followed by a declining rate as precipitation coated reactive surfaces. EMP analysis and SEM imaging show precipitation of serpentine phases along the walls of the tensile fracture, which is the main factor contributing to the reduction in permeability.",

            "abstract": "Hot flow anomalies (HFAs) at Earth’s bow shock were identified in THEMIS C satellite data for August 2007 to December 2009. The 142 events were classified as “young” or “mature” and then “spontaneous” or “regular”. HFAs were categorized as “mature” if there were strong shocks at the edges and a single hot ion population. HFAs were categorized as “young” if there were two ion populations, density and magnetic strength depletions, plasma heating, and no shocks at the edges. It is suggested that young HFAs evolve into mature HFAs. \"Spontaneous\" HFAs (SHFA) are HFAs not associated with a solar wind discontinuity whereas \"regular\" HFAs are associated with a solar wind discontinuity.\nIn this study, SHFAs and HFAs do not show major differences in their plasma parameters. They have a magnetic local time range from 7.3 - 16.7. The normalized HFA occurrence rate is largest for approximately radial interplanetary magnetic field, cone angles less than ~55° (less than ~35° for young regular HFAs), magnetic local times away from noon, relatively larger Mach numbers in the range observed, and high solar wind speeds. The analysis also suggests the operation of an HFA cooling mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have documented the key role of atmospheric rivers (ARs) in extreme precipitation and flooding in the western U.S., however very little research has been conducted on this topic in the eastern U.S. Evidence suggests that events such as the severe flooding in Tennessee in May 2010 have been partially driven by the presence of an AR, and that AR conditions may also have contributed to the “Snowmageddon” blizzard that struck the mid-Atlantic region in 2010. However, a robust study of the linkage between AR conditions and eastern U.S. precipitation remains elusive. An extreme precipitation climatology produced as part of the NOAA Hydrometeorology Testbed’s (HMT’s) most recent pilot project in the Southeast U.S. has identified a collection of heavy precipitation cases in which AR conditions are likely to have been a driving force of the precipitation in this region. A newly-developed AR detection tool (ARDT) based on integrated vapor transport (IVT) is being tested for the Southeast U.S. region and a subset of precipitation cases. ARDT performance is also compared to that of the western United States in order to determine the tool’s utility for pinpointing precipitation in the eastern U.S.’s environment of generally higher background moisture and more diverse array of precipitation generation mechanisms (as opposed to generally drier background states and more orographically-focused precipitation in western U.S. AR environments.)\nThis presentation will detail the linkage between identified ARs and known heavy precipitation events in the southeastern U.S., as well as compare the types and frequencies of heavy precipitation events that are not linked to AR conditions in this region. A primary objective of this investigation is to determine whether defining synoptic-scale moisture transport features as ARs in the eastern U.S. can provide potential operational or applied forecast benefit.",

However, a variety of studies suggest that individual aerosol products have significant differences in the geographic distribution of their retrieval uncertainties. Nonetheless, it can be difficult or impractical to track down relevant product validation studies and invest time in mastering the proprietary file formats of these aerosol products. As a result, many studies are performed using data from one or two most familiar products that, oftentimes, may not be optimal for a given region of interest.\nIn this presentation, we will use Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) data within the framework of the Multi-sensor Aerosol Products Sampling System (MAPSS) to catalog the accuracy of aerosol retrievals from the spaceborne sensors listed above. We will report our findings in analyzing the spatial and temporal distributions of the uncertainties in the global over-land and maritime retrievals of aerosols based on inter-comparing spaceborne data with coincident ground-based measurements from both AERONET and MAN. We will also explain our vision of how this analysis can be used as a base for a multi-sensor aerosol product package that would help end users to make a more informed choice when selecting data for their regions of interest.",

            "abstract": "As the solar wind travels outwards through the corona, it continues to be strongly and preferentially heated, but the location at which this heating primarily occurs is unknown. Some theories attribute the non-thermal plasma properties observed at 1AU to a continuous heating, while others see it as a relic of heating that occurred closer to the solar surface. A recent study by Kasper et al. has provided new insights, using an analysis of collisional age to construct a model of the solar wind in which the outflowing plasma is energized only up to a boundary point, and after which it ceases to be preferentially heated. This boundary is found to exist in the 30 and 50 solar radii range, varying with changing solar wind conditions, and the model shows very good agreement with measurements taken by the Wind spacecraft at 1AU. In the study presented here, a relationship between the Kasper et al. heating boundary and the solar wind’s Alfvén point is investigated. A model of the Alfvén point location is constructed and calculated using Wind spacecraft observations, and the Wind data is subsequently split into bins based on Alfvén point height. Recalculating the height of the preferential heating boundary for each of these bins reveals a very strong linear correlation between the heating boundary and the Alfvén point. This suggests that the Alfvén point may play an important role in determining how and where the preferential heating of the solar wind occurs.",

            "abstract": "The process by which climate models are evaluated has evolved substantially over the past decade, with the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) serving as a centralizing activity for coordinating model experimentation and enabling research. Scientists with a broad spectrum of expertise have contributed to the CMIP model evaluation process, resulting in many hundreds of publications that have served as a key resource for the IPCC process. For several reasons, efforts are now underway to further systematize some aspects of the model evaluation process. First, some model evaluation can now be considered routine and should not require “re-inventing the wheel” or a journal publication simply to update results with newer models. Second, the benefit of CMIP research to model development has not been optimal because the publication of results generally takes several years and is usually not reproducible for benchmarking newer model versions. And third, there are now hundreds of model versions and many thousands of simulations, but there is no community-based mechanism for routinely monitoring model performance changes. An important change in the design of CMIP6 can help address these limitations. CMIP6 will include a small set standardized experiments as an ongoing exercise (CMIP “DECK”: ongoing Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima), so that modeling groups can submit them at any time and not be overly constrained by deadlines. In this presentation, efforts to establish routine benchmarking of existing and future CMIP simulations will be described. To date, some benchmarking tools have been made available to all CMIP modeling groups to enable them to readily compare with CMIP5 simulations during the model development process. A natural extension of this effort is to make results from all CMIP simulations widely available, including the results from newer models as soon as the simulations become available for research. Making the results from routine performance tests readily accessible will help advance a more transparent model evaluation process.",

            "abstract": "The geoid anomaly and driving force associated with the cooling oceanic lithosphere (“ridge push”) are both proportional to dipole moment of the density-depth distribution, and allow a reevaluation of the ridge push force using the geoid. The challenge with this approach is to isolate the “lithospheric geoid” from the full geoid signal. Our approach is to use a band-pass spherical harmonic filter on the full geoid (e.g., EGM2008-WGS84, complete to spherical harmonic degree and order 2159) between orders 6 and 80. However, even this “lithospheric geoid” is noisy, and thus we average over 100 profiles evenly spaced along the global ridge system to obtain an average geoid step associated with the mid-ocean ridges. Because the positive ridge geoid signal is largest near the ridge (and to capture fast-spreading ridges), we evaluate symmetrical profiles extending ±45 m.y. about the ridge. We find an average ridge geoid anomaly of 4.5m, which is equivalent to a 10m anomaly for 100 m.y. old oceanic lithosphere. This geoid step corresponds to a ridge push force of ~2.4 x1012N/m for old oceanic lithosphere of 100 m.y., very similar to earlier estimates of ~2.5 x1012N/m based on simple half-space models. This simple half-space model also predicts constant geoid slopes of about 0.15 m/m.y. for cooling oceanic lithosphere. Our observed geoid slopes are consistent with this value for ages up to 40-50 m.y., but drop off to lower values at greater ages. We model this using a plate cooling model (with a thickness of the order of 125km) to fit the observation that the geoid anomaly and ridge driving force only increase slowly for ages greater than 40 m.y. (in contrast to the half-space model where the linear dependence on age holds for all ages). This reduction of the geoid slope results in a 20% decrease in the predicted ridge push force. This decrease is due to the combined effects of treating the oceanic lithosphere as a cooling plate (vs. a half-space), and the loss of geoidal energy required through filtering of the geoid. We evaluate the role of revised ridge push forces with plate-scale stress models. Our revised estimate of the ridge push force based on the lithospheric geoid, and corresponding stress models, further emphasizes the “active” rather than “passive” nature of the plates themselves in plate tectonics.",

Age constraints (based on fossils, detrital zircon and stable isotopic studies) indicate an early Cambrian age for the uppermost Nagaur Group. Although not well-constrained, the Edicaran-Cambrian boundary is placed within the Nagaur Group. The basal Marwar sedimentary units (the Sonia and Girbakhar sandstones) rest unconformably over the ~750 Ma Malani rhyolites and contain enigmatic discoidal fossils. The age for the onset of sedimentation within the lowermost Jodhpur Group remains elusive. In this study we reported new LA-ICP-MS ages from a felsic igneous rock layer within the Jodhpur Group (Sonia sandstone) at Khatu. Cathodoluminescence images showed the zircons from the felsic rock are rounded and fragmentary consistent with an inherited or xenocrystic origin. The age spectra from the zircons are dominated by peaks of around 850 Ma, 1200~1400 Ma, 1500~2000 Ma, 2500 Ma consistent with previous studies. A youngest concordant zircon yielded an age 702 Ma ± 17.2. As the ages in our study are from recycled/inherited ancient grains, the exact crystallization age remains elusive. Nevertheless, the eruption of the felsic rocks must be no older than ~700 Ma. Additional studies are underway to constrain the age of the lowermost Marwar Supergroup and to place the basinal development in a tectonic context.",

It plays an important role in cloud formation processes, and contributes to organic acidity of precipitation. Rain and snow deposited to the landscape is a source of nutrient enrichment to ecosystems and water bodies, and is especially important as an input of carbon in coastal regions. Since DOC is highly chemically reactive and bioavailable it influences rates of primary and secondary productivity in aquatic ecosystems. Despite the significance of DOC to many ecosystem processes, knowledge about its contributions to landscapes in precipitation remains limited. Here, we quantified the removal of DOC from the atmosphere via precipitation over space and time in order to assess the magnitude of wet deposition as a link between terrestrial and aquatic components of the carbon cycle. Further, we consider the predictability of organic matter in precipitation as a function of hydro-chemical and climatic variables. We measured DOC concentration and composition in storm events both sequentially (hourly during events) and seasonally (weekly over the year). Data on the chemical composition of precipitation, along with meteorological back-trajectory analyses help clarify how an interplay between emission sources, atmospheric transport and climatic conditions determine the abundance of rainwater DOC across Pennsylvania.",

            "abstract": "NASA has identified a major need to develop long-term, consistent products valid across multiple missions, with well-defined uncertainty statistics addressing specific Earth science questions. These types of data sets are termed Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) and are defined as long-term, well calibrated and validated data records for Earth Science research. Land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) data have been identified as an important ESDR by NASA and many other international organizations, e.g. GCOS. LST&E data are essential for a wide variety of surface-atmosphere studies, from calculating the evapotranspiration of plant canopies to retrieving atmospheric water vapor. LST&E products are currently generated from sensors in low Earth orbit (LEO) such as the NASA-EOS MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua satellites as well as from sensors in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) such as GOES. Sensors in LEO orbits provide global coverage at moderate spatial resolutions (~1-km) but more limited temporal coverage (twice-daily), while sensors in GEO orbits provide more frequent measurements (hourly) at lower spatial resolutions (~3-4 km) over a geographically restricted area. LST&E products from these instruments are currently produced using different emissivities, atmospheric correction, and algorithmic approaches, and usually do not include a full set of uncertainty metrics. NASA has recognized this general lack of consistency between science products and has identified the need to develop long-term, consistent, and calibrated data and products that are valid across multiple missions and satellite sensors. We address this problem by generating three self-consistent LST&E ESDRs from 2000-2018 with well defined uncertainties; 1) a unified global LEO LST-ESDR at 1-km spatial resolution and resampled to daily, 8-day and monthly time-steps; 2) a unified N. and S. America GEO LST-ESDR at 5-km spatial resolution and resampled to hourly temporal resolution; 3) a unified global Emissivity-ESDR at 5-km spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution. Initial results and methodologies will be discussed, including validation and inter-comparisons with heritage products.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic region is expected to experience disproportionately severe impacts due to climate change, affecting sea ice, seasonal snow cover, streamflow, permafrost, glaciers, and ice sheets as well as terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Through the use of the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), a fully coupled regional earth system model, we aim to better understand how changes in these processes may prompt non-linear responses and feedbacks throughout the Arctic region climate system. The net effect of these feedbacks is not easily understood without the use of coupled earth system models that allow us to evaluate the interactions between components of the climate system; determine the extent, magnitude, and sign of complex feedback processes; and to project the climate system’s response to future predictions. RASM is a high resolution, regional, coupled atmosphere - land - sea ice - ocean model that uses the Community Earth System Model (CESM) coupling infrastructure over a Pan-Arctic domain. RASM is composed of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrology model, the RVIC streamflow routing model, the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) model and the Los Alamos Sea Ice model (CICE). We evaluate RASM’s abilities to capture key features of the land surface climate and hydrological cycle over the recent decades (1979-2009) through comparisons with uncoupled simulations, reanalysis data sets, satellite measurements and in-situ observations. Of particular interest are the model’s ability to capture diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations in hydrological fluxes and states and the interaction between model components.",

            "abstract": "We describe a Middle Permian radiolarian chert sequence in South China (Chaohu area), with sequence of chert and mudstone layers formulated into binary series.Two interpolation approaches were tested: linear interpolation resulting in a “triangle” series, and staircase interpolation resulting in a “boxcar” series. Spectral analysis of the triangle series reveals decimeter chert-mudstone cycles which represent theoretical Middle Permian 32 kyr obliquity cycling. Tuning these cycles to a 32-kyr periodicity reveals that other cm-scale cycles are in the precession index band and have a strong ~400 kyr amplitude modulation. Additional tuning tests further support a hypothesis of astronomical forcing of the chert sequence. Analysis of the boxcar series reveals additional “eccentricity” terms transmitted by the boxcar representation of the modulating precession-scale cycles. An astronomical time scale reconstructed from these results assumes a Roadian/Wordian boundary age of 268.8 Ma for the onset of the first chert layer at the base of the sequence and ends at 264.1 Ma, for a total duration of 4.7 Myrs. We propose that monsoon-controlled upwelling contributed to the development of the chert-mudstone cycles. A seasonal monsoon controlled by astronomical forcing influenced the intensity of upwelling, modulating radiolarian productivity and silica deposition.",

More than 3 years of data are sorted using the Auroral Electrojet (AE) index into quiet time (<100.0), moderate activity (100.0<AE<300.0), and high activity (>300.0) and by IMF Bz polarity to create six unique maps. Each of the six temperature maps are calculated using each TWINS spacecraft and then compared. The calculation for determining ion temperatures follows the methods in Scime et al., [2002; 2005] and Keesee et al., [2008; 2011].

New data include: 1) a 1 km wide aerial LiDAR survey along the entire surface rupture (@ 10 shots/m2, May 2012,\nwww.opentopography.org\n); 2) terrestrial LiDAR surveys at 5 sites within the MSZ (@ >1000 shots/m2, April 2014); 3) low altitude aerial photography and ground based photography of the entire MSZ; 4) a ground-truthed database of 87 out of the 94 imagery-based offset measurements made within the MSZ; and 5) a database of 50 new field-based offset measurements made within the MSZ by our team on the ground, 31 of which have also been made on the computer (Ladicaoz) with both the 2000 LiDAR data (@ 0.5 m DEM resolution; Chen et al, in review) and 2012 LiDAR data (@ 35 cm DEM resolution; our team).\nNew results to date include 1) significant variability (> 2 m) in horizontal offsets measured along short distances of the surface rupture (~100 m) within segments of the surface rupture that are localized to a single fault strand; 2) strong dependence of decadal scale fault scarp preservation on local lithology (bedrock vs. alluvial fan vs. fine sediment) and geomorphology (uphill vs. downhill facing scarp); 3) newly observed offset features which were never measured during the post-event field response; 4) newly observed offset features too small to be resolved in airborne LiDAR data (< 1 m); 5) nearly 25% of LiDAR imagery-based measurements that were later ground-truthed were judged by our team to warrant removal from the database due to incorrect feature reconstruction; and 6) significant variability in both accuracy of LiDAR offset measurements (relative to field-based measurements) and reported uncertainty between workers, mostly based on differing interpretations of geomorphic complexity.",

Because soil moisture-convection interactions are a local phenomenon that require a sufficiently moist and unstable atmosphere to initiate convection, any systematic changes to water vapor produced by these global circulation changes may manifest in disrupting or promoting the soil moisture-precipitation feedback chain. Using a new framework, the Heated Condensation Framework (HCF; Tawfik and Dirmeyer 2014), local land-atmosphere coupling can be examined by separating the atmospheric background state from the land surface state in terms of convective initiation. The current work explores how the soil moisture-convection relationship changes from year-to-year and during influential El Nino and La Nina events.

The aim of the programme is to quantify the mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet and track changes in the extent of the glaciers, ice caps and ice sheet margin.\nSpecifically, PROMICE aims to estimate the mass loss derived from three fundamentally different sources:\nSurface melt water runoff from the ice sheet margin\nIceberg production\nMass loss of individual glaciers and ice caps surrounding the ice sheet\nThe first is observed by a network of automatic weather stations (AWS) on the ice sheet margin measuring ice ablation as well as meteorological parameters.\nThe second is determined by establishing a so-called ‘flux gate’ along the entire ice sheet margin and keeping track of the ice passing through this gate. The flux gate is obtained from airborne surveys of ice sheet surface elevation and thickness. The volume of the ice passing through the gate is derived from maps of the surface velocity of the ice sheet, produced from satellite radar.\nThe third is investigated through regular mapping of area and elevation of the approximately 20.000 individual glaciers and ice caps in Greenland. Mapping is carried out using recent satellite imagery as well as aerial ortho-photos.\nWithin PROMICE data sets from these activities are collected. They include observations from the network of currently about 20 AWS on the margin of the Greenland ice sheet.

Flow-normalized concentrations and fluxes were estimated using a regression model that removed the influence of interannual variability in streamflow to reveal underlying patterns of change. Stream N export increased in the early 1990s, peaked in the mid-2000s, and has since declined by over 30%. Similarities in the timing and magnitude of N deposition suggest the watershed is responding to changes in atmospheric deposition. Other possible explanations, including forest disturbance, snow depth, or permafrost or ice thaw could not explain stream N export although a climate signal is revealed in the analysis. High-elevation watersheds have responded rapidly to reductions in sulfur deposition and here we show the response to N deposition may be similar, at least in areas with high rates of deposition where surface-water nitrate concentrations are elevated. Our results show that stream N export responds rapidly to reductions in N deposition in high elevation watersheds, similar to patterns observed for reductions in sulfur deposition.",

            "abstract": "Receiver Function (RF) analyses using teleseismic P waveforms is a technique to isolate P to S conversions from seismic discontinuities in the lithosphere. Using earthquakes with a good azimuthal distribution, RFs recorded at a three-component seismic station can be inverted to obtain detailed lithospheric velocity structures. The technique, however presents a velocity-depth trade-off, which results in a non-unique model because RFs do not depend on the absolute seismic velocities but rather on relative velocity contrasts. Unlike RF, surface wave dispersion is sensitive to the average shear-wave velocity which makes it well suited for studying long period variations of the lithospheric seismic velocities. We performed a joint inversion of RF and Rayleigh-wave phase velocity dispersion to investigate the structure beneath the SIEMBRA network, a 43-broadband-seismic-station array deployed in the Pampean flat slab region of Argentina. Our results indicate: 1) The presence of several mid-crustal discontinuities probably related with terrane accretion; 2) A high seismic velocity in the lower crust suggesting partial eclogitization; 3) A thicker crust (> 50 km) beneath the western Sierras Pampeanas with an abrupt change in the relative timing of the Moho signal indicating a thinner crust to the east; 4) The presence of the subducting oceanic crust lying at ~100 km depth. We then built a 1D regional velocity model for the flat slab region of Argentina and used it for regional moment tensor inversions for local earthquakes. This technique is notably dependent on small-scale variations of Earth structure when modeling higher frequency seismic waveforms. Eighteen regional focal mechanisms have been determined. Our solutions are in good agreement with GCMT source estimations although our solutions for deep earthquakes systematically resulted in shallower focal depths suggesting that the slab seismicity could be concentrated at the top of the subducting Nazca plate. Solutions corresponding to crustal events match well the geological observations from other studies.",

            "abstract": "Submarine fans are complex sea-floor landforms built over a variety of time and space scales from turbulent instability on the low end up to basin-scale filling on the upper end. The intervening intermediate scale is often a source of eventual lithologic heterogeneity as many depositional lobes are built through time and space as building blocks for the larger landform. Here we take an experimental approach toward investigating submarine fan evolution and the preserved architecture by addressing the question: What is the relationship between the formative hydraulics and preserved sedimentary product of intermediate-scale, i.e., avulsion-scale, features? Experiments offer the ability to dictate boundary conditions as well as monitor the evolution of the flow field, here through image-based particle tracking techniques, and of the sediment bed. Our experimental approach consists of using saline density currents with crushed melamine plastic sediment to build submarine fans with supercritical distributaries. These fan systems experience avulsion cycles characterized by: (1) channel incision and basinward extension, (2) channel stagnation and lobe aggradation, (3) hydraulic jump formation upstream of the lobe that then retreats updip, and (4) flow avulsion. Hydraulic jump formation is an important part of these cycles in that the jump region becomes a significant locus of deposition. We found there exists a relationship between the upstream hydraulic properties, namely the denismetric Froude number, and depositional lobe thickness. This occurs because of consistent relationships between Froude number and the sequent depth ratio. This also leads to other relationships in the planform that can be tied to hydraulic variables. In this way there exists the potential to invert upstream hydraulic data from preserved depositional features created within avulsion cycles.",

            "abstract": "Over 110 spinel peridotite xenoliths collected from four localities in the Tariat region, central Mongolia, show a predominance (over 90%) of fertile lherzolites with subordinant harzburgite and peridotites veined with pyroxenite. Equilibration temperatures are high (~900°C at 1.5 GPa [1]). Major element compositions of the fertile samples are consistent with them being the residues of 0-6% partial melt removal at shallow depths [2]. The clinopyroxenes in the lherzolites are moderately LREE depleted (average chondrite normalized La/Sm = 0.45) and most whole rocks show small, if any, depletions in Re and Pd compared to the other HSE. These data point to minimal metasomatic overprinting of these fertile lherzolites. 187Os/188Os for samples with more than 3.2% Al2O3 range only from 0.126 to 0.131, within the range of modern fertile asthenospheric mantle. In contrast to the indicators of fertility in most samples, Sr, Nd and Hf isotopic composition of acid-leached clinopyroxene separates from the lherzolites plot within the range of modern MORB with 87Sr/86Sr from 0.7021 to 0.7026, eNd from +7.7 to +9.8 and eHf from +13.3 to +18.5. The lherzolites thus appear to sample a section of mantle that has compositional and isotope characteristics consistent with modern fertile asthenosphere. The isotopic composition of the Tariat lherzolites are distinct from that of Cenozoic Mongolian basaltic volcanism pointing to limited involvement of the lithospheric mantle in magma generation in this area. The implied asthenospheric provenance of the mantle lithosphere suggests that it either could be the replacement for recently delaminated lithosphere or, more likely, a section of fertile mantle accreted to the base of the crust earlier, e.g. during construction of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt in the Mesozoic/Paleozoic. Although fertile, and hence compositionally dense, the high temperatures of the shallow lithospheric mantle under this section of Mongolia likely contribute to the high elevation of the Hangay uplift.

Here we analyze 101 sub-basins across thirteen states in the USA using high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) in combination with data on the spatial variation of precipitation, soil, geology, and land cover. We test the following hypotheses: (1) Drainage density carries strong, codependent signatures of rainfall variability, soil type, and topographic relief; (2) Drainage density reflects the extent of landscape dissection on the sub-catchment scale and the subsequent processes of vegetation recovery and gullying.\nWe employ a dimensionless drainage density (Ddd) metric defined as the ratio of likely channelized pixels in a basin to its total number of pixels, and map this metric across meter-resolution lidar DTMs using GeoNet [Passalacqua et al., 2010]. We assess the resolution-dependent scaling of Ddd and observe that it is a much weaker scaling function of DTM resolution than the dimensional formulation of drainage density (Dg), which is classically defined as the ratio of total channel length to total basin area.\nIn order to characterize the correlation structure of drainage density with climatic parameters such as mean annual precipitation (MAP), we use a Gaussian mixture model and identify two sub-groups of landscapes that display different correlations. We observe that Ddd and MAP are negatively correlated in arid and semi-arid environments and positively correlated in humid environments. The transition occurs at a MAP around 900-1000mm/yr and coincides with the maximum observed values of soil thickness and available water content. Landscape relief has a negative correlation with Ddd in arid environments while the correlation is positive in humid climates. We discuss the implication of our results for understanding eco-geomorphic processes and for modeling landscape evolution.\n",

As the relation between surface-wave dispersion and the seismic velocity structure of the earth is nonlinear, a reliable way to perform the inversion is Monte Carlo sampling in a Bayesian framework. Considering the high sensitivity of surface waves to Vs in broad depth intervals and their low sensitivity to Vs in thin layers, there are strong trade-offs between shear speeds at neighboring depths. MC sampling provides a way to quantify non-uniqueness of the inverted shear velocity models.\nWe develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for joint inversion of Rayleigh- and Love-wave dispersion curves that is able to yield robust radially and azimuthally anisotropic shear velocity profiles, with resolution to depths down to the transition zone. The inversion is a one step process that doesn't involve any linearization procedure or a priori bounds around a reference model. In a fixed dimensional Bayesian formulation, we chose to set the number of parameters relatively high, with a more dense parametrization in the uppermost mantle, therefore we used a Gaussian a priori distribution of the parameters in order to avoid overfitting.\nWe apply the MCMC algorithm to the inversion of surface-wave phase velocities accurately determined in broad period ranges in a few test regions, and present the resulting radially and azimuthally anisotropic shear velocity models.",

            "abstract": "A drift mode accelerometer is a precision instrument for spacecraft that overcomes much of the acceleration noise and readout dynamic range limitations of traditional electrostatic accelerometers. It has the potential of achieving acceleration noise performance similar to that of drag-free systems over a restricted frequency band without the need for external drag-free control or continuous spacecraft propulsion. Like traditional accelerometers, the drift mode accelerometer contains a high-density test mass surrounded by an electrode housing, which can control and sense all six degrees of freedom of the test mass. Unlike traditional accelerometers, the suspension system is operated with a low duty cycle so that the limiting suspension force noise only acts over brief, known time intervals, which can be accounted for in the data analysis. The readout is performed using a laser interferometer which is immune to the dynamic range limitations of even the best voltage references typically used to determine the inertial acceleration of electrostatic accelerometers. This presentation describes operation and performance modeling for such a device with respect to a low Earth orbiting satellite geodesy mission. Methods for testing the drift mode accelerometer with the University of Florida precision torsion pendulum will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Hudson Bay overlies some of the thickest Precambrian lithosphere on Earth, whose internal structures contain important clues to the earliest workings of plate formation. The Hudson Bay Lithospheric Experiment (HuBLE) has thus far constrained its seismic wavespeed, anisotropy, and discontinuity structures. However, previous work has either focused on a single imaging method or briefly compared two independent methods. In this study, we combine surface wave dispersion curves with P to S receiver functions (PRF) to jointly invert for 1D shear velocity, and also compute independent S to P receiver functions (SRF) using teleseismic earthquakes recorded at 36 broadband seismic stations from the HuBLE experiment and 9 additional regional stations. High shear velocities are observed to depths of 200-300 km in the region, indicating a thick depleted lithospheric keel, with maximum thickness in the center of Hudson Bay. The 1D shear velocity profiles typically exhibit a low-velocity zone in the lower crust, consistent with the hypothesis of post-orogenic or syn-orogenic lower crustal flow or the tectonic burial of metasediments. Observations of a flat Moho in the Rae domain of northwestern Hudson Bay are consistent with an Archean-aged crust, which has remained unaltered since formation. Structures observed within the mantle lithosphere in the depth-stacked S to P receiver functions appear to dip from the Hearne domain towards the Rae domain, suggestive of lithospheric formation through plate tectonic processes. This implies that plate tectonic processes were in action during the Archean when these provinces formed.",

We sampled mineral soil (0-15 cm) across the ecotone between aspen (Populus tremuloides) and mixed conifers stands (Abies lasiocarpa and Pseudotsuga menziesii) in semi-arid montane forests from Utah, to investigate the influence of vegetation vs. site characteristics on SOC stabilization, storage and chemistry. SOC was divided into light fraction (LF), mineral-associated SOC in the silt and clay fraction (MoM), and a dense subfraction > 53 µm (SMoM) using wet sieving and electrostatic attraction. SOC decomposability and solubility was derived from long term laboratory incubations and hot water extractions (HWE). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to study differences in chemical functional groups in LF and MoM. Vegetation cover did not affect SOC storage (47.0 ± 16.5 Mg C ha−1), SOC decomposability (cumulative CO2-C release of 93.2 ± 65.4 g C g−1 C), or SOC solubility (9.8 ± 7.2 mg C g−1 C), but MoM content increased with presence of aspen [pure aspen (31.2 ± 15.1 Mg C ha-1) > mixed (25.7 ± 8.8 Mg C ha−1) > conifer (22.8 ± 9.0 Mg C ha−1)]. Organo-mineral complexes reduced biological availability of SOC, indicated by the negative correlation between silt+clay (%) and decomposable SOC per gram of C (r = -0.48, p = 0.001) or soluble SOC (r = -0.59, p < 0.0001). FTIR spectral analysis indicated that higher MoM content under aspen was not due to higher concentration of recalcitrant compounds (e.g., aliphatic and aromatic C), but rather to stabilization of simple molecules (e.g., polysaccharides) of plant or microbial origin. FTIR spectra clustered by sites with similar parent material rather than by vegetation cover. This suggests that initial differences in litter chemistry between aspen and conifers converged into similar MoM chemistry within sites.",

Plants react to these conditions and form linkages with the landscape. For example, mosses occupy the wet troughs and lichens are more abundant in the drier high-centred polygons.\nWe conducted measurements in a polygonal-structure tundra site at Barrow, Alaska, to investigate the interconnections between evapotranspiration fluxes, geomorphology and plant cover, during two consecutive years. Fluxes were measured at three spatial and temporal scales: (1) Eddy covariance flux tower, (2) Continuous, fixed, surface clear chamber, and (3) Discontinuous measurements with mobile chambers in approximately 60 locations across the landscape.\nOur results indicate that different environmental conditions (soil moisture, soil temperature, wind speed, and thaw depth) and plant community composition, driven by microtopographical features, have significant influences on soil greenhouse gas and energy fluxes. Among plant types, evapotranspiration fluxes from moss-covered and inundated areas were more than twice those from other plant types. Continuous chamber measurements were similar in trend and values to eddy-covariance measurements, implying on the high contribution of surface fluxes to atmospheric concentrations. However, wind direction influenced the upscaling of fluxes from chamber to tower, because maritime winds had different moisture content and temperature than terrestrial winds. Microclimate was also affected by microtopography, and wind speed was higher on polygon ridges, and lower in the more protected trough areas, affecting evapotranspiration fluxes. In addition, we observed a strong seasonal trend in fluxes. During peak summer, although 24-hour daylight occurs, our results indicated substantial diurnal variations, despite constant daylight conditions.\nInformation gathered in this research has advance our understanding of coupled processes in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems, and will be used to improve climate model predictions for this already rapidly changing ecosystem.",

In the second, empirical relationships between parameters such as AC Poynting flux and auroral electron energy flux are used to dynamically regulate the location and intensity of the ionospheric outflow. The idealized simulation results can be compared statistically with observations from a variety of ground and space based observations. The results from events driven by CMEs and CIRs in the solar wind can be compared with measures of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, i.e. cross polar cap potential, as well as satellite measurements of plasma flow and composition. In addition, simulations with plasmasphere population have been conducted and we examine how this species affects the evolution of the magnetosphere and compare its structure with observations.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide. It is released in the Arctic from the seafloor and sediments in melting permafrost regions. Lakes and ponds also emit methane to the atmosphere. Methane production in anoxic lake sediments is often controlled by the amount of available organic material and temperature. It is speculated that the amount and type of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in lakes can also affect methane production in two ways; by either providing a source of carbon (C) for methane production and/or releasing oxygen into the sediment through the roots to hinder production. We sampled SAV at 63 locations on Mellan Harrsjön, a small post-glacial lake in a permafrost setting in sub-arctic Sweden (N 68°21’, E 19°02’). We also measured percent cover of the vegetation, dissolved oxygen, temperature, depth and other variables. We found that the most abundant species, Sparganium angustifolium, occurred in areas with high ebullitive methane emissions from previous studies and therefore provides a carbon source for CH4 production. We also found that over a ten day period percent cover of Sparganium angustifolium increased, with increasing water temperatures, from 37 to 49%. With Arctic warming, high latitude lakes are likely to experience an earlier ice-out and later freeze-up. Because of this, SAV growth is likely to increase and provide a more stable carbon source for CH4 production.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the potential economic and physical impacts of climate change on coastal resources involves evaluating a number of distinct adaptive responses. This paper presents a tool for such analysis, a spatially-disaggregated optimization model for adaptation to sea level rise (SLR) and storm surge, the Coastal Impact and Adaptation Model (CIAM). This decision-making framework fills a gap between very detailed studies of specific locations and overly aggregate global analyses. While CIAM is global in scope, the optimal adaptation strategy is determined at the local level, evaluating over 12,000 coastal segments as described in the DIVA database (Vafeidis et al. 2006). The decision to pursue a given adaptation measure depends on local socioeconomic factors like income, population, and land values and how they develop over time, relative to the magnitude of potential coastal impacts, based on geophysical attributes like inundation zones and storm surge. For example, the model's decision to protect or retreat considers the costs of constructing and maintaining coastal defenses versus those of relocating people and capital to minimize damages from land inundation and coastal storms. Uncertain storm surge events are modeled with a generalized extreme value distribution calibrated to data on local surge extremes. Adaptation is optimized for the near-term outlook, in an “act then learn then act” framework that is repeated over the model time horizon. This framework allows the adaptation strategy to be flexibly updated, reflecting the process of iterative risk management. CIAM provides new estimates of the economic costs of SLR; moreover, these detailed results can be compactly represented in a set of adaptation and damage functions for use in integrated assessment models. Alongside the optimal result, CIAM evaluates suboptimal cases and finds that global costs could increase by an order of magnitude, illustrating the importance of adaptive capacity and coastal policy.",

            "abstract": "Alarming rate of retreat of glaciers and formation of glacial lakes in higher elevation of Nepal Himalaya has been reported to be related with the pronounced atmospheric temperature rise in the region. Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF) are the growing climate induced hazards in the Himalaya increasing the vulnerability of community living in the mountain valley, and the fragile ecosystem. This study tried to come up with the potential impacts from glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in highland of eastern region of Nepal and potential role of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in coping. I analyzed the trend of climatic pattern (temperature and precipitation) of the Eastern Himalaya Region of Nepal available from Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), Government of Nepal, and also prepared the latest location map of the glacial lakes using google earth and ArcGIS application in the highland of the Kanchanjungha Conservation Area of the region. Tiptala glacial lake, located at an elevation of 4950 masl, within the conservation area, was selected for the GLOF hazard assessment. I used semi-structured questioner survey and key informants interviews in the community living below the lake in the highland of the study area in order to assess the potential hazard of GLOF. Analysis shows the increasing trend of atmospheric temperature in the region. With the varying sizes, 46 glacial lakes were located in the region, which covers over 2.57 sq. km in total. Though the larger portion of the downstream area of the Tiptala glacial lake fall in the remote location away from major residential area, few villages, major pasture lands for Yaks, foot trails, and several bridges across the Tamor River below the lake are in risk of GLOF. Poor access due to extreme geographical remoteness and capacity to afford the modern technologies in the community is seen as the major limiting factor to the knowledge and information about the climate change and related impacts. Modern ICTs has high potential to reduce the risk of climate related hazards in the remote area by information dissemination and awareness.",

            "abstract": "The global excess radiocarbon abundance record for the past 50 kyr can be entirely explained by the explosion of four supernovae 44, 37, 32, and 22 kyr ago less than 250 pc from Earth. Each supernova left a nearly identical signature beginning with a sudden increase at the time of the explosion, followed by a hiatus of 1500 years, and continuing with a sustained, 2000 year increase in radiocarbon from gamma rays produced by diffusive shock in the supernova remnant. For the past 18 kyr excess radiocarbon from SN22kyrBP, identified as the Vela supernova, has decayed with the 5700 year half-life of 14C. The absolute scale for radiocarbon abundance has been determined from the decay curve as Δ14C=5±2% in 1950. Small oscillations in the decay curve are shown to coincide with variations in Earth’s Virtual Axial Dipole Moment (VADM). SN44kyrBP exploded approximately 110 pc from Earth doubling the radiocarbon abundance. These supernovae are confirmed in the 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl and nitrate geological records. An additional 19 supernovae are observed 50-300 kyr ago in the 10Be record. Using the Earth as a calorimeter I have determined that approximated 2×1049 ergs were released at the time of each supernova explosion and 1049-50 ergs afterwards, consistent with theoretical predictions. The background rate of radiocarbon productions from more distant sources was determined as 1.61 atoms/cm2s at the top of the atmosphere. Although little danger to life on Earth is expected from these supernovae, each of the recent events were shown to correlate with concurrent global warming of 3-4°C.",

These data, combined with geomorphic parameter information obtained from the National Hydrography Dataset and the National Elevation Dataset, were used to train Bayesian Networks consisting of 9-15 parameters. Hydraulic geometry relationships were used to constrain power law coefficients such that observed time series representing the measured daily discharge could be correlated with synthetic time series governing hydraulic width, depth and velocity at each site. This approach allows the training set to represent natural flow conditions and not the somewhat irregular timing of the field surveys. Sensitivity analysis of network is presented, along with over 500 worldwide validation cases to demonstrate network accuracy when confidently constrained. Making discharge predictions that combine field data with empirical relations though the use of a probabilistic framework is advantageous in that it explicitly accounts for uncertainty in the interpretation of results. This allows objective assessment of the predictive performance when applied to qualitative decisions relevant to environmental managers.",

            "abstract": "Satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index, or NDVI, is a commonly used index in applications that require consistent and timely data, including monitoring drought, tracking vegetation phenological transitions, and assessing crop progress and condition. Although many other indices have been developed, the NDVI remains popular in the monitoring community. One reason is the value of NDVI for use in long-term studies necessitating multiple sensor data sources. It is calculated using a standard formula, red minus near-infrared divided by red plus near-infrared. But, this does not mean that all NDVI data are the same. Many factors, ranging from sensor design and raw satellite data ingest to initial data manipulation and post-processing, influence end-product quality and consistency. The purpose of this study was to perform a statistical scientific comparison between multiple NDVI data sources. The NDVI data analyzed in this study were derived from 8-day 250 meter (m) standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua surface reflectance composites (Collection 5, MOD09Q1), 7-day 250 m expedited MODIS (eMODIS) Terra and Aqua NDVI products, and 14-day 1000 m Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products of central U.S. over the 2003 – 2012 timeframe. Only composites falling within the growing season (between April and October) and temporally coincident were included. All composites were consistently post-processed using standard MODIS quality assurance data and evaluated to calculate spatial statistics (e.g. means and standard deviations) for 160 uniform 150 kilometer2 tiles. The results for seasonal, period-specific and overall correlations indicated the highest agreement was between standard MODIS Terra and Aqua composites, with a Pearson’s coefficient of determination of R2 = 0.98, and the lowest agreement was between eMODIS Terra and AVHRR, with a R2 value of 0.84. There was evidence of slight Terra sensor degradation within the time series.",

            "abstract": "It is still unclear how seasonal variations in vegetation greenness relate to vegetation function (i.e., photosynthesis). Currently, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a widely used proxy for the period of terrestrial carbon uptake. However, new complementary measures are now available. In this study, we compare the seasonal cycle of NDVI with remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and data-driven gross primary productivity (GPP) over the Northern Hemisphere high latitude forests (40°-55°N). Comparison of the seasonal cycle between these three datasets shows that the NDVI-based phenology has a longer estimated growing season than the growing season estimated using SIF/GPP. The differences are largely explained by a slower decrease in NDVI in the fall relative to SIF/GPP. In the transition seasons, NDVI is linearly related to temperature, while SIF/GPP show nonlinear relationships with respect to temperature. These results imply that autumn greening related to warming found in recent studies may not result in enhanced photosynthesis. Our method of combining remote sensing of NDVI and SIF can help improve our understanding of the large-scale vegetation structural and functional changes.",

Close monitoring is needed to save such vital components of our environment. Remote-sensing technology has shown its ability to monitor and survey remote areas of coral reefs. In this study, coral reef habitats in Hurghada, Egypt were examined using Landsat imageries over a 26-year period. The change detection analysis was adopted to identify the alterations in coral reef habitats between 1987 and 2013. Three images, acquired from Landsat-5 TM on August 14th 1987, Landsat-7 ETM+ on September 10th 2000, and Landsat-8 OLI on July 20th 2013, were used in the change detection analysis. Different processing techniques were applied to the three images, including but not limited to rectification, masking, water column correction, classification, and change detection statistics. The supervised classifications performed over the three scenes show five significant marine-related classes: coral, sand subtidal, sand intertidal, macro-algae, and seagrass. The change detection statistics obtained from the classified scenes of 1987 and 2000 revealed a significant increase in the macro-algae and seagrass classes (93% and 47%, respectively), accompanied by a major decline in the sand intertidal, coral, and sand subtidal classes (41%, 40%, and 37%, respectively). On the other hand, the change detection statistics obtained from the classified scenes of 2000 and 2013 revealed an increase in the sand subtidal and macro-algae classes (14% and 19%, respectively), while a major decrease in the sand intertidal, coral, and seagrass classes (49%, 46% and 74%, respectively).",

            "abstract": "We apply an integrated modeling framework to both target and value watershed management interventions in the Upper Tana watershed, which provides municipal water, irrigation water, and hydropower services to Nairobi and surrounding areas. The analysis begins by applying an index model approach that incorporates existing land use and land surface characteristics to prioritize the type and location of conservation investments in different subbasins, subject to budget constraints and stakeholder concerns (Resource Investment Optimization System -- RIOS). We then run the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) using the RIOS-identified investment scenarios to produce spatially explicit scenarios that simulate changes in water yield and suspended sediment. Finally, we link those biophysical outputs to monetary and non-monetary human well-being metrics for multiple benefit streams, including: Reduced water treatment costs, increased hydropower production, and crop yield benefits for upstream farmers in the conservation area. The viability of a payment for watershed services scheme is discussed, with attention to the various components of value assessed and to dependencies on water management approaches. While other studies have examined links between land use and the provision of hydrologic services, this study is novel in that it presents an integrated analysis that targets interventions in a decision context and then relies on calibrated, process-based, biophysical models to demonstrate the return on those investments considering multiple (and sometimes competing) hydrological services, doing so at a sub-annual time-scale.",

            "abstract": "Lead concentrations and isotopic compositions were measured in surface and subsurface waters across the Eastern Tropical South Pacific as part of the 2013 US GEOTRACES Zonal Transect from Peru to Tahiti. Surface waters were collected throughout the transect, and subsurface waters were collected to a depth of 1,000 m at 36 vertical profile stations. Aliquots of some of those samples, as well as samples from greater depths, were used in intercalibrations with Ed Boyle’s group, which focused on lead fluxes from hydrothermal vents and at the benthic boundary layer. In contrast, our group focused on aeolian lead fluxes to surface waters from natural and industrial sources. Preliminary data indicate that lead concentrations in those South Pacific surface waters are low compared to the more contaminated North Pacific. Moreover, complementary lead isotopic compositions indicate distinguishing between natural and industrial lead fluxes in the South Pacific will be more difficult now that the use of gasoline with lead alkyls from Australia have been eliminated.",

            "abstract": "A MEPAG Science Analysis Group (SAG) has undertaken an analysis of Special Regions (SR) on Mars—regions where indigenous martian life could exist or where Earth microbes, if introduced, could survive and reproduce. The SR-SAG has considered the impact of SR on future human activities on the martian surface. Human exploration requires access to in-situ resources, some of which may be found in SR. Water and oxygen for ISRU are found in the atmosphere, surface/near-surface ice, hydrated minerals, and perchlorates. Water ice is most abundant at latitudes poleward of ~60 degrees, but polar darkness, cold temperatures, and CO2 degassing present hazards to human operations in these regions. Accessible water is more limited toward the equator, though temperature and solar energy conditions become more favorable. The possible presence of liquid water in Recurring Slope Lineae and active gullies leads to their treatment as SR. Fuel for surface operations and propellants for crew ascent could be manufactured from the martian atmosphere and surface materials, but dust in the atmosphere may clog ISRU equipment and perchlorate is toxic to humans. Power may be produced from solar or nuclear energy. Reliance on solar energy limits operations to the equatorial zone where easily accessible ice resources are limited. Nuclear power allows surface operations at a range of latitudes, but waste heat could convert some non-SR into SR. Radiation shielding is necessary for long-term human operations on Mars and could be obtained by deposition of regolith or by water storage in tanks or as ice around habitats, or the use of underground habitats. SR-SAG recognizes that it will be impossible for all human-associated processes and operations to be conducted within entirely closed systems. Protocols need to be established so (1) human missions to Mars will not contaminate SR nor be contaminated by materials from them, and (2) human activities on Mars will avoid converting areas into SR.",

            "abstract": "The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) is NASA’s first dedicated Earth remote sensing satellite to study atmospheric carbon dioxide from space, and was launched successfully on July 2, 2014. OCO-2 is designed to quantify the sources and sinks of CO2by making highly precise measurements of its column abundance. OCO-2 has three science observation modes – nadir, glint and target. In the nadir mode, the satellite points the instrument to the local nadir, so that data can be collected along the ground track just below the spacecraft. In the glint mode, the spacecraft points the instrument toward the bright \"glint\" spot, where solar radiation is specularly reflected from the surface. In the target mode, the Observatory will lock its view onto a specific surface location, and will scan back and forth over that target while flying overhead. A target track pass can last for up to 9 minutes. Over that time period, the Observatory can acquire as many as 12,960 samples at local zenith angles that vary between 0° and 85°.\nHere, we analyze target track measurements over several of the OCO-2 validation sites where ground-based solar-looking Fourier Transform Spectrometers are located. The target scan serves two purposes. The first is to collect a large number of measurements over surface calibration and validation targets to assess the precision and accuracy of the retrieved column averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2). The second is to look for spatial variations in column averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2) in the vicinity of the target that could compromise the value of the measurements for calibration or validation. To meet both requirements, we compare XCO2 retrievals as a function of both observation angle and scan location, and investigate whether those variations are coming from instrument calibration, algorithmic deficiencies, aerosols/clouds or real CO2variations. Further, simulated retrievals indicate that target observations can show large sensitivity to even small amounts of clouds and aerosols (especially if lofted). We investigate the sensitivity of OCO-2 target mode observations to clouds and aerosols and compare against the simulated results.\n© 2014. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "Snowpack is crucial for the western USA, providing around 75% of the total fresh water supply (Cayan et al., 1996) and buffering against seasonal aridity impacts on agricultural, ecosystem, and urban water demands. The resilience of the California water system is largely dependent on natural stores provided by snowpack. This resilience has shown vulnerabilities due to anthropogenic global climate change. Historically, the northern Sierras showed a net decline of 50-75% in snow water equivalent (SWE) while the southern Sierras showed a net accumulation of 30% (Mote et al., 2005). Future trends of SWE highlight that western USA SWE may decline by 40-70% (Pierce and Cayan, 2013), snowfall may decrease by 25-40% (Pierce and Cayan, 2013), and more winter storms may tend towards rain rather than snow (Bales et al., 2006). The volatility of Sierran snowpack presents a need for scientific tools to help water managers and policy makers assess current and future trends. A burgeoning tool to analyze these trends comes in the form of variable-resolution global climate modeling (VRGCM). VRGCMs serve as a bridge between regional and global models and provide added resolution in areas of need, eliminate lateral boundary forcings, provide model runtime speed up, and utilize a common dynamical core, physics scheme and sub-grid scale parameterization package. A cubed-sphere variable-resolution grid with 25 km horizontal resolution over the western USA was developed for use in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) within the Community Earth System Model (CESM). A 25-year three-member ensemble climatology (1980-2005) is presented and major snowpack metrics such as SWE, snow depth, snow cover, and two-meter surface temperature are assessed. The ensemble simulation is also compared to observational, reanalysis, and WRF model datasets. The variable-resolution model provides a mechanism for reaching towards non-hydrostatic scales and simulations are currently being developed with refined nests of 12.5km resolution over California.",

When using data for the entire year, rainfall intensity has a quasi Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) dependence on T, with super-CC slope in a limited temperature range and a maximum around 25. While general, these features vary with averaging duration, season, the quantile of rainfall intensity, and to some extent geographic sub-region. By using Td and CAPE as regressors, we separate the effects of temperature on rainfall extremes via increased atmospheric water content and via enhanced atmospheric convection. The two contributions have comparable magnitudes, pointing at the need to consider both Td and atmospheric stability parameters when assessing the impact of climate change on rainfall extremes.",

However, the data considered to represent the “true” values often include their own measurement errors, biasing calibration and validation results. Triple collocation (TC) can be used to estimate the root-mean-square-error (RMSE), using observations from three mutually-independent, error-prone measurement systems. Here, we introduce Extended Triple Collocation (ETC): using exactly the same assumptions as TC, we derive an additional performance metric, the correlation coefficient of the measurement system with respect to the unknown target, R2. We demonstrate that R2 is the scaled, unbiased signal-to-noise ratio, and provides a complementary perspective compared to the RMSE. We apply it to three collocated wind datasets: the ECMWF numerical weather prediction forecast, ASCAT scatterometer retrievals and in-situ buoy measurements. Since ETC is as easy to implement as TC, requires no additional assumptions, and provides an extra performance metric, it may be of interest in a wide range of geophysical disciplines.",

As part of the project, the VEFI payload [\nPfaff et al., 2010\n] has recorded the 3-D electric field from DC through 16 kHz with high fidelity. The relative calibrations track between the three E-field antennas with sufficient accuracy and stability to allow retrieval of the wave polarization for a wide range of lightning-generated whistler waves [\nJacobson et al., 2014\n]. The wave polarization in turn allows retrieval of the wavevector (within a sign ambiguity), which in turn allows an inverse-raytrace of the whistler raypath from the satellite to the ionospheric entry point. We will compare the raytrace predictions with ground-truth from the WWLLN global lightning-monitoring system [\nLay et al., 2004\n;\nRodger et al., 2005\n;\nRodger et al., 2004\n]. In addition to providing location and time of lightning strokes, WWLLN provides an estimate of the radiated radio energy in the whistler passband [\nHutchins et al., 2012\n]. Finally, the CINDI payload [\nHeelis et al., 2009\n] on C/NOFS provides ion composition at the satellite, permitting the index of refraction to be inferred. We will compare these estimates to the Poynting fluence density observed by VEFI, thereby providing a direct test of the coupling of lightning radio energy into plasmaspheric whistlers.",

            "abstract": "The generation of surface-bound exospheres present around the Moon, Mercury and other airless rocky bodies are produced primarily by the interaction of micrometeoroid impacts and charged particles from the solar wind, and magnetospheres with those surfaces. While the study of the interactions of both micrometeoroids and ion sputtering are well investigated, the contributions arising from energetic electron interactions are typically less-well established. Observations from the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS), taken < 400 km from the surface, have shown a plasma cusp with energetic heavy ions (i.e. Na+- and O+-groups) for which the source has not been determined. However, the precipitation of keV electrons onto the surfaces of Mercury has recently been inferred from measurements using the X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) instrument onboard the MESSENGER spacecraft observations of the night-side of Mercury. A newly developed global kinetic transport model suggests that electron-stimulated desorption (ESD), and possibly light ion stimulated desorption (ISD), can directly yield ions that can be transported and dynamically accelerated to the plasma cusp regions observed by FIPS. In addition, keV electrons and ions from the solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere frequently bombard with the lunar surface. Here, we present some of the most recent results from our ongoing work studying the effects of photon-stimulated desorption (PSD), ion-stimulated desorption (ISD) and implantation, as well as electron-stimulated desorption (ESD). Apollo samples collected from both the lunar highland and Mare regions, as well as simulants of the Mercury Regolith have been investigated. The temperature- (100-600 K) and energy-dependence (threshold – 2 keV) of ESD time-of-flight (ToF) results will be presented for these materials along with some preliminary results from our group based on photon-desorption studies of water on lunar material, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) studies of water covered regolith and dusts, as well as the effects of ion implantation/sputtering using keV H+ ions on ESD-ToF results. The implications of these results in the context of current observations will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "High-speed communications underwater is an increasing requirement for data intensive seafloor sensors. Acoustic modems provide dependable long-range communications underwater, but data rates are limited to <57Kbps. Free-water optical modems (OMs) offer high data rate, 10Mbps communications over a range of 200 m – a distance for ROVs, AUVs or wire-lowered packages to communicate without the need to directly plug-in or retrieve the instrument. Over the past 4 years, we have demonstrated the functionality and utility of OM technology using a CORK borehole observatory as a test case. A CORK represents all of the basic components required for a seafloor observatory: a stable environment for long-term continuous measurements of earth and ocean phenomena, access to a unique environment below the seafloor and a standard communication interface.\nThe CORK-OM features a high-bandwidth, low-latency optical system based on LED emitters and PMT receivers and an acoustic command and control system. OM tests established a communication link from 20 to 200 meters range at rates of 1, 5 and 10 Mbps with no bit errors. The seafloor OM was plugged into the CORK’s existing underwater wet mateable connector and provided additional power to the CORK to boost the data rate to 1 Hz from the normal 1 minute sample period. To communicate with the seafloor CORK-OM, a number of different modalities were used. One method was an OM mounted to a CTD frame on a lowered wire from a ship with an SDSL link over the conducting wire. Other methods utilized OMs mounted to both ROV Jason and submersible Alvin.\nWe deployed OMs at two CORKs in 2012 in the northeast pacific at sites 857D and 1025C. The CORKs were visited in 2013 by a vessel of opportunity to download data and were put into sleep mode. The CORKs were revisited in 2014, woken up and successfully interrogated for data. ALVIN retrieved the CORK-OMs for corrosion, biofouling and battery performance assessment. We also performed tests of a next generation OM using a deployed seafloor modem and AUV Sentry. A complete lambertian optical field was quantitatively mapped by Sentry and test data was successfully downloaded from 20 to 150 m slant range. The AUV modality demonstrates the capability of ‘data-mule’ operations to autonomously recover data from a seafloor observatory with minimal human intervention.",

            "abstract": "Recent scientific studies have demonstrated that sub-mesoscale ocean eddies, motions characterized by Rossby and Richardson numbers around 1, are important in determining the vertical density structure of the ocean, particularly in the mixed layer. Instabilities excited at the sub-mesoscale have timescales of days and length scales of less than 10 kilometers, and enhance ocean restratification by slumping lateral density gradients.\nIn the polar oceans, a unique mechanism exists that may generate motions on these scales. Individual floes of sea ice may create lateral gradients in the ocean surface heat flux and wind stress curl, acting as an insulator and physical barrier between the ocean and the atmospheric processes that destabilize it. The \"floe size distribution\" describes the fraction of the ocean surface area covered by sea ice floes, as a function of the sea ice floe size, and determines the length scales over which gradients in atmospheric forcing are transmitted to the ocean. It may therefore play a significant role in exciting or inhibiting sub-mesoscale eddies, and consequently in restratification and air-sea exchange. Current GCMs simulate ice cover using grid-scale ice fraction alone, and lack information about the floe size distribution and of ice length scales that may be important in setting the larger-scale statistics of these motions. An important factor in determining the properties of the upper polar oceans might therefore be missing from modern GCMs.\nWe consider this possibility by examining sub-mesoscale resolving ocean GCM experiments coupled to an energy-balanced atmosphere and idealized model of floes of sea ice. Varying the floe size distribution with a fixed sea ice fraction, we find that the length scales of individual floes and the floe size distribution itself play an important role in setting the steady-state ocean stratification, temperature, and air-sea exchange.",

            "abstract": "Existing plate models for the breakup of Africa and East Gondwana (Australia, East Antarctica, India, Madagascar, the Seychelles, and Sri Lanka) are problematic and require revision. Specific problems include the utilization of dubious Gondwana configurations, improbable plate motion, and/or a failure to satisfy the holistic marine magnetic anomaly data. I present here a new model for the breakup of East Gondwana. This new model begins from a constrained, pre-breakup, Gondwana configuration. Out of this initial “tight-fit” configuration, East Gondwana rifts from West Gondwana (Africa & South America) as a cohesive unit. During this breakup and subsequent seafloor spreading, East Gondwana is devoid of any internal compression or anomalous plate motion. The overall motion of East Gondwana is constrained by seafloor spreading in the coeval Somali Basin and Mozambique/Riiser Larsen Basins. Seafloor spreading in these basins is modeled using existing marine magnetic anomaly interpretations and satellite-derived gravity data. Our model is uniquely able to satisfy the magnetic anomaly observations in both of the aforementioned basins without invoking improbable plate motion or configurations. Additionally, our plate model provides valuable insight into the breakup of India and East Antarctica. In this model, we fix India to Madagascar from breakup to 90 Ma, thus eventual separation between India and East Antarctica is an output, not an input of our model. We suggest that this separation occurred diachronously from ~140 Ma in the east to ~120 Ma in the west. This modeled motion between India and East Antarctica agrees well with geophysical observations from the margin of East Antarctica and our preliminary analysis of margin character and variability.",

In the absence of direct measurements, solar physicists have struggled for decades to accurately reconstruct the coronal magnetic field using photospheric magnetograms. Even with today’s excellent magnetographs, these reconstructions are plagued by several problems, among them long computation time, and poor agreement with the structures seen in EUV and coronagraph images. However no method exists for systematically improving the agreement between coronal images and magnetic reconstructions. Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus will bring us closer to the sun we have ever been before, but taking full advantage of that opportunity requires accurate coronal magnetic field reconstructions so that we can connect the in situ observations offered by these unique missions to magnetic sources at the surface of the Sun. In this study we propose a method to improve coronal magnetic field reconstructions by optimizing agreement between the reconstructed field and white-light coronagraph images.",

            "abstract": "Despite strenuous efforts to reduce the emissions of ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), concentrations of ground-level ozone (O3) still often exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standard in U.S. cities in summertime, including Chicago. Furthermore, studies have projected a future increase in O3 formation due to global climate change. This study examines the response of summertime O3 to emission controls and temperature change in the Chicago area from 2005 to 2013 by employing observations of O3, O3 precursors, and meteorological variables. We find that meteorology explains about 53% of the O3 variance in Chicago. O3 mixing ratios over Chicago are found to show no clear decline over the 2005–2013 period. The summertime ground-level O3 trend consists of a decrease of 0.08 ppb/year between 2005 and 2009 and an increase of 1.49 ppb/year between 2009 and 2013. Emissions of NOx and concentrations of NO2 have been decreasing steadily from 2005 to 2013 in the Chicago area. Concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Chicago, however, have more than doubled since 2009, even though emission inventories suggest that VOC emissions have decreased. We believe that O3 production in Chicago became more sensitive to VOCs starting in 2008/2009 and may have switched from being NOx-limited to VOC-limited. The warmer climate since 2008 has also contributed to the increasing ozone trend in the Chicago area. Increased attention should be paid to improving the quantification of VOC sources, enhancing the monitoring of reactive VOC concentrations, and designing VOC mitigation measures.",

(2009, JGR 114) analyzed surface radiation data spanning 1995 through 2007 from several ARM and six SURFRAD sites across the continental US, and showed an average 8 Wm-2/decade brightening in all-sky downwelling SW. The study also showed a 5 Wm-2/decade increase in the clear-sky downwelling SW, an expected result of decreasing aerosol optical depths during the same time period (Augustine et al., 2008, JGR 113). However, the unexpected result of the Long et al. study is that the 5 Wm-2/decade increase is in the diffuse SW, while the direct SW remained virtually unchanged...opposite what is expected for aerosol direct effect due to decreases in aerosols. With detailed radiative transfer modeling and correlation with US FAA commercial flight hours through the same years, Long et al. speculated that while the decreased aerosols did increase the total SW, an increase in high, sub-visual contrail-generated ice haze repartitioned the increase into the diffuse SW component through large-mode scattering.\nSubsequent attempts to investigate the veracity of this speculation using long time series of ARM Micropulse and Raman lidar data proved untenable due to instrument limitation and continuity issues. However, similar to using the red/blue ratio of pixel color amounts in processing color sky images to infer clouds, we have used clear-sky diffuse SW irradiance measurements from the Multi-Frequency Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR) 870 and 415 nm spectral channels to look at any possible trends suggesting \"whitening\" of the cloud-free skies over the ARM SGP site. We will present our preliminary findings to date of these investigations suggesting indeed that there has been an aggregate \"whitening\" of the sky conditions we typically consider to be \"cloud free.\"\nAugustine, J.A., G.B.Hodges, E.G.Dutton, J.J.

These averages are in good agreement with independently obtained estimates for the average heating rate for a solar wind plasma under those conditions. The unanswered question has been whether the convergence issue is the result of intermittent dynamics or simple measurement uncertainties. In other words, is the difficulty in obtaining a single result that characterizes many similarly prepared samples due to in situ dynamics that create physically real variations or simple statistics? There have been publications showing evidence of intermittent dynamics in the solar wind. Here we show that the third-moment expressions and the computed energy cascade for relatively small samples of data comparable to the correlation length are generally well-formed estimates of the local dynamics. This leads us to conclude that intermittency and not simple measurement uncertainties are responsible for the slow convergence to expected heating rates. We partially characterize the scale size of the intermittency to be comparable to or smaller than the correlation length of the turbulence and we attempt to rephrase the discussion of third moments in terms of intermittent dynamics.",

We then extract tidal loading response signals from multiple years of processed GPS time series using generalized harmonic analysis techniques, whereby satellite modulation corrections and the astronomical argument are updated at each epoch. To compare with our observations, we construct a range of forward models by convolving modern ocean tidal loading models (e.g., FES2012, TPX08-Atlas) with Greens functions for Earth structure. The development of our own load Love number and Greens function computation code provides us with the facility to explore a wide range of 1D, layered elastic Earth models. Finally, we convert our forward modeling methods into a Bayesian inversion framework to explore the range of density and elastic structural models for the Amazonian Craton that are consistent with our observations.",

            "abstract": "Cloud properties determined from satellite imager radiances are increasingly used in weather and climate applications, particularly in nowcasting, model assimilation and validation, trend monitoring, and precipitation and radiation analyses. The value of using the satellite-derived cloud parameters is determined by the accuracy of the particular parameter for a given set of conditions, such as viewing and illumination angles, surface background, and cloud type and structure. Because of the great variety of those conditions and of the sensors used to monitor clouds, determining the accuracy or uncertainties in the retrieved cloud parameters is a daunting task. Sensitivity studies of the retrieved parameters to the various inputs for a particular cloud type are helpful for understanding the errors associated with the retrieval algorithm relative to the plane-parallel world assumed in most of the model clouds that serve as the basis for the retrievals. Real world clouds, however, rarely fit the plane-parallel mold and generate radiances that likely produce much greater errors in the retrieved parameter than can be inferred from sensitivity analyses. Thus, independent, empirical methods are used to provide a more reliable uncertainty analysis. At NASA Langley, cloud properties are being retrieved from both geostationary (GEO) and low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellite imagers for climate monitoring and model validation as part of the NASA CERES project since 2000 and from AVHRR data since 1978 as part of the NOAA CDR program. Cloud properties are also being retrieved in near-real time globally from both GEO and LEO satellites for weather model assimilation and nowcasting for hazards such as aircraft icing. This paper discusses the various independent datasets and approaches that are used to assessing the imager-based satellite cloud retrievals. These include, but are not limited to data from ARM sites, CloudSat, and CALIPSO. This paper discusses the use of the various datasets available, the methods employed to utilize them in the cloud property retrieval validation process, and the results and how they aid future development of the retrieval algorithms. Future needs are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Careers in energy science related fields represent significant job growth in the U.S. Yet post-secondary career and technical programs have not kept pace with demand and energy science curriculum, including fundamental concepts of energy generation and environmental impact, lacks a firm position among general or career and technical education courses. Many of these emerging energy related jobs are skilled labor and entry level technical positions requiring less than a bachelor’s degree. These include jobs such as solar/photovoltaic design and installation, solar water and space heating installation, energy management, efficiency and conservation auditor, environmental technician, etc. These energy related career pathways fit naturally within the geosciences discipline. Many of these jobs can be filled by individuals from HVAC, Industrial technology, welding, and electrical degree programs needing some additional specialized training and curriculum focused on fundamental concepts of energy, fossil fuel exploration and use, atmospheric pollution, energy generation, alternative energy sources, and energy conservation. Two-year colleges (2ycs) are uniquely positioned to train and fill these workforce needs as they already have existing career and technical programs and attract both recent high school graduates, as well as non-traditional students including displaced workers and returning veterans. We have established geoscience related workforce certificate programs that individuals completing the traditional industrial career and technical degrees can obtain to meet these emerging workforce needs. This presentation will discuss the role of geosciences programs at 2ycs in training these new workers, developing curriculum, and building a career/technical program that is on the forefront of this evolving industry.",

            "abstract": "The Radio Jove Project is a hands-on educational activity in which students, teachers, and the general public build a simple radio telescope, usually from a kit, to observe single frequency decameter wavelength radio emissions from Jupiter, the Sun, the galaxy, and the Earth. Regular monitoring of Jupiter and solar radio storms is typical, and Radio Jove amateur observations have improved in their scientific utility. Some observers have upgraded their equipment to make spectroscopic observations in the frequency band from 15-30 MHz. These observations can be particularly useful when made in conjunction with professional telescopes such as the Long Wavelength Array (LWA), the Nancay Decametric Array, the Ukrainian UTR-2 Radio Telescope, etc. The coming Juno mission to Jupiter will observe the radio emissions while in orbit at Jupiter and will benefit from the Earth-based perspective provided by frequent monitoring of the emissions. With these goals in mind work is now underway to provide simple methods of archiving the Radio Jove observations for use by the amateur and professional radio science community in scientifically useful and easily analyzed formats. The data will be ingested to both Radio Jove specific databases and to archives containing a variety of “waves” data. Methods are being developed to assure the scientific validity of contributed data such as certification of the observers. Amateur scientists have made overwhelming contributions to optical astronomy and we believe the same is possible within the radio astronomy community as well.",

            "abstract": "For the first time, the Rosetta spacecraft stays with a comet over an extended period of time during its journey in the inner the solar system. The data provided by the suite of instruments on board the Rosetta spacecraft, notably the ROSINA mass spectrometers and the pressure sensor, provides critical information concerning comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG) and its environment. These measurements reinforce our knowledge of comet CG and enable us to describe the nucleus and the sources with more details. The observations allow us to better constrain and accordingly develop much more realistic models of the comet’s coma.\nWe show a 3D simulation of the gas and dust coma of comet CG using a Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo model performed with the Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (Tenishev et al. 2008, 2011). The coma model presented includes a realistic nucleus shape, with a gas flux distribution and a surface temperature that takes into account irregularities and concavities of the nucleus. Along with the gas drag, the gravity field drives the dust dynamics and is therefore accurately computed around the irregular nucleus shape. This constitutes the state-of-the-art of cometary coma models, which are crucial to interpret instrument data and for further mission planning.\nAcknowledgement:\nThis work was supported by contracts JPL#1266313 and JPL#1266314 from the US Rosetta Project and NASA grant NNX09AB59G from the Planetary Atmospheres Program.\n",

These tailings contain large amount of Pb (3000 ppm) and Zn (140 ppm) expressed mainly as galena, wulfenite and barite. The subsurface of the studied area is constituted mainly by weathered granite coved in some places by Triassic red formations. A geophysical survey was conducted by using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) combined with Magnetic Imagery to explore the subsurface area and understand how the mine waste is interacting with the groundwater. Two-Dimensional ERT revealed the occurrence of rounded structures with high resistivity values corresponding to spherical boulders of weathered granite. Resistivity values within the boulders decrease gradually from the center toward the outer layers. This granite was found to be covered by highly conductive materials from the tailings of the mine reaching a depth extending up to 60 m. Magnetic maps revealed local magnetic anomalies reaching 400 nT due to old buried pipes at the mine site of Zeida. These anomalies correspond to the presence of faults used as pathways to recharge the groundwater reservoir",

            "abstract": "Elevated summer ozone and winter PM frequently occur in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) and the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) in California.  Meteorological conditions, such as wind, temperature and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) play crucial roles in these air pollution events. Therefore, accurate representation of these fields from a meteorological model is necessary to successfully reproduce these air pollution events in subsequent air quality model simulations. California’s complex terrain and land-sea interface can make it challenging for meteorological models to replicate the atmospheric conditions over the SJV and SCAB during extreme pollution events. In this study, the performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) over these two regions for a summer month (July 2012) and a winter month (January 2013) is evaluated with different model configurations and forcing.  Different land surface schemes (Pleim-Xiu vs. hybrid scheme), the application of observational and soil nudging, two SST datasets (the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) SST vs. the default SST from North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) reanalysis), and two land use datasets (the National Land Cover Data (NLCD) 2006 40-category vs. USGS 24-category land use data) have been tested.  Model evaluation will focus on both surface and vertical profiles for wind, temperature, relative humidity, as well as PBLH.  Sensitivity of the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) results to different WRF configurations will also be presented and discussed.",

Results are discussed in terms of the accuracy of the products, the effect of climate variability, and differences between products. The validation and intercomparison of these products is done for the whole as well as different parts of the area. Validation results are reasonably satisfactory for daily and monthly rainfall with a correct match in spatial distribution in rainfall between regions. There is a better correlation for monthly precipitation. On average the bias vary from -0.55 mm to -2.05 mm for daily and from -16.44 mm to -62.04 mm for monthly, the root mean square error vary from 15.15 mm to 16.06 mm for daily and from 159.62 mm to 172.65 mm for monthly. All products underestimate the strong rainfall regimes and overestimate low rainfall regimes. Structures in the occurrence of rainfall are better represented than structures in rainfall amounts.

            "abstract": "Tropical peatlands sequester an estimated 15% of the carbon pool from peatlands worldwide. Indonesian peatlands account for approximately 65% of all tropical peat, and are believed to be the largest global source of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere from degrading peat. However, there is great uncertainty in these estimates due to insufficient data regarding the thickness of organic peat soils and their carbon content. Meanwhile, Indonesian peatlands are threatened by heightening pressure to drain and develop.\nIndirect geophysical methods have garnered interest for their potential to non-invasively estimate peat depth and gas content in boreal peatlands. Drawing from these techniques, we employed ground penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) in tandem with direct methods (core sampling) to evaluate the potential of these methods for tropical peatland mapping at 2 distinct study sites on West Kalimantan (Indonesia). We find that: [1] West Kalimantan peatland thicknesses estimated from GPR and ERI in intermediate/shallow peat can vary substantially over short distances (for example, > 2% over less than 0.02° surface topography gradient), [2] despite having less vertical resolution, ERI is able to better resolve peatland thickness in deep peat, and [3] GPR provides useful data regarding peat matrix attributes (such as the presence of wood layers). These results indicate GPR and ERI could help reduce uncertainty in carbon stocks and aid in responsible land management decisions in Indonesia.",

Given that many such satellites do not possess systems capable of applying thrust to correct for these perturbations, the ability to perform station-keeping maneuvers, as well as to adjust and maintain the relative position of each spacecraft within a constellation, is greatly dependent on the ability to accurately model variations in the thermosphere-ionosphere density. This paper uses density data measured along the orbital paths of the Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP), the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) to validate and compare several atmospheric models, including the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM), the US Naval Research Laboratory Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter Radar (NRLMSISE-00), and the Jacchia-Bowman 2008 empirical thermospheric density model (JB2008), under various geomagnetic activity levels and seasonal conditions.",

If the glacial HCO3- is derived from atmospheric CO2, this pathway represents a long-term CO2 sink. If the HCO3- is derived from carbonate minerals, precipitation is equal to dissolution and there is no net effect on the CO2 balance of the atmosphere. Only the weathering of Ca or Mg-bearing silicates can potentially draw CO2 out of the ocean/atmosphere system. Subglacial environments are potential habitats for a range of microbes that may generate CO2 from organic C. If the production of CO2 from organic sources exceeds the weathering of Ca and Mg from silicates, the subglacial environment is a long-term CO2 source.\nIn order to determine whether ice bodies typically act as CO2 sources or sinks, we modeled the evolution of pH and alkalinity through a range of typical subglacial weathering reactions, considering both the case in which CO2 and O2 can openly exchange with the atmosphere and the case in which the subglacial environment is closed from atmospheric interaction. We find that in the closed system scenario, subglacial waters cannot reach atmospheric PCO2 levels under typical conditions. Initial open system weathering followed by closed system weathering can allow CO2 supersaturation when sulfide oxidation is considered.\nWe use this result to analyze pH and alkalinity measurements from a geographically and geologically diverse selection of subglacial waters. The PCO2 of most of the subglacial waters is near or above atmospheric values. This implies that exchange of gases between subglacial waters and the atmosphere is typical and widespread. This input of atmospheric CO2 into the glacial weathering environment implies that about 5 mg of CO2 are typically removed from the atmosphere per l of glacial discharge water. Similar PCO2 values can be produced in an entirely closed system if organic C is broken down through anoxic fermentation. These closed system assumptions would require order of 10 mg of CO2 production per l. As that rate of organic decomposition cannot be sustained over a glacial cycle, we favor the interpretation that glaciers and ice sheets are typically carbon sinks.",

            "abstract": "This work develops a simple model for the complete radial structure of the tropical cyclone wind field at the top of the boundary layer. The model is constructed by mathematically merging existing theoretical solutions for the radial wind structure in the inner convecting and outer non-convecting regions. The model is then evaluated against three observational datasets. First, the outer solution is tested against a global database from the QuikSCAT satellite (1999-2009) and found to reproduce the characteristic wind structure of tropical cyclones at large radii where convection is absent, suggesting that it successfully captures the physics of this region. Second, the inner solution is tested against the HWind database (2004-2012) for the Atlantic and East Pacific basins and are shown to credibly represent the inner-core structure but substantially underestimate wind speeds at large radii. The complete model is then shown to largely rectify this underestimation, particularly at higher intensities. Finally, model variability is compared with the Extended Best Track dataset (1988-2013). The complete model exhibits two modes of variability corresponding to the independent variations in storm size and in inner structure that mirror that observed in nature, including the independent variability of the inner and outer regions of tropical cyclones. More broadly, the model provides insight into clear definitions of the terms \"size\" and \"structure\" and their respective, independent variabilities.",

However, due to the low concentrations at which they occur they are notoriously difficult to measure with confidence. This leads us to ask if there are other associated signatures of anomalous transport that can be sought. We develop a general stochastic transport framework and derive an asymptotic relation between the tail scaling of a breakthrough curve for a conservative tracer at a fixed downstream position and the scaling of the peak concentration of breakthrough curves as a function of downstream position, demonstrating that they provide equivalent information. We then quantify the relevant spatiotemporal scales for the emergence of this asymptotic regime, where the relationship holds, in the context of a very simple model that represents transport in an idealized river. We validate our results using random walk simulations. The potential experimental benefits and limitations of these findings are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Whereas glaciated landscapes record increased erosional efficiency through moraines and U-shaped valleys, unglaciated hillslopes and rivers lack a mechanistic theory for climate controls on their dynamics and form. Changes in precipitation and associated aggradation due to vegetation loss or incision due to increased river discharge are commonly invoked when considering the effect of glacial intervals on unglaciated terrains, but there is scant evidence supporting or discounting these hypotheses. Surprisingly, there is little consideration that temperature, rather than precipitation, may dictate the frequency, magnitude, or style of erosion in unglaciated landscapes during glacial intervals. Here, we present results combining a mechanistic frost-cracking model with downscaled general circulation model output to predict the extent and intensity of sediment production via frost processes across the unglaciated Oregon Coast Range (OCR) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Our results show that in this mid-latitude region, well south of the Cordilleran ice sheet, frost-driven processes likely shaped 90% of the present-day landmass during the LGM. A suite of geomorphic and vegetation data from a 50-ky sediment core from a paleo landslide-dammed lake in the OCR support our model results. Our study site, Little Lake, is located in the central portion of the OCR, over 400 m south of the maximum extent of the Cordilleran ice sheet. Based on 10Be-derived erosion rates, present-day catchment erosion rates average 0.07 ± 0.03 mm/yr (mean ± sd), while LGM erosion rates remained constant around 0.19 ± 0.01 mm/yr. These LGM values are nearly 3X greater than present-day erosion rates and coincide with high frost cracking intensity predicted by our model. We also observe a transition from finely laminated lacustrine clays and sands to coarse lacustrine blue-grey sands at ~ 28 ka, during the transition to the LGM. The presence of Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce) and Abies lasiocarpa (subalpine fir) in the core during the LGM imply mean annual temperatures of ~ 1 °C and January mean temperatures of ~ -7 °C. Our results suggest that broad swaths of continental landscapes likely experienced accelerated sediment production via frost processes rather than via changes in precipitation during glacial intervals.",

            "abstract": "The Solomon Islands are located in the southwestern Pacific, where the Australian Plate underthrusts the Solomon Plate towards ~N70 E at a rate of ~100 mm/yr. The Coleman seamount on the Australian plate is impinging on the forearc at Rendova Island and may cause both the seismicity and tectonic behavior to be more complicated than usual. Hence, an understanding o f the ongoing crustal deformation is essential to reconstructing the structural framework that controls the entire subduction system, particularly earthquake generation on the megathrust fault and possible subsidiary faults. Based on the results from GPS and D_InSAR, the horizontal velocity profiles across the trench for areas of the forearc to the west and to the east of the impinging Coleman seamount show different characteristics. The eastern profile shows convergence rates of ~100 mm/yr only 10 km from the trench at the western end of the Tetepare Island, and the western profile reaches 70 mm/yr at 30 km from the trench. This difference might be caused by the shallow locked depth consistent with co-seismic slip located extremely close to the trench during the Mw 7.1 Solomon Earthquake on 3rd January, 2010. We have a hypothesis to argue that the behavior of the fault geometry should be very different on the two sides of the seamount. However, the coupling ratio could be realized by further detailed analysis.",

At present, the CHUVA project has conducted 6 field campaigns, the last one being in Manaus jointly with GoAmazon, IARA and ACRIDICON. The main focus of the present study is to bring into perspective the different characteristics of precipitation that reaches the surface in Brazil over several locations. To do so, disdrometer data is analyzed in detail, employing a Gamma fit for each DSD measurement which provides the respective parameters to be studied. Those are disposed in a 3D space, each axis corresponding to one parameter, and the patterns are analyzed. A correlation between the Gamma parameters is defined as a parametric surface that fits the observations with errors smaller than 10% and R2 greater than 0.95. In this way, one parameter can be estimated with respect to the other two, reducing the degrees of freedom of the problem from 3 to 2. As the 3 parameters are defined over this surface, it’s possible to obtain a surface representing integral DSD properties such as rainfall intensity (RI). Sensibilities tests are conducted on this estimation and also on other DSD characteristics such as total droplet concentrations and mean mass-weighted diameter. It’s shown that the DSD integral properties are generally very sensitive to the Gamma parameters. Nonetheless, the sensibility varies over the surface, being higher in a region where the parameters are not balanced (i.e. a relatively high value in one parameter and low values on the other two). It’s suggested that any study proposing parameterization/estimation of DSD properties should be aware of this region of high sensitivity. To further the collaboration with GoAmazon and ACRIDICON, the disdrometer results regarding rainfall droplets are compared against in-situ cloud DSDs. The same 3D pattern recognition on the parameters is conducted and discussed, highlighting the effects of aerosol particles on the DSD characteristics.",

However, a limited number of studies have explored the consistency of the temperature estimates produced by these proxies or assessed the cross proxy reproducibility of the major results gleaned from these records. Here, incorporating novel and previously published records from a variety of different sites (ODP Site 662 in the Eastern Equatorial Atlantic, DSDP Site 607 and Site 609 in the North Atlantic, and ODP Site 1125 in the Southwest Pacific), we assess the consistency of the long-term trends and orbital signatures of Uk’37 SST records, relative to faunal and Mg/Ca estimates from the same sites. Exploring the similarity of companion SST datasets generated for different time windows within the Plio-Pleistocene at several different sites, we find that while there are structural differences between records, they produce very similar long-term trends and produce absolute temperature estimates that are generally within error of each other. Furthermore, companion records successfully capture the same dominant milankovtich period and produce phase estimates relative to benthic oxygen isotope estimates that are within error of each other. While there are some differences in the strength, temporal persistence, and presence/absence of the non-dominant milankovitch periodicies and some intervals in which one proxy record is coherent with δ18O while another is not, our results suggest that the primary results gleaned from SST proxy records remain intact regardless of which SST proxy is used.",

            "abstract": "High-latitude surface air temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global mean, causing permafrost to thaw and thereby exposing large quantities of previously frozen organic carbon (C) to microbial decomposition. Increasing temperatures in high latitude ecosystems not only increase C emissions from previously frozen C in permafrost but also indirectly affect the C cycle through changes in regional and local hydrology. Warmer temperatures increase thawing of ice-rich permafrost, causing land surface subsidence where soils become waterlogged, anoxic conditions prevail and C is released in form of anaerobic CO2 and CH4. Although substrate quality, physical protection, and nutrient availability affect C decomposition, increasing temperatures and changes in surface and sub-surface hydrology are likely the dominant factors affecting the rate and form of C release from permafrost; however, their effect size on C release is poorly quantified. We have compiled a database of 24 incubation studies with soils from active layer and permafrost from across the entire permafrost zone to quantify a) the effect size of increasing temperatures and b) the changes from aerobic to anaerobic environmental soil conditions on C release. Results from two different meta-analyses show that a 10°C increase in temperature increased C release by a factor of two in boreal forest, peatland and tundra ecosystems. Under aerobic incubation conditions, soils released on average three times more C than under anaerobic conditions with large variation among the different ecosystems. While peatlands showed similar amounts of C release under aerobic and anaerobic soil conditions, tundra and boreal forest ecosystems released up to 8 times more C under anoxic conditions. This pan-arctic synthesis shows that boreal forest and tundra soils will have a larger impact on climate change when newly thawed permafrost C decomposes in an aerobic environment compared to an anaerobic environment even when accounting for the higher heat trapping capacity of CH4 over a 100-year timescale.",

            "abstract": "The high-speed CME, ejected on 23 July 2012, observed by STEREO A on the same day as the leading edge of the CME arrived at 1AU was unique in respect to the observed plasma and magnetic structure. STEREO A also observed large Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) flux increase prior to the CME onset. Because of its similarity in intensity to the great Carrington storm of 1859, it is referred to as \"Carrington 2\" event. Fortunately, the Earth was not on the path of the CME, otherwise it might have caused a major space weather event. We used the Rice Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms with the solar wind and IMF parameters measured in situ by STEREO A as inputs to infer what the \"geoeffectiveness\" of that storm might have been. We are presently running our neural network models of Kp, Dst and AE on our realtime prediction site at\nhttp://mms.rice.edu/realtime/forecast.html\n.\nWe modeled this event using our ANN-based Kp and Dst prediction algorithms to observe that, in fact, this would have been an extremely powerful geomagnetic storm. Our results show a prediction resulting in a Kp value of almost 9 and Dst of nearly -300 nT. However, when assumptions about Earth's dipole angle tilt (please see figure) and solar wind densities are made, predictions resulting in Kp of 9+ and Dst below -800 nT are found. Additionally, we also considered the effects of SEP flux, using STEREO A measurements, in our models. In doing so, the final Kp and Dst values rose further, with Kp reaching 10 and Dst dipping below -920 nT respectively.",

ROSINA consists of a suite of three instruments: a pressure sensor (COPS: COmetary Pressure Sensor) and two mass spectrometers: the Reflectron Time of Flight mass spectrometer (RTOF) and the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS). Here we will focus on the first results obtained by DFMS, the high-resolution mass spectrometer of ROSINA. DFMS is a traditional magnetic mass spectrometer that combines an electrostatic analyzer for energy analysis with a magnet for momentum analysis. To date, DFMS is the highest mass resolution mass spectrometer in space, with resolution (m/Δm = 3000 at 1% of the peak height at 28 amu/q). It will be able to resolve CO from N2 at m/z= 28 amu/q or 12CH and 13C at m/z= 13 amu/q. We will present the first results of DFMS: the detection of organic species and their implication for the origin of cometary material.",

The real part determines the speed of the electromagnetic waves, while the imaginary part is related to the penetration depth. This project is part of NASA’s OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission. Radar is an important tool for asteroid investigation, particularly for detecting and characterizing regolith; but without robust knowledge of dielectric properties, these data cannot be used to their greatest advantage. Here, we present preliminary measurements of complex relative permittivity using the split-cylinder resonator method at 10 GHz. Resonant cavity methods utilize the difference in resonant frequency between an empty cavity and a cavity containing a sample to calculate relative permittivity and loss tangent of the sample, at higher precision than is possible with other methods. We use these split-cylinder measurements of solid samples at a single frequency in conjunction with companion broadband (300 MHz to 14 GHz) measurements of powders. Our goal is to establish a “parameter space” that characterize the effects of various factors such as water content, frequency, and the relative abundances of mineralogical and elemental constituents such as iron and titanium on complex relative permittivity of geological materials that might represent good analogs for the regolith of Bennu, OSIRIS-REx’s target asteroid. Our results will also provide a database for future asteroid exploration with radar.",

            "abstract": "The lack of diversity in the geosciences has long been recognized as a problem. While improvements have been made, the proportion of Bachelor’s degrees in the earth sciences awarded to Hispanic students in 2012 was only 5.6%, a huge disparity with the 17% of the U.S. population that is Hispanic. At California State University, Sacramento, 19% of the student population is Hispanic but, of the 61 students that earned an undergraduate degree in geology between 2005 and 2010, only four were Hispanic. In response to the lack of diversity in the geology major, we developed a new Geology of Mexico course with the goal of recruiting Hispanic students to the major. We present a quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of this course in attracting Hispanic students, encouraging them to take more geology courses, and recruiting them to the major. Data was collected in the Geology of Mexico course and in the equivalent Physical Geology course. During the period evaluated, 93% of enrollment in Geology of Mexico was Hispanic compared with 18.5% in Physical Geology. We found that Hispanic students in Physical Geology earned lower grades than did nonminority students, while Hispanic students in Geology of Mexico earned grades comparable with nonminority students in Physical Geology. Overall, Geology of Mexico students also showed more positive attitude changes to the geosciences and were more likely to take another geology course. The recruitment rate into the major for Hispanic students in Geology of Mexico was comparable to the recruitment rate for nonminority students in Physical Geology. Since 2008, the proportion of Hispanic geology majors has risen from 4.5% to 14.1% and, notably, the proportion of underrepresented minorities has increased from 4.5% to 22.2%, reflecting a significant overall increase in diversity of the major. In order to increase retention of minority students, we developed a field course for new majors who were not yet ready for upper division courses. This field trip allows students to get to know the faculty and to create bonds with fellow new majors, thus creating a stronger bond to the department and developing a cohort effect earlier in the students' educational path.",

            "abstract": "The coastal mangroves forests of Everglades National Park (ENP) are well protected from development. Nevertheless, climate change, hurricanes and other anthropogenic disturbances have affected these intertidal ecosystems. Understanding and monitoring forest structural parameters such as canopy height and above-ground biomass (AGB) are important for the establishment of an historical database for past, present and future ecosystem comparison. Forest canopy height has a well understood and directly proportional correlation with AGB. It is possible to derive it using (1) airborne LiDAR/Laser Scanning (ALS) or (2) space-borne radar systems such as Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and TanDEM-X (TDX). A previous study of the mangrove canopy height and AGB in the ENP was conducted a decade ago based on ALS data acquired in 2004 in conjunction with SRTM data, which were acquired in 2000 (Simard et al. 2006).\nIn this study we estimated canopy height and AGB using an ALS dataset acquired in 2012 and TDX data acquired during the years 2012-2014. The ALS dataset was acquired along a 16.5 x 1.5 km swath of mangrove forest with variable canopy height. The sampled areas were representative of mangrove stature and structure in the whole ENP. Analysis of the ALS dataset showed that mangrove canopy height can reach up to ~25 meters close to the coastal ENP waters. Additionally, by comparing our ALS results with those of a previous study by Simard et al. (2006) we identified areas where mangrove height changes greater than ± 3 meters occurred.\nTo expand the study area to the full ENP mangrove ecosystem we processed single-polarization TDX data to obtain a Digital Canopy Model (DCM) that represents the mangrove canopy height. In order to obtain the true canopy height we calibrated the TDX phase center height with ALS true canopy height. Preliminary results of a corrected single-polarized (HH) TDX scene show that mangrove canopy height can reach up to ~25 meters in the western region of the ENP.",

The traditional data access options include web-based direct archive file downloads, user selected data subsets and format conversions produced by server-side computations, and client and cURL-based APIs for routine scripted data retrieval.\nTo enhance user experience and utility, the RDA now also offers THREDDS Data Server (TDS) access for many highly valued dataset collections. TDS offered datasets are presented as aggregations, enabling users to access an entire dataset collection, that can be comprised of 1000’s of files, through a single virtual file. The OPeNDAP protocol, supported by the TDS, allows compatible tools to open and access these virtual files remotely, and make the native data file format transparent to the end user. The combined functionality (TDS/OPeNDAP) gives users the ability to browse, select, visualize, and download data from a complete dataset collection without having to transfer archive files to a local host.\nThis presentation will review the TDS basics and describe the specific TDS implementation on the RDA’s diverse archive of GRIB-1, GRIB-2, and gridded NetCDF formatted dataset collections. Potential future TDS implementation on in-situ observational dataset collections will be discussed.

            "abstract": "The Paraná – Etendeka large igneous province (≈ 135 Ma) has not been linked to a known mass extinction event, despite large igneous provinces being postulated as a cause. The reason why some large igneous provinces appear the cause of huge fluctuations in the global biosphere, an example being the link between Siberian trap volcanism and the Permo-Triassic boundary, while others seem to have only a minor effect is still debated. Establishing detailed histories of these large igneous provinces is important for understanding why such variations in effect may occur. Why does the volume of the province not reflect the magnitude of the effects seen?\nDuring the early Cretaceous, reversals of Earth’s magnetic field were more frequent than at other times in Earth’s history. Magnetostratigraphy is therefore a tool capable of providing high resolution constraints on the history and duration of the Paraná – Etendeka large igneous province volcanism. Detailed sampling of the Etendeka volcanic stratigraphy, followed by progressive demagnetisation of 893 specimens, yields 70 individual polarities gained from throughout the central volcanic succession. Correlation of the individual sections sampled reveals a minimum of 16 separate polarities are recorded. Subsequent links to the geomagnetic polarity timescale suggest a minimum province duration of > 1 Myrs, with no obvious period of short, high volume volcanism as is often suggested. A protracted duration (>1Myr) may therefore provide the reason why at least the Paraná – Etendeka appears to have no associated extinction event.",

Many models have been put forward to explain this observation, such as galactic chemical evolution (Clayton, 1988), photochemical self-shielding (Thiemens and Jackson, 1987; Clayton, 2002; Yurimoto and Kuramoto, 2004; Lyons and Young, 2005), quantum chemical explanations (Hathorn and Marcus, 1999, 2000; Gao and Marcus, 2002; Marcus, 2004), the processing of solids via nebular lightning (Nuth et al, 2011), and others. Some of the models were invalidated when the Genesis results showed that the oxygen isotopic fractionation of solar wind (and hence of the Sun) was relatively much richer in 16O than such bodies as the Earth or the Moon. Whatever the process that produced non-mass-dependent fractionation in some chondrules and calcium aluminum inclusions, its signature may also be detectable in other solar system solids. If at least some cometary dust was produced in the inner nebula and only later transported outward to be incorporated into comets, then such dust may also show some degree of non-mass-dependent fractionation.\nThe COSIMA instrument on the Rosetta spacecraft (Kissel et al 2009) is a secondary ion mass spectrometer designed to measure the composition of cometary dust. Using calibration data from the COSIMA reference model and flight data if possible, measurement all three isotopes of oxygen will be attempted, and the results compared to other solar system bodies.",

            "abstract": "A large fraction of high latitude permafrost-dominated landscapes are covered by soil mantled hillslopes. In these landscapes, soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulates and is lost through lateral transport processes. At present, these processes are not included in regional or global landsurface climate models. We present preliminary results of a soil transport and storage model over a permafrost dominated hillslope. In this model soil carbon is transported downslope within a mobile layer that thaws every summer. The model tracks soil transport and its subsequent storage at the hillslope's base. In a scenario where a carbon poor subsurface is blanketed by a carbon-rich surface layer, the progressive downslope soil transport can result in net carbon sequestration. This sequestration occurs because SOC is carried from the hilllsope’s near-surface layer, where it is produced by plants and is capable of decomposing, into depositional sites at the hillslope's base where it is stored in frozen deposits such that it's decomposition rate is effectively zero. We use the model to evaluate the quantities of carbon stored in depositional settings during the Holocene, and to predict changes in sequestration rate in response to thaw depth thickening expected to occur within the next century due to climate-change. At the Holocene time scale, we show that a large amount of SOC is likely stored in depositional sites that comprise only a small fraction of arctic landscapes. The convergent topography of these sites makes them susceptible to fluvial erosion and suggests that increased fluvial incision in response to climate-change-induced thawing has the potential to release significant amounts of carbon to the river system, and potentially to the atmosphere. At the time scale of the next century, increased thaw depth may increase soil-transport rates on hillslopes and therefore increase SOC sequestration rates at a magnitude that may partly compensate for the carbon release expected from permafrost thawing. Model guided field data collection is essential to reduce the uncertainty of these estimates.",

These direct measurements will be compared with flux-rope model calculations to help assess the fidelity of different models and to provide diagnostics of internal structures. The Grad-Shafranov reconstruction method will be utilized together with a constant-twist nonlinear force-free (Gold-Hoyle) flux rope model and the commonly known Lundquist (linear force-free) model to reveal the close relation between the field-line twist and length in cylindrical flux ropes, based on in-situ Wind spacecraft magnetic field and plasma measurements. We show that our initial analysis of field-line twist indicates clear deviation from the Lundquist model, but better consistency with the Gold-Hoyle model.

            "abstract": "French Guiana is an overseas department administratively attached to France, located in the northeast of South America between Brazil and Surinam. French Guiana’s distance from France (more than 8000 km) leads to varied needs, especially in energy supply. A promising solution for solar mapping of French Guiana lies in the use of satellite images as the few ground radiometric stations (6 stations) are not sufficient to create a solar mapping of French Guiana. In this work, we assess the use of the Heliosat-II method with GOES satellite images in order to develop a dynamic solar map in French Guiana. To estimate Surface Solar Irradiance (SSI) over French Guiana, the original Heliosat-II method developed for operation with METEOSAT images has been modified to be used with GOES satellite images. Modifications include a change in calibration and in the calculation of the cloud albedo. Cloud albedos were retrieved using several strategies proposed by the literature: the maximum monthly value of the apparent albedo values (ρc max), the 95th percentile of the apparent albedo values (ρc Q95) or a pixel-by-pixel formula (ρc Rig). ). By using these three different methods, SSI was calculated over French Guiana. SSI estimated with ρc max as the cloud albedo gives the best results, with an overall MBE lesser than 5% and a Correlation Coefficient greater than 0.9, for a RMSE of 25% . These results show that the use of the Heliosat-II method with GOES images provide accurate SSI estimates in French Guiana.",

            "abstract": "Modern climate science assessments now have a history of nearly a quarter-century. This experience, together with important advances in relevant social sciences, has greatly improved our ability to communicate climate science effectively. As a result, the Third National Climate Assessment (NCA) was designed to be truly accessible and useful to all its intended audiences, while still being comprehensive and scientifically accurate. At a time when meeting the challenge of climate change is increasingly recognized as an urgent national and global priority, the NCA is proving to be valuable to decision-makers, the media, and the public.\nIn producing this latest NCA, a communication perspective was an important part of the process from the beginning, rather than an afterthought as has often been the case with scientific reports. Lessons learned from past projects and science communications research fed into developing the communication strategy for the Third NCA. A team of editors and graphic designers worked closely with the authors on language, graphics, and photographs throughout the development of the report, Highlights document, and other products. A web design team helped bring the report to life online. There were also innovations in outreach, including a network of organizations intended to extend the reach of the assessment by engaging stakeholders throughout the process. Professional slide set development and media training were part of the preparation for the report’s release. The launch of the NCA in May 2014 saw widespread and ongoing media coverage, continued references to the NCA by decision-makers, and praise from many quarters for its excellence in making complex science clear and accessible. This NCA is a professionally crafted report that exemplifies best practices in 21st century communications.",

            "abstract": "Caldera formation is common on the large volcanoes of Mars. Of these, the Nili Patera caldera in Syrtis Major appears unique. Set at one end of a 200 km long depression, the caldera manifests both extrusive [Christensen et al., 2005] and potentially intrusive [Wray et al., 2013] evolved silica-rich units, hydrothermal systems [Skok et al., 2010], and other post-caldera-formation volcanic structures such as the Nili Tholus cone. Nili Patera distinguishes itself by the depth of collapse. While other Martian caldera collapse less than thickness of the volcanics, Nili Patera’s floor lies ~1800 m below the plains elevations: ~1300 m below the estimated 500 m mean thickness of Syrtis Major [Hiesinger and Head, 2004]. Other calderas lack morphologic evidence of late-stage volcanic constructs, while dust cover precludes spectroscopic evidence of evolved compositions in many calderas. If Nili Patera is unique, the question then is why? We examine the qualities that distinguish Nili Patera not just from calderas on other volcanoes but also from the neighboring Meroe Patera, due south within the same elongate depression. The Noachian-aged material below Syrtis Major have been observed to be altered and phyllosilicate-rich [Ehlmann et al., 2009, Marzo et al., 2010]. Access to this water-rich substrate could have driven the surface hydrothermal system. The eruption of evolved lavas would not be caused by the substrate composition, but could instead result from the collapse. Basaltic volcanoes on Earth often have evolved plutons created by repeated partial melting. The massive collapse of Nili Patera could have provided a mechanism for this unit to erupt, while remaining buried in other volcanoes. We examine multiple hypotheses for why this deep collapse is only observed in Nili Patera and how the observed lithologies here may relate to the evolution of other Martian volcanoes. The regional-scale compositional signature, that the Syrtis Major province shares with other major volcanic constructs [Taylor et al., 2010], provides a broader context to such evolutionary pathways.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this experiment is to decide whether or not the sediment located within Searsville Dam at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is well suited for agricultural soil. By utilizing various combinations of sediment, farm soil, compost, and horse manure to grow basil plants, we underwent an exploratory study in order to better understand what type of materials and nutrients plants can best thrive within. Our general experiment protocol includes watering the crops with irrigation every day while young, and then limiting that water exposure to only Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays as they become more established. The basil is growing in pots filled with the different amounts of material, and are arranged randomly to prevent certain plants from getting more sunlight than others. The whole experiment plot is covered with a thin white fabric and secured with bricks and wood to keep out pests in the garden. In order to observe trends in the basil development, plant height and leaf number is recorded once every week. During the third week of the study we performed soil texture tests, and within the fourth week we calculated pH data. We discovered that the sediment our project focuses upon is 10-18% clay and 50% sand which categorizes it as loam, and the Stanford farm soil that serves as our control group contains 20-26% clay and 30% sand so it is a silt loam material. The pH tests also showed an average of 7.45 for sediment, 7.3 for farm soil, 7.85 for compost, and 7.65 for horse manure. By looking at all of the data recorded over the five-week time period, we have so far noticed that the 50% sediment and 50% horse manure combination consistently has the best height increase as well as leaf size and content. The 50% sediment and 50% compost mixture has also performed well in those terms, and is therefore a possibility for the best agricultural soil. However, future lab work conducted by Stanford students to examine the nutrient content of the basil tissue, along with the study of other types of plants in each agricultural medium, will be the determining factors when deciding whether or not the sediment from Searsville Dam is the ideal substance for growing crops, especially when mixed with other fertile substances.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative knowledge of the soil hydraulic properties is necessary for most studies involving water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone. However, it is always expensive, difficult, and time consuming to measure hydraulic properties directly. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been widely used to forecast soil hydraulic parameters. Rosetta is is one of many PTFs and based on artificial neural network analysis coupled with the bootstrap sampling method. The model provides hierarchical PTFs for different levels of input data for Rosetta (H1-H5 models, with higher order models requiring more input variables). The original Rosetta model consists of separate PTFs for the four “van Genuchten” (VG) water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) because different numbers of samples were available for these characteristics. In this study, we present an improved Rosetta pedotransfer function that uses a single model for all five parameters combined; these parameters are weighed for each sample individually using the covariance matrix obtained from the curve-fit of the VG parameters to the primary data. The optimal number of hidden nodes, weights for saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention parameters in the neural network and bootstrap realization were selected. Results show that root mean square error (RMSE) for water retention decreased from 0.076 to 0.072 cm3/cm3 for the H2 model and decreased from 0.044 to 0.039 cm3/cm3 for the H5 model. Mean errors which indicate variable matric potential-dependent bias were also reduced significantly in the new model. The RMSE for Ks increased slightly (H2: 0.717 to 0.722; H5: 0.581 to 0.594); this increase is minimal and a result of using a single model for water retention and Ks. Despite this small increase the new model is recommended because of its improved estimation of water retention, and because it is now possible to calculate the full covariance matrix of soil water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity together in one neural network model, which will be useful in stochastic modeling and risk-based analysis.",

            "abstract": "Seismological discrimination between underground explosions and earthquakes is complicated by the observation that explosions generate significant S wave radiation. Whether these S waves are generated mainly in the non-linear source region, or by slip on nearby faults, or by mode conversion at boundaries along the propagation path remains controversial. In this study we explore the hypothesis that S wave radiation is generated during the ubiquitous generation of fractures observed in the non-linear source region. We model the nucleation, growth, and interaction of these fractures using a fully dynamic micromechanical damage mechanics recently formulated by Bhat et al. (J. Appl. Mech., 2012). Parameters in the model include the size, density, and orientation of initial fractures in the source rock, the coefficient of friction on their faces, and the dynamic critical stress intensity factor for nucleation and propagation. The damage mechanics is built into the ABAQUS dynamic finite element code as a user-defined rheology and is used to calculate the spatial extent and geometry of the fracture damage as well as resultant seismic radiation generated by an explosion with a specified pressure time-function. A fundamental result of these calculations is that any process that breaks the spherical symmetry of the explosion produces S waves. Sources of asymmetry include an anisotropic distribution of initial fracture (e.g. a rift in the granitic texture), an anisotropic regional pre-stress, or even heterogeneity that breaks the symmetry of the radial fractures. We compare our calculations with field experiments (by Weston Geophysical and New England Research) in a granite quarry and with laboratory experiments that use high-speed photography and laser velocimeters to record the evolution of the damage pattern and resultant seismic radiation.",

            "abstract": "A 3D multi-fluid, multi-scale plasma model with a complete treatment of plasma pressure anisotropy is employed to study global magnetospheric dynamics at Saturn. Cassini has observed anisotropies in the Saturnian magnetosphere, and analyses have showed correlations between anisotropy and plasma convection, ring current structure and intensity, confinement of plasma to the equatorial plane, as well as mass transport to the outer magnetosphere. The energization and transport of plasma within Saturn's magnetosphere is impactful upon the induced magnetic environments and atmospheres of potentially habitable satellites such as Enceladus and Titan.\nRecent efforts to couple pressure anisotropy with 3D multi-fluid plasma modeling have shown a significant move towards matching observations for simulations of Earth's magnetosphere. Our approach is used to study the effects of plasma pressure anisotropy on global processes of the Saturnian magnetosphere such as identifying the effect of pressure anisotropy on the centrifugal interchange instability. Previous simulation results have not completely replicated all aspects of the structure and formation of the interchange 'fingers' measured by Cassini at Saturn. The related effects of anisotropy, in addition to those mentioned above, include contribution to formation of MHD waves (e.g. reduction of Alfvén wave speed) and formation of firehose and mirror instabilities. An accurate understanding of processes such as the interchange instability is required if a complete picture of mass and energy transport at Saturn is to be realized.\nThe results presented here will detail how the inclusion of a full treatment of pressure anisotropy for idealized solar wind conditions modifies the interchange structure and shape of the tail current sheet. Simulation results are compared to observations made by Cassini.",

Modeling results support these findings, indicating that acoustic waves should be able to reach 250-350 km within ~250 km horizontally of the source, and gravity waves should be able to propagate significantly further. However, the mechanism by which the acoustic waves are generated and the ubiquity of occurrence of both types of wave is unknown. We use GPS total electron content measurements to detect gravity and acoustic waves in the ionosphere. We perform a statistical study from 2005 May – July to compare the occurrence rate and horizontal extent of the waves to storm size and convective height from NEXRAD radar measurements. It is found that both gravity waves and acoustic wave horizontal extent is primarily associated with storm size and not convective height.",

            "abstract": "Induced polarization (IP) is a successful electric method to identify drill targets for mineral exploration at the property scale. The Paleomagnetism and Petrophysics Laboratory at the Geological Survey of Canada makes petrophysical measurements on cylindrical rock samples, 2.5 cm diameter and 2.2 cm long. This small size has advantages, including allowing measurement of magnetic remanence with standard paleomagnetism equipment, but it is too small to allow a 4‑contact electrical impedance measurement. The samples are impregnated with distilled water under vacuum and allowed 24 hours for solutes to dissolve off pore walls, in order to approximate original groundwater ionic conductivity. We use graphite electrodes on the flat surfaces and measure the complex impedance at 5 frequencies per decade from 1 MHz down to 25 mHz. Typical responses on a Cole-Cole plot (i.e., real vs. imaginary components displayed parametrically as a function of frequency) look like a two overlapping circular arcs followed by a constant-phase diffusive response at lowest frequencies. The impedance frequency response is fit with a circuit in which the rock is modelled as a set of parallel resistor and constant-phase-element pathways, connected in series through a modified constant-phase-element representing the low frequency sample-holder response. The program “ZarcFit”, written in LabView, allows the operator to tune parameters of an equivalent but far more intuitive series circuit with a set of 13 sliders, and then perform a least-squares optimization. Time domain chargeability is defined by removing the effect of the sample holder, taking the Fourier transform to convert the frequency response to its time-domain equivalent and then integrating under the resulting voltage-decay curve. Time domain measurements using two-electrode sample holders are necessarily contaminated by the low-frequency response of ionic diffusion at the electrodes. Results are compiled in the Canadian Rock Physical Properties Database. I will present examples of mineralogical/lithological sources of chargeability and a useful mineralization index from combining physical properties which can be estimated from inversion of surface geophysical surveys.",

            "abstract": "We attempt to forecast M-and X-class solar flares using a machine-learning algorithm, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), and four years of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, the first instrument to continuously map the full-disk photospheric vector magnetic field from space (Schou et al., 2012). Most flare forecasting efforts described in the literature use either line-of-sight magnetograms or a relatively small number of ground-based vector magnetograms. This is the first time such a large dataset of vector magnetograms has been used to forecast solar flares.\nWe build a catalog of flaring and non-flaring active regions sampled from a database of 2,071 active regions, comprised of 1.5 million active region patches of vector magnetic field data, and characterize each active region by 25 parameters --- which include the flux, energy, shear, current, helicity, gradient, geometry, and Lorentz force. We then train and test the machine-learning algorithm. Finally, we estimate the performance of this algorithm using forecast verification metrics with an emphasis on the true skill statistic (TSS). Bloomfield et al. (2012) suggest the use of the TSS as it is not sensitive to the class imbalance problem. Indeed, there are many more non-flaring active regions in a given time interval than flaring ones: this class imbalance distorts many performance metrics and renders comparison between various studies somewhat unreliable.\nWe obtain relatively high TSS scores and overall predictive abilities. We surmise that this is partly due to fine-tuning the SVM for this purpose and also to an advantageous set of features that can only be calculated from vector magnetic field data. We also apply a feature selection algorithm to determine which of our 25 features are useful for discriminating between flaring and non-flaring active regions and conclude that only a handful are needed for good predictive abilities.",

            "abstract": "Water resource management decisions are made against a backdrop of uncertainty. To capture this model uncertainty, a move is currently afoot in the hydrologic community towards multi-model ensembles. However, the current generation of operational and experimental simulation platforms can be characterized as “small ensemble” systems. Typically, fewer than five hydrologic models are used to characterize the substantial uncertainty in simulation of hydrologic processes and the multi-model systems have a poor probabilistic portrayal of risk.\nWe have developed a hydrologic modeling approach, SUMMA (the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives), that is built on a common set of governing equations and a common numerical solver. In developing SUMMA we recognize that most hydrologic models are based on the same set of governing equations that describe the temporal evolution of thermodynamic and hydrologic model states. As a result, different hydrologic models can be thought of as individual instantiations of a master modeling template. The difference among models relates to decisions on (1) the methods used to represent spatial variability (both throughout the model domain and within model elements); (2) the methods used to parameterize individual physical processes; (3) the methods used to estimate model parameters; and (4) the methods used to solve the model equations. Given this perspective, SUMMA provides a unified approach to hydrologic modeling that integrates different modeling methods into a consistent structure with the ability to instantiate alternative hydrologic models.\nThis presentation will illustrate the capabilities of SUMMA to quantify model uncertainty. First, we review results from an analysis of model shortcomings and provide a typology of the different sources of uncertainty in hydrologic modeling. Next, we summarize the extent to which SUMMA can mimic the behavior of existing models, through controlled test cases for a subset of model domains. This work on model mimicry guides the careful and deliberate selection of ensemble members, so that the ensemble has a comprehensive coverage of the model hypothesis space. Finally, we evaluate the statistical properties of large ensemble systems developed using SUMMA, to improve the probabilistic characterization of risk.",

            "abstract": "Intensive off-road vehicle use for immigration, smuggling, and security of the United States-Mexico border has prompted concerns about long-term human impacts on sensitive desert ecosystems. To help managers identify areas susceptible to soil erosion from vehicle disturbances, we developed a series of erosion potential models based on factors from the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), with particular focus on the management factor (P-factor) and vegetation cover (C-factor). To better express the vulnerability of soils to human disturbances, a soil compaction index (applied as the P-factor) was calculated as the difference in saturated hydrologic conductivity (Ks) between disturbed and undisturbed soils, which was then scaled up to remote sensing-based maps of vehicle tracks and digital soils maps. The C-factor was improved using a satellite-based vegetation index, which was better correlated with estimated ground cover (r2 = 0.77) than data derived from regional land cover maps (r2 = 0.06). RUSLE factors were normalized to give equal weight to all contributing factors, which provided more management-specific information on vulnerable areas where vehicle compaction of sensitive soils intersects with steep slopes and low vegetation cover. Resulting spatial data on vulnerability and erosion potential provide land managers with information to identify critically disturbed areas and potential restoration sites where off-road driving should be restricted to reduce further degradation.",

            "abstract": "Africa has experienced the highest urban growth (~3.5% per year) in the developing world. West Africa in particular has seen significant urban growth mainly driven by the high natural population growth rate and the increasing percentage of population moving to urban areas. Urban growth in West Africa is expected to continue in decades to come. This study uses Landsat data at five different time steps (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010) to map four cities from four different eco-regions of West Africa since the early 1970s. The selected four cities, Kumasi in Ghana, Abuja in Nigeria, Tahoua in Niger and Ouagadoughou in Burkina Faso, are some of the fastest growing cities in the region. We selected the cities in the following ecoregions: Eastern Guinean Forest, Guinean Forest-Savanna Mosaic, Sahelian Acacia Savanna and West Sudanian Savanna. We hypothesize that urban growth in West Africa is different compared to the other parts of the world primarily due to the dependency of about 60 percent of active labor force on subsistence agriculture in the region. As agriculture productivity is dependent on favorable climatic conditions (i.e., good rainfall, suitable temperature), any variability in climate impends the livelihood of subsistence farmers triggering the movements of more people towards the cities. Therefore, studying urban growth based on ecoregions help to better explain the urban development in West Africa. After mapping the urban areas, this study makes a comparative analysis of the temporal and spatial pattern of the urban growths across the ecoregions in West Africa.",

            "abstract": "Long, linear features consisting of sediment and ice, approximately 100 m long and 20 cm wide, run transverse to the margin of Flàajökull, an outlet glacier of Vatnajökull Ice Cap. These features, interpreted as basal crevasse fills, are thought to have formed by debris and water injected into a void under pure tension or a combination of tension and shear in response to an ice pressure drop at the bed. The debris content of these basal crevasse fills are between 5 to 10% by volume. The formation of these basal crevasse fills is uncertain, because direct observation is difficult.\nTo study these basal crevasse fills, we used the orientation of magnetic grains using anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) to guide us in understanding their kinematics. The AMS technique is superior over other fabric methods because a three-dimensional susceptibility ellipsoid is used to determine strain. We sampled two basal crevasse fills and obtained 86 ice core samples for AMS analyses. We also cut nine blocks of ice to determine the magnetic mineralogy, grain size of the magnetic carrier and c-axis orientation of the ice. The AMS results demonstrate that at one fill, the fabric was most likely formed by a combination of pure shear and simple shear. At the second site the AMS results were not well clustered possibly due to insufficient strain. Hysteresis and high temperature susceptibility tests indicate a magnetite carrier that was silt-sized or smaller. Thin sections used to evaluate c-axis fabrics display several multi-maximums that suggested that the fabric developed through recrystallization during deformation. It is inferred that grain scale processes reveal deformation by grain-boundary migration and grain nucleation. Magnetic particles appear to have behaved as passive markers following the March model (1932). Given this data set, we argue that the crevasse fills were formed by multiple processes including injection of turbid waters followed by in situ-freezing and deformation.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice in the Canadian Beaufort Sea has retreated strongly in recent summers, raising interest in its role for the Arctic climate and eco system, and in allowing access for shipping and offshore resources extraction both in Canada and in Alaskan waters further downstream. However, little is known about the thickness of its first- and multiyear ice regimes at the end of winter which are important in preconditioning the ice cover for summer retreat. Here we present results from spring-time airborne electromagnetic ice thickness surveys performed since 2009 over hundreds of kilometers of various first- and multiyear ice regimes. Surveys are complemented by satellite radar imagery allowing regional extrapolation of results. Results show large regional thickness variability with bands of first-year ice in the south and east, of heavily deformed old multiyear ice further north, and of younger multiyear ice in the Canada Basin further to the Northwest. This regional variability is hard to capture with moored ice thickness echo sounders. While the regions of multiyear ice have become thinner overall, there is little evidence for thinning of first-year ice despite later fall freeze-up. This may be related to a thinner snow cover and supports hypotheses about the resilience of first-year ice in a warmer Arctic. Due to the spatial extent of the surveys our data provide unique opportunities for the validation of satellite and airborne radar and laser altimeter and microwave radiometer ice thickness retrievals for which we will show a few examples. We have also analysed the occurrence of extreme ice features and hummock fields and show that these occur frequently both in the first- and multiyear ice regimes. These continue to pose hazards for marine infrastructure.",

Such small geomagnetic storms have not been studied as in depth as larger storms, even though they are capable of pumping-up or depleting the radiation belts equally as extremely as their larger counterparts, this study finds. Since much of the past few years has been quiet, it is necessary to extend previous studies to include smaller storms. We perform a statistical analysis of relativistic electron flux response at geosynchronous to small geomagnetic storms over an 11 year period (1989-2000) using LANL satellite data, similar to previous studies of larger geomagnetic storms. We investigate changes in relativistic electron flux response with various solar wind parameters, as well as extend the statistical analysis of small and large geomagnetic storms with data sets now available from the Van Allen Probes.",

            "abstract": "Detailed process-oriented study of the mechanisms of conversion in the Arctic of fossil carbon to atmospheric gas is progressing, but necessarily limited to a few point locations and requiring detailed subsurface measurements inaccessible to remote sensing. Airborne measurements of concentration, transport and flux of these carbon gases at sufficiently low altitude to reflect surface variations can tie such local measurements to remotely observable features of the landscape. Carbon dioxide and water vapor have been observable for over 20 years from low-altitude small aircraft in the Arctic and elsewhere. Methane has been more difficult, requiring large powerful aircraft or limited flask samples. Recent developments in spectroscopy, however, have reduced the power and weight required to measure methane at rates suitable for eddy-covariance flux estimates. The Flux Observations of Carbon from an Airborne Laboratory (FOCAL) takes advantage of Integrated Cavity-Output Spectroscopy (ICOS) to measure CH4, CO2, and water vapor in a new airborne system. The system, moreover, measures these gases' stable isotopologues every two seconds or faster helping to separate thermogenic from biogenic emissions. Paired with the Best Airborne Turbulence (BAT) probe developed for small aircraft by NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory and a light twin-engine aircraft adapted by Aurora Flight Sciences Inc., the FOCAL measures at 6 m spacing, covering 100 km in less than 30 minutes. It flies between 10 m and 50 m above ground interspersed with profiles to the top of the boundary layer and beyond.\nThis presentation gives an overview of the magnitude and variation in fluxes and concentrations of CH4, CO2, and H2O with space, time, and time of day in a spatially extensive survey, more than 7500 km total in 15 flights over roughly a 100 km square during the month of August 2013. An extensive data set such as this at low altitude with high-rate sampling addresses features that repeat on 1 km scale or smaller such as thermokarst lakes as well as landscape changes on the 100 km scale.",

            "abstract": "The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the Southern Ocean remains one of the most undersampled regions of the world’s oceans. The ACC is comprised of four major fronts: the Sub-Tropical Front (STF), the Polar Front (PF), the Sub-Antarctic Front (SAF), and the Southern ACC Front (SACCF). These were initially observed individually from repeat hydrographic sections and their approximate locations globally have been quantified using all available temperature data from the World Ocean and Climate Experiment (WOCE). More recent studies based on satellite altimetry have found that the front positions are more dynamic and have shifted south by up to 1° on average since 1993.\nUsing ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data from the current Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) we have measured integrated transport variability of the ACC south of Australia. However, differentiation of variability of specific fronts has been impossible due to the necessary smoothing required to reduce noise and correlated errors in the measurements. The future GRACE Follow-on (GFO) mission and the post 2020 GRACE-II mission are expected to produce higher resolution gravity fields with a monthly temporal resolution.\nHere, we study the resolution and error characteristics of GRACE gravity data that would be required to resolve variations in the front locations and transport. To do this, we utilize output from a high-resolution model of the Southern Ocean, hydrology models, and ice sheet surface mass balance models; add various amounts of random and correlated errors that may be expected from GFO and GRACE-II; and quantify requirements needed for future satellite gravity missions to resolve variations along the ACC fronts.",

            "abstract": "Previous work using oxygen and stable carbon isotopes from Arctica islandica shells has shown that this archive can provide information on past seawater temperatures, carbon cycling and ocean circulation. However, relatively less attention has been devoted to other “non-traditional” isotope systems within this proxy archive. In this study, we report the boron (δ11B) and strontium isotopic values (87Sr/86Sr and δ88/86Sr) from A. islandicashells collected and cultured from the Gulf of Maine.\nThe long-lived ocean quahog, A. islandica was collected and cultured in the Gulf of Maine for 8 months. Our high-resolution δ11B records from the experiment show 5-7‰ of increase through the culture, with low values from January to May and higher values after May. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios from both tank water and shell samples suggest that the shell material reflects ambient ocean chemistry without interferences from terrestrial sources. Although It has been suggested that stable Sr isotopic ratios (δ88/86Sr) in biogenic carbonates are influenced by the temperature of the precipitating fluid, our nearly identical δ88/86Sr data do not support this hypothesis despite a 15 °C temperature change during the experiment.\nBased on the in-situ measurements of culture seawater temperature, salinity and pH, and two commonly used fractionation factors (α3-4) for corals and forams, we predicted the range in shell δ11B values for the experiment. Our boron results are at the extreme ends of the two prediction lines suggesting the potential usage of the bivalve shells as seawater pH indicator. However, the wider range in δ11B in this experiment than the predictions based on other carbonate organisms (only 2 to 3‰) suggests that a species-specific fractionation factor may be required.\nRecent work from an additional constant temperature experiment (10 and 15 °C) in the Gulf of Maine will allow us to further evaluate temperature influences and potential vital effects on the shell boron isotope values.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET), as a major part of the water balance, is a key indicator of vegetation stress and also represents various types of water usage strategies. High spatial and temporal resolution ET mapping can provide detailed information about daily vegetation water use and soil moisture status at finer scales, which is important to water management and vegetation condition monitoring. This research employs a multi-scale ET modeling system which is based on the two source surface energy balance (TSEB) model. We discuss the utility of applying this modeling system over an irrigated agriculture area in California and a forested site in North Carolina.\nThe multi-scale ET modeling system integrates the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse model and associated disaggregation scheme (ALEXI/DisALEXI) and fuses the ET estimations from both MODIS (1km, daily) and Landsat (30m, bi-weekly). The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflective Fusion Model (STARFM) is used to retrieve high spatial and temporal resolution ET. A Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) methodology is used in the system to sharpen the native Landsat thermal infrared band (TIR) to 30m resolution. Comparing with Landsat only ET retrievals, this ET modeling system can optimize the usage of multi-satellite data, which are in different temporal and spatial resolution, to maximize the utility of high spatial and temporal ET estimation.\nDaily high spatial resolution ET retrievals are compared with observations from local flux towers. Determining how model output of daily water use information can be employed in irrigation and forest management applications will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Periodic density structures with length-scales of hundreds to several thousands of Mm and frequencies of tens to hundreds of minutes are observed regularly in the solar wind at 1 AU. These structures coexist with, but are not due to, fluctuations in the plasma resulting from the turbulent cascade. Two lines of evidence – one identifying corresponding changes in compositional data in situ, and another identifying periodic density structures in the inner Heliospheric Imaging data onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)/ Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) suite - indicate that periodic density structures are formed in the solar corona as part of the slow solar wind release and/or acceleration processes. The periodic nature of these density structures is an important physical constraint on their origin. In this presentation, we present the results of tracking periodic structures identified in the SECCHI/HI1 images down through the corresponding SECCHI/COR2 images. We demonstrate that the periodic density structures are formed around or below 2.5 solar radii – the inner edge of the COR2 field of view. Further, we compute the occurrence rate of periodic density structures in 10 days of COR2 images as a function of location in the solar corona. We find that this set of periodic density structures occurs preferentially in relation to coronal streamers. Periodic density structures are tracers of solar wind origin and/or acceleration; this study is a pilot for the kinds of investigations that we can carry out with the better temporal and spatial resolution of the heliospheric imagers on Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program has continuously operated profiling cloud radars and micropulse lidars at five fixed sites, for periods ranging from eight to nineteen years. The sites include the U.S. southern Great Plains, the Alaska North Slope and three Tropical Western Pacific locations. The radar and lidar observations, along with ceilometer and precipitation measurements, have been synthesized using ARM's Active Remote Sensing of Clouds (ARSCL) value-added product, which provides cloud boundaries and best-estimate radar reflectivities, mean Doppler velocities and spectral widths. The product’s time resolution ranges from 10 seconds down to 4 seconds, with height resolution of 45 meters or better. Through its use in retrievals of cloud microphysics and dynamics, this high-resolution, long-term data set has the potential to make major contributions toward improved cloud representations in climate models and the understanding of cloud processes. However, it is essential that data set quality and accuracy be assessed and made available to data users in order to maximize utility and reliability.\nIn this study, we apply a variety of approaches to characterize observation quality throughout the ARSCL data record at each site. We describe instrument availability and radar operating status and possible issues. We track radar sensitivity as a function of time through cirrus detection statistics as well as changes in radar signal saturation level over time. We also examine noise and insect clutter reflectivity levels as possible surrogates for radar calibration changes. Through these and other techniques, we assess the most and least reliable time periods for each instrumented site and provide valuable guidance to potential data users, for both case-study research and long-term climatological applications.",

            "abstract": "Southern Ocean cloud cover is strongly linked to extratropical weather systems, and thus to the position of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) storm track and the mid-latitude eddy-driven jet stream. Consequently, if the jet moves poleward (either as a result of natural variability or anthropogenic forcing), a notable change in cloud-radiative processes might be expected. In this study, we examine the cloud-radiative anomalies associated with interannual variability in the latitude of the SH mid-latitude eddy-driven jet, using two satellite data sets (ISCCP-FD and CERES) and 20 global climate models from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Two distinct model types are found. In the first class of models (“type I models”), the total cloud fraction is reduced at SH mid-latitudes as the jet moves poleward, contributing to enhanced shortwave radiative warming. In the second class of models (“type II models”), this dynamically-induced cloud-radiative warming effect is largely absent. Type I and type II models have distinct deficiencies in their representation of observed Southern Ocean clouds, but comparison with the two satellite data sets indicates that the cloud-dynamics behavior of type II models is more realistic.\nBecause the SH mid-latitude jet shifts poleward in response to CO2 forcing, the cloud-dynamics biases uncovered from interannual variability are directly relevant for climate change projections. In CMIP5 model experiments with abruptly quadrupled atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the global-mean surface temperature initially warms more in type I models, even though their equilibrium climate sensitivity is not significantly larger. In type I models, this larger initial warming is linked to the rapid adjustment of the circulation and clouds to CO2 forcing in the SH, where a nearly instantaneous poleward shift of the mid-latitude jet is accompanied by a reduction in the reflection of solar radiation by clouds. In type II models, the SH jet also shifts rapidly poleward with CO2 quadrupling, but it is not accompanied by cloud-radiative warming anomalies, resulting in a smaller initial global-mean surface temperature warming.",

To study the turbulent momentum exchange between a stream and gravel streambed, laboratory experiments were conducted in a 2.5 m long refractive-index matching (RIM) laboratory flume. A flat gravel bed was simulated using cubically packed acrylic spheres (Ds = 1.27 cm) with a refractive index, RI = 1.495, that matched that of the NaI solution in the flume. Thus, optical access to the pore spaces could be gained, and the flow field from the near-bed and into the pore spaces could be measured with particle image velocimetry (PIV).\nDense 2-D velocity vector fields were measured for two bed configurations: (1) a flat, porous, bed composed of three layers of spheres and (2) a flat bed with a cylinder (Dc = 1.27 cm) placed atop it, to induce hyporheic exchange in the manner of a channel-spanning large woody debris. The flow over and through the bed produced by the cylinder is found to be dramaticallydifferent from that associated with a flat bed. The mean velocity field produced by the cylinder exhibited strong flow downwelling in the pore space immediately upstream of the cylinder and upwelling several pore spaces downstream. In particular, the shear layer separating from the cylinder remained parallel to the bed from the point of flow separation to the edge of the field of view, instead of reattaching several grain diameters downstream. The cylinder also promoted increased vertical momentum exchange as suggested by turbulent kinetic energy maps.",

In the first, the top 150 precipitation events at stations located within six regions in the IMW were identified, then back trajectories were initiated at 6 hour intervals on those days at the four CFSR grid points nearest the stations. The second method identified the leading patterns of integrated water vapor transport (IVT) using the three leading Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of IVT over land that were first normalized by the local standard deviation. The top 1% of the associated 6-hourly time series were used to construct composites of IVT, atmospheric circulation and precipitation. The results from both methods indicate that moisture originating from the Pacific that leads to extreme precipitation in the IMW during winter take distinct pathways through gaps in the Cascade (Oregon-Washington), Sierra-Nevada (California) and Peninsula Mountains (southern California through Baja California). The moisture transported along these routes appears to be the primary source for heavy precipitation for the mountain ranges in the IMW. The synoptic conditions associated with the dominant IVT patterns include a trough ridge couplet at 500 h PA, with the trough located northwest of the ridge where the associated circulation funnels moisture from the west-to-southwest through the mountain gaps and into the IMW.",

The SMCM specifically models the area fractions of the three cloud types (congestus, deep and stratiform) that characterize organized convective systems on all scales. The SMCM captures the stochastic behavior of these three cloud types via a judiciously constructed Markov birth-death process using a particle interacting lattice model. The SMCM has been successfully applied for convectively coupled waves in a simplified primitive equation model and validated against radar data of tropical precipitation.\nIn this work, we use for the first time the SMCM in a GCM. We build on previous work of coupling the High-Order Methods Modeling Environment (HOMME) NCAR-GCM to a simple multicloud model. We tested the new SMCM-HOMME model in the parameter regime considered previously and found that the stochastic model drastically improves the results of the deterministic model. Clear MJO-like structures with many realistic features from nature are reproduced by SMCM-HOMME in the physically relevant parameter regime including wave trains of MJO's that organize intermittently in time. Also one of the caveats of the deterministic simulation of requiring a doubling of the moisture background is not required anymore.",

            "abstract": "To investigate the changes of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is of great importance to understand soil carbon dynamics and develop greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation strategies. There are research gaps in understanding how natural environmental and anthropogenic factors (such as socio-cultural and political/legislative) have provided positive and negative feedbacks on SOC stocks since the 1920s at continental scale. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine the temporal trends in SOC storage across the contiguous U.S.; 2) explore the factors that can explain if soils have acted as a carbon source or sink during the period from 1920s to 2010. We used two soil datasets: 1) National Characterization Soil Survey Database (NCSS) from 1924 to 2010, which includes a total of 14,493 site observations with mutiple soil horizons within 0-100 cm; 2) The data from the Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA) Project, containing a total of 6,409 site observations to the maximum depth of 100 cm (2010-2012). We also extracted environmental covariates (space-time layers) covering the U.S. from various sources (remote sensing, National Elevation Dataset, climate data from PRISM project, etc.) to those sites. Results show a fluctuating trend of SOC stocks from 4 kg m-2 in 1920-1930 to 6 kg m-2 in 2010 in the 0-20 cm profile, and from 9 kg m-2 in 1920-1930 to 17 kg m-2 in 2010 in the 0-100 cm profile, respectively. However, there had been a decrease of SOC stock from 1975 to 1985 in both the 0-20 cm and 0-100 cm profiles. Our analysis reveals relationships between SOC storage and major pivotal political/legislative and socio-cultural events as well as environmental factors. The variation of SOC across the contiguous U.S. was affected in some periods by environmental legislation while in others natural effects predominated. The SOC stock change assessment can be used to infer on the magnitude and past trends; and thus, allows some insight how past natural and anthropogenic conditions have interacted with soil carbon storage. These patterns are likely to be amplified under projected anthropogenic trajectories that are magnitude of orders larger in the future. Our results also highlight the importance to take measures to achieve a neutral carbon budget fostering soil carbon sequestration to enhance soil carbon natural capital.",

Controlling for location and time fixed effects, we show that higher than normal temperatures lead to: (i) higher total murder rates, (ii) higher rates of drug cartel related murders, and (iii) higher suicide rates. The effects of high temperatures on inter-personal violence (murders) and on inter-group violence (drug cartel related murders) are large, statistically significant and similar to those found in other recent settings. The use of panel data econometric methods to examine the effect of weather on suicide incidence is novel. We assess the role of economic channels (i.e., agricultural production affected by weather) and conclude that they cannot account for most of the estimated impacts, suggesting that other mechanisms, including psychological explanations, are likely to be important in this setting.",

            "abstract": "Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a major anthropogenic ozone-depleting substance, with an ozone depletion potential (with respect to CFC-11) of 0.82. CCl4 is also a greenhouse gas and the 100-yr global warming potential is 1,400. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol (MP) included CCl4, and production and consumption were phased out for developed countries in 1996. Developing countries were allowed a delayed reduction, but CCl4 was fully phased out from emissive uses in 2010. However, the near-zero 2007-2012 emissions estimate based on the UNEP reported production and feedstock usage cannot be reconciled with the observed slow decline of atmospheric concentrations, year-to-year variability, and the inter-hemispheric gradient (IHG). We use available source and sink data in the NASA 3-Dimensional (3-D) Chemistry Climate Model, GEOSCCM, to test existing emissions and lifetime estimates against CCl4 mixing ratio observations. Our model results show that the IHG and global trend provide useful information for quantitatively constraining CCl4 emissions and lifetime estimates. The observed IHG (1.5±0.2 ppt for 2000-2012) is primarily caused by ongoing current emissions, while ocean and soil losses and stratosphere-troposphere exchange together contribute a small negative gradient (~0 - -0.3 ppt). Using the observed CCl4 global trend and IHG from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – Global Monitoring Division (NOAA-GMD) and Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) networks, we deduce the mean global emissions for the 2000-2012 period are 39 (34-45, lower-upper limit emission estimates) Gg/yr (~ 30% of the peak 1980s emissions) and a corresponding total lifetime of 35 (37-32, upper-lower limit lifetime estimates) years. These results point to the need for a more accurate bottom-up estimate of CCl4 emissions as well as re-evaluation of the CCl4 best estimate lifetime (currently 25 years).",

The distribution of dust in the Martian atmosphere has a significant impact on the atmospheric structure and variability. Information obtained through reconstruction of EDL data from past missions can be used in studying the performance of a model used in preflight atmospheric characterization for future missions. We use the Mars Weather Research and Forecasting (MarsWRF) General Circulation Model to simulate the atmospheric temperature during the landing time periods of Mars Exploration Rovers MER-A and MER-B in 2004. The multi-scale capability of MarsWRF is useful for conducting high- resolution nested simulation centered at the landing site. This version of MarsWRF includes a high spectral accuracy “k-distribution” radiative transfer model. We use the IR dust opacity profile data from the Thermal Emission spectrometer (TES) limb scan data as well as the TES Nadir data to prescribe the dust opacity distribution. Data from MY 26, which corresponds to the year of MER landing, and data from a climatology based on the median of 4 years (MY24 to MY27) of TES data are used. Model temperature profiles are compared with the reconstructions from EDL data and TES observations. Sensitivity of the model simulation to variations in the input opacity data are shown.",

            "abstract": "We examine a multi-centennial Balkan record of vegetation and landscape during the Little Ice Age (LIA) climatic transition that lasted from c. 15th to the 19th century AD. Biological proxies (pollen, spores, and charcoal), geochemical analysis (X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)), and a robust chronology based on AMS 14C dating are used to reconstruct the vegetation response and human-environmental interactions during the LIA. A sediment core extracted from a sinkhole lake located in western Serbia (44°30’N-19°30’E; elevation 250 m a.s.l.) was sampled at 10-cm intervals for investigating biological proxies. Palynological data include temperate indigenous trees (e.g. Quercus, Betula), herbaceous taxa (e.g. Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae), and key anthropogenic indicators (e.g. Juglans, cereals) and demonstrate wet and cool conditions as well as seasonal variations during cal. 16th to 19th century AD. The XRF data obtained from the core at 1-cm intervals show changes in the clastic input and surface erosion around the lake probably owing to seasonal variations during the LIA. Moreover, pollen and charcoal data together reveal the changing nature of human interference across the LIA from intense deforestation to reforestation and sustained cultivation with climatic and seasonal variations. Correlating palaeoecological and geochemical data for this region allows us to interpret the long-term dynamics of landscape and humans across one of the important climatic intervals in Europe. The Balkans, as one of Europe’s “Biodiversity Hotspots” and a rapidly changing region, provides insights into possible biotic responses to future global climatic change.",

            "abstract": "The long residence time of soil organic matter (SOM) is a dynamic property, reflecting the diversity of stabilization mechanisms active within the soil matrix. Climate and ecosystem properties act at the broadest scale, while biochemical recalcitrance, physical occlusion and mineral association drive stability at the microscale. Increasing evidence suggests that the stability of SOM is dominated by organo-mineral interactions. However, the 2:1 clays that provide much of the stabilization capacity in temperate soils are typically absent in tropical soils due to weathering. In contrast, these soils may contain an abundance of iron and aluminium oxides and oxyhydroxides, known as short-range-order (SRO) minerals. These SRO minerals are capable of SOM stabilization through adsorption or co-precipitation, a faculty largely enabled by their high specific surface area (SSA). As such, despite their relatively small mass, SRO minerals may contribute substantially to the SOM stabilization capacity of tropical soils. The objective of this work is to characterize and quantify these Fe-C interactions.\nSurface (0-20 cm) soil samples were taken from 20 quantitative soil pits dug within the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory in northeast Puerto Rico. Soils were stratified across granodiorite and volcaniclastic parent materials. Four extraction procedures were used to isolate three different forms of Fe-C interactions: sodium pyrophosphate to isolate organo-metallic complexes, hydroxylamine and oxalate to isolate SRO Fe- and Al-hydroxides, and dithionite to isolate crystalline Fe-oxyhydroxides. Extracts were analysed for DOC and Fe and Al concentrations to estimate the amount of SOM associated with each mineral type. Soils were subjected to SSA and solid-phase C analyses before and after extraction to determine the contribution of the various Fe mineral types to soil SSA, and therefore to potential stabilization capacity through organo-mineral complexation. Preliminary results suggest that extracts from granodiorite parent material contain on average twice the Fe than those from volcaniclastic parent material. The removal of SRO minerals reduced SSA in both soil types, and appear to contribute substantially to SOM stabilization compared to the bulk mineral matrix.",

The projected change in the precipitation pattern in response to warming is not uniform. In general, the difference in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons is expected to increase. Because of the changes in precipitation pattern, the characteristics of future drought scenarios might be different from that observed in the past. In this study, the characteristics of drought are investigated in terms of severity, frequency, and duration for nine representative climate regions across the United States at different time scales. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is used as the means to forecast and compare drought characteristics for different regions at different time scales, a perspective which is not obtained using other available drought monitoring indices. The North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) provides historic as well as future precipitation from multiple regional climate models (RCMs) coupled with various global circulation models (GCMs). To evaluate the performance of the RCMs, we used the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) precipitation data set. We analyzed the coefficient of efficiency (E) of the models for different time scale at different locations. Results from the climate model historic run were adjusted to represent the reanalysis data and the same adjustment factor was used to correct the future projections. Adjusted values of SPI obtained from the historic runs were compared with those from the future runs. The performance of climate models in characterizing drought is different in different locations. The change in drought characteristics is shown to occur in all climatic regions; however, nature of change is different.",

We present preliminary results from a project designed to analyze the age, elevation, and paleoclimate history of Quaternary sediments deposited during sea level highstands along the United States Atlantic Coastal Plain (ACP) from Maryland to Florida. Prior studies have shown that, depending on the region, ACP sediments correlate with past interglacial periods corresponding to Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5, 7, possibly 9, and 11. Stratigraphy, marine micropaleontology, and palynology indicate at least two major marine transgressive sequences on the Delmarva Peninsula in Virginia corresponding to MIS 5a and 11, the Nassawadox Formation and Accomack beds of the Omar Formation, respectively. These depositional sequences represent sea-level positions of approximately +10m and +15m, relative to today. Despite generally corresponding to glacio-eustatic sea levels of +5-9m for MIS 5a-e (Potter & Lambeck, 2003; Kopp et al., 2009), and of +6-13m for MIS 11 (Raymo & Mitrovica, 2012), the relative sea-level positions during both interglacial periods were likely affected by glacio-isostatic adjustment in the region. Corresponding marine units and paleo-shorelines, identified by pronounced inland scarps separated by intermittent terraces on the western side of the Chesapeake Bay, are likely from MIS 5, 7, and 11. Ostracode and foraminifera assemblages identify significant environmental variability within these transgressive interglacial deposits, likely driven by relatively minor, suborbital climatic and sea-level oscillations.",

            "abstract": "Estimating forest soil carbon and nitrogen (CN) is critical to understanding ecosystem responses to changing climate, disturbance and forest management practices. Most of the uncertainty in soil CN cycling is associated with the difficulty in characterizing soil properties in field sampling because forest soils can be rocky, inaccessible and spatially heterogeneous. A composite coring technique is broadly applied as the standard FIA soil sampling protocol. However, the accuracy of this method might be limited by soil compaction, rock obstruction and plot selection problems during sampling. In contrast, the quantitative soil pit sampling method may avoid these problems and provides direct measurements of soil mass, rock volume and CN concentration representative of a larger ground surface area. In this study, the two sampling methods were applied in 60 forest plots, randomly located in three research areas in the Delaware River Basin in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region. In each of the plots, one quantitative soil pit was excavated and three soil cores were collected. Our results show that average soil bulk density in the top 20 cm mineral soil measured from the soil cores was consistently lower than bulk density measured by soil pits. However, the volume percentage of coarse fragments measured by the core method was also significantly lower than the pit method. Conversely, CN concentrations were greater in core samples compared to pit samples. The resulting soil carbon content (0-20 cm) was estimated to be 4.1 ± 0.4 kg m-2 in the core method compared to 4.5 ± 0.4 kg m-2 in the pit method. Lower bulk density but higher CN concentration and lower coarse fragments content from the cores have offset each other, resulting in no significant differences in CN content from the soil pit method. Deeper soil (20-40 cm), which is not accessible in the core method, accounted for 29% of the total soil carbon stock (0-40 cm) in the pit method. Our results suggest that, although soil CN stocks measured by the two sampling methods had no significant difference, some systematic biases appear to exist in the FIA soil core method in measuring soil bulk density and coarse fragment content. Data collected by the quantitative soil pit method may be considered more accurate and can access greater soil depth, but substantially labor intensity may hamper sample sizes.",

            "abstract": "This work assesses the impact of uncertainties in atmospheric state on laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS)-based retrievals of CO2 column mixing ratios (XCO2). LAS estimates of column XCO2 are normally derived from a combination of observed CO2 differential optical depths (∆τ) and measured/estimated values of temperature, moisture and pressure along the viewing path. XCO2 can be related to CO2 ∆τ as\n(see equation)\nwhere Δτother represents residual observed ∆τ due to other species, ∆σ is the CO2 differential absorption cross section, psfc is the surface pressure, q is the local specific humidity and λon/λoff represent the observation on/off-line wavelengths. As shown by these equations, the accuracy of retrieved XCO2 values depends on both the error characteristics of the observed ∆τ and the ability to accurately characterize P, T, and q along the observed path. In the case of global space-based monitoring systems it is often not possible to provide collocated in situ measurements of the ancillary quantities for all observations. Therefore, retrievals often rely on collocated remotely sensed data or values derived from Numerical Weather Predictions (NWP) models to describe the atmospheric state. \nA radiative transfer (RT)-based simulation framework, combined with representative global upper-air observations and matched NWP profiles, was used to assess the impact of model differences in vertical T, vertical moisture, and psfc on estimates of column CO2 and O2 concentrations. These analyses focus on characterizing these errors for several CO2 features in the 1.57- and 2.05-µm region, and representative O2 features near 0.76 and 1.27 µm. The results provide a set of signal-to-noise metrics that characterize the errors in retrieved values associated with uncertainties in knowledge of the atmospheric state, and provide a method for selecting optimal differential line pairs to minimize the impact of this noise term. These metrics may help define the instrument requirements needed to meet the objectives of the proposed Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days and Seasons (ASCENDS) satellite mission, and have provided information to facilitate the design, development, and assessment of the NASA Langley Research Center’s ASCENDS CarbonHawk Experiment Simulator (ACES).",

This study focuses on airmass thunderstorms which occurred in northern Alabama on May 21, 2012 during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign. Two aircraft (NASA DC-8 and NCAR G-V) sampled inflow and outflow of the convective storms. WRF-Chem simulations of the same event are conducted on 3 nested domains at a cloud-parameterizing scale (15 km horizontal grid) and cloud-resolving scales (3 km and 0.6 km horizontal gird). Lightning data assimilation with a smooth nudging function is used to improve the WRF-Chem simulations of thunderstorm location and structure. Gridded total flashes from the North Alabama Lightning Mapping Array (NALMA) and Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) are assimilated by the model every 10 minutes. Compared with the NEXRAD radar reflectivity, the model-simulated thunderstorms capture the placement, structure and intensity of the real storms fairly well, but the storms decay faster than those in the observations. The model-simulated vertical distributions of trace gases within the storm and surrounding the storm are compared with measurements from the DC-8 and G-V aircraft in the storm inflow and outflow regions. Model-derived CO mixing ratios and vertical velocities are used to estimate transport from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere, and these results are compared with those from other more intense convective systems observed in DC3.",

            "abstract": "Large thrust faults on Mercury are the expression of horizontal contraction that resulted from cooling of the planet; their uneven distribution may indicate that other stress fields contributed to their formation and development. We explore the relationship in the northern hemisphere between locations of lobate scarps and high-relief ridges >50 km in length and inferred crustal thickness to understand whether mechanisms that result in crustal thickening and thinning may have also influenced the locations of large thrust faults. These landforms are concentrated in areas with >53 km crustal thickness (at the 99% confidence level, on the basis of a two-sided single proportion test), an extreme end of the normal distribution (with a mean of 40 km) of modeled crustal thickness values. One possible mechanism for thickening crust and concentrating prominent thrust faults is mantle flow; a broad pattern of mantle upwelling and downwelling is compatible with Mercury’s gravity anomaly and topography fields at long (>1000 km) horizontal wavelengths. On Earth (e.g., central Australia), midplate mantle downwelling has been invoked as a mechanism to thicken overlying continental crust and increase compressional stresses in the rigid upper portion of the lithosphere. Downwelling in some areas requires upwelling in others; horizontal divergence could decrease levels of compressive stresses over upwelling regions and might account for the deficiency of large thrust faults in areas of thinnest crust (<27 km, significant at the 95% confidence level). We tested the possibility that this deficiency instead corresponds to burial by thick volcanic flows within areas of smooth plains by excluding the northern plains and Caloris interior plains (the two largest expanses of smooth plains), but there was no significant change from the result for the full hemisphere. If mantle flow contributed to the current patterns of crustal thickness and large thrust fault locations, an implication is that either (i) the large-scale pattern of mantle flow on Mercury was long-lasting and geographically stationary during the period when the planet contracted, or (ii) a shorter episode of mantle flow coincided with the development of many scarps, perhaps because of a relatively high rate of contraction at that time.",

            "abstract": "Snowmelt is the primary source of surface water in the western United States and many other regions on Earth. Climate warming is forecast to impact the amount of precipitation that falls as snow and forms the mountain snowpack. Climate change induced alterations to snowpack translate to changes in snowpack magnitude, the timing of snowmelt, and changes in snowmelt rate. We ask how these perturbations may impact how snowmelt is partitioned between evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff (R) at Como Creek, a snowmelt dominated catchment on the Colorado Front Range. Como Creek is a 4.5 km2 headwater catchment spanning 2900-3560 m and is part of the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Station and the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory. We use observations of snow water equivalent (SWE), ET, and precipitation (P) from Niwot Ridge, CO, and discharge from Como Creek to explore relationships between snowpack dynamics and snowmelt partitioning. Measurements of ET are collected adjacent to Como Creek at the Niwot Ridge Ameriflux site and are assumed representative of the hydrologic fluxes in Como Creek. Analyses from point data show that years with higher peak SWE/P ratios partition proportionally more snowmelt to ET (pValue: 0.045). For example, water year (WY) 2005 has a peak SWE/P ratio of 0.49 and a growing season ET normalized by WY precipitation (ET/P) ratio of 0.48 while WY 2008 has a peak SWE/P ratio of 0.83 and an ET/P ratio of 0.82. Observations also show that years that experience later peak SWE (DOY=142) partition proportionally less snowmelt into ET (ET/P=0.42) compared to years that experience earlier peak SWE (DOY=86) and partition proportionally more snowmelt to ET (ET/P=0.56). Further point analyses also suggest that more rapid snowmelt results in proportionally less snowmelt partitioned to ET and more partitioned to runoff. To explore the underlying processes responsible for these relationships at the catchment scale we use the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys) to model how snowmelt is partitioned between ET and R under observed conditions and under a variety of climate change induced snowmelt timing, magnitude, and rate scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Knowing the magnitude of tectonic stress and rock strength at seismically active margins is important towards understanding fault strength and failure mechanics, yet both are difficult to measure in situ. Recent work at subduction margins, including Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Nankai Trough Subduction Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) drillsites, uses the width of compressional wellbore breakouts (BO), which depends on far field stress conditions, rock strength, and borehole annular pressure (APRS), to estimate the magnitude of horizontal principal stresses (SHmax and Shmin); estimates are problematic due to uncertainty in rock strength (unconfined compressive strength/UCS– for which direct measurements are scarce) and rheology that govern stress distribution at the wellbore. We conduct a novel case study at IODP Site C0002, where a hole was drilled twice with different boundary conditions, providing an opportunity to define in situ stress and strength from field data.\nSite C0002 is the main deep riser borehole for NanTroSEIZE, located near the seaward edge of the Kumano Basin above the seismogenic plate boundary, ~30 km from the trench. Several boreholes were drilled at the site. During IODP Expedition 314 in 2007, Hole C0002A was drilled with a suite of logging while drilling (LWD) tools to 1401 mbsf in a riserless mode. Hole C0002F, ~70 m away, was drilled to 862 mbsf in riserless mode during Exp. 326 in 2010 and deepened to 2005 mbsf in a riser mode during Expedition 338 in 2012-2013. Increased APRS achieved by riser drilling stabilizes the borehole and suppresses BO, consistent with resistivity imaging data from Exp. 314 that document well-developed, continuous BO throughout the borehole, and data from Expedition 338 indicating few BO.\nWe use a semi-Newtonian approach to solve for stress and UCS consistent with the observed BO width and measured APRS in the two holes over the interval from 862-2005 mbsf. Effective SHmax ranges from ~10-30 MPa and indicate a strike-slip or thrust regime. Our results indicate UCS is higher than predicted by empirical relations and a small suite of laboratory tests by as much as 20 MPa. This apparent discrepancy may indicate that the failure criterion, or assumed distribution of stresses around the wellbore in analyses of far field stress, may not be appropriate in this setting.",

However, most such retrievals ignore polarization effects in the reflected radiation and are limited to dark surface scenarios. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of combining intensity and polarization measurements in the O2 A and B bands for retrieving aerosol optical depth and aerosol height, especially over bright surfaces.\nThe feasibility study is conducted in two steps. The first step comprises a theoretical analysis of the effects of various aerosols on the behavior of the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) of light in the O2 A and B bands under different surface conditions. We use the Unified Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model (UNL-VRTM) to simulate the full Stokes vector and its Jacobians with respect to the aerosol optical depth and parameters characterizing the aerosol vertical profile. In order to identify the most sensitive spectral wavelengths, the concepts of ‘Shannon information content (SIC)’ and ‘degree of freedom for signal (DFS)’ are used to examine the information contained in each individual wavelength in both O2 bands. In the second step, case studies are conducted to retrieve the optical depth and vertical distribution of aerosols. Here, we use GOME-2 and/or SCIAMACHY backscatter measurements at selected most sensitive wavelengths in both O2 bands. The retrieval method is based upon non-linear optimal estimation theory. We compare the retrieved aerosol parameters (optical depth and height of aerosols) directly with CALIPSO observations. We also estimate the error of the retrieved parameters due to various sources of uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) availability varies considerably throughout Taylor Valley, Antarctica. As an essential nutrient, P content and weathering have significant implications for the diversity and functioning of biota in soils, streams, and lakes. In upper Taylor Valley (Bonney Basin), soils have much lower total P content than in lower Taylor Valley (Fryxell Basin), 0.4 versus 1.5 g/kg soil. We hypothesize that this striking contrast is related to differences in glacial drift source and weathering rates.\nWe investigated the primary source of mineral P (apatite) and the grain-scale weathering processes resulting in the release of P into streams and adjacent soils in the Bonney and Fryxell Basins. Physical erosion, chemical weathering, and biological weathering all leave distinctive patterns on the surface of individual apatite grains. By inspecting these surfaces, we determined the relative importance of weathering processes for P cycling.\nApatite grains were separated from loose glacial drift using heavy-liquid and magnetic techniques. Individual grains were analyzed using SEM-EDS. We observe significant differences between the grains collected from the two basins. Grains from the Bonney Basin are more elongated and have a higher proportion of crystal faces. These results suggest that rates of physical weathering have been lower in the Bonney Basin than in the Fryxell Basin. In addition, we will present results on grain surface morphologies, indicative of chemical and biological weathering.\nAs the climate warms, more liquid water is expected to be available within the Taylor Valley system. This increase in water will likely lead to higher rates of P weathering, potentially altering nutrient limitation in this environment. Understanding how the P cycle will respond to a changing climate is contingent on understanding the current weathering processes and controls on P availability.",

            "abstract": "An accurate representation of density of snow and firn at the surface of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is important for both models and measurements of ice sheet mass change, and therefore estimates of ice sheet contribution to past and future sea level rise. In particular, mass change derived from satellite and airborne snow accumulation measurements (e.g. accumulation from IceBridge, and volume changes from ICESat and Cryosat-2) rely on estimates of snow and firn density to convert measured surface elevation changes into estimates of mass change. While numerous firn densification models (FDMs) have been applied over both ice sheets, there has been little evaluation of the density simulated by regional climate models (RCMs). RCMs capture the coupling between the surface-and the atmosphere, as well as sub-surface hydrology and thermodynamics, and are used to make future projections of ice sheet mass change. Improving accuracy of simulated density is important for improved representation of RCM-simulated surface processes. Here we present an initial validation of density profiles in the Modèle Atmosphérique Régionale (MAR) RCM against in situ data from the SUMup community dataset. An analysis of initial results indicates that MAR tends underestimate surface density in the first two meters of the snowpack at the cores examined. Additionally, initialization of the MAR snowpack may lead to errors in subsurface density in some locations. These biases and errors may impact simulation of storage of meltwater within the firn and may lead to an underestimation of mass changes if simulated density is combined with remote-sensing-derived accumulation estimates.",

            "abstract": "Rip currents are a worldwide coastal hazard that have claimed 616 lives in Costa Rica since 2001 (~50/yr). Lifeguard staff, warning signs, and flag systems have been shown to reduce deaths at rip-prone beaches but are not a perfect system. At Playa Cocles, a popular beach destination along the Caribbean Coast of Costa Rica near Puerto Viejo, lifeguards post flags at the mouth of the 3 to 6 rip currents present each morning. In July 2014, these dangerous currents were measured with floating GPS drogues at speeds up to 3.1 m/s. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the capability of the Digital Globe WorldView2 (WV2) multispectral satellite for identifying rip channels and mapping bathymetry in the surf zone (20m and less), because rips form at topographically low spots in the bathymetry as a result of feedback amongst waves, substrate, and antecedent bathymetry. WV2 was launched in 2009; it has a 1.1 day pass-over rate with 1.84m ground pixel resolution of 8 bands, including ‘yellow’ (585-625 nm) and ‘coastal blue’ (400-450 nm). Using one 25km2 image from 23 December 2009, during the “high season” of tourism, a bathymetric map of Playa Cocles is created and measured for accuracy. Results of the study will assist the Comisión Nacional de Emergencias de Costa Rica and the town of Puerto Viejo by creating a rip current hazard evaluation and prediction system for the rip-prone beach of Playa Cocles. This creation methodology may be repeated for any following dates or other locations in Costa Rica (or anywhere on the globe captured by WV2). Future work will build on this research to determine rip current strength, location, and seasonality from a combination of WV2 satellite information and field data.",

            "abstract": "To date, analysis of diet, food web complexities, biogeochemical cycles, and ecosystem functioning have largely focused on using variation in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotope ratios. This is because a great deal is understood about what leads to this variation and because the dual stable isotope analysis of these two elements using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) is now commonplace. However, the aforementioned studies may all greatly benefit from the additional information one can get from also having sulfur (S) stable isotopes ratio data. Until very recently the analysis of δ34S has traditionally required an additional and often more difficult analytical procedure.\nHere, we report on the development of a new method that simultaneously analyzes the elemental and isotopic composition of N, C and S in a single sample. The new commercially available instrument includes a modified NCS elemental analyzer in line with an IRMS outfitted with 100 volt AD converters for wide dynamic range. We tested, and modified, this instrument to achieve maximum accuracy and precision for the isotopic measurements of all three elements. We found that the original design needed improvements to achieve our goals by: a) including a component (originally designed for trapping water) as buffer to reduce S memory and obtain reliable δ34S analysis; b) adding an external furnace for complete reduction of nitrogen oxides to N2 gas for accurate δ15N; c) adding a magnesium perchlorate water trap immediately after the reduction tube to minimize any water condensation that could also influence S memory. We analyzed a selection of organic materials and soils with approximately a 1:2 standards versus unknowns ratio per run.\nUsing this NCS set-up, the precision of the N and C isotopic measurements was comparable to the one usually attained in NC mode alone (standard deviation of ± 0.13 δ15N in the range 30 to 400 µg N, and of ± 0.12 δ13C in the range 0.20 to 4 mg C). The precision for S in the range 8 to 120 µg S was ± 0.4 δ34S, although it decreased for samples with lower S content (± 1 δ34S at 4 µg S).\nBased on our testing, we believe that this method is suitable for widespread use, and can significantly enhance the application of δ34S measurements in both soils and a broad range of organic samples in ecological and biogeochemical research.",

            "abstract": "An airborne and ground-based field program called DEEPWAVE was performed in New Zealand during June and July 2014. DEEPWAVE measurements provided the first opportunity to observe gravity waves (GWs) arising from various tropospheric sources and propagating throughout the atmosphere to regions of dissipation as high as the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). Quantification of GW amplitudes, scales, and phase structures was enabled by observations that were nearly continuous in altitude and often spanned broad horizontal extents.\nThe measurements were made possible by new Na resonance and UV Rayleigh lidars and an Advanced Mesosphere Temperature Mapper (AMTM) specifically built for measurements aboard the NSF/NCAR GV research aircraft. Additional ground-based optical instruments quantified stratosphere and MLT mean and GW structures whenever skies were clear.\nThis talk will focus on deep propagation of mountain waves (MWs). Our observations yielded many surprises and important new insights into these phenomena. Flight-level measurements often revealed relatively weak MW forcing and an apparent distinction between vertically-propagating MWs having larger horizontal wavelengths >30 km, and trapped lee waves having wavelengths <30 km. But no such distinction was observed in the MLT, where the new lidar and AMTM instruments revealed large MW amplitudes at horizontal wavelengths of ~10-100 km. Large MLT MW responses were also observed on nights when the GV did not fly because of expected weak MW forcing. Both larger- and smaller-scale MWs achieved T’ ~10-20 K at ~87 km, implying horizontal velocity perturbations of u’~20-50 m/s and surprisingly large peak momentum fluxes. These results suggest that MWs routinely account for localized, but significant momentum transport to altitudes as high as allowed by the intervening winds.",

            "abstract": "Scientific information on, and regulatory oversight of, the U.S. oil and gas extraction have been outpaced by the scale and extent of development, particularly in states like Pennsylvania. Through recent convenings and focus groups with local officials from municipalities and counties facing such development, we asked how scientific information can be gathered and communicated to help policymakers make decisions on whether to proceed with development and, if so, what regulatory and non-regulatory approaches to consider to manage the risks from such activity.\nWe found that the highly technical nature of unconventional oil and gas development can make conveying information difficult and public conversations harder. And, although there is scientific agreement on areas of greater risk, such as air, water, and socioeconomics effects, communities vary widely in their perceptions and concerns about these. Local leaders expressed concerns about the availability and accessibility of information: much of it is scattered, sourced from a variety of sources and viewpoints, and is viewed with confusion, skepticism, or disbelief among various stakeholders.\nIn order to generate independent and trusted information, baseline testing, monitoring and enforcement, and data sharing are needed – but the specifics of who would do the studies, who would fund them, and how much data one would need before decisions can be made remain largely unclear. One reason for this uncertainty is the patchwork and contested nature of regulation between local, state, tribal, and federal authorities. Another is the fragmented operations disbursed across the landscape, numerous kinds and scales of operators, and the host of actors involved in land access, well development, production, and piping, lead to disjointed sources of studies, data, and communication. Another reason is that the impacts of oil and gas development activities are nested and complex, each affecting the other at varied levels, local to global.\nThis presentation will elaborate on the challenges in integrating scientific knowledge with decision making that local officials face as they navigate decisions about whether oil and gas development aligns with the character of the communities they govern, and if so, how to minimize the related effects and risks for their communities.",

Giant kelp is a highly dynamic foundation species that supports an ecologically and economically important ecosystem.

Spectral variability is explored by assessing how changes in the photosynthetic condition of giant kelp canopy (i.e. pigment and nutrient concentrations) are exhibited in the reflectance and transmittance of kelp fronds. We then compare pigment and nutrient concentrations of kelp fronds to laboratory and airborne measurements of reflectance and transmittance in order to develop spectral metrics of kelp photosynthetic pigment state.\nWe developed spectral indices that explained 71%, 18%, and 59% of the variance for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c, and fucoxanthin respectively, and found that HyspIRI will have sufficient spectral resolution and signal to detect these changes in chlorophyll a and fucoxanthin. Our results indicate that the spectral coverage provided by HyspIRI has the potential to provide new insights into the ecology and variability in photosynthetic condition of giant kelp.",

            "abstract": "Supereruptions have the potential to be devastating events, and constraining the longevity of the giant pools of magma (>450 km3) discharged in such eruptions is critical. Much work has focused on this problem, but no consensus has been reached, and estimates vary considerably depending on the approach used (e.g. Bishop Tuff, zircon geochronology: 103-106 a; oxygen isotopes: 104 a; thermal modeling: 103-105 a; textures, diffusion chronometry: 103 a). This discrepancy exists partly because different timekeepers in eruptive products record different magmatic processes, and methods vary in how well they can resolve timescales related to these processes. We describe a new method using textures (sizes, shapes, positions) of quartz-hosted melt inclusions, determined from propagation phase-contrast x-ray tomography, to estimate crystallization times. The premise of this geochronometer is that, over time, initially round melt inclusions become more faceted through diffusion, and their current shape can be used to estimate their magmatic residence time. This method is distinct in that it illuminates the time that a magma was melt-rich and eruptible rather than crystal-rich and uneruptible; many geochronometers can record these latter, more protracted histories, making it challenging to interpret the timescales that result from them. We also use this method to estimate quartz growth rates, an important but currently poorly constrained quantity. We determine growth rates by relating inclusion residence times and their positions within a crystal: Growth Rate = Length (distance from crystal edge) / Time (residence time). We apply this method to three large-volume high-silica rhyolite eruptions: the paired 240 ka Ohakuri-Mamaku (245 km3 combined volume; central Taupo Volcanic Zone [TVZ], New Zealand), the 26.5 ka Oruanui (530 km3; central TVZ), and the 760 ka Bishop Tuff (1000 km3; California, USA). To validate this method, we compare a subset of our results to those obtained from Ti diffusion profiles in the same crystals. Results show that: (a) the two methods give comparable timescale estimates; (b) quartz growth rates average 10-12 m/s; and (c) quartz melt inclusions give decadal to centennial timescales, revealing that giant magma bodies develop over notably short, historical timescales.",

            "abstract": "Radial anisotropy within the upper mantle was first encountered in the early 1960's based on studies using surface waves. A disrepancy between the Love and Rayleigh wave data was observed which could not be explained using a simple isotropic model. This was later reconconciled using a transversely isotropic model now assumed in many modern day anisotropic models such as SAW642AN and S362ANI. Radial anisotropy is attributed to the lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of the anisotropic crystals believed to be organised by the flow in the upper mantle. These models are therefore important for analysing the geometry of the flow and the deformation of the mantle. Surface wave observations offer a unique way of studying the radial anisotropy. Rayleigh waves are sensitive to the vertical shear velocity (SV) and Love waves are sensitive to the horizontal shear velocity (SH). The ratio of these give the radial anisotropy parameter ξ. Although radial anisotropy models exist, they are usually limited to the fundamental mode measurments with poor path coverage due to the noise on the horizontal components. Higher mode Love wave measurements are difficult for oceanic paths. This is because group velocities of the higher modes are similar to the fundamental mode between a period range of 50-100 s. These therefore arrive and interferre with each other. The higher mode information therefore cannot be extracted easily. We modify the method of Debayle and Ricard 2012 which allow the extraction of information up to the 5th overtone by mimicking the interferrence from the arrival of the fundamental and higher modes. Synthetic tests show an excellent recovery of the fundamental and higher mode information from the Love waves. The inclusion of the the higher modes greatly increases the resolution to the SH velocity and increases the sampling to deeper structures. We apply this modified method to a large dataset and construct an SH model. This is then combined with an equivalent SV model for the radial anisotropy model which we present here with added higher mode information and improved path coverage compared to recent global models.",

            "abstract": "Our down-hole mineralogical and geochemical analyses from the East Pacific Rise fast-spreading lower oceanic crust indicate that alteration of olivine to serpentine and of plagioclase to prehnite were independent, and neither alone monitors the total “alteration.” The results are based on representative channel sub-samples recovered from every Hole J core during IODP Expedition 345 to the Hess Deep tectonic window. Samples have been analyzed for trace element, Sr isotopic, and quantitative mineralogical compositions (the latter by Rietveld refinement using X-ray diffraction data).\nHole J is the most representative rock succession drilled at the Hess Deep as it penetrated the two principle plutonic lithologies: an upper gabbro and a lower troctolite. Units are significantly distinguished by XRD modal mineralogy and trace element abundances. The more heterogeneous gabbro contains 23-32 wt% clinopyroxene (cpx), 34-54 wt% plagioclase (plag), and <4 wt% olivine (ol). The troctolite contains 3-11% cpx, 14-36% plag, and ≤6% ol. Alteration minerals comprise together 18-31% in the gabbro versus 55-80% of the troctolite. The most abundant alteration products are prehnite and chlorite.\nGabbro samples with lowest abundances of alteration minerals (18-20 wt%) preserve 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70275-0.7028) consistent with unaltered mantle. The abundance of plag in the gabbro, the major host for Sr, suggests retention of mantle Sr isotopic compositions there is due to the large reservoir of magmatic Sr. 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.70300-0.70342 in the troctolite samples indicate seawater interaction, even where olivine is most abundant, and serpentine is at or below the ~1% detection limit by XRD. Significant alteration of the deep crust by seawater thus predates the first appearance of serpentine. These data suggest that the timing and operation of prehnite- and serpentine-producing alteration reactions are independent.",

The MACDA dataset is a reanalysis of Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) retrievals from the Mars Global Surveyor during Mars Year (MY) 24-27 (Montabone et al., 2011). The local energy conversion processes are diagnosed with the help of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) equation. Implementing the EKE equation on the MACDA dataset required evaluation of the vorticity from the horizontal wind vector and the calculation of the vertical component of the wind vector from the quasi-geostrophic omega equation. The computation of the terms that include the horizontal divergence required special care due to the sensitivity of the calculation of the divergence by a numerical approximating scheme. Results are provided for the Ls = 200-230 early winter period that allows for direct comparison to results in Kavulich et al. (2013), which used the Mars global circulation model (MGCM) of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) for the investigation of the local energetics. Overall patterns are similar; however, there are important differences between the local energy conversion processes in the different MY’s and in the MACDA and the MGCM datasets. Most importantly, the geopotential flux convergence, which serves as a trigger for EKE generation, is stronger in the MACDA dataset than the MGCM dataset. Additionally, the EKE and forcing terms are weaker in MY 26 than in MY 24/5.\nKavulich, M. J., Szunyogh, I., Gyarmati, G., & Wilson, R. J. (2013).

Here we compare and evaluate three strategies to obtain daily maps of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone from OMI and MLS measurements: trajectory mapping, direct profile retrieval, and data assimilation. Evaluation is based on an assessment that includes validation using ozonesondes and comparisons with the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemical transport model (CTM). We investigate applications of the three ozone data products from near-decadal and inter-annual timescales to day-to-day case studies. Inter-annual changes in zonal mean tropospheric ozone from all of the products in any latitude range are of the order 1-2 Dobson Units while changes (increases) over the 8-year Aura record investigated vary by 2-4 Dobson Units. It is demonstrated that all of the ozone products can measure and monitor exceptional tropospheric ozone events including major forest fire and pollution transport events. Stratospheric ozone during the Aura record has several anomalous inter-annual events including split stratospheric warmings in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics that are well captured using the data assimilation ozone profile product. Data assimilation with continuous daily global coverage and vertical ozone profile information is the best of the three strategies at generating a global tropospheric and stratospheric ozone product for science applications.",

            "abstract": "Recent Global Climate Models, utilizing topography restored for rift-related subsidence and glacial erosion, produce a West Antarctic Ice Sheet for earliest Oligocene (~34 Ma) conditions. Additionally, global isotopic records indicate an Antarctic ice sheet larger than today’s at ~34 Ma. However, evidence for a pre-30 Ma major glaciation has been lacking in seismic stratigraphic studies of Ross Sea.\nUtilizing deep scientific core holes and all available seismic reflection profiles, we investigated subsidence, sedimentation, and glacial erosion in the Ross Sea. These data image a smooth, tilted and laterally continuous (>200 km) unconformity interpreted as metamorphic basement eroded by waves and subaerial processes. At ~34 Ma, much of the central proto-Ross Sea’s ground surface was composed of this basement.\nIn the western Ross Sea, a pre-30 Ma trough >50 km-wide cuts downward as much as 2 km into acoustically reflective strata. These reflective strata are interpreted to be 80-55 Ma syn-rift sedimentary rocks cut by faults. The trough fill is unfaulted; therefore erosion postdates the rifting. Using the current depth of the top basement and the age of initial aggrading marine strata, post-~30 Ma to post-~25 Ma subsidence rates are easily calculated. Projecting these rates using tilts of 30 Ma and younger strata, Central Trough has subsided 2-3 km since 30 Ma, similar to published values for this trough. The unconformity flooring the trough currently is as deep as 6 km with shallower sills downflow. If backstripping and thermal modeling also indicate a reverse gradient of the trough axis at ~34 Ma and ~55 Ma, the erosion must have been due to ~34 Ma ice. In the event that the trough was eroded soon after cessation of rifting at 55 Ma, then total differential subsidence might explain both the current depth and reverse gradient. Projecting the known rates of sediment deposition between ~25 Ma and ~30 Ma, the trough fill can easily be post-~34 Ma. Therefore, one of the possible explanations is that the erosional trough comprising deep Central Trough may be evidence of the first advance of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. However, since we have not yet done the modeling, we cannot yet rule out the trough being an early Cenozoic river valley or a submarine canyon.",

            "abstract": "The Western United States relies heavily on forested mountain watersheds for its water supply. These same watersheds are nearly uniformly managed using fire suppression, which has persisted over the past century. The dense vegetation resulting from fire suppression has the potential to increase the risk of catastrophic fires, damage ecosystems, and reduce water yield from these watersheds. Despite the ubiquity of fire suppression, the hydrologic effects of restoring the pre-European fire regime in forested watersheds are unknown, as the vast majority of water-fire studies focus on severe, infrequent events. The Illilouette Creek Basin, within Yosemite National Park, has been allowed to revert to a natural fire regime over the last forty years. The results presented here form part of the first hydrological analysis of the effects of restoring a natural fire regime in a Western U.S. watershed.\nAn aerial photography record dating from the time when the new fire regime was instituted shows that the repeated fires in the Illilouette Basin have converted many forested areas into meadows, shrublands, and wetlands. Preliminary measures of soil moisture and plant water potential during summer suggest that the changes in vegetation type are associated with changes in plant water availability, allowing the aerial photography record to be interpreted in hydrological terms. With reduced leaf area to support transpiration and interception of winter snows, the new vegetation cover in the Illilouette Basin is hypothesized to increase water storage and yields, and may be associated with observed increases in the runoff ratio from the Illilouette Basin.",

            "abstract": "Coastal and inland waters represent a diverse set of resources that support natural habitat and provide valuable ecosystem services to the human population. Conventional techniques to monitor water quality using in situ sensors and laboratory analysis of water samples can be very time- and cost-intensive. Alternatively, remote sensing techniques offer better spatial coverage and temporal resolution to accurately characterize the dynamic and unique water quality parameters. Existing remote sensing ocean color products, such as the water quality proxy chlorophyll-a, are based on ocean derived bio-optical models that are primarily calibrated in Case 1 type waters. These traditional models fail to work when applied in turbid (Case 2 type), coastal waters due to spectral interference from other associated color producing agents such as colored dissolved organic matter and suspended sediments. In this work, we introduce a novel technique for the predictive modeling of chlorophyll-a using a multivariate-based approach applied to in situ hyperspectral radiometric data collected from the coastal waters of Long Bay, South Carolina. This method uses a partial least-squares regression model to identify prominent wavelengths that are more sensitive to chlorophyll-a relative to other associated color-producing agents. The new model was able to explain 80% of the observed chlorophyll-a variability in Long Bay with RMSE = 2.03 µg/L. This approach capitalizes on the spectral advantage gained from current and future hyperspectral sensors, thus providing a more robust predicting model. This enhanced mode of water quality monitoring in marine environments will provide insight to point-sources and problem areas that may contribute to a decline in water quality. The utility of this tool is in its versatility to a diverse set of coastal waters and its use by coastal and fisheries managers with regard to recreation, regulation, economic and public health purposes.",

            "abstract": "The Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) on board Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) was launched on October 28, 2011. It consist of three instruments: Nadir Mapper (NM), Nadir Profiler (NP) and Limb Profiler (LP). The OMPS LP instrument is designed to provide high vertical resolution ozone profiles from measurements of the scattered solar radiation in the 290-1000 nm spectral range. It collected its first Earth limb measurement in January 10, 2012, and continues to provide daily global measurements of ozone profiles from the cloud top up to 60 km.\nThis presentation will describe the recent changes implemented for the OMPS LP V2.0 ozone product and discuss the results of comparisons with co-located measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), and from ozone sondes and lidar measurements.\nIn general, the agreement with MLS is within 5% over an altitude range of 20-40 km. Above 40 km, the difference is ~10% in the southern and northern hemispheres. In the lower stratosphere above the tropopause, the lack of aerosol corrections is evident, where OMPS is 5-10% smaller than MLS in the tropics and northern hemisphere. The difference is smaller in the southern hemisphere, where the retrieval algorithm is less sensitive to aerosol due to the large single-scattering angle and small aerosol scattering phase function.",

Dust emission rate in North Africa in the 1950s was 9 times lower than during 1980-84 (Mukhopadhyay and Kreycik, 2008). We also know that dust is an important ice nuclei. Therefore, it is important to know how the variability of dust could affect the climate through acting as ice nuclei. A state-of-art GCM with double moment cloud microphysics scheme and ice nucleation treatment for dust and black carbon (BC) was employed. We focus on mixed-phase clouds for the simplicity of the study. The effect of BC as ice nuclei is also investigated.",

            "abstract": "Runoff and soil moisture biases were found by comparing fully coupled CCSM4 simulations and observations. The CLM underestimated runoff in the areas where soils have high clay content, but overestimated in the areas covered by volcanic ash soils (i.e. Andisols). Clayey soils tend to exhibit aggregation structure that prone to form macropores. Macropores enable water to flow through unsaturated soil more rapidly than it would in a soil matrix defined by Darcy’s law. The existence of macropores increases effective hydraulic conductivity, thus decreases water content in the surface soils. Without this mechanism, CLM4 may overestimate evapotranspiration and in turn underestimate runoff by retaining too much plant available water. We hypothesize that lack of macropore flow mechanism is partially responsible for the underestimation and insufficient soil porosity representation is associated with overestimation. Andisols are soils formed in volcanic ash with very high porosity (often >0.60 cm3 cm-3) and water holding capacity. The mineral soil porosity is defined by sand content in CLM and is much lower than it would have been for Andisols. CLM may retain insufficient plant available water and underestimate evapotranspiration therefore partitioning too much to runoff. We propose more detailed soil maps in the CLM to improve the representations of soil physical properties that are critical in the terrestrial water modeling.",

            "abstract": "The expansion of woody shrubs throughout much of the Arctic in recent decades is a common observation in response to climate change. However, we lack a complete understanding of how woody shrubs differ physiologically from neighboring species and how these differences may confer competitive advantages to woody shrubs as the climate continues to change. At a site in West Greenland, we combined detailed leaf physiological measurements with stable isotope analysis of plant leaf material, xylem water and soil water to elucidate the processes governing seasonal carbon (C) gain in the two dominant plant species at our study site: Betula nana and Poa pratensis. We hypothesized that cooler, drier soils beneath the Betula canopy would result in greater drought sensitivity during times of high atmospheric demand (i.e. greater water vapor pressure deficit; VPD), which would manifest in reduced leaf carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C), reduced stomatal conductance (gs) and a negative relationship between leaf Δ13C and Δ18O in accordance with the dual-isotope conceptual model. Data collected over two consecutive growing seasons, however, revealed greater drought sensitivity in Poa, which displayed a dramatic reduction in Amax and gs during periods of high VPD, along with reduced leaf Δ13C. Additionally, leaf Δ13C and Δ18O were negatively correlated in Poa, suggesting strong stomatal influence on Δ13C. Conversely, we found no relationship between leaf Δ13C and Δ18O in Betula, indicating that seasonal variation in Δ13C may have been driven primarily by changes in photosynthesis. Our results suggest that, although Poa maintains greater average leaf-level photosynthesis, this species is more susceptible to drought than Betula. Meanwhile, it may be that Betula employs a strategy to avoid drought stress and maintain steady, yet conservative, C gain. This strategy may enable growth to continue during warm and dry conditions, conferring a competitive advantage for Betula in a changing climate. While our data clearly show greater drought-sensitivity in Poa and a potential advantage for Betula, these results are limited to two seasons and two species. However, we feel that our evidence is strong enough to spur future research into plant-water-carbon relations as it relates to shrub expansion in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "We present initial results of a study of comenditic to trachytic melt inclusions from the Millennium Eruption (ME) of Paektu volcano (AD 946; VEI≥7; 25 km3 DRE). Paektu volcano (aka Changbaishan) is a remote and poorly studied intraplate stratovolcano whose 37 km2 caldera is bisected by the political border between North Korea and China, limiting studies of its proximal deposits. ME magmas are predominantly phenocryst-poor (≤3 vol%) comendites plus a volumetrically minor late-stage, more phenocryst-rich (10-20 vol%) trachyte. Sizeable (100-500 µm diameter) glassy but bubble-bearing melt inclusions are widespread in anorthoclase and hedenbergite phenocrysts, as well as in rarer quartz and fayalite phenocrysts. Comparing the relative enrichments of incompatible volatile and non-volatile elements in melt inclusions along a liquid line of descent shows decreasing volatile/Zr ratios suggesting the partitioning of volatiles into a fluid phase. This suggests that current gas-yield estimates (Horn & Schminke, 2000) for the ME, based on the petrologic method (difference in volatiles between melt inclusions and matrix glass), could be severe underestimates. Establishing the composition and quantity of a pre-eruptive fluid phase is the primary goal of this study and has implications for eruption triggering and for modeling the climatic effects of one of the largest eruptions in the last 10,000 years. Including results from Horne and Schminke (2000), melt inclusions from within a single pumice fall unit show a wide range in dissolved volatile contents and magma chemistries. Concentrations of H2O are moderate (2–3.5 wt% via FTIR), with Cl and F ranging from 500–4600 ppm and 1100–4700 ppm (via EPMA). CO2 is below the detection limit of 2 ppm (FTIR with N2 purge) in bubble-bearing melt inclusions, but is detectable (≤56 ppm) in melt inclusions homogenized at 100 MPa and 850–900 °C for ~30 min (conditions also leading to reduction of dissolved H2O to 0.6–2 wt%). Characterization of a co-existing fluid phase in ME magmas is being investigated with further melt inclusion analyses, mineral-melt-fluid equilibrium calculations, and phase equilibrium experiments on fluid-saturated liquid lines of descent and on volatile solubilities of the ME trachyite-comendite suite.",

Wellbore alteration has been observed under supercritical CO2 exposure condition in previous experimental and field studies. One such study also showed that a reduction in both tensile and compressive strength when specimens were exposed to CO2-O2 gases at 50°C and 85°C as compared to specimens only exposed to CO2 gases; secondary mineral precipitation (SMP) and high temperature was speculated as the causes. In this study, experiments were designed to justify how different variables influenced SMP, and to quantify its effect on mechanical properties of Class H Portland cement. Chemical and mechanical alterations of Class H cement were investigated to verify the impact of SMP during this process. Cement prisms were investigated under different scenarios including influence of brine composition (simulated Mt. Simon basin), high temperature (up to 85 °C); high pressure (up to 4200psi); CO2 sequestration; CO2-O2 co-sequestration. Modulus of rupture and compressive strength of the cement prisms were tested under each scenario and several exposure durations. Initial results indicated that high temperature and synthetic brine composition had a negative influence on compressive strength. Pore solution analysis was conducted to examine the ionic exchange and geochemical alteration between the cement and brine. Specimens decreased in sodium and potassium, significantly increased in calcium, and slightly increased in sulfate after CO2 injected into system. Scanning electronic microscopy visually identified SMP and the alteration depth of specimens exposed to CO2 gas and CO2-O2 gases with time of exposure, respectively. The predicted degree of SMP, change of pore solution, and mechanic strength based on temperature, pressure, brine composition, and gas exposure conditions will be presented.",

Additional HSRL-2 data products include profiles of aerosol type, mixed layer depth, and aerosol microphysical parameters (e.g. effective radius, concentration). The HSRL-2 and WRF-Chem aerosol profiles are compared along the aircraft flight tracks.\nHSRL-2 profiles acquired during the NASA Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from COlumn and VERtically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) mission over Houston during September 2013 are compared with the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System global model, version 5 (GEOS-5) profiles. In addition to comparing backscatter and extinction profiles, the fraction of aerosol extinction and optical thickness from various aerosol species from GEOS-5 are compared with aerosol extinction and optical thickness contributed by aerosol types derived from HSRL-2 data.\nWe also compare aerosol profiles modeled by GEOS-5 with those measured by the airborne LaRC DIAL/HSRL instrument during August and September 2013 when it was deployed on the NASA DC-8 for the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) mission. DIAL/HSRL measured extinction (532 nm), backscatter (532 and 1064 nm), and depolarization profiles (532 and 1064 nm) in both nadir and zenith directions during long transects over the continental United States. DIAL/HSRL measurements acquired during SEAC4RS allow comparisons with GEOS-5 simulations of forest fire smoke over the western U.S. The fraction of aerosol extinction attributed to dust derived from the DIAL/HSRL depolarization measurements are compared with the corresponding GEOS-5 dust simulations.",

We fitted the RHESSI spectra at different times with a power-law plus isothermal component. We then used the fitted real-time spectral parameters of nonthermal electrons as the input to the RADYN radiative hydrodynamic code (Carlsson et al, 1992, 1996; Allred et al, 2005) to simulate the low-chromospheric response to collisional heating by energetic electrons.

MVP will feed science, payload, and operational lessons learned to the development of a real-time, short-duration lunar polar volatiles prospecting mission. MVP achieves these goals through a simulated lunar rover mission to investigate the composition and distribution of surface and subsurface volatiles in a natural and a priori unknown environment within the Mojave Desert, improving our understanding of how to find, characterize, and access volatiles on the Moon.\nThe MVP field site is the Mojave Desert, selected for its low, naturally occurring water abundance. The Mojave typically has on the order of 2-6% water, making it a suitable lunar analog for this field test. MVP uses the Near Infrared and Visible Spectrometer Subsystem (NIRVSS), Neutron Spectrometer Subsystem (NSS), and a downward facing GroundCam camera on the KREX-2 rover to investigate the relationship between the distribution of volatiles and soil crust variation. Through this investigation, we mature robotic in situ instruments and concepts of instrument operations, improve ground software tools for real time science, and carry out publishable research on the water cycle and its connection to geomorphology and mineralogy in desert environments.\nA lunar polar rover mission is unlike prior space missions and requires a new concept of operations. The rover must navigate 3-5 km of terrain and examine multiple sites in in just ~6 days. Operational decisions must be made in real time, requiring constant situational awareness, data analysis and rapid turnaround decision support tools. This presentation will focus on the first science results and operational architecture findings from the MVP field deployment relevant to a lunar polar rover mission.",

            "abstract": "3D process geological models, whether for carbonate or sedimentological systems, have been proposed for modeling realistic subsurface heterogeneity. The problem with such forward process models is that they are not constrained to any subsurface data whether to wells or geophysical surveys. We propose a new method for realistic geological modeling of complex heterogeneity by hybridizing 3D process modeling of geological deposition with conditioning by means of a novel multiple-point geostatistics (MPS) technique termed image quilting (IQ). Image quilting is a pattern-based techniques that stiches together patterns extracted from training images to generate stochastic realizations that look like the training image. In this paper, we illustrate how 3D process model realizations can be used as training images in image quilting. To constrain the realization to seismic data we first interpret each facies in the geophysical data. These interpretation, while overly smooth and not reflecting finer scale variation are used as auxiliary variables in the generation of the image quilting realizations. To condition to well data, we first perform a kriging of the well data to generate a kriging map and kriging variance. The kriging map is used as additional auxiliary variable while the kriging variance is used as a weight given to the kriging derived auxiliary variable. We present an application to a giant offshore reservoir. Starting from seismic advanced attribute analysis and sedimentological interpretation, we build the 3D sedimentological process based model and use it as non-stationary training image for conditional image quilting.",

            "abstract": "Although evidence suggests that climate change will negatively impact water resources and hence diarrheal disease rates in the developing world, there is uncertainty surrounding prior studies. This is due to the complexity of the pathways by which climate impacts diarrhea rates making it difficult to develop interventions. Therefore, our goal was to develop a mechanistic systems approach that incorporates the complex climate, human, engineered and water systems to relate climate change to diarrhea rates under future climate scenarios.\nTo do this, we developed an agent-based model (ABM). Our agents are households and children living in Hubli-Dharward, India. The model was informed with 15 months of weather, water quality, ethnographic and diarrhea incidence data. The model's front end is a stochastic weather simulator incorporating 15 global climate models to simulate rainfall and temperature. The water quality available to agents (residents) on a model \"day\" is a function of the simulated day's weather and is fully validated with field data. As with the field data, as the ambient temperature increases or it rains, the quality of water available to residents in the model deteriorates. The propensity for an resident to get diarrhea is calculated with an integrated Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment model with uncertainty simulated with a bootstrap method. Other factors include hand-washing, improved water sources, household water treatment and improved sanitation.\nThe benefits of our approach are as follows:\nOur mechanistic method allows us to develop scientifically derived adaptation strategies.\nWe can quantitatively link climate scenarios with diarrhea incidence over long time periods.\nWe can explore the complex climate and water system dynamics, rank risk factor importance, examine a broad range of scenarios and identify tipping points.\nOur approach is modular and expandable such that new datasets can be integrated to study climate impacts on a larger scale.\nOur results indicate that climate change will have a serious effect on diarrhea incidence in the region. However, adaptation strategies including more reliable water supplies and household water treatment can mitigate these impacts. ",

            "abstract": "El Salvador has 20 potentially active volcanoes, four of which have erupted in the last 100 years. Since San Vicente Volcano has had no historic eruptions, monitoring is not a high priority; especially given the current eruptive crisis at San Miguel Volcano. Though probability of eruptive hazards remains low at San Vicente, it is arguably one of the most hazardous volcanoes in the country due to rainfall-induced landslides and debris-flow risk. At least 250 deaths occurred in November 2009 from landslides and debris flows triggered by Hurricane Ida. This disaster caused the Universidad de El Salvador – Facultad Multidisciplinaria Paracentral (UES-FMP, San Vicente, El Salvador) to partner with governmental and nongovernmental organizations (including the U.S. Peace Corps, U.S. Fulbright Program, Korean International Cooperation Agency, Protección Civil and the Centro de Protección para Desastres (CEPRODE)) to focus its faculty and student research toward hazard monitoring and risk studies. Newly established monitoring efforts include: measurement of surface cracks and localized rainfall by Protección Civil and local residents using crude extensometers and rain gauges; installation of six weather stations that operate within the most at-risk municipalities; seismic refraction surveys to better characterize stratigraphy and seasonal water table changes; and most recently, a USAID/NSF-funded initiative partnered with the UES-FMP to monitor seasonal hydrologic conditions related to flooding and groundwater recharge. The information from these initiatives is now used to communicate current conditions and warnings through a network of two-way radios established by CEPRODE and Protección Civil. Representatives from the multi-institutional team also communicate the data to authorities who make better-informed decisions regarding warnings and evacuations, as well as determine suitable areas for population relocation in the event of a crisis. Data will eventually be used to model and forecast potential hazard events.",

            "abstract": "Continental plateaus are reservoirs of excess gravitational energy that can influence the late-stage geodynamic evolution of adjacent orogenic wedges. In the central Himalaya (80-88˚E), most late Cenozoic deformation has involved roughly N-S shortening within the Himalayan orogenic wedge. Within this region, all 1976-2014 Mw 5 and larger earthquakes had thrust mechanisms associated with slip along major arc-parallel structures within or at the base of the orogenic wedge. In contrast, the segment of the wedge between 88˚E and 91˚E – including easternmost Nepal, the Sikkim region of India, and Bhutan – is characterized by a complex deformation field that includes thrusting on arc-parallel wedge structures but also transcurrent faulting at high angles to the Himalayan arc. In fact, over the same 1976-2014 period, all but one of the Mw 5 and larger earthquakes in this region had transcurrent fault mechanisms, mostly consistent with dextral strike-slip along NW-striking faults. We refer to this region as the central-eastern Himalayan transition zone. Although direct field evidence of the surface breaks of these faults has not been established, the orientations of nodal planes of large earthquakes, as well as alignments of microearthquake arrays, suggest that they may connect northward to a discontinuous family of arc-parallel faults – most showing evidence for oblique slip, with variable normal and dextral-transcurrent components – which we interpret as the long-term structural manifestation of the boundary between the distinctive modern strain fields of Tibet (E-W extension) and the central Himalaya (N-S shortening). In addition, transverse faults of the central-eastern Himalayan transition zone may project southward, beneath sediments near the Ganges and Bhramaputra confluence, as dextral tear faults linking the active thrust front of the central Himalaya to the active thrust front of the Shillong Plateau in northeastern India. We hypothesize that the broadening of the zone of Neogene-Quaternary convergent deformation by a factor of two or more between the central Himalaya and eastern Himalaya-Shillong region is a signature of southeastward flow of Tibet driven by local gravitaitonal potential energy gradients, substantially modifying the character of the Himalayan orogenic wedge.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the importance of transhydrogenases in determining lipid D/H ratios using the model organism Methylobacterium extorquens.\nTranshydrogenases are a class of oxidoreductase enzymes that are responsible for transferring reducing power between intracellular pools of pyrimidine nucleotides. At least three classes of transhydrogenases have been described: i) the proton translocating transhydrogenase PntAB, which is known to carry an extremely large hydrogen isotope effect; ii) the soluble energy-independent transhydrogenase UdhA, which is present in many proteobacteria; iii) the electron-bifurcating transhydrogenase NfnAB, present in many anaerobic bacteria and archaea.\nIn wild-type Methylobacterium grown on C1 compounds such as methanol or methylamine, NADPH is produced by methylene tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) dehydrogenase during the cytoplasmic oxidation of formaldehyde to formate. Lipids produced under these conditions are are enriched in deuterium relative to media water by ~80 permil. We compare this to an engineered mutant (EM) in which the H4MPT pathway has been inactivated and replaced by the non-orthologous glutathione-dependendent pathway from Paracoccus denitrificans that produces NADH but not NADPH. In the EM strain, NADPH is limiting. To obtain sufficient reducing power for biosynthesis, pntAB is upregulated and transhydrogenase activity is increased. Lipids in this strain are depleted in deuterium relative to media water by ~200 permil. In several evolved strains derived from EM, transhydrogenase expression is higher than in EM, correlating with restoration of NAD(H) and NADP(H) pools towards the wild type, and lipids in these strains are enriched in deuterium relative to the EM.\nWe compare these results to a pntAB deletion mutant which has been complemented with pntAB on an inducible promoter, allowing a direct comparison between transhydrogenase expression levels, NADPH/NADP ratios, and lipid D/H ratios.",

            "abstract": "The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the University New Brunswick (Canada) and the University of Hawaii have developed a concept to provide open ocean tsunami wave height estimates using very accurate measurements of absolute total electron content (TEC) perturbations. Ionosphere-derived tsunami wave height estimates from our CubeSat for Natural-Hazard Estimation With Ionospheric Sciences (CNEWS) mission will refine the tsunami source energy calculation and improve the tsunami scale calculation for a localized region. As a secondary science objective, transmitting impulsive HF/VHF (10-40 MHz) transmissions through the ionosphere will provide in-situ geomagnetic disturbance measurements, which allow for discrimination between tsunami-induced signatures and space-weather-related fluctuations.\nNASA has invested several millions of dollars in the development of a tsunami warning system based on geodetic measurements from ground-based GPS stations. Leveraging this investment by simultaneously using ionospheric measurement from this GPS network for the detection of tsunamis represents a significant step forward. GPS ionospheric imaging is limited, however, by the slowly changing satellite geometry and its weak absolute TEC resolution (about 3 TECU). It has also been shown that GPS ionospheric imaging alone cannot distinguish between space weather fluctuations and those due to natural hazards. The very precise ionospheric measurements generated by CNEWS are expected to provide a quasi-static image of tsunami ionospheric signatures that we will use in an advanced model inversion technique to estimate tsunami wave heights at 10 cm (one sigma) uncertainty. The geomagnetic field strength resolution is also a key constraint for discriminating between natural hazards and space weather effects. HF/VHF impulses can resolve absolute TEC measurements at the 0.02 TECU level and geomagnetic field strength may be measured at 50 nT resolution.",

This specification represents a dynamical adjustment to the raw SAT field, which reduces ensemble spread by accounting for the influence of spontaneously-occurring atmospheric circulation changes unique to each ensemble member (EM). When applied independently to the simulated Northern Hemisphere (NH) SAT field from individual EMs, the methodology yields a dynamical adjustment that accounts for nearly 50% of the cold season SAT variance in each EM, validating a previous application of PLS regression to observations. Dynamical adjustment is also applied to SAT trends across the large IC ensemble, enabling the attribution of multi-decadal trends to external forcing and internal variability as well as dynamical and radiative/thermodynamic processes. When applied to the ensemble of SAT and SLP trends over a multi-decadal mid-21st Century reference interval, the methodology yields a dynamical adjustment that explains over 75% of the intra-ensemble variance of the NHSAT warming trend and accounts for about 5% of the ensemble-mean NHSAT warming trend. This methodological framework may be applied to other large IC ensembles, other climatological variables, and across a wider variety of time scales in order to investigate the role of internal variability in modulating the magnitude and patterns of historical and projected climate change.",

            "abstract": "The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has fourteen stations in the Barnett Shale that take ambient concentration measurements of forty-six non-methane hydrocarbons. We gathered all measurements for the period of October 16-31, 2013, and applied Lagrangian trajectories to each air parcel that was measured, to achieve a domain filling of the Barnett region. Regular grids of concentration values for each VOC at each hour were constructed, then implemented into an unsupervised machine learning classification. This self-organizing map assigned classification numbers to each grid cell in each hourly grid, where a class number essentially corresponded with a signature of representative concentration values for all forty-six hydrocarbons. Two hundred was determined to be an appropriate number of classes for this classification. Similarly, we applied a self-organizing map to the wind speed and resultant direction measurements recorded at each station. This classification grouped together the hours in our time frame into six distinct wind regimes. Concentration class numbers were analyzed for different wind regimes, and for the whole time period. A grouping of classes with numbers in the middle-to-upper forties was discovered near and downwind of oil and gas facilities. The validity and accuracy of this method was confirmed by performing a site-by-site comparison against an independent study which analyzed the VOC concentrations at three TCEQ stations. This opened the door to expand the dataset to include other ground-based measurements of both non-methane VOC and methane concentrations, to further trace back emission sources.",

            "abstract": "Hurricane Sandy was the most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season. It developed from a tropical depression on October 22 and became a Category three storm at its peak intensity on October 25. Early on October 29 Sandy became a post-tropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds and made landfall along the New Jersey seashores. While all NWP models correctly predicted that the storm will strike the New Jersey Seashore within 72 hours of its landfall, most models struggled to predict its path at longer forecast lead times. The United States GFS (Global Forecast Systems) predicted a northeast instead of northwest path from the forecast cycles before October 25 and a path biased toward the north from the cycles before October 27. This study investigates the impact of GFS biases in environmental flow and surface forcing on the predicted Sandy storm path and intensity. A set of sensitivity experiments were carried out to explore the cause of forecast biases. In particular, the sensitivity of forecasts to model resolution and different physics parameterization options were examined.",

To assess the relative impact of errors in different meteorological forcings, many studies have conducted sensitivity analyses where errors (e.g., bias) are imposed on one forcing at a time and changes in model output are compared. Although straightforward, this approach only considers simplistic error structures and cannot quantify interactions in different meteorological forcing errors (i.e., it assumes a linear system). Here we employ the Sobol’ method of global sensitivity analysis, which allows us to test how co-existing errors in six meteorological forcings (i.e., air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, incoming shortwave and longwave radiation) impact specific modeled snow variables (i.e., peak snow water equivalent, snowmelt rates, and snow disappearance timing). Using the Sobol’ framework across a large number of realizations (>100000 simulations annually at each site), we test how (1) the type (e.g., bias vs. random errors), (2) distribution (e.g., uniform vs. normal), and (3) magnitude (e.g., instrument uncertainty vs. field uncertainty) of forcing errors impact key outputs from a physically based snow model (the Utah Energy Balance). We also assess the role of climate by conducting the analysis at sites in maritime, intermountain, continental, and tundra snow zones. For all outputs considered, results show that (1) biases in forcing data are more important than random errors, (2) the choice of error distribution can enhance the importance of specific forcings, and (3) the level of uncertainty considered dictates the relative importance of forcings. While the relative importance of forcings varied with snow variable and climate, the results broadly identify the need to reduce uncertainties in precipitation, longwave radiation, and shortwave radiation.",

            "abstract": "The ongoing development of constellations of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites with short repeat time acquisitions allows to explore the behavior of active faults with an unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. The improvement from monthly to daily repeat times sheds a new light on the dynamics of near-surface fault creep along continental faults, which has been shown to exhibit various temporal behaviors, from persistent slow silent slip to discrete episodes of aseismic slip. Along the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), an 80 km-long section is creeping at least since the 1944, M7.3 earthquake near Ismetpasa, Turkey. Recent geodetic measurements suggest an average creep rate of about half the total slip rate accommodated by the NAF (8±3 mm/yr vs. 22±3 mm/yr). In addition, an effective bi-modal distribution of frictional properties along fault dip (rate-strengthening from the surface to 5-7 km-depth and rate-weakening down to the locking depth) can explain the persistent creep rate and the extent of past ruptures. We take advantage of the dense set of SAR images acquired by the Cosmo-SkyMed™ (ASI) constellation over the creeping section of the NAF to quantify, with a high spatial and temporal resolution, the distribution of aseismic slip along strike and its evolution between August 2013 and June 2014. We compute 1000+ interferograms from 350+ radar acquisitions over 7 tracks using the ISCE software (JPL). We use the Generic InSAR Analysis Toolbox (GIAnT) and the PyAPS library to correct interferograms from the propagation delays due to the stratification of the troposphere, predicted using the ERA-Interim (ECMWF) re-analysis. We use the New Small Baseline (NSBAS) method to derive the spatial and temporal evolution of the near-fault displacements independently for each track. Our results suggest the fault does not creep steadily over the 2013-2014 period but rather releases strain through discrete aseismic events we refer to as bursts of creep. In particular, we identify one major burst, equivalent to a M5.0 earthquake that took place in a maximum of 8 days releasing the equivalent of 1 year of creep at that location. The observed bursts of creep suggest new exploration of the mechanical properties of the fault zone during the interseismic period is needed along the creeping section of the NAF.",

            "abstract": "We have developed and tested an iterative spectral solution technique for flexure of thin elastic plates having continuously varying rigidity in both horizontal directions. This novel method was used to model oceanic lithosphere bending seaward of deep-sea trenches. In our formulation, the various mechanical loads that lead to plate flexure are simulated as applied bending moments and vertical forces acting on an arbitrary trench planform. Another input required by our model is a grid of flexural rigidity covering the plate domain laterally. We developed a procedure for estimating the rigidity from the plate age and curvature. With the loading and rigidity as input, the iterative spectral method gives the plate deflection as output. The plate curvature is then recalculated to obtain updated values of the rigidity, from which a new deflection grid is produced. These computations proceed iteratively until convergence is achieved. For our parameter estimation problem, we sought to find values of applied moments and vertical loads that produce a plate deflection surface which matches the seafloor bathymetry from ship soundings and marine gravity from satellite altimetry. By referring to a yield strength envelope formulation, we can take the modeled deflection surface and predict the lateral distribution of brittle failure at the bent areas of the plate. If we consider optimally-oriented faults according to an assumed value of the friction coefficient, we find that the upper layer of the plate undergoing brittle failure deepens with increasing proximity to the trench. We conducted tests for our modeling approach on an outer rise region adjacent to the South American Trench. Our preliminary results suggest a correspondence between the prevalence of surface fractures observed in high-resolution bathymetry with model predictions of brittle failure extending more than 10 kilometers deep into the plate.",

            "abstract": "The topography of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and the structure and composition of the D” region are essential to understand the interaction between the earth's mantle and core. A variety of seismic data-processing techniques have been used to detect and measure travel-times and amplitudes of weak short-period teleseismic body-waves phases that interact with CMB and D”, which is crucial to constrain properties of the lowermost mantle at short wavelengths. Major challenges in enhancing these observations are: (1) increasing signal-to-noise ratio of target phases and (2) isolating them from unwanted neighboring phases. Seismic array-processing can address these problems by combining signals from groups of seismometers and exploiting information that allows to separate the coherent signals from the noise.\nHere, we focus on the study of the Pacific large-low shear-velocity province (LLSVP) and surrounding areas using differential travel-times and amplitude ratios of the P and PcP phases, and their depth phases. We particularly design scale-dependent slowness filters that do not compromise time-space resolution. This is a local delay-and-sum (i.e. slant-stack) approach implemented in the time-scale domain using the wavelet transform to enhance time-space resolution (i.e. reduce array aperture). We group stations from USArray and other nearby networks, and from Hi-Net and F-net in Japan, to define many overlapping local arrays. The aperture of each array varies mainly according (1) to the space resolution target and (2) to the slowness resolution required to isolate the target phases at each period. Once the target phases are well separated, we measure their differential travel-times and amplitude ratios, and we project these to the CMB. In this process, we carefully analyze and, when possible and significant, correct for the main sources of bias, i.e., mantle heterogeneities, earthquake mislocation and intrinsic attenuation.\nWe illustrate our approach in a series of regional studies of the CMB and D” using P and PcP observations with unprecedented resolution, for events with magnitude Mw>5.4 and distances up to 80 degrees. Regions sampled span Alaska and the north of Canada, inside and outside of the northwest border of the Pacific LLSVP, and up to its eastern border from central America.",

            "abstract": "Macropores forming a continuous pathway between the soil surface and subsurface drains favour the transport of many contaminants from agricultural fields to surface waters. The smoke injection method presented by Shipitalo and Gibbs (2000) used for demonstrating and quantifying such pathways has been further developed and used on a drained Danish sandy loam. In order to identify the preferential pathways to drains, smoke was injected in three 1.15 m deep tile drains (total drain length 93 m), and smoke emitting macropores (SEMP) at the soil surface were counted and characterized as producing either strong or weak plumes compared to reference plumes from 3 and 6 mm wide tubes. In the two situations investigated in the present study – an early spring and an autumn situation, smoke only penetrated the soil surface layer via earthworm burrows located in a 1.0 m wide belt directly above the drain lines. However, it is known from previous studies that desiccation fractures in a dry summer situation also can contribute to the smoke pattern. The distance between SEMP measured along the drain lines was on average 0.46 m whereas the average spacing between SEMP with strong plumes was 2.3 m. Ponded water was applied in 6 cm wide rings placed above 52 burrows including 17 reference burrows which did not emit smoke. Thirteen pathways in the soil were examined using dye tracer and profile excavation. SEMP with strong plumes marked the entrance of highly efficient transport pathways conducting surface applied water and dye tracer into the drain. However, no single burrow was traced all the way from the surface into the drain, the dye patterns branched off in a network of other macropores. Water infiltration rates were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in SEMP with strong plumes (average rate: 247 mL min-1 n = 19) compared to SEMP with weak plumes (average rate: 87 mL min-1 n = 16) and no plumes (average rate: 56 mL min-1 n = 17). The results suggest that the smoke injection method is useful for identification of potentially efficient pathways for surface applied contaminants to drains and surface waters, pathways being associated primarily with unevenly distributed SEMP producing strong smoke plumes.",

            "abstract": "The Columbia River, located in the northwestern United States with headwaters in Canada (Pacific Northwest), is intensely managed for hydropower generation, irrigation, flood control, ecosystem services (particularly salmonids), navigation, and recreation. Effects of anthropogenic climate change already manifest themselves in the Pacific Northwest through reduced winter snow accumulation at lower elevations and earlier spring melt. As the climate warms, the Columbia River, whose flow regime is heavily dependent on seasonal snow melt, is likely to experience significant changes in the timing of its seasonal hydrograph and possibly in total flow volume. We report on a new study co-funded by the Bonneville Power Administration to update and enhance an existing climate change streamflow data set developed by the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group in 2009-2010. Our new study is based on the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Version 5 (CMIP5). In contrast to earlier studies, we are using a suite of three hydrologic models, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, the Unified Land Model and the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System, each implemented at 1/16 degree (~6 km) over the Pacific Northwest. In addition, we will use multiple statistical downscaling methods based on the output from a subset of 10 CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs). The use of multiple hydrologic models, downscaling methods and GCMs is motivated by the need to assess the impact of methodological choices in the modeling process on projected changes in Columbia River flows. We discuss the implementation of the three hydrologic models as well as our development of a glacier model for VIC, which is intended to better represent the effects of climate change on streamflows from the Columbia River headwaters region. Finally, we report on our application of a new auto-calibration method that uses an inverse routing scheme to develop spatially-distributed runoff fields from naturalized flows at gauge locations. This allows us to calibrate the hydrologic models at the level of the individual grid cell rather than sub-basin.",

For example, NE CSC researchers are analyzing the effect of climate change on the timing and volume of seasonal and annual streamflows and the concomitant effects on ecological and cultural resources; developing techniques to monitor tree range dynamics as affected by natural disturbances which can enable adaptation of projected climate impacts; studying the effects of changes in the frequency and magnitude of drought and stream temperature on brook trout habitats, spatial distribution and population persistence; and conducting assessments of northeastern regional climate projections and high-resolution downscaling.

            "abstract": "The effect of AMOC variations on SST, and climate in general, is a subject of intense studies. One important aspect of this connection is whether the AMOC impacts are localized in the Northern hemisphere or extend to the Southern hemisphere as well. In particular, the Atlantic SST dipole index, designed to reflect the interhemispheric seesaw changes in sea surface temperatures, has been proposed to approximate AMOC variations over the duration of the instrumental temperature record. Using historical and control simulations of the CMIP5 dataset, here we investigate whether this index provides a good proxy for AMOC variability on decadal to centennial timescales and whether in fact the SST response on these timescales is interhemispheric in nature or centered more on the North Atlantic. In parallel we estimate the overall sensitivity of North Atlantic SSTs to AMOC variations. We find that indeed the power spectra of AMOC variations and the Atlantic dipole index share common spectral peaks in many models, and the two indices typically correlate with coefficients ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 with a few year lead. However, even for the models with the highest correspondence between the AMOC and the Atlantic dipole, the correlation between the two is mainly controlled by SST variations in the North Atlantic. Taking into consideration the South Atlantic SST does not improve this correlation, and in many cases makes it significantly worse. We conclude that on decadal to centennial timescales AMOC variations mainly affects the North Atlantic, with the SST sensitivity of the North Atlantic SST given by the CMIP5 multi-model average of about 0.3oC per 1Sv of AMOC change. However, on average AMOC variations explain only 30% of variability associated with the simulated Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).",

            "abstract": "Extreme weather events, such as heat and cold waves, droughts, and floods, have substantial social and economic impacts. Whether these extreme events are related to one of the prominent components of climate change --- Arctic Amplification (AA)--- is controversial. The hypothesis proposed by Francis and Vavrus (2012) is that a reduced meridional temperature gradient owing to AA will cause a weaker and wavier extratropical circulation, which will result in slower progression of weather systems and more atmospheric blocking events. To test this hypothesis we borrow the concept of \"sinuosity\" from geomorphology to measure the waviness of the boreal extratropical circulation. As applied here, sinuosity is defined as the ratio of the curvilinear length of a circumhemispheric geopotential height contour to the perimeter of its equivalent latitude, where the contour and the equivalent latitude enclose the same area. We use 500hPa daily geopotential heights from NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis and from the CESM climate model’s historical and RCP8.5 greenhouse simulations to calculate sinuosity. Observations and simulations exhibit similar annual cycles of sinuosity, with the maximum sinuosity occurring in summer and minimum sinuosity during winter. Although no long-term trend (1948-2013) in sinuosity is observed in winter (DJF) or summer (JJA), a positive linear trend has occurred since the 1980s and accelerated after 1995 at middle latitudes (winter) and high latitudes (summer). The 500hPa zonal wind is found to weaken at latitudes where sinuosity increases. The change of sinuosity and corresponding zonal wind in RCP8.5 simulations is also explored. Our study finds a strong negative correlation between observed daily sinuosity and the daily Arctic Oscillation (AO) index in all seasons. This negative correlation and the tendency of CMIP5 models to simulate a negative AO-like pattern aloft during winter in a warmer climate suggest a trend toward a wavier extratropical atmospheric circulation in the future.",

The effects of LIDs on hydrology and water quality have been indicated to be positive through much of research, showing the decrease of surface runoff volumes and pollutant loadings. However, LIDs can cause different effectiveness under a variety of conditions. In this study, the effectiveness of LIDs was assessed under various urban planning (a compact high-density urban type (UHD), a conventional medium-density urban type (UMD), and a conservational medium-density urban type (UMC)) and under various LIDs conditions (types, locations, and percent allocations of LIDs) for surface runoff, nitrate, and total phosphorus to evaluate the effectiveness of LIDs for these conditions at a development scale.\nRain gardens, rainwater harvesting systems, and permeable pavements were considered for simulations. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used and model development was performed to simulate the LIDs considered. A manual optimization was used to identify the LIDs conditions that meet both targeted reduction amounts and minimal cost. The effectiveness of LIDs was evaluated for the three urban land uses and for the optimized LIDs conditions.\nThe study demonstrated different effectiveness of LIDs under various conditions considered. Under the condition of the urban land uses, the largest reduction by LIDs occurred in the order of following land uses for all variables: in UMD land use > in UMC land use > in UHD land use. Among post-LIDs scenarios, the UHD land use represented low values for surface runoff and nitrate and the UMD land use for TP. For the LIDs optimization, the various combinations of type, location, and percent allocation for each variable changed the effectiveness of LIDs and/or caused the same effectiveness of LIDs. This study can ultimately suggest proper strategies on a watershed scale to effectively control stormwater and help regulator establish effective LID policies based on the results.",

            "abstract": "We studied the generation and extension of micro cracks during semi-brittle failure of rectangular prisms (12 mm x 6 mm x 6 mm) of Carrara marble under uniaxial compression (i.e., with no confining pressure) at temperatures ranging from 25 to 184 °C and compared these observations to existing damage models. Using a long distance microscope, we generated a series of sequential images of micro-scale grid made of square markers with sides about 7.5 mm long and spacing of 12.6 mm. The grid covered a region of 1 mm x 0.8 mm near the center of one free surface. By measuring the relative displacements of the grid markers, we generated 2 – D finite strain distribution maps at each stage of the experiment. Deformation was concentrated along cracks. To study and quantify their evolution additional filtering stage was applied. At 105 °C and 184 °C, the number and length of micro cracks increased with increasing load, and near the peak stress, they intersected and coalesced. By measuring the number and vertical dimension of the cracks intersecting the surface, we calculated a damage parameter as defined by Ashby and Sammis [1990]. In the two experiments mentioned above, the damage sustained by the samples near the peak stress was much larger than that calculated from the model. In a third experiment at room temperature, failure was very abrupt and no micro cracks were observed within the region analyzed.",

            "abstract": "Regional refinement in an atmospheric general circulation model is a new tool in atmospheric modeling. A regional high-resolution solution can be obtained without the computational cost of running a global high-resolution simulation as global climate models have increasing ability to resolve smaller spatial scales. Previous work has shown high-resolution simulations, i.e. 1/8 degree, and variable resolution utilities have resolved more fine-scale structure and mesoscale storms in the atmosphere than their low-resolution counterparts. We will describe an experiment designed to identify and study Arctic storms at two model resolutions. We used the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5, with the Spectral Element dynamical core at 1/8-degree and 1 degree horizontal resolutions to simulate the climatological year of 1850. Storms were detected using a low-pressure minima and vorticity maxima - finding algorithm. It was found the high-resolution 1/8-degree simulation had more storms in the Northern Hemisphere than the low-resolution 1-degree simulation. A variable resolution simulation with a global low resolution of 1-degree and a high-resolution refined region of 1/8 degree over a region in the Arctic is planned.

            "abstract": "For decades, scientists have struggled to understand what causes the aurora, and have developed two different theories to explain the phenomena. The magnetospheric and ground-based data necessary to test the two competing theories have only recently become available with the launch of NASA's THEMIS mission in 2007 and the Canadian Space Agency's (CSA) deployment of an all-sky imaging network. We present research testing the \"Auroral Streamer\" hypothesis given by Nishimura, Lyons, et al. in their various papers from 2010 to present. We compiled a list of all their published events (numbering 455, and covering a span from 2007 to 2011) and reviewed ground-based white- and red-light image files, THEMIS satellite bulk plasma velocity and magnetic field strength measurements, ground-based magnetometer observations, and 1-minute Auroral Electrojet (AL) index data. We visually categorized the events by auroral phenomenology, separating events with auroral streamers from those without, and analyzed the characteristics of the events with superposed epoch analyses. Although Nishimura, Lyons et al. argued that every event in their onset list constituted an \"Auroral Streamer\" onset, our results show that most events in the list are not poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs). In contrast to these previous studies, the results suggest that the \"auroral streamer\" model is not widely applicable. This is the first time these events have been analyzed with such detail, and call into question fundamental aspects of this model.",

            "abstract": "Pavilion Lake in British Columbia, Canada is an ultra-oligotrophic lake that has abundant microbialite growth. Recent research has shown that photoautotrophic microbial communities are important to modern microbialite development in Pavilion Lake. However, questions remain as to the relationship between changing light levels within the lake, variation in microbialite macro-structure, microbial consortia, and the preservation of associated biosignatures within the microbialite fabrics. The 2014 Pavilion Lake Research Project (PLRP) field program was focused on data gathering to understand these complex relationships by determining if a) light is the immediate limit to photosynthetic activity and, if so, if light is distributed around microbialites in ways that are consistent with emergent microbialite structure; and b) if at more local scales, the filamentous pink and green cyanobacterial nodular colonies identified in previous PLRP studies are centers of photosynthetic activity that create pH conditions suitable for carbonate precipitation. A diver-deployed pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer was used to collect synoptic in situ measurements of fluorescence yield and irradiance and across microbialites, focusing on comparing flat and vertical structural elements at a range of sites and depths. As well, we collected time series measurements of photosynthetic activity and irradiance at a set depth of 18 m across three different regions in Pavilion Lake. Our initial findings suggest that all microbialite surfaces are primarily light-limited regardless of depth or location within the lake. Shore based PAM fluorometry and microelectrode profiling of diver-collected samples suggest that pink and green nodules have different photosynthetic properties and pH profiles, and that nodular growth is likely to be the primary route of calcification due to the gelatinous covering the nodule creates. On-going tests for molecular signatures and isotopic shifts will allow for further examination of surface microvariation and the associated influence on microbialite development.",

The measurements are made on the vertical components of all permanent stations recording LHZ data from IRIS. We currently consider earthquakes with Ms>5.5 between 1990 and 2007. Joint inversions for 2D phase velocity and attenuation maps are performed, allowing the coupling through physical dispersion (e.g. Zhou 2009). As demonstrated in Dalton and Ekstrom (2006), correcting the effect of focusing-defocusing is crucial in order to obtain reliable attenuation structures. Ray theory, which has been used to date, may not give reliable predictions of such effects, because it depends strongly on short wavelength velocity structures and so is very sensitive to how the phase velocity maps are smoothed. Instead, we use the 2D finite frequency amplitude kernel (Zhou et al, 2004) to model the focusing-defocusing effect. Attenuation models and evaluations of model error and resolution will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Tsunamis are low frequency but high impact natural disasters. In 2004, the Boxing Day tsunami killed hundreds of thousands of people from many nations along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean. Tsunami run-up exceeded 35 m. Seven years later, and in spite of some of the best warning technologies and levels of preparedness in the world, the Tohoku-Oki tsunami in Japan dramatically showed the limitations of scientific knowledge on tsunami sources, coastal impacts and mitigation measures. The experience from Japan raised serious questions on how to improve the resilience of coastal communities, to upgrade the performance of coastal defenses, to adopt a better risk management, and also on the strategies and priorities for the reconstruction of damaged coastal areas. Societal resilience requires the reinforcement of capabilities to manage and reduce risk at national and local scales.\nASTARTE (Assessment STrategy And Risk for Tsunami in Europe), a 36-month FP7 project, aims to develop a comprehensive strategy to mitigate tsunami impact in this region. To achieve this goal, an interdisciplinary consortium has been assembled. It includes all CTWPs of NEAM and expert institutions across Europe and worldwide. ASTARTE will improve i) basic knowledge of tsunami generation and recurrence going beyond simple catalogues, with novel empirical data and new statistical analyses for assessing long-term recurrence and hazards of large events in sensitive areas of NEAM, ii) numerical techniques for tsunami simulation, with focus on real-time codes and novel statistical emulation approaches, and iii) methods for assessment of hazard, vulnerability, and risk. ASTARTE will also provide i) guidelines for tsunami Eurocodes, ii) better tools for forecast and warning for CTWPs and NTWCs, and iii) guidelines for decision makers to increase sustainability and resilience of coastal communities. In summary, ASTARTE will develop basic scientific and technical elements allowing for a significant enhancement of the Tsunami Warning System in the NEAM region in terms of monitoring, early warning and forecast, governance and resilience.\nThis work is funded by project ASTARTE - Assessment, STrategy And Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe.

            "abstract": "The final closure of the Panama Isthmus and permanent separation of Caribbean and Pacific waters is thought to have modified their salinity, faunistic assemblages, and ultimately, ocean circulation patterns and global climate. The Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI) is thought to have been the result of Plio-Pleistocene closure of the Isthmus that allowed land animals to massively cross the Isthmus. Similarly, the separation of Caribbean and Pacific waters by a rising Isthmus is thougth to be a prime example of vicariance. The role of Isthmus closure on global changes, however, remains controversial due in part to the difficulty of establishing a precise chronology of seaway closure. While timing of glaciation is well established, new data on the chronology of Isthmus emergence suggests that the process of closure is more complex, long, and old than previously thought. We sampled fluvial and shallow marine strata in northwesternmost South America to recover zircon grains for provenance analyses in the immediate vicinity of the docking site. Because the ages of magmatic provinces in northwestern South America and the Panama Isthmus are mutually exclusive, detrital zircon analyses provides a tool to evaluate land connections. We found that an uniquely Panamanian, 40-45 Ma (early Lutetian) detrital zircon fingerprint is abundant in middle Miocene strata, but absent in underlying lower Miocene and Oligocene strata of the northern Andes. This fingerprint represents the beginning of fluvial detrital exchange between the Panama arc and South America, and therefore marks the time of docking and the end of deep-water, and probably shallow-water connections by middle Miocene times.

However, few measurements of biomass burning have been made in temperate regions. This study quantifies the emission factors of trace gases and fine particles from 16 agricultural fires in the southeastern U.S. sampled during the SEAC4RS campaign. The evolution of reactive nitrogen species (PANs, NOx, and nitrate) and ozone in these fire plumes was also studied. The agricultural fires emitted significant levels of sulfur and chlorine. Sulfur was mainly emitted as SO2 while chlorine was mainly found in the form of particulate chloride. The preliminary emission factors of SO2, sulfate, and chloride are larger than those for other types of biomass burning with average values of 0.92±0.50, 0.21±0.19, and 1.1±0.73 g/kg. Emission factors of other major gaseous (such as hydrogen cyanide, hydroxyacetone, acetonitrile, and monoterpenes) and particulate species (such as nitrate and ammonium) and their variations in agricultural fires will also be examined. PAN was found to form very rapidly in the sampled plumes of agricultural fires. The ratio of PAN to NOy reached up to 40% in less than 1 hour. Other peroxyacyl nitrates (APAN, PPN, and PiBN) all formed rapidly at similar speeds. O3 formation occurred in most agricultural fire plumes but O3 destruction was also observed.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal flow through the oceanic crust controls heat and mass fluxes between the crust and the ocean, with implications for element cycling and Earth’s heat budget. Permeability in oceanic crust is generated by a combination of high-porosity faults and volcanic deposits. Whereas faults generally increase permeability in the vertical direction, volcanic deposits impart an isotropic permeability. This study is focused on evaluating the permeability in volcanic rocks from the outcrop to thin-section scales including: large inter-pillow voids and hyaloclastite zones (m-cm), vesicles (cm-mm), and micro-scale pore networks (mm-μm). Quantifying hydrothermal fluxes requires measurements of crustal permeability. However, most physical measurements of oceanic crustal permeability are made on core pieces and rock fragments. The importance of large pore space for controlling formation-scale permeability is not known in detail but has been interpreted from in situ measurements of bulk permeability at boreholes. To better quantify formation-scale permeability of oceanic crust we integrate 2D and 3D permeability measurements at the outcrop, hand sample and thin section scales. We estimate outcrop-scale permeability using LiDAR scans and photographs of a pillow lava outcrop in the Talcott basalt of southeastern Connecticut. Permeability is quantified from a 2D classified image of dense pillow cores and permeable inter-pillow hyaloclastite zones using equations based on the equivalent channel model of Walsh and Brace (1984). We apply the same method to 2D images of porous rock hand samples and thin sections that have likewise been segmented into pore and matrix space. Our results will help evaluate how porosity and permeability measurements made at the sample and thin section scale can be adapted to understand magnitudes of fluid flow through oceanic crust at the regional and global scales.",

            "abstract": "Volcanically emitted CO2 is generally mantle-derived, but high degassing rates at some arcs (e.g. Merapi [1] and Colli Albani Volcanic District [2]) are thought to be affected by magma-carbonate interaction in the upper plate. However, the effects of depth, temperature, and composition on this process are poorly known.\nWe experimentally simulated magma (50%)-limestone (50%) wallrock interactions at 0.5-1.0 GPa, 1100-1200 °C using pure calcite and a hydrous (~3-5 wt.% H2O) melt (basalt, andesite, or dacite). At 1.0 GPa, 1200 °C starting melts are superliquidus, whereas in the presence of calcite, Ca-rich cpx ± Ca-scapolite are produced.\nWith increasing T, basalt-calcite interaction causes the melt, on a volatile-free basis, to become silica-poor and Ca-rich with alumina decreasing as cpx becomes more CaTs-rich. The same trend is seen with all starting melt compositions as P decreases at a constant T (1200 °C), producing melts similar to ultracalcic (CaO/Al2O3>>1) melt inclusions found in arc settings. Shifting from basalt to andesite has little effect on SiO2 and CaO of the reacted melt (e.g. 37 wt.% SiO2, 42 wt.% CaO at 0.5 GPa, 1200 °C), whereas Al2O3 of andesite-derived reacted melt is lower, likely a result of lower alumina in the starting andesite. Wall-rock calcite consumption is observed to increase with increasing T, decreasing P, and increasing melt XSiO2. At 0.5 GPa between 1100 and 1200 °C, our basalt experiments yield carbonate assimilation from 22 to 48 wt.%. This decreases to 20 wt.% at 1.0 GPa, 1200 °C, whereas an andesitic composition assimilates 59 to 52 wt.% from 0.5 to 1.0 GPa at 1200 °C. The higher assimilation in andesite-added runs at high-T is because of lower silicate liquidus as evidenced by lower modal proportion or absence of cpx ± scapolite.\nUsing a magma flux rate estimated for Mt. Vesuvius [3], we obtain a CO2 outflux for a single such volcano experiencing arc magma-calcite reaction [4] of at least 2-4% of the present-day global arc flux of CO2 [5]. Therefore, greater lengths of continental arcs with carbonate strata in some geologic time periods might have caused excess degassing of CO2.\n[1] Troll et al. (2012) GRL 11, 1-6; [2] Freda et al.

            "abstract": "In this study we seek to identify how snow depth sampling strategies can be used to minimize time and effort when measuring Arctic tundra snow depth distributions, which are primarily controlled by wind and topography. We investigate this issue using data from an oversampled Arctic Alaska watershed. Specifically, we ask at what measurement spacing do we lose our ability to resolve critical scale-related snow spatial variations? Our multi-year measurements come from three nested study areas of 1 km2, 6 km2, and 209 km2. The 1 km2 area was sampled on a static 100-m spaced grid yielding between 6,400 to 15,000 depth measurements each time it was surveyed. The 6 km2 area was measured using arbitrarily scattered 100-300 m long snow depth transects, producing 6,900 to 10,900 snow depths each year. For the largest area, thirty-five to fifty 200 m-long transect lines were randomly distributed throughout the domain yielding 3,000 to 13,400 total measurements annually. To compare results from dense vs. sparse surveys, we extracted and averaged snow depth measurements from dense surveys at the same locations used in the sparse surveys. We found that despite a reduction in number of data points by a factor of 26 to 61, the overall snow depth pattern continued to be captured. In addition, mean values of depth showed high fidelity despite the large reduction in sample number. For example, when subsampling the 6 km2 grid to represent the 1 km2 grid, there was only a 3 cm difference in the average value. However, when comparing snow depth averages of either of the smaller areas with the largest area (209 km2), we conclude that the larger domain is undersampled despite the thousands of data points collected there. During three years of measurements the 209 km2 snow depth average was between 13 and 26% less than the average for the 1 km2 grid. Remarkably, in 2013 the average was only 4% less than the 1 km2 grid, demonstrating that in some years sparse sampling can capture relatively accurate snow depths. Based on these comparisons, we speculate on what sort of sampling pattern might be used at the 209 km2 scale that is both parsimonious and cost efficient.",

            "abstract": "The Buck Creek Monitoring Watershed, in the western Adirondack Region of New York, has provided long-term data back to 1982 for tracking acid rain effects and recovery, and for supporting fundamental research on environmental change. At Buck Creek, monitoring acidic deposition effects as they worsened, then diminished, has advanced our understanding of key biogeochemical processes such as Al mobilization. Although Al mobilization has been one of the primary adverse effects of acidic deposition, in the recovery phase it is now affecting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in new ways that could be both positive and negative, as soils and surface waters respond to further declines in acidic deposition.   Using stream Al measurements from Buck Creek over varying seasons and flows, a new index, the base cation surplus (BCS), was developed to account for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) effects on the relationship between ANC and inorganic Al. Mobilization of inorganic Al, the form toxic to biota, occurs below a BCS of zero, regardless of DOC concentrations. Soil and stream data from Adirondack surveys showed that a BCS value of zero corresponds to a soil base saturation value in the B horizon of approximately 12%. Additional Adirondack survey work indicated that, where sugar maple stands grew in soils with base saturation values below 12%, seedling regeneration was nearly zero, suggesting a link between Al mobilization and impairment of tree regeneration. In recovering Adirondack lakes, the BCS was also used to show that increasing trends in DOC were accelerating decreases of inorganic Al beyond what would be expected from the increasing trends of ANC. Similar decreases of inorganic Al in Buck Creek, were coupled with increases in organic Al concentrations, which resulted in no trend in total Al concentrations despite a strong increase in pH. Sampling of Buck Creek soils in 1997, and again in 2009-2010, indicated a substantial decrease in forest floor exchangeable Al, of which approximately 85% was accounted for by stream export through leaching of exchangeable Al from soil to stream.  Changes in the chemistry of the upper B horizon also suggest the possibility that recovery from acidification is accelerating podzolization in these soils.",

            "abstract": "The isolation and analysis of reconnection regions and topological separators within MHD models is crucial to gaining a systems-level understanding of the near-Earth space environment. However, existing methods for the partitioning of model volumes into distinct topological regions are prohibitively expensive. To address this problem, we have developed a unique fieldline-based volumetric data structure for simplifying the analysis of complex 3D magnetic reconnection and associated dynamics. When applied to Earth's magnetosphere, this allows us to quickly generate geometric approximations of topological separators and separatrices, to integrate associated parallel electric fields, and to compute momentum and energy flux out of the reconnection region. Simultaneously, our approach yields the mapping of the open-closed boundary and associated fluxes into the open field region at the model's inner boundary. The approach is flexible, respects model resolution, and is intimately tied to physically meaningful queries, such as the relationship between reconnection and entropy flows in the inner magnetosphere and dynamics in the tail current sheet. We implement this data structure as an underlying component of the Community Coordinated Modeling Center's Kameleon-plus access and interpolation software. Thus, all of our methods and tools will be made available to the larger space weather modeling community, and will be suitable for both researchers and educators.",

            "abstract": "The temporal evolution and spatial configuration of continents can be analyzed through their response to long-term forces, as a function of the elastic property of the lithosphere, which is parameterized as effective elastic thickness (Te). The Te method has been widely used as a key proxy to examine the long-term strength/rigidity structure of the lithosphere. The present study employs the gravity inversion and flexure inversion techniques that operate in spatial domain in order to estimate the spatial variation of Te as well as the Moho configuration along the western continental margins of India (WCMI) and eastern continental margin of Madagascar (ECMM). The main objective of the present study is to understand the nature of isostasy and structure of the lithosphere along these conjugate passive margins. The results correlate well with the continental and oceanic regional-scale structures including ridges and basins in the WCMI and ECMM that reveal their mode of evolution. This study obtained comparable results from both the passive margins such as a linear zone of anomalously low-Te (1–5 km) along the WCMI (~1680 km long), which exactly correlates with the low-Te patterns obtained all along the ECMM. These low-Te zones along the passive margins are attributed as paleo-rift inception points of lithosphere thermally and mechanically weakened by the combined effects of the Marion hotspot and lithospheric extension due to rifting. When these conjugate passive margins were correlated by matching the mirrored low-Te linear zones, obtained a best fit position of Madagascar against India during the Gondwana Rifting time. The hence derived India-Madagascar paleo-fit model is well justified by the best close-fit of the crustal geometry and bathymetry of the continental shelf margins, and also by the matching of tectonic lineaments, lithology and geochronological belts along the margins of both the continents.",

            "abstract": "The formation and evolution of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in atmospheric condensed phases (i.e., aqueous SOA) can proceed rapidly, but relatively little is known of the important aqueous SOA precursors or their reaction pathways. In our work we are studying the aqueous SOA formed from reactions of phenols (phenol, guaiacol, and syringol), benzene-diols (catechol, resorcinol, and hydroquinone), and phenolic carbonyls (e.g., vanillin and syringaldehyde). These species are potentially important aqueous SOA precursors because they are released in large quantities from biomass burning, have high Henry’s Law constants (KH = 103 -109 M-1 atm-1) and are rapidly oxidized.\nTo evaluate the importance of aqueous reactions of phenols as a source of SOA, we first quantified the kinetics and SOA mass yields for 11 phenols reacting via direct photodegradation, hydroxyl radical (•OH), and with an excited organic triplet state (3C*). In the second step, which is the focus of this work, we use these laboratory results in a simple model of fog chemistry using conditions during a previously reported heavy biomass burning event in Bakersfield, CA. Our calculations indicate that under aqueous aerosol conditions (i.e., a liquid water content of 100 μg m-3) the rate of aqueous SOA production (RSOA(aq)) from phenols is similar to the rate in the gas phase. In contrast, under fog/cloud conditions the aqueous RSOA from phenols is 10 times higher than the rate in the gas phase. In both of these cases aqueous RSOA is dominated by the oxidation of phenols by 3C*, followed by direct photodegradation of phenolic carbonyls, and then •OH oxidation. Our results suggest that aqueous oxidation of phenols is a significant source of SOA during fog events and also during times when deliquesced aerosols are present.",

            "abstract": "Determining patterns and rates of glacial erosion is important in understanding landscape evolution, topographic relief production, geochemical cycles, climate change, and glacial thermal regimes of paleo glaciers and ice sheets. Combining in situ 10Be and 26Al apparent exposure age dating, geomorphological mapping, and field investigations, we examine glacial erosion patterns of the almost 4 000 km2 Haizishan paleo-ice cap on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results show that ice caps developed several times on the low relief Haizishan Plateau and produced a zonal pattern of landscape modification. In locations where apparent exposure ages on bedrock are consistent with last deglaciation, complete resetting of the cosmogenic exposure age clock indicates that more than 2 m of glacial erosion occurred during the last major glaciation (which in this area correlates with the global Last Glacial Maximum (gLGM)). However, older apparent exposure ages on bedrock and in saprolites profiles in areas known to have been covered by the paleo ice cap during gLGM indicate inheritance and thus limited or no erosion by the last ice cap in several areas, including the central zone of the paleo ice cap and at the head of an outlet glacier. Similarly, cosmogenic radionuclide depth profiles in saprolites show erosion of >2 m in an outlet valley bottom and in the mountains that make up the northern border of the paleo ice cap, while samples from saprolites in areas of otherwise scoured terrain have a large nuclide inheritance indicating limited erosion. As patterns of glacial erosion intensity are largely driven by basal thermal regime, our results are consistent with a hypothesis of complex thermal regimes for the paleo Haizishan ice cap during gLGM that was proposed previously on the basis of landform patterns. Future work, including glaciological modeling, is required to fully understand the implications and mechanisms of the complex thermal regime of this paleo ice cap.",

Viewing windows span the upper front and one side, and there are two additional 10”x10” transparent ports on the front, which can be easily opened to install and manipulate apparatus prior to pumping the system down. The windows and ports, which allow for full viewing of the interior, consist of 0.75” thick polycarbonate. The chamber was fabricated from 0.5” thick Al alloy.\nOur system includes two externally-controlled sample wheels, each of which can hold up to 16 one-inch diameter samples. The samples can be viewed from above through a pair of windows for spectroscopic analysis. In our current configuration, one window above each wheel is ZnS and the other is sapphire, but these can be easily exchanged with other materials to suit various wavelength transmission ranges. One sample wheel is in thermal contact with copper tubing for heating or cooling; the wheel is removable and the tubing manifold can be configured to hold a hand sample for spectroscopic analysis under a controlled temperature and Martian atmospheric pressure.\nThe chamber is large enough to accommodate instruments under consideration for landed missions. A 24-wire electrical pass through enables applications such as powering instruments or monitoring chamber properties (temperatures, atmospheric pressure, etc.).\nThe chamber is available for national and international collaborations and can be used to support a diversity of projects.

            "abstract": "The hierarchical branching structure of a river network serves as a template upon which environmental fluxes of water, sediment, nutrients, etc. are conveyed and organized both spatially and temporally within a basin. Dynamical processes occurring on a river network tend to heterogeneously distribute fluxes on the network, often concentrating them into “clusters,” i.e., places of excess flux accumulation. Here, we put forward the hypothesis that places in the network predisposed (due to process dynamics and network topology) to accumulate excess bed-material sediment over a considerable river reach and over a considerable period of time reflect locations where a local imbalance in sediment flux may occur thereby highlighting a susceptibility to potential fluvial geomorphic change. We have developed a framework where we are able to track fluxes on a “static” river network using a simplified Lagrangian transport model and use the spatial-temporal distribution of that flux to form a new “dynamic” network of the flux that evolves over time. From this dynamic network we can quantify the dynamic connectivity of the flux and integrate emergent “clusters” over time through a cluster persistence index (CPI) to assess the persistence of mass throughout the network. The framework was applied to sand transport on the Greater Blue Earth River Network in Minnesota where three hotspots of fluvial geomorphic change have been defined based on high rates of channel migration observed from aerial photographic analysis. Locations within the network with high CPI coincided with two of these hotspots, possibly suggesting that channel migration here is driven by sediment deposition “pushing” the stream into and thus eroding the opposite bank. The third hotspot was not identified by high CPI, but instead is believed to be a hotspot of streamflow-driven change based on additional information and the fact that high bed shear stress coincided with this hotspot. The proposed network-based dynamic connectivity framework has the potential to place dynamical processes occurring at small scales into a network context to understand how reach-scale changes cascade into network-scale effects, useful for informing the large-scale consequences of local management actions.",

            "abstract": "Continental rifts commonly experience multiple phases of rifting with different directions and rates of extension. The relative maturity of the fault network developed during the initial rift phase has been shown in physical analogue experiments to influence the fault population developed during subsequent rift phases. However, the full 3D geometry and evolution of the fault networks is difficult to constrain from such models.\nWe use a 3D discrete element model to investigate the evolution of normal fault networks in multi-phase rift environments and compare these to networks developed during a single rift phase. Faults are defined as an accumulation of broken bonds in the brittle layer and their location, throw and interaction is recorded through time. Thus incremental fault displacement and geometry and the evolution of the fault network in 3D can be examined. We investigate how the maturity of an initial normal fault network impacts on the fault network evolution and geometry during a second rift phase with an extension direction at 45 degrees to the first phase.\nDuring the first rift phase conjugate fault sets nucleate and organise themselves by segment growth, interaction and linkage into co-linear fault zones. With increasing extension the fault network develops a preferred dip polarity generating crustal-scale half graben with dip domains developed along strike. The degree of development of this first-phase fault network strongly influences the second phase fault geometry and evolution. Even a small amount of Phase I extension promotes fault orientations in Phase II to strongly reflect the Phase I orientation. An intermediate level of Phase I extension result in complex Phase II fault geometries reflecting reactivation of Phase I faults and new Phase II faults. Sigmoidal planform fault geometries develop, with the network having complex, zig-zag and rhomboidal fault patterns. A large amount of Phase I extension, with a mature fault network, results in Phase II being dominated by, and deformation localised onto, Phase I faults. Some domains dominated by new Phase II faults occur where the fault density of Phase I faults is low. In all models, fault geometry shows clear variation with depth - faults become less segmented and more strongly reflect the initial Phase I fault orientation with increasing depth.",

            "abstract": "Yellowstone caldera, Wyoming, hosts one of the largest hydrothermal systems on Earth, fueled by heat and volatiles released from hotspot-derived basalt magmas that stall in the crust. Prolonged hydrothermal activity has pervasively altered the subsurface and such altered material is presumed to have acted as a source for magmas erupted after the two largest caldera eruptions, as evidenced by low-δ18O signatures in these magmas. This study focuses on the youngest Yellowstone volcanic units, the ~ 255 ka to ~ 70 ka large volume (~ 360 km3) Central Plateau Member (CPM) rhyolites. New laser-ablation ICP-MS whole rock, glass and mineral trace element data were obtained in order to refine existing constraints on CPM petrogenesis. Small temporal increases in elements such as As (3.1-4.1 ppm), Rb (170-200 ppm), Cs (3.6-4.3 ppm), Pb (26-31 ppm), Th (23-27 ppm) and U (5.4-6.8 ppm) contrast with increases of ~ 40-50 % in HFSE and REE in the same samples. The highest observed temporal increase is that of Zn, from 65 to 105 ppm. Caesium is highly incompatible with mineral/glass partition coefficients KD < 0.05 measured in all investigated mineral phases. Rubidium is also incompatible but its sanidine/glass KD ~ 0.4 results in a larger bulk distribution coefficient DRb ~ 0.2. For Pb, sanidine/glass KD ~ 0.8 leads to DPb > 0.4. Zinc is observed to be compatible in clinopyroxene, fayalite, zircon, chevkinite (KD ~ 5-12), and Fe-Ti oxides (KD ~ 40), such that DZn may approach 1. Fractional crystallization or partial melting processes alone cannot explain the same small increase rate of elements with diverse degrees of incompatibility (Rb, Cs and Pb), nor a larger increase rate in nearly compatible Zn. Assimilation by the juvenile CPM magmas of a crustal material of distinct composition appears to be required, and hydrothermally altered rhyolites, comprising much of the Yellowstone subsurface represent the most likely assimilant. Lower Rb, Cs, Pb (perhaps also As and U) and higher Zn concentrations in this altered rock horizon would explain the unusual temporal variations in these fluid-mobile elements in CPM lavas. As the CPM magma bodies developed and evolved, fractionating some mineral phases, they also assimilated these altered rhyolites, modifying incompatible trace element increase rates.",

            "abstract": "Convective momentum transport (CMT) has been demonstrated to have a large impact on global atmospheric circulation in both observational and numerical studies. In General Circulation Models (GCMs) CMT is often parameterized in a simple way by assuming that in-cloud horizontal momentum depends only on lateral entrainment and detrainment rates [Schneider and Lindzen, 1976]. In addition to lateral entrainment and detrainment rates the effect of perturbation pressure gradient force induced by convection (Pc) on momentum transport is significant. Because it is the most complicated term to be parameterized, a very simple form of products among a constant coefficient, mass flux, and environment vertical wind shear was employed to parameterize it [Gregory et al., 1997]. In addition, none of these CMT parameterizations deal with the scale problems. Thus, the goal of this study is to evaluate the past CMT parameterizations and explore the scale dependencies of Pc and CMT using Cloud Resolving Model (CRM) simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) coupled with the most sophisticated spectral-bin microphysics. Our preliminary results show that the parameterized CMT from the top-hat approach is underestimated especially at the gray zone scale (~4-50 km); using the simplified 3-updraft and 1-downdraft formulation proposed in our previous study for eddy transport of moisture, the CMT can be represented well. The formulation also produced a more accurate mass flux compared to the top-hat approach, which can potentially improve the parameterization of Pc. We investigate the relative contributions from linear and nonlinear forcing to Pc at different model grid spacing (dx). Our results show that the assumption that non-linear forcing is much smaller than linear force is valid only at dx > 128 km and dx < 8 km. At the dx = 32~16 km, linear and nonlinear forcings become compatible, suggesting a more sophisticated formula for Pc might be needed.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of Saturn's inner magnetosphere are driven by the planet's strong magnetic field, rapid rotation rate, and interactions between magnetospheric plasma and Saturn's distributed neutral cloud. This cloud is composed mostly of water and OH molecules and primarily originates from the cryovolcanic plumes of Enceladus. Charge-exchange collisions between ions and neutrals result in a loss of momentum from the plasma, while photoionization and electron-impact ionization of neutrals produces new, slow-moving water group ions that are accelerated in the corotation direction by the J×Bforce associated with magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents. Unbalanced centrifugal stresses cause this newly-produced plasma to move radially outward, eventually leaving the magnetosphere. The characteristic signature of this process is the development of inward-moving fingers of hot, rarefied, outer magnetosphere plasma, as required by the conservation of magnetic flux.\nWe investigate the dynamics of Saturn's inner magnetosphere using the latest iteration of the Saturn multifluid model with refined plasma-neutral interaction physics. Earlier versions of this model were used to investigate the external triggering of plasmoids and the interchange process using a fixed internal source rate. We use a static representation of Saturn's neutral cloud and modified multifluid MHD equations incorporating mass- and momentum-loading terms. Our collision physics calculations have been updated to include energy-dependent rate coefficients, and includes the ability to specify a radially-dependent suprathermal electron distribution to investigate ionization by this component.\nWe validate our results using data from the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer and Magnetometer instruments (CAPS and MAG) during Saturn solstice. Inclusion of self-consistent ion-neutral interactions in our simulation allows us to examine the spatial and temporal variation in mass- and momentum-loading in the inner magnetosphere and their dependence on local plasma conditions. We also investigate the formation and evolution of interchange fingers, comparing our results with data from Cassini, and determine the global rates of radial outflow. Finally, we study the impact of seasonal changes on the above phenomena.",

            "abstract": "The 24 September 2013 M7.7 earthquake in Balochistan, Pakistan, produced a ~200 km long left-lateral strike-slip surface rupture along a portion of the Hoshab fault, a moderately dipping (45-75º) structure in the Makran accretionary prism. The rupture is remarkably continuous and crosses only two (0.7 and 1.5 km wide) step-overs along its arcuate path through southern Pakistan. Displacements are dominantly strike-slip, with a minor component of reverse motion. We remotely mapped the surface rupture at 1:5,000 scale and measured displacements using high resolution (0.5 m) pre- and post-event satellite imagery. We mapped 295 laterally faulted stream channels, terrace margins, and roads to quantify near-field displacement proximal (±10 m) to the rupture trace. The maximum near-field left-lateral offset is 15±2 m (average of ~7 m). Additionally, we used pre-event imagery to digitize 254 unique landforms in the “medium-field” (~100-200 m from the rupture) and then measured their displacements compared to the post-event imagery. At this scale, maximum left-lateral offset approaches 17 m (average of ~8.5 m). The width (extent of observed surface faulting) of the rupture zone varies from ~1 m to 3.7 km. Near- and medium-field offsets show similar slip distributions that are inversely correlated with the width of the fault zone at the surface (larger offsets correspond to narrow fault zones). The medium-field offset is usually greater than the near-field offset. The along-strike surface slip distribution is highly variable, similar to the slip distributions documented for the 2002 Denali M7.9 earthquake and 2001 Kunlun M7.8 earthquake, although the Pakistan offsets are larger in magnitude. The 2013 Pakistan earthquake ranks among the largest documented continental strike-slip displacements, possibly second only to the 18+ m surface displacements attributed to the 1855 Wairarapa M~8.1 earthquake.",

These layers can range from several meters in thickness, to discrete layers invisible to the naked eye (cryptotephra). Identification of cryptotephra layers is paramount for complete characterization of the eruptive record of a volcanic center, not just the largest eruptive events. However, cryptotephra recognition is hampered by their small volume in most drill cores.\nA non-destructive method to distinguish tephra layers, particularly those of a high silica nature which may not be readily detectable with magnetic methods, is visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy. The Vis/NIR region of the light spectrum contains strong absorption features due to charge-transfer absorptions in transition metals (dominated by iron) and vibration and overtone bands due to hydroxyl and water (including near 1.4 µm, 1.9 µm, and 2.2-2.5 µm). The exact position and nature of these bands provide a means to identify various carbonate-, hydroxyl-, iron-, phyllosilicate-, sulfate-, and water-bearing minerals (e.g., Pieters and Englert, 1993).\nWe produced a series of mixtures of hemipelagic sediment and tephra which were used to identify band positions and features which strongly correlate with the presence of tephra (see figure). The addition of ~15-20 wt.% tephra to a sediment results in recognizable spectral changes. The mixture data was used to create a MATLAB program to run unknown sample analyses through. We then used an ASD FieldSpec to collect Vis/NIR data (0.39-2.5 µm) on the upper 10 m of core collected during IODP 340 (U1396C) off the coast of Montserrat at 0.5 cm resolution and applied our tephra recognition program to this data. We identified 29 potential cryptotephra layers in the 10 m analyzed. Dissolution techniques are being completed to corroborate the spectral data.",

In recent decades this region has experienced substantial increase in variability – especially with intense rainfall events during wet season (Nov-Apr) causing severe flood damage and low rainfall seasons resulting in water shortages. On the other hand, higher evaporation rates driven by increasing air temperatures contribute significantly to water losses in this region. Thus, understanding the inter-annual and multi-decadal variability of rainfall and temperature in the basin is important for efficient water resources management. To this end, the objective of this research is to investigate the relationship between large scale climate variables and basin hydroclimatology and to use these in statistical models for potential skillful prediction.\nWe perform Principal Component Analysis on the space-time rainfall and temperature fields to identify dominant modes of variability. The modes are then related to large scale climate fields such as sea surface temperatures, sea level pressures, etc. to identify regions of high correlation and consequently, the potential physical mechanisms and predictors such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are isolated. Subsequently, we develop a statistical prediction model for the wet season (Nov-Apr) rainfall and temperature based on the climate predictors developed from the above diagnostics. We find significant prediction skill, improving the prospects for efficient water resources management.",

            "abstract": "There is close agreement among three of the four experimental studies that have ‘calibrated’ the P–T dependencies of Ti-in-quartz solubility. New experiments were conducted to identify potential experimental disequilibrium, and determine which Ti-in-quartz solubility calibration is most accurate. Quartz and rutile were synthesized from SiO2- and TiO2saturated aqueous fluids in a forward-type experiment at 925°C and 10 kbar in a piston-cylinder apparatus. A range of crystal sizes was examined to determine if growth rate affected Ti incorporation in quartz. Cathodoluminescence (CL) images and electron microprobe measurements show that intercrystalline and intracrystalline variations in Ti concentrations are remarkably small regardless of crystal size. The average Ti-in-quartz concentration from the forward-type experiment is 392±1 ppm Ti, which is within 95% confidence interval of data from the 10 kbar isobar of Wark and Watson (2006) and Thomas et al. (2010). Quartz from the forward-type experiment was used as starting material for reversal-type experiments. The high-Ti quartz starting material was recrystallized at 925°C and 20 kbar to reduce the solubility of Ti in recrystallized quartz to the equilibrium solubility concentration of the reversed P–T condition. The ‘dry’ and ‘wet’ reversal experiments produced polycrystalline quartzites. Rutile occurs as inclusions in quartz, and as individual crystals dispersed along quartz/quartz grain boundaries. Quartz that recrystallized during the reversal-type experiment has substantially lower Ti concentrations than the quartz starting material because Ti solubility at 20 kbar is significantly lower than at 10 kbar. Dark cathodoluminescent quartz with low Ti concentrations shows that extensive quartz recrystallization occurred at the reversal P–T condition. The average Ti concentration in quartz from reversal experiments is 94±2 ppm Ti, which is within the 95% confidence interval of a linear fit to the 20 kbar data of Thomas et al. (2010).\nThomas JB, Watson EB, Spear FS, Shemella FS, Nayak SK, Lanzirotti A (2010) Contrib Mineral Petrol 160:743–759\nWark DA, Watson EB (2006) Contrib Mineral Petrol 152:743–754",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) are known to indirectly influence climate since they affect the concentration of both atmospheric ozone (O3) and hydroxyl radicals (OH). In addition, lightning NOx (LNOx) is the most important source of NOx in the upper troposphere (particularly in the tropics). It is difficult to estimate LNOx because it is not easy to make measurements near the lightning channel, and the various NOx-producing mechanisms within a lightning flash are not fully understood. A variety of methods have been used to estimate LNOx production [e.g., in-situ observations, combined ground-based VHF lightning mapping and VLF/LF lightning locating observations, indirect retrievals using satellite Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) observations, theoretical considerations, laboratory spark measurements, and rocket triggered lightning measurements]. The present study introduces a new approach for estimating LNOx that employs Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) data. LIS optical measurements are used to directly estimate the total energy of a flash; the total flash energy is then converted to LNOx production (in moles) by multiplying by a thermo-chemical yield. Hence, LNOx estimates on a flash-by-flash basis are obtained. A Lightning NOx Indicator (LNI) is computed by summing up the LIS-derived LNOx contributions from a region over a particular analysis period. Larger flash optical areas are consistent with longer channel length and/or more energetic channels, and hence more NOx production. Brighter flashes are consistent with more energetic channels, and hence more NOx production. The location of the flash within the thundercloud and the optical scattering characteristics of the thundercloud are complicating factors. LIS data for the years 2003-2013 were analyzed, and geographical plots of the time-evolution of the LNI over the southern tier states (i.e. upto 38o N) of CONUS were determined. Overall, the LNI trends downward over the 11 yr analysis period. The LNI has been added to the list of indicators presently provided by a sustaining assessment tool developed at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for monitoring lightning/climate interactions over the United States, as part of the National Climate Assessment (NCA) program.",

            "abstract": "There is a small but growing catalog of storm-driven shallow landslides in areas with available LIDAR data. These datasets offer the promise of more refined testing of shallow landside models. Traditional grid-cell extraction methods may not capture slopes relevant to initiation or terminal runout for model comparison. With the intent of this study being to provide the most robust data on historic hazardous storm-driven shallow landslides, we developed a method to automate slope extraction along pathways of arbitrary length, starting at the terminal runout or headscarp and following the gradient. Using python scripting in a GIS environment, we extracted slope failure values for each landslide, thereby reducing manual analysis. Script testing was done on a 2006 landslide dataset consisting of nearly one thousand landslides we mapped from high-resolution historic imagery in Marin County, California, USA. The scripting process grouped individual landslide headscarp, lateral scarp and margins into a single entity, thereby allowing attributes to be populated for both multiple features as well as each single landslide group. Slope values were extracted above the headscarp and along the terminal runout using 10-m pathways. These values were coded for obstructions, both natural and anthropogenic, using historical imagery. This allowed us to identify both natural and man-made obstructions that could skew slope analysis results. We compared these pathway-generated values to grid cell extraction techniques to assess the degree to which the different methods capture the distributions of slopes at initiation and deposition. By developing an automated method to analyze landslide slope failure, additional historical landslide datasets with available LIDAR data can be examined rapidly, thereby contributing to the mapping of future landslide hazard zones.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Mars2020 rover will be searching for signs of past habitability and past life on Mars. Additionally, the rover mission will prepare a cache of highly significant samples for a future sample return mission. NASA requires these samples to be well characterized; the instruments on the rover must be capable of fine-scale in situ mineralogical or elemental analysis with emphasis on biosignature detection or characterization. We have been developing multiple standoff laser-based instruments at the University of Hawaii, Manoa that are capable of fine-scale in situ chemical analysis and biosignatures detection. By employing a time-resolved spectroscopy, we can perform elemental analysis with Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), mineral and organic analysis with Raman spectroscopy, and biosignature detection with Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF). Each of these techniques share the same optics and detection equipment, allowing us to integrate them into a single, compact instrument. High time-resolution (~100 ns/pulse) is the key to this instrument; with it, the detector only records data when the signal is the brightest. Spectra can be taken during the day, LIBS can be measured without a plasma light background, and the Raman signal can be separated from the mineral fluorescence signal. Since bio-organics have very short fluorescence lifetimes, the new instrument can be used to unambiguously detect bio-organics. The prototype uses a low power (0.5 mJ/pulse) 532 nm laser with a detection limit of < 30 ppm of organics in a sample of Antarctica Dry Valley soil measured from 8 m. Another LIF instrument under development in our lab, called the Biofinder, takes advantage of the extremely intense fluorescence signal produced by organics by using a wide laser spot and a camera to produce LIF images of wide area (25 cm area from 2 m distance with 2 mm/pixel resolution). The Biofinder can quickly assess the area around the rover (at 10 frames/s) by imaging sample cores, drill holes, or outcrops, and then allow the slower but more precise instruments on the rover to characterize the regions of interest. Either of these prototypes would be ideally suited for future NASA missions, including human exploration missions. The next iterations of the instruments will be designed specifically for future astronaut explorers.",

            "abstract": "While understanding of climate change’s impact on coastal systems has recently seen great improvements, there still remains much to be understood, especially for systems as hydraulically complex as estuaries. The hydrodynamic climate in estuarine waters is controlled by multiple factors such as boundary conditions offshore (tides, waves), across the surface (winds), at the upper estuary margin (streamflow), as well as mean sea level. On the decadal to century scale, climate change modulated variability in these forcings will effect state of the overall system resulting in changes to experienced extreme water level events.\nA study of climate change impacts on two Pacific Northwest estuaries is presently underway. ADCIRC-SWAN is being used to conduct multi-decadal simulations of water levels across the study estuaries. A GCM-RCM configuration was selected from the NARCCAP project and then bias-corrected against the observation-based NARR data. This was separated into two data streams (historical and future) which were then run through a set of models in order to develop forcing for ADCIRC-SWAN. At the open ocean boundary, the model is forced with wave output from the WaveWatch III model. The free surface of the model is forced with surface winds and pressure. The streamflow boundaries are forced with hydrographs obtained from the Micromet - Snowmodel - Hydroflow suite of runoff routing models.\nThe ADCIRC-SWAN output provides time series data on total water levels (TWLs) throughout the model domain. These time series can be used to construct CDFs of water elevation at any site of interest and also to derive return periods for extreme water level events. Of particular interest to this study is how these products change from the historical to future runs and which processes (changing offshore waves, changing streamflow) are primarily responsible for the observed changes in flooding characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Among the diverse menu of technologies for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, one option involves pairing carbon capture and storage (CCS) with the generation of synthetic fuels and electricity from co-processed coal and biomass. In this scheme, the feedstocks are first converted to syngas, from which a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process reactor and combined cycle turbine produce liquid fuels and electricity, respectively. With low concentrations of sulfur and other contaminants, the synthetic fuels are expected to be cleaner than conventional crude oil products. And with CO2 as an inherent byproduct of the FT process, most of the GHG emissions can be eliminated by simply compressing the CO2 output stream for pipeline transport. In fact, the incorporation of CCS at such facilities can result in very low—or perhaps even negative—net GHG emissions, depending on the fraction of biomass as input and its CO2 signature.\nTo examine the potential market penetration and environmental impact of coal and biomass to liquids and electricity (CBtLE), which encompasses various possible combinations of input and output parameters within the overall energy landscape, a system-wide analysis is performed using the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) model. With resource supplies, energy conversion technologies, end-use demands, costs, and pollutant emissions as user-defined inputs, MARKAL calculates—using linear programming techniques—the least-cost set of technologies that satisfy the specified demands subject to environmental and policy constraints. In this framework, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed both national and regional databases to characterize assorted technologies in the industrial, commercial, residential, transportation, and generation sectors of the U.S. energy system. Here, the EPA MARKAL database is updated to include the costs and emission characteristics of CBtLE using figures from the literature. Nested sensitivity analysis is then carried out to investigate the impact of various assumptions and scenarios, such as the plant capacity factor, capital costs, CO2 mitigation targets, oil prices, and CO2 storage costs.",

            "abstract": "Flood events in the Yangtze River are associated with variation in East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) precipitation. Understanding the frequency and scale of the EASM precipitation during the Holocene is a key to understanding the mechanism and cyclicity of floods and droughts. Because about 70% of the annual discharge occurs during the flood season, the Yangtze delta sediments provide a good archive of EASM precipitation. In this study, we investigate the possibility of applying OSL dating to establishing high-resolution chronologies for the Yangtze delta sediment cores YD13-1H and G3. The objectives of this study are: (1) test whether fine grained quartz in present day suspended particle matter (SPM) is fully bleached or reset before deposition, (2) where possible, test quartz fine- and coarse-grain OSL dating against radiocarbon shell ages, (3) interpret the sediment transport processes through the differential bleaching of quartz and feldspar OSL signals.\nWe show that the SPM collected from the surface water column of the Yangtze River during the flood season is well-bleached (offset ~60 years). Fine-grained pro-delta sediments are thus potentially a good dosimeter for OSL dating. OSL ages sediment cores indicate a pronounced change in sedimentation rate at ~6 ka and ~2ka. These events are consistent with what is known of the evolution of the Yangtze catchment and delta. The delta began to build at ~6 ka (Zhao et al., 1979), and human activities increased significantly in the catchment at ~2ka　(Chen et al., 1985). It is however surprising that the entire top 9 m of sediment only records these two events. The question of whether significant deposition was limited to 2 ka and 6 ka, or whether the record has been disturbed by erosion/reworking remains. These issues are discussed in terms of the reliability of the quartz OSL ages, the degree of bleaching by comparison with polymineral OSL signals, and the relationship of the OSL ages to the sedimentary record.",

            "abstract": "Identification of mantle contribution to rift topography and structure is difficult, especially in the continents while volcanic activity (considered a prime signature of mantle upwellings) is not systematically detected in the areas of presumed active rifting. It can be argued therefore that complex brittle-ductile rheology and stratification of the continental lithosphere result in screening and deviation of mantle upwellings as well as in short-wavelength modulation and localization of surface deformation induced by mantle flow. This deformation is also affected by far-field stresses and hence interplays with the “tectonic” topography. Testing these ideas requires fully-coupled high resolution “tectonic grade” 3D numerical modelling of mantle-lithosphere interactions, which so far has not been possible due to conceptual and technical limitations of earlier approaches. We present here new ultra-high resolution (5003) 3-D experiments on rift topography and structure over mantle plumes, incorporating a weakly pre-stressed (ultra-slow spreading) rheologically realistic lithosphere. The results show complex surface evolution, which is very different from symmetric patterns usually assumed as the canonical surface signature of mantle upwellings. In particular, the topography exhibits strongly asymmetric small-scale 3D features, which include narrow and wide rifts, flexural flank uplifts and fault structures. In presence of a craton, a double rift system forms with coeval development of a magma-rich rift branch above the plume head and a magma-poor one along the opposite side of the craton. Our results thus suggest a dominant role for rheology structure and intra-plate stresses in controlling dynamic topography, mantle-lithosphere interactions, and continental break-up processes above mantle plumes while reconciling the passive (plume-activated) versus active (far-field tectonic stresses) rift concepts as these experiments show both processes in action and demonstrate the possibility of developing both magmatic and amagmatic rifts in identical geotectonic environments.",

            "abstract": "Despite residing in a state with 75% of North American earthquakes and three of the top 15 ever recorded, most Alaskans have limited knowledge about the science of earthquakes. To many, earthquakes are just part of everyday life, and to others, they are barely noticed until a large event happens, and often ignored even then. Alaskans are rugged, resilient people with both strong independence and tight community bonds. Rural villages in Alaska, most of which are inaccessible by road, are underrepresented in outreach efforts. Their remote locations and difficulty of access make outreach fiscally challenging. Teacher retention and small student bodies limit exposure to science and hinder student success in college.\nThe arrival of EarthScope’s Transportable Array, the 50th anniversary of the Great Alaska Earthquake, targeted projects with large outreach components, and increased community interest in earthquake knowledge have provided opportunities to spread information across Alaska. We have found that performing hands-on demonstrations, identifying seismological relevance toward career opportunities in Alaska (such as natural resource exploration), and engaging residents through place-based experience have increased the public’s interest and awareness of our active home.",

            "abstract": "Irrigation is indispensable to the agriculture in dry inland river basins, and may significantly alter the regional water cycle which is often featured by complicated surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) interaction. Although field-scale processes of irrigation water are clearly understood, the hydrological impact of irrigation at a large basin scale has not well examined. It poses a challenge to the water resources management. Our studies presented a modeling approach to address this challenge. GSFLOW, an integrated SW-GW model, was improved to represent irrigation practices in the model simulation, and applied to the HeiHe River Basin (HRB), the second largest inland river basin in China. The mid-stream area of HRB is a semi-arid region with extensive oasis agriculture, typical of western China. A series of studies have been conducted. First, the model was applied to fuse the limited hydrological observations in the area and generate a coherent understanding of the regional water cycle. Spatially and temporally detailed information on the impact of irrigation was then achieved. Second, an innovative optimization approach, coupling the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and SCE-UA algorithms, was proposed for the complex model. Allocation of surface water and groundwater for the irrigation was optimized under different management scenarios. The optimization results not only helped understand the hydrological processes, but provided insights into the water resources management. Third, the Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM) was implemented to systematically address the modeling uncertainty. Spatial variation and temporal dynamics of the uncertainty associated with the irrigation practice in this area were revealed. The uncertainty results shed light on further data collection and model improvement. Overall, our study demonstrated the applicability and significant value of the integrated modeling approach in understanding the basin-wide impact of irrigation on the water cycle in dry inland areas.",

            "abstract": "To answer fundamental questions about our changing climate, we must quantify how aerosols are changing over time. This is a global question that requires regional characterization, because in some places aerosols are increasing and in others they are decreasing. Although NASA’s Moderate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensors have provided quantitative information about global aerosol optical depth (AOD) for more than a decade, the creation of an aerosol climate data record (CDR) requires consistent multi-decadal data. With the Visible and Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard Suomi-NPP, there is potential to continue the MODIS aerosol time series. Yet, since the operational VIIRS aerosol product is produced by a different algorithm, it is not suitable to continue MODIS to create an aerosol CDR. Therefore, we have applied the MODIS Dark-target (DT) algorithm to VIIRS observations, taking into account the slight differences in wavelengths, resolutions and geometries between the two sensors. More specifically, we applied the MODIS DT algorithm to a dataset known as the Intermediate File Format (IFF), created by the University of Wisconsin. The IFF is produced for both MODIS and VIIRS, with the idea that a single (MODIS-like or ML) algorithm can be run either dataset, which can in turn be compared to the MODIS Collection 6 (M6) retrieval that is run on standard MODIS data. After minimizing or characterizing remaining differences between ML on MODIS-IFF (or ML-M) and M6, we have performed apples-to-apples comparison between ML-M and ML on VIIRS IFF (ML-V). Examples of these comparisons include time series of monthly global mean, monthly and seasonal global maps at 1° resolution, and collocations as compared to AERONET. We concentrate on the overlapping period January 2012 through June 2014, and discuss some of the remaining discrepancies between the ML-V and ML-M datasets.",

Through this analysis, we discuss the source and transport mechanisms of energetic electrons at Saturn and attempt to explain their spatial distributions inside 20 planetary radii (Rs). Using only data sets from equatorial orbits, a recent analysis of Cassini MIMI/LEMMS, CAPS, and MAG data sets by Clark et al. (2014; doi:10.1016/j.pss.2014.07.004) demonstrated how the angular profiles (i.e., ‘pancakes’, ‘isotropic’, ‘field-aligned’, and ‘butterfly’ PADs) of keV-energy electrons are statistically distributed at Saturn. Through a theoretical transport model, Clark et al. (2014) also demonstrated the role of Saturn’s neutral gas torus with adiabatic transport to explain the spatial distribution of electrons. However, their data/model comparison was limited to a case study analysis and the data-model comparison results still do not provide the full picture in understanding the source of keV-energy electrons and their radial evolution. Here we continue to refine our understanding of the spatial distributions of keV-energy electrons at Saturn with the use of a data-model comparison approach. Using the full set of MIMI/LEMMS particle data available for the period mid-2004 to mid-2014, we carefully reexamine the role of neutrals and adiabatic transport for the region ~10 to 15 Rs. Using PAD profiles deduced from data sets at 15 Rs, we build different boundary conditions for our computational model and discuss how angular profiles radially evolve throughout the region ~10-15 Rs and which PADs at our boundary condition can explain the Cassini observations near ~10 Rs. We also present the results from our ongoing investigation of the dominant processes inside ~10 Rs and focus on the impact of chorus emission on the energetic electron distributions.",

            "abstract": "The Middle-East and North Africa (MENA) experience the highest risk of water stress in the world. This underlines the importance of climate analysis for water resources management and climate change adaptation for this region, particularly in transboundary basins such as the Tigris-Euphrates system. Such analysis, however, is difficult due to a paucity of high quality precipitation data. The network of gauge stations is quite sparse and the data are often available only at monthly time-scale. Satellite-based products, such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), offer better temporal resolution; however, these data are available only for periods that are short for hydroclimatic analysis, and they often misrepresent precipitation over regions with complex topography or strong convection. To fill this gap, we have implemented the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, initialized with the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis II, to generate high-resolution precipitation estimates for MENA. Several sensitivity analyses have been performed in order to find a set of physics parameters that appropriately captures the annual cycle and year-to-year variability of rainfall over select areas in MENA. The results show that WRF, particularly over highlands, estimates the precipitation more accurately than the satellite products. In addition to these reanalysis-driven simulations, we have performed several simulations using the historical and twenty first century outputs of a select number of GCMs available at the CMIP5 archive. These runs enable us to detect changes in rainfall behavior under different greenhouse gas scenarios and reveal synoptic to mesoscale mechanisms responsible for such changes.",

            "abstract": "CO2-brine relative permeability relations are important parameters in modeling scenarios such as CO2 sequestration in saline aquifers and CO2 enhanced recovery in oil reservoir. Many steady-state experimental studies on CO2-brine relative permeability showed that the CO2-brine relative permeability differs greatly from typical oil-brine relative permeability. Particularly, they reported a very small endpoint CO2 relative permeability of 0.1~0.2 at a relative high residual water saturation of 0.4~0.6.\nIn this study, we hypothesize the measured low endpoint CO2 relative permeability in previous studies was an experimental artifact that is primary due to low CO2 viscosity. We conducted steady-state CO2 drainage experiments by co-injecting equlibrated CO2 and brine into a long (60.8 cm) and low permeability (116-mD) Berea sandstone core at 20 °C and 1500 psi. During every experiment, both the overall pressure drop across the core and the pressure drops of the five independent and continuous sections of the core were monitored. The in-situ saturation was measured with a medical X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scanner. In the center three sections where saturation was uniform, we determined the relative permeability to both brine and CO2 phases. In the entrance and exit sections, both measured pressure gradients and saturation were non-uniform. To cope with this, we make several self-consistent assumptions that reveal the nature of capillary entrance and effect in steady-state two-phase core flooding experiments. Based on these assumptions we determined the relative permeability to CO2 and CO2-brine capillary pressure simultaneously using measured pressure drops. We found: (1) a much higher endpoint CO2 relative permeability of 0.58 at a water saturation of 48%, (2) the entrance region with non-uniform saturation expanded CO2 relative permeability data to much lower water saturation, (3) the determined CO2-brine capillary pressure curve is self-consistent and matches with an independent Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure (MICP) curve measured with a plug from the same Berea sandstone after appropriate scaling. Herein we propose a dimensionless number that estimates how much the measured overall pressure drop during steady-state two-phase flow is affected by capillary effects.",

Snow and ice have much lower absorption at the 532 nm than the 1064 nm wavelength and therefore a higher fraction of emitted photons will be returned to the range detector. However, lower absorption results in an increase in the number of scattering events that occur within the snow and ice (volume scattering). If not properly corrected for, volume scattering can result in spatially and temporally coherent time delays in photon returns that result in a low bias in derived surface elevations. We provide a summary of our preliminary findings into the potential magnitude and time evolution of volume scattering on elevations derived from ICESat-2 data.",

Cooling rates of CO2 observed by SABER/TIMED from 2002-2013 are analyzed on two important nonmigrating tides, the DE2 and DE3. Relative amplitudes are on the order of 15-50% with respect to the monthly mean emissions. Seasonal and solar cycle variations are discussed and complemented to Earth’s natural thermostat: the nitric oxide 5.3 μm emissions. Furthermore, photochemical tidal modeling has been done in order to understand the underlying coupling mechanisms responsible for transmitting tidal signal into the CO2 cooling rates. While the main tidal coupling mechanism is the temperature dependence of the collisional excitation of the CO2 (01101) fundamental band transition (v=2), there is also evidence for an increasing importance of advection and neutral density variations towards higher altitudes. Our results indicate that the tropospheric tides due to large-scale weather systems are important for modulating the longitudinal and local time structure of the energy budget of Earth’s upper atmosphere.",

To differentiate the climatic response to volcanic eruptions from the model’s natural variability, we use the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), a 30-member ensemble of 20th Century simulations of the coupled climate model. We analyzed the climate following three large 20th Century eruptions: Mount Agung, El Chichón, and Mount Pinatubo. Each volcanic eruption is simulated by an idealized aerosol distribution so each eruption’s forcing is identical across ensemble members. The three climate variables we focused on were: surface temperature, precipitation, and surface pressure. With these variables we investigated global and regional climate responses. Globally, the model exhibits the expected cooling that persists for several years following large eruptions. Associated with this, the model shows that the global hydrologic cycle slows and the cooler troposphere holds less water vapor resulting in a decreased surface pressure. On the regional scale, we investigate two responses to large volcanic eruptions that have been described observationally: Northern Hemisphere winter warming, and an enhanced likelihood for El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Investigating the northern hemisphere winters following the eruptions, some simulations produce anomalous warming over land that is similar to the observed warming, but just as many produce anomalous cooling. Comparing the distribution of temperature anomalies, we cannot distinguish the northern hemisphere winter response from the model’s natural variability. A similar analysis for ENSO events, however, hints that warm events (i.e., El Niño) are more likely following large volcanic eruptions than is typical of the model’s natural variability.",

            "abstract": "Lake Superior, Earth's largest lake by area, has seen a steady increase in nitrate levels over the past century, while phosphorus remains exceedingly low, resulting in an increasingly imbalanced stoichiometry. Although its ratio of watershed area:lake area is relatively small, rivers emptying into Lake Superior could be important drivers of long-term changes in lake stoichiometry. To better assess how the Lake Superior watershed affects its stoichiometry, we examined the chemistry of two of its largest tributaries, the Saint Louis River and the Nipigon River, at their confluences with Lake Superior. Both of these rivers have high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) but low nitrate (NO3) concentrations relative to the lake. Using simple mixing models, we found these nearshore confluences to create sinks of lake NO3 as a result of relatively high rates of denitrification. Climate change is altering the amounts and patterns of delivery of materials from land to lakes and we also examined the plume from a June, 2012 100-year flood in the Saint Louis River. Three days after this historic rain event, we found elevated chlorophyll levels throughout the plume, up to 5-fold higher than in the open lake. Combining our samples with satellite imagery, we conservatively estimate that this plume contained 598,000 kg of phosphorus in dissolved and particulate form, or 40% of the average annual P input to the lake. If storm events such as this occur with increasing frequency as predicted in climate change scenarios, the lake's productivity may increase and stoichiometry could become more balanced, through greater P input and increased N retention due to sedimentation and denitrification.",

            "abstract": "\"Science is the greatest of all adventure stories,\" says physicist Brian Greene, author of The Elegant Universe. \"It's been unfolding for thousands of years as we have sought to understand ourselves and our surroundings . . . and needs to be communicated in a manner that captures this drama.”\nCarl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson, the old and new storytelling hosts of Cosmos, would agree. So would Rachel Carson, who used one of the oldest and simplest of all story forms, the fable, to coax her readers into a complicated tale of pesticides, chemistry, and ecological succession. Silent Spring may well be the most influential science book of the last fifty years.\nMore than ever, scientists need to communicate clearly and passionately to the public, the media, and decision-makers. Not everyone can be as articulate as a Jane Goodall or an Alan Rabinowitz. But humans are storytelling animals, and recent communications research suggests that information conveyed in story form activates more parts of the brain than when it is conveyed by bullet point or other non-narrative ways. Even a shy and retiring researcher can easily learn to use, at minimum, small and subtle techniques to find common ground with an audience who will not forget the message. Additionally, much recent communications research suggests strongly that the most memorable and effective way to coomunicate with the public is by conveying shared values or common ground. Stories--common to virtually every human society over time--inherently do that. As a literary and nonfiction writer for 40 years, and a university teacher of nonfiction and science/nature wiritng for the last 30, I know this first hand as well as through core scholarship about literature and narrative theory.\nAmong other things, my talk will explore how some of the above science communication stars have used these sometimes-buried communication strategies--and how others can, too. Not crucial, but a brief interactive excerise I could conduct would help drive home some of these points.",

            "abstract": "The Magadi (Kenya) and Natron (Tanzania) basins of the East African Rift are in an early stage (< 7 Ma) of continental rifting. The many normal faults observed in these areas create sediment-filled basins and a large number of alkaline springs feed water into two major lakes (Lake Magadi and Natron). Earthquake swarms reported in 1998 (Magadi) and 2007 (Natron) were accompanied by surface ruptures. Although CO2 is a major component of magmatic volatiles and fault-related fluids that may facilitate earthquakes and fault weakening, the soil CO2 efflux of continental rifts is poorly known. Here, we report soil CO2 flux rates measured in the Magadi and Natron basins, and carbon isotope values (δ13C, ‰ vs. PDB) to constrain CO2sources.\n Soil CO2 fluxes were measured at fault zones, horsts, grabens, and surface ruptures by EGM-4 (PP systems) with a gas accumulation chamber. A t-shaped connector with a needle was used for gas sampling into evacuated glass vials with a rubber septum. δ13C values were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a gas bench at the stable isotope laboratory, University of New Mexico.\n The fault zones in the Magadi basin have higher maximum CO2 flux rates (< 533.52 g m-2 d-1) and heavier δ13C values (< -3.8 ‰) than the Natron basin (< 147.12 g m-2 d-1 and < -6.2 ‰, respectively). In both areas, soil CO2 efflux is insignificant (< 10 g m-2 d-1) in both horsts and the middle of grabens with lighter δ 13C values (~ -10 ‰) likely resulting from significant air contribution. The highest CO2 flux rates (< 919.44 g m-2 d-1) were measured at recent surface ruptures, but they have lighter δ13C values (-10 to -15 ‰), implying significant air and biogenic C contributions.\n Our results indicate that (1) normal faults are pathways that deliver mantle-derived CO2 to the surface, (2) the Magadi basin exhibits greater mantle-derived CO2 than the Natron basin, and (3) recent ruptures are zones of shallow CO2 degassing.",

            "abstract": "River flow is an integrated characteristic reflecting numerous environmental processes and their changes aggregated over the watershed areas. River discharge plays a significant role in the fresh-water budget of the Arctic Ocean and ocean salinity and sea ice formation are critically affected by river input. Changes in the fresh water flux to the ocean can exert significant control over global ocean circulation via the North Atlantic deepwater formation with consequences for north hemisphere climate. Thus, it is important to understand ongoing changes in streamflow across Eurasian pan-Arctic, which contributes 75% of the total terrestrial runoff to the Arctic Ocean.\nWe analyzed variability of the annual and monthly river discharge across the Eurasian pan-Arctic drainage basin based observational records until 2012. To analyze the monthly trends in river discharge we cannot use river monitoring stations located along many large rivers due to impoundments and other human impacts within the drainage basins. An analysis of monthly discharge records longer than 50 years for rivers with no significant human impacts has been applied to identify seasonal variations and changes in the hydrological regime. The results showed significant changes in winter and summer-autumn runoff across many regions of Eurasian pan-Arctic. We hypothesize that the possible cause of increased winter river runoff is the reduction of barriers between subsurface water reservoirs and surface runoff due to improved drainage pathways as the result of increasing winter air temperature and decreasing river ice. Using new data for river ice and discharge for small and medium size rivers in Russian pan-Arctic we have checked this hypothesis using integrated analysis of data for streamflow, river ice thickness and air temperature. Preliminary results have shown significant correlation between these parameters in many basins confirming the hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "Mineral dust aerosols often observed over California in winter and spring from long-range transport can be efficient ice nuclei (IN) and enhance snow precipitation in mixed-phase orographic clouds. On the other hand, local pollution particles can serve as good CCN and suppress warm rain, but their impacts on cold rain processes are uncertain. The main snow-forming mechanism in warm and cold mixed-phase orographic clouds (refer to as WMOC and CMOC, respectively) could be very different, leading to different precipitation response to CCN and IN. We have conducted 1-km resolution model simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a spectral-bin cloud microphysical model for WMOC and CMOC cases from CalWater2011. We investigated the response of cloud microphysical processes and precipitation to CCN and IN with extremely low to extremely high concentrations using ice nucleation parameterizations that connect with dust and implemented based on observational evidences. We find that riming is the dominant process for producing snow in WMOC while deposition plays a more important role than riming in CMOC. Increasing IN leads to much more snow precipitation mainly due to an increase of deposition in CMOC and increased rimming in WMOC. Increasing CCN decreases precipitation in WMOC by efficiently suppressing warm rain, although snow is increased. In CMOC where cold rain dominates, increasing CCN significantly increases snow, leading to a net increase in precipitation. The sensitivity of supercooled liquid to CCN and IN has also been analyzed. The mechanism for the increased snow by CCN and caveats due to uncertainties in ice nucleation parameterizations will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and quantifying the impact of biomass burning on measurement sites in the Western U.S. is important, as fire activity is thought to be strengthening due to climate change while population growth across the West has been increasing the number of people exposed to these wildfires. Fires can emit large quantities of species relevant for air quality, as well as carbon-containing gases (CO2, CO, CH4), thereby making it a source of carbon to the atmosphere. The intense, highly varying, and often localized nature of fire emissions render it difficult for models to capture the impact of biomass burning on atmospheric distributions of CO2 and other trace gases, particularly with emission inventories at resolutions that are coarse in comparison to the spatiotemporal variability of actual fires.\nIn this study, we present simulations of CO2, CO, and PM2.5 at measurement sites in the Western U.S. The modeling framework consists of (1) Receptor-oriented Lagrangian particle dispersion model simulations from the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model; (2) Nested meteorological fields from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model; and (3) High-resolution wildland fire emission inventories from the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory covering the entire Western U.S. The modeling framework enables researchers to investigate and quantify the impact of biomass burning emissions on trace gas sampling sites. For CO2, we will compare our estimates against values from NOAA’s CarbonTracker simulations. Differences from other existing emission inventories (e.g., GFED, FINN) will also be quantified. Examples will be shown at selected sites across the Western U.S, on mountains as well as lower elevations.",

            "abstract": "The importance of methanogenesis and percent of methane loss from the subsurface porewater in various northern wetland sites was quantified with isotope-mass balance equations. With equimolar amounts of CO2 and CH4 produced from methanogenesis, the amount of dissolved CO2 produced from methanogenesis as compared to other decomposition processes can be calculated and is equivalent to the amount of CH4 before loss due to ebullition, plant-mediated transport, and diffusion. This method was applied to porewater samples collected from various locations within permafrost collapse-scar bogs and northern peatlands. From the peatland sites, bogs produced less CO2-meth than fens (2.9 ± 1.3 mM and 3.7 ± 1.4 mM, respectively). Methanogenesis was a more utilized decomposition process in the bogs than the fens. However, greater amounts of CO2-meth found in fen sites was most likely due to the presence of more labile organic substrates resulting in greater overall production. More CH4 was lost in fens (89 ± 2.8%) than bogs (82 ± 5.3%) from plant-mediated transport as fens are dominated by vascular plants (Carex) while bogs are dominated by Sphagnum mosses. In permafrost sites, mid-bogs produced twice the amount of CO2-meth as bog moats (1.6 ± 0.63 mM and 0.82 ± 0.20 mM, respectively). Less methanogenesis was found in bog moats as recently thawed organic matter is exposed to initial decomposition processes and methane production grows over time. A similar amount of CH4 was lost from bog moats as mid bogs (63 ± 7.0% and 64 ± 9.3%, respectively) likely due to the greater density of vascular plants found within a bog moat.",

As these models are continually being improved and updated in order to address new questions for the research and policy communities, it is worth examining the consequences of the country-to-region mapping schemes used for model results. This study presents an application of a data processing system built for the GCAM integrated assessment model that allows any country-to-region assignments, with a minimum of four geopolitical regions and a maximum of 185. We test ten different mapping schemes, including the specific mappings used in existing major integrated assessment models. We also explore the impacts of clustering nations into regions according to the similarity of the structure of each nation’s energy and agricultural sectors, as indicated by multivariate analysis. Scenarios examined include a reference scenario, a low-emissions scenario, and scenarios with agricultural and buildings sector climate change impacts. We find that at the global level, the major output variables (primary energy, agricultural land use) are surprisingly similar regardless of regional assignments, but at finer geographic scales, differences are pronounced. We suggest that enhancing geographic resolution is advantageous for analysis of climate impacts on the buildings and agricultural sectors, due to the spatial heterogeneity of these drivers.",

            "abstract": "Marine gravity from satellite altimetry has become a primary tool for investigating the tectonics of the remote ocean basins as well as unexplored continental margins especially in the polar regions where shipboard data are sometimes sparse. Gravity field accuracy depends on three factors: spatial track density, altimeter range precision, and diverse track orientation. Recently two new non-repeat altimeter data sets have become available from CryoSat-2 and Jason-1 to augment the data provided by Envisat, Geosat, and ERS-1/2. One question that arises is what is the unique contribution of each altimeter? To answer that question we have constructed 5 global gravity models omitting data from CryoSat-2, Jason-1, Envisat, Geosat, and ERS-1/2 respectively. We find each satellite provides an important contribution. CryoSat-2 has the best polar coverage and highest track density so provides the greatest improvement overall. Envisat has excellent high latitude coverage where it provides the greatest improvement in the Arctic. Jason-1 has the lowest orbital inclination so provides a dramatic improvement in the E-W gravity component for latitudes < 60. We have verified an overall gravity accuracy in the Gulf of Mexico of 1.6 mGal. This is sufficient to reveal previously unknown sub-seafloor structure buried under sediment on the continental margins. The accuracy in the Arctic is generally worse and highly variable depending on the extent of permanent ice cover. The major error sources in marine gravity are now due to ice coverage, inaccurate coastal tide models, mesoscale variability, permanent dynamic topography, and the errors in land gravity, which migrate into the nearby oceans during the conversion from geoid height to gravity. The high-resolution gravity field (~80 km) being provided by the GOCE mission may help to reduce these error sources.",

            "abstract": "Interception of precipitation in sub-alpine forests is likely to be strongly reduced after wildfire, potentially producing large increases in net precipitation. Objectives of this study were to describe changes in rainfall and snow interception, and net precipitation after the severe 2003 Lost Creek wildfire as part of the Southern Rockies Watershed Project in the south-west Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. Throughfall troughs and stemflow gauges were used to explore relationships between throughfall, stemflow, and net rainfall with variation in gross rainfall in burned and undisturbed stands during the summers of 2006-2008. These relationships were used to scale the effects of the wildfire on net rainfall for the first decade after the wildfire (2004-2013) using a 10 year rainfall record in the watershed. Annual snowpack surveys (5 snow courses in each of burned and reference stands) measured peak snowpack depth, density, and snow water equivalent (SWE) for this same period.\nMean annual P was 1140 mm (684-1519 mm) during the first 10 years after the wildfire, with 61% falling as snow. Throughfall and stemflow in the burned forest accounted for 86% and 7% of gross rainfall, respectively, compared with 53% and 0.002% in the unburned stands in the summers of 2006-2008. Scaled rainfall interception relationships (=f(rainfall event size)) indicated annual increases in net rainfall were 192 mm/yr (133-347 mm) for 10 years after the fire. Similarly, mean increases in peak SWE were 134 mm/yr (93-216 mm). Collectively, the mean increase in net precipitation was 325 mm/yr (226-563 mm; 29%) for the first decade after the wildfire. Hydrologic forcing by increased net precipitation may be a particularly important element of wildfire impacts on sub-alpine watersheds. Furthermore, because of the very slow growth rates of sub-alpine forests, increases in net precipitation are likely to persist and affect precipitation-runoff relationships for decades in these environments.",

            "abstract": "Numerous studies investigated the influence of abiotic (meteorological conditions) and biotic factors (tree characteristics) on stemflow generation. Though these studies identified the variables that influence stemflow volumes in simply structured forests, the combination of tree characteristics that allows a robust prediction of stemflow volumes in species-rich forests is not well known. For many hydrological investigations, it would be useful if at least a rough estimate of stemflow volumes can be obtained based on tree characteristics. The need for robust predictions of stemflow motivated us to investigate the relations between tree characteristics and stemflow volumes in a species-rich tropical forest located in central Panama. With a sampling setup consisting of 10 rainfall collectors, 300 throughfall samplers, and 60 stemflow collectors and cumulated data comprising 26 rain events, we derive three main findings. First, stemflow represents a minor hydrological component in the studied 1 ha forest patch (0.98 % of cumulated rainfall). Second, in the studied species-rich forest, single tree characteristics are only weakly related to stemflow volumes. The influence of multiple tree parameters (e.g. crown diameter, presence of large epiphytes, and inclination of branches) and the dependencies among these parameters require a multivariate approach to understand the generation of stemflow. Third, predicting stemflow in species-rich forests based on tree parameters is a difficult task. Although the best model can capture the variation in stemflow to some degree, a critical validation reveals that the model cannot provide robust predictions of stemflow. A reanalysis of data from previous studies in species-rich forests corroborates this finding. Based on these results we discuss several options for quantifying stemflow volumes in species-rich forests.",

Simulations also confirmed that Poynting flux and soft electron precipitation significantly change the neutral density and dynamics around the cusp. Commonly the enhancement of Poynting flux and the enhancement of soft electron precipitation are expected to happen at the same time and same location. Through analyzing DMSP observation data, the correlation between them is found to be more complex. In some cases the time and locations of Poynting flux and soft electron precipitation enhancements are rather consistent, while are quite different in other cases. Several possible mechanisms for the different correlations have been investigated as well. This result will improve our understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, especially in the cusp region.",

            "abstract": "Mid-ocean ridges and hotspots are ideal environments to constrain the definition of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). LAB depth is expected to be significantly different in these regions depending on the definition of the plate. A purely thermal definition should deepen with age and distance from the ridge and shallow in the presence of a thermal plume anomaly. Whereas, compositional boundaries could exist at constant depth, possibly deepened by a thermal plume anomaly. We use S-to-P receiver functions to image upper mantle discontinuities beneath Iceland. We image a strong velocity decrease with depth at 45 – 80 km depth that is likely associated with the LAB. The phase undulates in depth, shallowest beneath the ridge, deeper in adjacent regions near ~9 My old seafloor, and shallow again at great distances from the ridge. The depth variations do not show simple thickening with seafloor age, even when effects of thermal plume anomalies are taken into account. The phase is also deeper and its magnitude greater than predictions for a thermal plate based on experimental constraints. The observation is better explained by a compositionally defined lithosphere with thickness dictated by temporal variation in thermal plume anomaly magnitude. Indeed, periodic plume pulsing has been hypothesized to explain variations in crustal thickness and gravity at the nearby Reykjanes Ridge. Our model suggests that thicker lithosphere is created at the ridge during times of plume pulsing, e.g., ~9 My. The thickened plate is subsequently rifted apart and thinner lithosphere is created until another pulse occurs. Comparison to experimental predictions for half-space cooling adjusted for regional crustal thickness suggests melt is likely required beneath the discontinuity to explain large velocity drops (~10 – 15%). Indeed, a velocity increase with depth is imaged at 160 km depth just east of Iceland that is likely the base of the melt rich layer. This suggests the plume approaches the island from the east, consistent recent eastward ridge jumps. Comparisons with other hotspot environments including Galapagos, Hawaii, and Afar suggest compositional components to the definition of the lithosphere, plume ascents that are non-vertical, and melt residence in the mantle at time and length scales that are seismically imageable.",

Data from the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope was used to compile a selection of solar flares with significant emission at energies greater than 150keV. These flares were then analysed and models were fitted to the spectra. The comparisons on these models, particularly with regards to the proficiency of broken power laws relative to single power laws, were used to determine the best fit for each flare.

            "abstract": "Extreme heating of soils during fires can have long-term and irreversible consequences and given the increasing use of prescribed fire by land managers and the increasing probability of wildfires associated with global warming, one approach to improving understanding of these consequences is to better understand and model the dynamics of the coupled heat, (liquid) moisture, and vapor transport in soils during extreme heating events. The present study describes a model developed to simulate non-equilibrium soil evaporation and the transport of heat, moisture, and water vapor under conditions during fires where the surface heating of the soil often ranges between 10,000 and 100,000 Wm-2 for several minutes to several hours. The Hertz-Knudsen equation is the basis for constructing the model's non-equilibrium evaporative source term. Model performance is tested against laboratory measurements of soil temperature and moisture changes. Testing the present model with different formulations for soil hydraulic conductivity, water retention curve, water activity, and the non-equilibrium evaporative source term, indicates that virtually all the model's successes result from the use of a temperature dependent condensation coefficient in the evaporative source term, a rather surprising and unexpected result. On the other hand, the model solution is not a completely faithful representation of the laboratory data. Nevertheless, this new non-equilibrium model circumvents many of the problems that plagued an equilibrium model developed for the same purpose (Massman 2012: Water Resources Research 48, WR011710) and provides a much more physically realistic simulation than the earlier model. Finally, the present model should provide insight into modeling of heat and mass transport and evaporation, not only during high temperature and low moisture conditions, but for modeling these soil processes under less extreme environmental conditions as well.",

            "abstract": "Life on Earth as we know it is impossible without water. Its importance to biological diversity, human well-being and the very functioning of the Earth-system cannot be overstressed, but we have remarkably little detailed knowledge concerning the spatial and temporal distribution of this vital resource. Earth observing satellites operating with high temporal revisits yet moderate spatial resolution have provided global datasets documenting spatial and temporal changes to water bodies on the Earth’s surface. Landsat 8 has a data acquisition strategy such that global coverage of all land surfaces now occurs more frequently than from any preceding Landsat mission and provides 30 m resolution data. Whilst not the last word in temporal sampling this presents a basis for mapping and monitoring changes to global surface water resources at unprecedented levels of spatial detail. In this paper we provide a first 30 m resolution global synthesis of surface water occurrence, we document permanent water surfaces, seasonal water surfaces and always-dry surfaces. These products have been derived by optimizing a methodology previously developed for use with moderate resolution MODIS imagery for use with Landsat 8. The approach is based on a transformation of RGB color space into HSV combined with a sequence of cloud, topographic and temperature masks. Analysis at the global scale used the Google Earth Engine platform applied to all Landsat 8 acquisitions between June 2013 and June 2014. Systematic validation is done and demonstrated our ability to map surface water. Our method can be applied to other Landsat missions offering the potential to document changes in surface water over three decades; our study shows examples illustrating the capacity to map new water surfaces and ephemeral water surfaces in addition to the three previous classes. Thanks to an optimized data acquisition strategy, a full-free and open data policy and the processing capacity of the GEE global land surface process monitoring at Landsat-class resolution is a reality. However high temporal revisit is needed to improve inter and intra annual characterization and we expect further improvements to the new products presented here as we complement the Landsat program with data from the forthcoming Sentinel 2 mission, and potentially others too.",

            "abstract": "Some species are rare because they are restricted to certain habitats and/or have small population sizes. Monterey spineflower, a federally listed threatened annual plant, is found in open sandy regions of the California coast, in chaparral vegetation around the Monterey Bay. A model based on previous research suggests that the Monterey spineflower population at Fort Ord Natural Reserve should be rapidly increasing, but it is not. This suggests that the model may be using data that overestimates the percentage of spineflower seeds that successfully germinate. I tested three hypotheses to determine the cause of the difference in population sizes between the predicted model and the field results. First, I predicted that the spineflower seeds are blown by the wind into shrubs such as manzanita, and are unable to germinate due to the lack of a suitable environment. I tested this in two ways. A field experiment showed that seeds are easily blow by wind. Next, I took soil cores and found spineflower seeds within the manzanita shrubs. Secondly, I predicted that the germination rate used by the model (90%) was too high. However, my germination experiments did not support this hypothesis because 91% of new seeds successfully germinated. Lastly, I predicted that the newer seeds are more viable than older seeds and therefore have a higher chance of successfully germinating. After germinating seeds in a controlled environment I observed that the seeds from 2014 had a higher number of successfully germinated seeds compared to the number of successfully germinated seeds from 1995 (91% vs 33%). I conclude that the loss of seeds due to wind decreases germination expectancies and older seeds are less viable than new seeds. Therefore, Monterey spineflower is a rare plant because environmental barriers hinder seeds from dispersing to a suitable habitat and successfully germinating while seeds lose viability as they age.",

Riming is generally thought to lead to larger, heavier particles with higher terminal velocities. Yet models commonly assume that heavily rimed particles such as graupel have a fixed density and that their settling speed is unaffected by turbulence in storms. Here we show automated measurements of photographed hydrometeor shape and fallspeed using a Multi Angle Snowflake Camera placed in Utah's Wasatch Mountain Range. The data show that graupel in low turbulence conditions has a size-dependent fallspeed distribution with a mode near 1 m/s, a result that is generally consistent with prior observations. However, the distributions are broadened by turbulence and a correspondence between particle density and air temperature. In high turbulence and at low temperatures, any sensitivity of fallspeed to particle size disappears.",

            "abstract": "Ice cores from ice sheets in Antarctica provide valuable records of past climates encompassing hundreds of thousands of years. Chemical and mineralogical characterization of aerosol mineral particles (dust) transported through the atmosphere and deposited on ice sheets and glaciers provide insight into the regional and global climate conditions during a time period. Elemental and isotopic analysis of dust entrapped in ice aids in determining provenance, with variations signifying changes in dust production, sources and transport pathways, indicating an evolving local and/or global climate. We present radiogenic isotope and elemental compositions of insoluble dust entrained in a coastal Antarctic ice core during the transition from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the Holocene. A series of 15 samples from the Taylor Dome ice core, 113-391 m in depth covering a time period of 1.8-31.5 ka were analyzed using traditional Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS) equipped with 10-11 Ohm resistors (87Sr/86Sr) and 10-13 Ohm resistors (143Nd/144Nd). We determined trace (TE) and rare earth element (REE) concentrations by Inductively Coupled Plasma Sector Field Mass Spectrometry (ICP-SFMS) and dust concentration and size distribution by Coulter Counter. The radiogenic isotopic compositions of glacial dust agrees with previously measured Antarctic dust: 87Sr/86Sr= 0.7052 – 0.7124 and εNd= -0.9 – -4.7, whereas Holocene dust displays a broader range from 87Sr/86Sr= 0.7054 – 0.7163 and εNd= -0.9 – -7.1, suggesting a shift from globally transported dust to more variable local input following the LGM to Holocene transition. The REE and TE concentrations display typical East Antarctic ice core dust patterns. The average dust particle diameter increases from ~1.8 to ~3 μm with decreasing depositional age, supporting the alteration in dust transport mechanism hypothesis. Our results display dust concentrations of >500 and <15 ppb during glacial and interglacial periods respectively, which are consistent with dust concentration analyses of interior Antarctic ice cores. We present the first radiogenic isotope dust data of a coastal Antarctic ice core during the Holocene, with distinct differences in dust characteristics during the LGM-Holocene transition indicating changes in dust provenance.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic materials (SOM) in atmospheric aerosols are often mixed with inorganic components. Condensed-phase SOM can exist in a liquid, semi-solid, or solid state at different temperatures and RH. We investigated the effects of phase states of SOM on the reactions of SOM from ozonolysis of limonene (LSOM) and α-pinene (PSOM) with NaCl using a set of complementary micro-spectroscopic analyses. SOM can react with NaCl and result in chloride depletion in the condensed phase, release of gaseous HCl, and formation of organic salts. The reactions driven by the high volatility of HCl are attributed to acid displacement by SOM acidic components. Similar reactions can take place in SOM/NaNO3 particles. Glass transition temperatures and viscosity of PSOM were estimated. The results show that the reaction depends on SOM composition, phase state and viscosity, mixing state, and reaction time. The release and potential recycling of HCl and HNO3 from reacted aerosol particles may have important implications for atmospheric chemistry. This reaction can modify particle physicochemical properties, such as the ability to form clouds, and thus may have important atmospheric implications.",

GEM, an annual workshop funded by the NSF, allows students to present their research in a collaborative atmosphere and to engage with senior scientists as peers. This builds confidence in the students, while also allowing them to share ideas and strengthen their research. Each GEM workshop starts with a student-run and organized “student day”, in which older students volunteer to present tutorials on different magnetospheric systems and processes. These tutorials strive to put the upcoming week of talks and posters in context while providing an overarching base understanding of the magnetospheric system. By starting the week with student taught tutorials, as well as icebreaker activities, the students become comfortable with asking questions and set the tone for the less formal student and discussion-oriented workshop.",

            "abstract": "Despite convincing evidence of deep ocean warming, temperature changes over the shelves have proven difficult to quantify as most long-term records lack the spatial and temporal resolution needed to resolve shelf variability. XBT data have been collected for 37 years along a repeat track from New Jersey to Bermuda from the MV Oleander providing the resolution necessary for shelf analysis. The XBT temperature data on the shelf (onshore of the 80 m isobath) were binned with 10 km horizontal and 5 m vertical resolution to produce monthly and annually averaged temperature sections. A climatology produced from the binned data identifies key seasonal temperature features consistent with previous climatologies, showing the utility of the XBT data. Annual spatially-averaged shelf temperatures have trended upwards since the beginning of the record in 1977 (0.025 C/yr), with recent trends (i.e., since 2002, 0.10 C/yr) substantially larger than the overall 37- year trend. Comparison of composite sections for the most anomalous years suggests that the interannual variability in the spatially-averaged temperatures is most heavily influenced by temperature anomalies near the shelf break.\nThe spatially-averaged temperature anomalies are not correlated with annually-averaged coastal sea level anomalies from tide gauges at zero lag, which suggest that interannual variability in coastal sea level is not due to thermo steric effects. However, a strong positive correlation is found between 2-year lagged temperature anomalies and coastal sea level anomalies. This relationship is most pronounced for the shelf break temperature anomalies, with the strongest 2-year lag correlations found in winter and spring. Connections between the observed interannual to decadal temperature variability on the shelf and variability in the AMOC are being investigated in an ongoing effort to better understand open-ocean/shelf interactions in the Northwest Atlantic.",

We use the latest version of WRF (v3.6, Apr 2014), which incorporates the Kain-Fritsch (KF) convective parameterization to provide subgrid-scale cloud fraction and condensate feedback to the rapid radiative transfer model-global (RRTMG) shortwave and longwave radiation schemes. We apply the KF scheme to simulate the DISCOVER-AQ Maryland field campaign (July 2011), and compare the sensitivity of meteorological parameters to the control run that does not include subgrid cloudiness. Furthermore, we will examine the chemical impact from subgrid cloudiness using a regional chemical transport model (CMAQ). There are several meteorological parameters influenced by subgrid cumulus clouds that are very important to air quality modeling, including changes in surface temperature that impact biogenic emission rates; changes in PBL depth that affect pollutant concentrations; and changes in surface humidity levels that impact peroxide-related reactions. Additionally, subgrid cumulus clouds directly impact air pollutant concentrations by modulating photochemistry and vertical mixing. Finally, we will compare with DISCOVER-AQ flight observation data and evaluate how well this off-line CMAQ simulation driven by WRF with the KF scheme simulates the effects of regional convection on atmospheric composition.",

            "abstract": "We searched for evidence of tidal and surface wave triggering of earthquakes at thirteen different well injection sites around the United States. We assembled earthquake catalogs in regions surrounding thirteen injection/geothermal sites, seven of which are in California, one in Oregon, and five in the Midwestern United States. After temporally declustering the catalogs, we tested each site for evidence of tidal triggering by applying the Schuster test at periods between 10.8 and 26.4 hours. We defined “triggering” at a given period as the time when the Schuster probability exceeds 99% confidence. In general, there was little evidence for tidal triggering of earthquakes at the injection/geothermal sites we investigated. The one exception was seismicity at the Geysers, CA, which was triggered at the M2 semidiurnal lunar period. Many sites also had amplitudes that exceeded 99% confidence at 24 hour periods, however since these sites had no evidence of triggering at the larger M2 tidal period, we consider this to be an anthropogenic effect.\nNext we searched for triggering by Mw 7 or above global earthquakes and Mw 4-7 regional earthquakes. We quantified the influence of the regional and global earthquakes on seismicity at each injection/geothermal site using the beta statistic, which is a measure of the change in seismicity rate before and after the triggering event occurs. In general, we found evidence for triggering by regional/global earthquakes at most sites. We also explored the relationship of activation to other site variables such as wellhead pressure, monthly injection, monthly production, and cumulative injection/production volumes when available. While the beta statistic does correlate with obvious variables such as the distance between the site and the triggering event it doesn’t appear to correlate with the aforementioned site-specific variables.",

For post-mission analysis, we have produced a high resolution (25 km) meteorological and aerosol reanalysis for the entire campaign period. In addition to the full meteorological observing system used for routine NWP, we assimilate 550 nm aerosol optical depth (AOD) derived from MODIS (both Aqua and Terra satellites), ground-based AERONET sun photometers, and the MISR instrument (over bright surfaces only). Daily biomass burning emissions of CO, CO2, SO2, and aerosols are derived from MODIS fire radiative power retrievals. We have also introduced novel smoke “age” tracers, which provide, for a given time, a snapshot histogram of the age of simulated smoke aerosol. Because GEOS-5 assimilates remotely sensed AOD data, it generally reproduces observed (column) AOD compared to, for example, the airborne 4-STAR instrument. Constraining AOD, however, does not imply a good representation of either the vertical profile or the aerosol microphysical properties (e.g., composition, absorption). We do find a reasonable vertical structure for aerosols is attained in the model, provided actual smoke injection heights are not much above the planetary boundary layer, as verified with observations from DIAL/HRSL aboard the DC8. The translation of the simulated aerosol microphysical properties to total column AOD, needed in the aerosol assimilation step, is based on prescribed mass extinction efficiencies that depend on wavelength, composition, and relative humidity. Here we also evaluate the performance of the simulated aerosol speciation by examining in situ retrievals of aerosol absorption/single scattering albedo and scattering growth factor (f(RH)) from the LARGE and AOP suite of instruments. Putting these comparisons in the context of smoke age as diagnosed by the model helps us to revise assumed aerosol optical properties for an improved representation of aerosol radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "Reactive Fe (oxyhydr)oxides preferentially undergo early diagenetic cycling and may cause a diffusive flux of dissolved Fe2+ from sediments towards the sediment-water interface. The partitioning of Fe in sediments has traditionally been studied by applying sequential extractions based on reductive dissolution of Fe minerals. We complemented the sequential leaching method by Poulton and Canfield [1] in order to be able to gain δ56Fe data for specific Fe fractions, as such data are potentially useful to study Fe cycling in marine environments. The specific mineral fractions are Fe-carbonates, ferrihydrite + lepidocrocite, goethite + hematite, and magnetite. Leaching was performed with acetic acid, hydroxylamine-HCl, Na-dithionite and oxalic acid. The processing of leachates for δ56Fe analysis involved boiling the samples in HCl/HNO3/H2O2, Fe precipitation and anion exchange column chromatography.\nThe new method was applied to short sediment cores from the North Sea and a bay of King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica). Downcore mineral-specific variations in δ56Fe revealed differing contributions of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides to redox cycling. A slight decrease in easily reducible Fe oxides correlating with a slight increase in δ56Fe for this fraction with depth, which is in line with progessive dissimilatory iron reduction [2,3], is visible in the top 10 cm of the North Sea core, but not in the antarctic sediments. Less reactive (dithionite and oxalate leachable) fractions did not reveal isotopic trends. The acetic acid-soluble fraction displayed pronounced δ56Fe trends at both sites that cannot be explained by acid volatile sulfides that are also extracted by acetic acid [1]. We suggest that low δ56Fe values in this fraction relative to the pool of easily reducible Fe oxides result from adsorbed Fe(II) that was open to isotopic exchange with oxide surfaces, affirming the experimental results of Crosby el al. [2]. Hence, δ56Fe analyses on marine sediments appear to be particularly useful when targeting specific Fe pools, rather than the total highly reactive Fe fraction, since isotopic trends may be masked within the latter pool.\n[1] Poulton and Canfield (2005), Chemical Geology 214, 209-221.\n[2] Crosby et al., Geobiology 5 (2007), 169-189.\n[3] Staubwasser et al., Geology 34 (2006), 629-632.",

Each stationary network site has a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker, EM27Sun), a UV-visible grating spectrometer (Pandora) and a LIDAR (Sigma Space, Mini MPL) to provide PBL height.\nTwo EM27Sun Fourier transform spectrometers at fixed locations are complemented by our self-developed solar-tracking Fourier transform spectrometer (Nicolet) to be used as a mobile unit to acquire cross-sectional slices of total column burdens across the urban dome. In additional to O2, CO2, CH4, H2O measurements, this system is also capable of measuring CO and N2O. This compact, inexpensive instrument uses a diffuser as a part of the tracking optics, which results in a rugged and simplified system. A novel camera-based active tracking schema is developed: the sun image on the diffuser is always regulated to the same position to ensure an accurate tracking.\nIn this paper we will show comparisons between the self-developed solar-tracking system and the commercial Bruker EM27Sun. In addition, initial data for the retrieved column concentrations in and outside of the Boston urban dome will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the impacts of land-use changes on tidal rivers over millennial time scales is critical to better predict the long-term impact of current management practices on estuarine water resources. The Christina River, a tidal river which flows into the Delaware River near Wilmington, Delaware, has been impacted by diverse land-use changes. Following European settlement, the region was largely deforested and converted to agriculture, increasing sediment and nutrient inputs. Later industrialization and urbanization affected the region with the growth of cities and the installation of refineries and factories, all of which further input nutrients as well as other chemicals. To better understand these changes, diatom samples were collected from vibracores taken in the fresh to oligohaline marshes surrounding the tidal portion of the river. Lead-210, cesium-137, and carbon-14 dating were used to date the sediments. Diatoms were analyzed to determine how the communities changed with time, from the present to approximately 1350-1410 years ago, in response to natural and anthropogenic impacts. Preliminary analyses indicate large shifts in the relative abundances in diatom species, as well as changes in the species present. Species richness and diversity indices were affected as well, generally being higher around and before the start of the 20th century. Additionally, the ratio of centric to pennate diatom species, an indicator of turbidity and phytoplankton productivity, appears to peak early in the 20th century. Continued research will identify additional trends and use the autecology of the species present in each sample to further analyze environmental changes.",

The SC-CSC is distinct from all other CSCs in that we have strategically included non-traditional collaborators directly within our governing consortium.\nThe SC-CSC is the only CSC to include any Tribal nations amongst our consortium (the Chickasaw Nation and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma) and to employ a full-time tribal liaison. As a result and in partnership with Tribes, we are able to identify the unique challenges that the almost 70 federally recognized Tribes within our region face. We also can develop culturally sensitive research projects or outreach efforts that bridge western science and traditional knowledge to address their needs. In addition, the SC-CSC is the only CSC to include another federal institution (GFDL) amongst our consortium membership. GFDL is a world-leader in climate modeling and model interpretation. Partnering GFDL’s expertise in the evaluation of climate models and downscaling methods with the SC-CSC’s stakeholder-driven approach allows for the generation and dissemination of guidance documents and training to accompany the high quality datasets already in development.\nThis presentation will highlight the success stories and co-benefits of the SC-CSC’s collaborations with Tribal nations and with GFDL, as well as include information on how other partners can connect to our ongoing efforts.",

We have assessed the long-term, large-scale landscape evolution of the region using thermochronologic analysis. Detrital apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He samples from the Selenga River (n = 55) and Orkhon River (n = 15) basins north of the Hangay Dome yield central ages of 134.2 ± 6 and 131.3 ± 9.8 (1σ) Ma, respectively. The regional granitic bedrock apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He single grain age distribution is approximately 95 to 200 Ma, with a homogenized grain central age of 131.2 ± 6.1 Ma. These low-temperature data, in conjunction with K-feldspar MDD 40Ar/39Ar ages of ~200-230 Ma, suggest regional exhumation in the Mesozoic. HeFTy (Ketcham, 2005) modeling corroborates these data and suggests cooling rates of ~3°C/Ma from 220-185 Ma, and applying a geothermal gradient of 21 ± 3°C/km for central Mongolia (Lysak and Dorofeeva, 2003), rock uplift rates from Late Triassic to Mid-Late Jurassic are approximately 100 m/My and from the Early Cretaceous (130 Ma) to the present approximately ≤ 30 m/My. Regional bedrock age patterns, detrital age populations, and thermal modeling suggest that significant recent, rapid rock uplift in central Mongolia is unlikely. Pecube thermo-kinematic models (Braun, 2003) indicate that any rapid (> 500 m/My) event in the Late Miocene-Pliocene would produce Early-Mid Cenozoic cooling ages in lower elevations of the Selenga River drainage basin, which is not supported by the detrital age signal. Pecube modeling of slow rock uplift rates of <50 m/My since the Early Triassic produce regional ages in agreement with geomorphic and geochronologic data. Regional apatite helium age-elevation patterns suggest long-term thermal stability of the upper crust and possible lowering of relief since Mesozoic exhumation. Basalt total fusion 40Ar/39Ar ages demonstrate the existence of Hangay Dome paleotopography since the Early Miocene and subsequent Miocene-Pliocene base level rearrangement and landscape incision. Alpine cirques and preserved moraines are indicative of a more recent, climate-driven erosional signal in the higher peaks of the western Hangay, possibly augmented by modest surface uplift over the past 10 m.y.",

            "abstract": "Urban areas are home to 80% of the US population and 70% of energy related fossil fuel emissions originate from urban areas. Efforts to accurately monitor, report, and verify anthropogenic CO2 missions using atmospheric measurements require reliable partitioning of anthropogenic and biogenic sources. Anthropogenic emissions peak during the daytime, coincident with biogenic drawdown of CO2. In contrast, biogenic respiration emissions peak at night when anthropogenic emissions are lower. This temporal aliasing of fluxes requires careful modeling of both biogenic and anthropogenic fluxes for accurate source attribution through inverse modeling. Biogenic fluxes in urban regions can be a significant component of the urban carbon cycle. However, vegetation in urban areas is subject to longer growing seasons, reduced competition, higher rates of nitrogen deposition, and altered patterns of biomass inputs, all interacting to elevate C turnover rates relative to analogous non-urban ecosystems. These conditions suggest that models that ignore urban vegetation or base biogenic flux estimates on non-urban forests are likely to produce inaccurate estimates of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.\nBiosphere models often omit biogenic fluxes in urban areas despite potentially extensive vegetation coverage. For example, in Massachusetts, models mask out as much as 40% of land area, effectively assuming they have no biological flux. This results in a ~32% underestimate of aboveground biomass (AGB) across the state as compared to higher resolution vegetation maps. Our analysis suggests that some common biomass maps may underestimate forest biomass by ~520 Tg C within the state of Massachusetts. Moreover, omitted portions of the state have the highest population density, indicating that we know least about regions where most people live. We combine remote sensing imagery of urban vegetation cover with ground surveys of tree growth and mortality to improve estimates of aboveground biomass and biogenic flux rates. Updated biogenic flux rates are combined with spatially explicit anthropogenic flux estimates and a network of urban CO2 monitoring sites as the foundation for a novel carbon monitoring system spanning the Boston-Washington D.C. metropolitan corridor.",

            "abstract": "The seasonal evolution of sea ice loss in the Beaufort Sea during 1979-2012 is examined, focusing on spatial differences between eastern and western sectors. Two stages in ice loss are identified: “opening” is defined as the spring decrease in ice concentration from its winter maximum below a value of 80% areal concentration; “retreat” is the summer decrease below 15% concentration. We consider three aspects of the problem, i.e. (i) the long-term mean, (ii) long-term linear trends, and (iii) year-to-year variability. We find that in the mean, ice opening occurs earliest in the southeast Beaufort Sea (SEB), forced by atmospheric heating acting on particularly thin ice relative to the southwestern Beaufort Sea (SWB). This thin SEB ice arises from divergence forced by easterly winds in fall and spring. There is no significant long-term trend in the date of SEB ice opening, although ice opening in the SWB is in fact trending toward earlier dates. This means that spatial differences in opening dates across the Beaufort Sea have been shrinking over the past 33 years, i.e., these dates are becoming more synchronous, a situation which may impact human and marine mammal activity in the area. Synchronicity in ice retreat dates is also increasing, although with no statistical significance at this time. Finally, we find that in any given year, an increase in monthly mean easterly winds of ~ 1 m/s during spring is associated with earlier summer retreat of 9-15 days, offering predictive capability with 1-2 months lead time.",

            "abstract": "A vast fraction of the South American Dry Chaco ecoregion still relies on rainwater harvesting (RWH) to support, not only livestock production, but domestic and industrial uses as well. As a result, water capture and storage infrastructure is widely disseminated throughout the region. In this work we characterized the most typical RWH systems in two contrastingly developed sub-regions of Dry Chaco ranging from extensive ranching to intensive beef and dairy production (central Argentina and western Paraguay, respectively). In each sub-region, we quantified RWH density, spatial distribution and associations with landscape features; by other hand, we illustrated how the daily dynamic of water stock in a typical RWH system contributes to assess their capture and storage efficiency. We found that randomly distributed, low-tech RWH systems prevail in central Argentina, while clustered and hi-tech systems do it in western Paraguay. Their density was highly contrasting between sub-regions (0.098 vs. 0.94 units/ km2 in central Argentina and western Paraguay, respectively), being exponentially associated with land cleared fraction and proximity to villages. The daily monitoring of water level suggested a positive but complex response of water capture to precipitation. The elongated catchment area, created by roads and trails, could have partially decoupled local precipitation and water yield of the impoundment, favouring the capture of remote precipitation events and generating highly variable water yield under large local precipitation events. Once stored, the rates of water level decline suggested that infiltration exceeded evaporation as a water output pathway (59 vs. 41%, respectively, of total losses). Across both study areas, RWH accounts for less than 1% of the annual precipitation, playing a minor role on the regional water balance; however at a local level, they can affect several hydrological fluxes including the onset of groundwater recharge and the mitigation of extreme runoff events along roads and trails.",

One component of this campaign was investigating 37 shallow snowpits along the route to characterize stratigraphy and microphysics, and also to collect samples for chemical analyses. All of the pits were sampled continuously at 3 cm resolution to depths encompassing the most recent year of accumulation (spring 2013 to spring 2014). Selected pits were sampled continuously from the surface down to the layer corresponding to summer 2012, results presented will be restricted to the top year of all pits. Large differences in the annual accumulation and seasonal variations of black carbon and major ions were observed between the pits. Some of these gradients were expected, as the traverse route covered a large range in both distance from the coast and elevation. In addition, we find significant differences in accumulation of chemical impurities in some pits that were relatively close together, especially in the lower and steeper parts of the traverse route. We hypothesize that the combination of local topography and the tracks of individual snow storms create higher variability over small spatial scales along the slopes of the ice sheet compared to the interior.",

            "abstract": "The alpine tundra is a mosaic of comingled vegetation communities that vary predominantly as a function of landscape position, micro-scale topography, subsurface permeability, and resultant soil moisture availability. We characterized the spatio-temporal variability of soil respiration from 17 alpine tundra sites across an irregular soil moisture gradient within the footprint of ongoing eddy covariance measurements over the 2011 (wet year) and 2012 (dry year) growing seasons. We then used a soil moisture threshold as a proxy to separate the sites into fellfield, dry/moist meadow, and wet meadow tundra vegetation communities. Soil moisture and soil respiration were significantly correlated across all communities (p << 0.001), but increasing soil moisture invoked a bidirectional response from fellfield and dry/moist meadow communities (directly proportional) relative to wet meadow communities (inversely proportional). Soil temperature and soil respiration were not significantly correlated. Linearly interpolating between sampling dates, the cumulative soil respiration flux over the two growing seasons ranged from 595 to 3177 g CO2 m-2, and median fluxes were 1114, 1679, and 1400 g CO2 m-2 for fellfield, dry/moist meadow, and wet meadow sites, respectively. Ecosystem respiration from nighttime eddy covariance measurements was 618 g CO2 m-2 over the same period, suggesting that soil respiration fluxes from very dry fellfield tundra disproportionately influenced the eddy covariance data. Overall, cumulative soil respiration was 50% greater in the wet year (2011) relative to the dry year (2012); therefore increased precipitation has the potential to increase soil respiration from alpine tundra as a whole.",

Here, we report on observations of this ‘pulsing’ slip obtained from advanced multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. The surface deformation time series show a strong correlation to the previously documented slip rate variations derived from repeating earthquakes on the fault interface, at various spatial and temporal scales. Time series analysis reveals a quasi-periodic pulsing with approximately 2-year-long intervals along some sections of the fault in both InSAR and repeating earthquake datasets, with the earthquakes on the fault interface lagging behind the far-field deformation by about six months. This suggests a temporal delay between the pulsing crustal strain generated by deep-seated shear and the time-variable slip on the shallow fault interface, and that at least in some places this process may be cyclical.",

            "abstract": "Fram Strait, the Arctic Ocean's only deep passage for exchange with lower latitude oceans, today serves as a conduit for waters flowing north into the Arctic Ocean and south into the Atlantic. Reconstruction of circulation patterns and strength at depth in the strait can help to clarify the history of Arctic/Atlantic deep water exchange and Arctic contributions to global meridional overturning circulation. We will present new sedimentary measurements of radioisotopes 231Pa and 230Th to provide information on this exchange in the past and its relationship to sedimentation and climatic events. Coretop and downcore 231Pa/230Th ratios from Arctic sediments indicate that 231Pa has been exported from the central Arctic basin throughout the Holocene and deglaciation. Fram Strait represents a possible sink for this “missing” 231Pa. Preliminary results from ODP Holes 908A and 909A, at 1274 m and 2519 m water depths respectively in the central strait, suggest that ratios in this region during the Holocene have varied between ~0.106 (above the 231Pa/230Th production ratio of 0.093 in seawater, indicating net import of 231Pa)and ~0.055 (well below the production ratio, indicating net export of 231Pa). Further measurements in cores from the Greenland and Svalbard continental slopes will give a fuller regional picture of 231Pa deposition and transport across the strait.",

Both optical, spectroscopic and x-ray diffraction data of post-heated samples indicate that SiC melts incongruently at high pressure following a positive Clapeyron slope.

            "abstract": "Micro-diamonds, moissanite and many highly reduced minerals, such as native Fe, Cr, Ni, Si, Al, and metallic alloys, have been reported previously from podiform chromitites and peridotites of the Luobusa ophiolite in the eastern segment of the Yarlung-Zangbo suture of southern Tibet.. Similar mineral associations have now been confirmed in mantle peridotites or chromitites of 11 other ophiolites in 5 orogenic belts, in Tibet, Myanmar, North China and the Polar Urals. However, detailed studies of the Luobusa ophiolite show that not all chromitites contain these UHP and highly reduced minerals. Diamond-bearing chromitites are chiefly massive bodies composed of over 95 modal% magnesiochromite with Cr#s [100Cr/(Cr+Al)] of 77-83 and Mg#s [100Mg/(Mg+Fe)] of 71-82. Most of these bodies have sharp contacts with the host harzburgites and are only rarely enclosed in dunite envelopes. Many magnesiochromite grains in the massive chromitites contain inclusions of forsterite and pyroxene. Forsterite inclusions have Fo numbers of 97-99 and NiO contents of 1.11-1.29 wt%. Mg#s of clinopyroxene inclusions are 96-98 and those of orthopyroxene are 96-97. X-ray studies show that the olivine inclusions have very small unit cells and short cation-oxygen bond distances, suggesting crystallization at high pressure. In contrast, diamond-free chromitites typically occur as layers within thick dunite sequences or as irregular patches surrounded by dunite envelopes. They consist of variable proportions of magnesiochromite (Cr# = 76-78; Mg# = 58-61) and olivine, and have banded, nodular and disseminated textures. The dunite envelopes consist chiefly of granular olivine with a few relatively large, amoeboidal grains of magnesiochromite, and typically grade into the host peridotites with increasing pyroxene. Unlike those in the massive ores, magnesiochromite grains in nodular and disseminated chromitites lack pyroxene inclusions, and their olivine inclusions have relatively low Fo (94-96) and NiO (0.35-0.58 wt%).\nWe propose that the diamond-bearing chromitite ores formed within the deeper parts of the upper mantle and were emplaced at an oceanic spreading ridge, whereas the diamond-free chromitites formed at shallow levels by melt/rock reaction, most likely in a SSZ environment.",

            "abstract": "The silicate Earth has a heavy silicon isotopic composition relative to all chondrite groups, which was taken as evidence for the presence of sufficient amounts of silicon in Earth's core to explain its density deficit. A difficulty remains, however, in that chondrites themselves show variable silicon isotopic composition. For example, enstatite chondrites, the only group of meteorites that matches the Earth’s composition for 17O, 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, and 92Mo, have very light silicon isotopic compositions that would require unrealistic amounts of silicon in Earth’s core if they were its main constituents. We have measured the silicon isotopic composition of several achondrites that had not been measured before. In particular, we have found that angrites have a heavy silicon isotopic composition, similar to the Earth and the Moon. These meteorites formed under relatively oxidizing conditions (~IW+1) and core formation in their parent-body occurred at relatively low pressure (<0.1 GPa), so core-mantle silicon isotopic fractionation is excluded as a cause for their Earth-like silicon isotopic composition. Angrites are among the most volatile-depleted meteorites and their heavy silicon isotope signature most likely reflects isotopic fractionation by nebular processes. All chondrite groups and the bulk silicate Earth form a trend in silicon isotopic composition vs. Mg/Si ratio, which we will show quantitatively can be explained by a simple nebular process. This can also explain the similarity in silicon isotopic composition between lunar and terrestrial rocks. Therefore, silicon isotopes in terrestrial rocks provide no constraints on the amount of Si in the core and are consistent with the presence of other light elements such as oxygen.",

            "abstract": "The orthogneisses in the core of the Xuelong Shan block are surrounded by ductile and then brittle fault rocks. This lens-shape block is in fault contact with Triassic marbles on the eastern margin and Jurassic-Cretaceous mudstones on the western margin. The rocks in the core of the Xuelong Shan block contain multiply foliated feldspathic orthogneisses with local amphibolites, largely overprinted by protomylonitic deformation. Foliation strengthens to the east to become mylonites and ultramylonites, with a 30 m wide zone of loosely cemented fault breccia adjacent to brittlely faulted Triassic marbles. In contrast, the rocks to the west are dominated by brittle deformation, with mylonites becoming cataclasites and then breccias facing the mudstones to the east. Well-foliated phyllonites are locally present within the cataclasites. Early S1 gneissosity striking ENE are recognized only in the interior protomylonite. In the east, the dominate mylonitic S2 foliation strikes 340° with a moderate dip to the east, and an L2 mineral stretching lineation plunges gently north. However, in the west S2 cleavage is transposed into a NNW trending schistosity that dips steeply to the ENE, with down-dip mineral stretching lineations.\nWhole rock chemistry indicates a granitic to granodioritic protolith for all the rocks including the ultramylonites, but also suggests the progressive loss of alkalis with increasing deformation. Trace element compositions show these rocks lie in the volcanic arc/syn-collisional granite field. U-Pb SHRIMP ages show an Early Triassic age for these granite, with possible Middle Permian inheritance in some cores. These ages are consistent with the period of the closure of the northern Paleo-Tethys ocean. Metamorphic rim ages of ~ 30 Ma record a small amount of zircon dissolution/precipitation probably associated with the Oligocene ductile deformation that produced the upper greenschist facies mylonites. These results support the geologic history of the ASRRSZ based on data obtained in the southern Diancang Shan block. Permian granitoids were intruded and ductily deformed in the Early Triassic. The left lateral shearing that brought these blocks to the surface was delayed until the Neogene extrusion of the Indochina block.",

A recent study on ecosystem scale BVOC fluxes over Amazonian rainforest showed that some oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), which are photochemically produced above the canopy, were depositing measurably into the forest. However, that study was limited to only a few compounds due to the technical difficulties. Very recently (June and July 2014), we deployed a PTR-TOF-MS (Proton Transfer Reaction – Time of Flight – Mass Spectrometer) to apply eddy covariance flux measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC) above the FLONA Tapajós (Floresta Nacional do Tapajós) in the central Amazon rainforest in Brazil. The main goal of this study is to quantify emissions and depositions of a wide range of VOCs and their oxidation products formed above and below canopy. In this presentation, data analysis will be focused on some depositing OVOCs into the forest. From preliminary results for the first 3 days of eddy covariance flux measurement, m/z 31 (CH2OH+), m/z 45 (C2H4OH+), m/z 61 (C2H4O2H+), m/z 71 (C4H6OH+), and m/z 113 (C5H4O3H+) were observed as uniformly depositing compounds during the daytime.",

            "abstract": "Landscape evolution models can be used to highlight signatures of particular sediment transport processes or formulae. In particular, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the merits of using nonlocal descriptions of sediment transport in steeplands. To date, all modeling efforts that make use of a nonlocal description are one-dimensional. Although this is effective at highlighting essential characteristics and behaviors of nonlocal transport, one-dimensional hillslopes (planar in planform) are rare, and thus these models apply to a limited part of the landscape. In an effort to further explore impacts of nonlocal transport, we have developed an algorithm for two-dimensional topography that can make use of nonlocal transport formulae. This algorithm therefore increases the type of topography against which formulae may be evaluated, and brings insight into new metrics such as plan-form curvature. Furthermore, this algorithm offers an opportunity to explore transport variables as a function of contributing area as opposed to just land-surface slope and position.\nA nonlocal formulation uses a convolution integral of upslope positions to determine the sediment flux at a particular position. Applying such a description to all positions within even a small watershed is computationally expensive. An efficient way to do this, however, is to calculate the flux along flow tubes. To determine the land-surface evolution we use a mass-conserving entrainment form of the Exner equation which takes the difference between the amount of sediment entrained and deposited within a given element. Significant challenges exist in terms of identifying flow paths, treating flow tube boundaries, identifying the flow lines for all contributing areas, and identifying ridges. We apply this algorithm to a set of idealized topographies in order to observe essential characteristics and to determine metrics which may be used to describe the characteristics of real topography.",

            "abstract": "Obtaining accurate solar radiation input to snowmelt runoff models remains a fundamental challenge for water supply forecasters in the mountainous western U.S. The variability of cloud cover is a primary source of uncertainty in estimating surface radiation, especially given that ground-based radiometer networks in mountain terrains are sparse. Thus, remote sensed cloud properties provide a way to extend in situ observations and more importantly, to understand cloud variability in montane environment. We utilize 17 years of NASA/NOAA GOES visible albedo product with 4 km spatial and half-hour temporal resolutions to investigate daytime cloud variability in the western U.S. at elevations above 800 m. REOF/PC analysis finds that the 5 leading modes account for about two-thirds of the total daily cloud albedo variability during the whole year (ALL) and snowmelt season (AMJJ). The AMJJ PCs are significantly correlated with de-seasonalized snowmelt derived from CDWR CDEC and NRCS SNOTEL SWE data and USGS stream discharge across the western conterminous states. The sum of R2 from 7 days prior to the day of snowmelt/discharge amounts to as much as ~52% on snowmelt and ~44% on discharge variation. Spatially, the correlation patterns take on broad footprints, with strongest signals in regions of highest REOF weightings. That the response of snowmelt and streamflow to cloud variation is spread across several days indicates the cumulative effect of cloud variation on the energy budget in mountain catchments.",

            "abstract": "Widespread and near-synchronous post-settlement stream entrenchment (arroyo cutting) in the southwest US stimulated research addressing forcing mechanisms and necessary geomorphic and climate conditions leading to episodic evacuations of valley-fill alluvium. Arroyos are an end-member channel form associated with ephemeral streams entrenched into cohesive, fine-grained, valley-fill. Historic arroyo entrenchment exposed 5-30 m of unconformity-bound packages of different aged Holocene alluvium. Chronostratigraphic reconstructions indicate that during the mid-late Holocene these systems underwent multiple periods of rapid episodic entrenchment followed by slow re-aggradation. Previous and ongoing work has developed alluvial chronostratigraphies of Kanab Creek, Johnson Wash, and surrounding streams in southern UT using a combination of stratigraphic relationships, radiocarbon, and single-grain OSL dating. This research investigates the role of allogenic forcing (climate change) and autogenic processes on cut-fill dynamics. This study tests if temporal or spatial variations in sediment supply have influenced the timing and location of arroyo aggradation and entrenchment. We measured in-situ 10-Be in quartz from alluvial and colluvial sediment in Kanab Creek and Johnson Wash to quantify catchment-average erosion rates. Samples were collected from modern channels throughout the watershed and from dated alluvial packages preserved in arroyo walls. Results quantify spatial and temporal variability in sediment supply throughout the two watersheds as a function of lithology, slope, elevation, contribution of sediment stored in valley-fill, and time. Moreover, 10-Be results from dated Holocene alluvium will be used to evaluate if climate change has influenced sediment supply and arroyo cut-fill dynamics.",

            "abstract": "This study assesses the skill of advanced regional climate models (RCMs) in simulating Southeastern United States (SE US) summer precipitation and explores the mechanisms responsible for the simulation skill at a process level. Analysis of the RCM output for the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) indicates that the RCM simulations of summer precipitation show large biases and a remarkable spread over the SE US. The causes of such a spread are investigated by performing simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, a next-generation RCM developed by the US National Center for Atmospheric Research. The results show that the simulated biases in SE US summer precipitation are due mainly to the misrepresentation of the modeled North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) western ridge. In WRF simulations, the NASH western ridge shifts 7-deg northwestward compared to that in the reanalysis ensemble, leading to a dry bias in the simulated precipitation according to the \"NASH western ridge - Southeast summer precipitation\" relationship. Experiments utilizing the Four Dimensional Data Assimilation technique further suggest that the improved representation of the circulation patterns associated with the NASH western ridge substantially reduces the bias in simulating SE US summer precipitation. Our analysis of circulation dynamics indicates that the NASH western ridge in the WRF simulations is significantly influenced by planetary boundary layer (PBL) processes over the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, a decrease (increase) in the simulated PBL height tends to stabilize (destabilize) the lower troposphere over the Gulf of Mexico, and thus inhibits (favors) the onset and/or development of convection. The changes in tropical convecton induce a tropical-extratropical teleconnection pattern, which modulates the circulation along the NASH western ridge in the WRF simulations and contributes to the precipitation biases over the SE US. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the NASH western ridge is an important factor responsible for RCM skill in simulating SE US summer precipitation. Furthermore, improvements in the PBL parameterizations for the Gulf of Mexico might help advance RCM skill in representing the NASH western ridge and SE US summer precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) successfully launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on July 2, 2014. The mission provides remotely-sensed measurements of the column-averaged dry air mole fraction of carbon dioxide from space. In order to insure the quality of the space-based observations, a detailed validation program was developed for the original OCO mission. During the time period between the original OCO launch failure and the successful launch of OCO-2, that validation methodology was tested and refined using data from the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) as part of the NASA Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) project.\nAt the core of the OCO-2 validation plan are comparisons of the satellite data to observations from Total Carbon Column Observation Network (TCCON), a network of ground based Fourier Transform Spectrometers. The TCCON instruments provide “ground truth”, allowing for determination of bias in the space-based observations. The TCCON observations are, in turn, traceable to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standards through aircraft and balloon-borne profile observations at the TCCON locations.\nOCO-2 is capable of making measurements in three observation modes: nadir; glint; and target. The initial operational mode for OCO-2 alternates between nadir and glint mode every 16 days with target mode observations initiated by commanding the spacecraft to point to specific surface location. Of the 19 locations that can be observed by OCO-2 in target mode, 18 are TCCON sites. The decision to target a specific TCCON site is based on a variety of criteria, including the local weather forecast, the operational status of the station, and the time since previous observation of that site. In addition, the coincidence criteria to utilize in comparison between the satellite and TCCON measurements have been refined during the ACOS project and will be utilized to compare OCO-2 nadir and glint observations with TCCON data.\nIn this presentation, we will show preliminary comparisons between OCO-2 and TCCON, using data from all satellite observing modes.",

            "abstract": "Sod based crop rotation (SBR) is a relatively new system of practice that incorporates at least 2 years of a perennial grass followed by a peanut and then cotton rotation. After 15 years of research on farm scale sites, this system has been found to have many advantages over conventional 3 year peanut-cotton-cotton rotations. These benefits include: increased profits; dramatic reductions in irrigation demand, fertilizer (N,P) pesticide use, and energy consumption; and, better carbon sequestration potential. The SBR system works primarily due to enhancement of plant root growth and improvement to soil properties. To forecast the water savings potential of sod based rotation, we employ the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate irrigation water demands over a 34 year period (1980-2013). We utilize data from a distributed network of weather stations to represent a range of climate conditions in the Florida, Georgia and Alabama area and data that represent a range of soil physical properties. The only calibration parameter adjusted in SWAT to distinguish between the new and conventional system of farming is rooting depth. Each model result providing 34 years of annual irrigation water requirements was fit to a cumulative probability distribution function to forecast the water savings potential of SBR. Depending upon soil type and weather station location, forecasted water savings using SBR ranged between 20.3 and 33.1 cm during a 10% chance drought year. With over 526,000 ha of irrigated conventional acres in cotton and peanut within the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina alone, this equates to a potential water savings of 1.07 billion to 1.74 billion m3 of water in a drought year. The cumulative mitigative effect of this system has yet to be realized through actual application in these states. However, even at low rates of application it is evident that SBR could significantly reduce the negative impacts of irrigation in the Southeast US as well as other locations where row crops grow in humid subtropical climates.",

The tracer measurements from both sensors are well represented by the simulation, supporting the use of simulated lower stratospheric mean age to interpret the column observations. There are several periods of at least 3-5 years during which the growth or decline in HCl column is smaller than expected given the upper stratospheric change in inorganic chlorine. During the early 1990s when the chlorine source gases are increasing rapidly these periods of slow growth are associated with periods of greater than average mean age.",

            "abstract": "California has experienced severe drought over the last three years, with especially deficient winter precipitation and mountain snowpack in 2013-2014. While the severity of California’s water crisis this year is not in question, the causes of the drought are less clear, and there has been debate as to whether human-induced climate change is at least in part a cause of anomalously low winter precipitation (P) and snow water equivalent (SWE) this year, or whether the conditions are simply the result of natural variability that has been manifested in previous severe droughts in California. To provide more scientific insight to this question, we reconstructed, using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model, SWE and runoff from 1920 to 2014 at a spatial resolution of 1/16 degree over the Sierra Nevada range of California. We forced the VIC model with a temporally consistent set of index precipitation and temperature stations that are also used in the University of Washington’s Drought Monitoring System for the West Coast Region (http://www.hydro.washington.edu/forecast/monitor_cali/index.shtml). We carried out trend analysis and examined cumulative probability for accumulated winter precipitation, SWE on Apr 1, annual, spring and winter runoff, average winter temperature (T) and SWE/P fraction. We also did correlation analysis between SWE and P as well as SWE and T. In addition, we used detrended temperature data to force the VIC model in order to analyze the role of climate change in SWE and runoff. Our results show that while the decreasing trend in SWE and earlier runoff peak in the year are related to long-term warming climate, there is no significant trend in winter P and there are lots of variability in the record of all variables. While this year’s anomalously warm weather might have exacerbated the ongoing 3-year drought (and winter 2013-14 in particular), we conclude that natural variability is the main cause.",

Using δ18O (sea surface temperature, SST; sea surface salinity, SSS proxy) and Mg/Ca (SST proxy) variations in non-encrusted planktic foraminifer Globorotalia truncatulinoides we produce time series spanning the last two millennia that is characterized by centennial-scale climate variability. We interpret geochemical variations in G. truncatulinoides to reflect winter climate variability because data from a sediment trap, located ~350 km east of the core site, reveal that annual flux of G. truncatulinoides is heavily weighted towards winter (peak production in January-February; Spear et al., 2011). Similar centennial-scale variability is also observed in the foraminiferal geochemistry of Globigerinoides ruber in the same multi-cores, which likely reflect mean annual climate variations. Our replicated results and comparisons to other SST reconstructions from the region lend confidence that the northern GOM surface ocean underwent large, centennial-scale variability, most likely dominated by changes in winter climate. This variability occurred in a time period where climate forcing is small and background conditions are similar to pre-industrial times.\n",

Vertical transport of atmospheric aerosols to Earth’s surface is governed by several processes including turbulent transfer, interception, inertial impaction, settling, diffusion, turbophoresis, thermophoresis, and electrostatic effects. In global transport models (GTMs), particle dry deposition velocity (vd) from the lowest model layer to the surface is often parameterized using an electrical resistance analogy. This resistance analogy is widely used in a modified form to compute vd for steady-state dry deposition flux. Recently, a mass conservative formulation of dry deposition applicable to smooth and rough surfaces was proposed. Here, we evaluate dry deposition velocities computed using five different schemes with measurement results from a variety of surfaces including bare soil, grass, and coniferous, broad-leaf, and deciduous forest canopies. Based on this assessment, we provide suggestions for optimal treatment of dry deposition processes in GTMs and evaluate implementation of new dry deposition schemes.",

            "abstract": "The morphology of lava flows is controlled by the physical properties of the lava and its effusion rates, as well as environmental influences such as surface medium, slope and ambient temperature and pressure conditions. The important rheological properties of lavas include viscosity (η) and yield strength (σy), strongly dependent on temperature (T), composition (X), crystal fraction (φc) and vesicularity (φb). The crystal fraction typically increases as temperature decreases, and also influences the residual liquid composition. The rheological behavior of multi-phase lava flows is expressed as different flow morphologies, for example basalt flows transition from smooth pahoehoe to blocky `a`a at higher viscosities and/or strain rates. We have previously quantified the rheological conditions of this transition for Hawaiian basalts, but lavas on Mercury are very different in composition and expected crystallization history.\nHere we determine experimentally the temperature and rheological conditions of the pahoehoe-`a`a transition for two likely Mercury lava compositions using concentric cylinder viscometry. We detect first crystals at 1302 ºC for an enstatite basalt and 1317 ºC for a basaltic komatiite composition representative of the northern volcanic plains (NVP). In both cases, we observe a transition from Newtonian to pseudo-plastic response at crystal fractions > 10 vol%. Between 30 to 40 vol%, a yield strength (τ0) around 26±6 and 110±6 Pa develops, classifying the two-phase suspensions as Herschel-Bulkley fluids. The measured increase in apparent viscosity (ηapp) ranges from 10 Pa s to 104 Pa s. This change in rheological properties occurs only in a temperature range up to 100 ºC below the liquidus.\nBy analogy with the rheological conditions of the pahoehoe-`a`a transition for Hawaiian basalts, we can relate the data for Mercury to lava flow surface morphology as shown in Figure 1, where the onset of the transition threshold zone (TTZ) for the enstatite basalt composition is around 1270 ˚C and 1300 ºC for the NVP composition. This is 70 ºC to 100 ºC higher than for Kilauea basalt. These data may allow emplacement temperatures and/or rates to be determined from remote sensing observations of the surface morphology of different volcanic fields on Mercury.",

            "abstract": "The desire to control the flow, storage and release of stormwater in urban systems distinctly alters the flow paths, water quality, and flood behavior of these once natural systems. The EPA and local municipalities have identified Low Impact Development (LID) and Best Management Practices (BMPs) as more natural methods to manage stormwater in urban areas, though the efficacy of these methods has not been quantified at the watershed scale. By holistically modeling stormwater flow at the watershed scale, engineered BMP solutions can be optimized for cost and evaluated on their ability to improve water quality and flood protection. In this research, the EPA System for Urban Stormwater Treatment and Analysis INtegration (SUSTAIN) model is applied to heavily urbanized watersheds in Southern California, specifically the Ballona Creek and Dominguez Channel watersheds (61% and 69% impervious land cover, respectively). Stormwater flow and pollutant load of selected metals are calibrated and validated over the gauged portions (89 sq. mi. in Ballona and 33 sq. mi. in Dominguez) and simulated over the full watersheds (~128 sq. mi. in both). Scenarios of BMP implementation are optimized for cost and pollutant load reduction. Results show that receiving water quality improvement is limited by BMP pollutant removal effectiveness. Consequently, larger BMP treatment capacity does not result in greater pollutant load reduction. The optimal scenario routed runoff from 90% of the watershed area through a variety of regional and distributed BMPs indicating that BMP implementation needs to focus on strategic placements to capture runoff from the largest drainage area instead of only maximizing BMP capacity. Secondary benefits such as peak flow reduction of 20-50% and recharge potential between 12,000 and 30,000 acre-ft per year were also demonstrated in selected Ballona Creek optimization scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Secure and long-term trapping of supercritical CO2 (scCO2) in deep geological formations is important for the reduction of leakage risk. Agartan et al. [2014] through controlled laboratory experiments in a test tank using surrogate fluids for scCO2 and brine showed that the dissolved scCO2 can be stored in geological formations containing low permeability layers, thus effectively enhancing dissolution trapping. As this finding was limited to a few test configurations, its validity was evaluated using a numerical modeling study focusing on the influence of different permeabilities and thicknesses of low permeability layers on trapping of dissolved scCO2. A Finite Volume Method (FVM)-based, single-phase, density and viscosity-dependent flow and transport model was employed to determine the effects of porosity and permeability perturbations, and numerical grid resolution on model results and density-dependent finger formations. The experimental data, generated by Agartan et al. [2014], was used to demonstrate the ability of the model to capture the observed transport behaviors. To demonstrate the role of heterogeneity characterized by layering on dissolution trapping at field-scale, a two-dimensional numerical model containing a geological structure similar to the Utsira formation in the Sleipner field was used in a set of test simulations. This formation provided a good test setting as it has the similar features with shale layers interbedded in-between composite sand layers that were used in the experiments. The results highlight that the thicker and lower permeability layers are able to store significant amounts of dissolved scCO2 for a long time. On the other hand, although the thinner and higher permeability layers slow down the vertical spreading, they cannot trap dissolved mass long enough to contribute the storage through immobilization. These findings have practical implications as effective strategies can be developed to enhance trapping by taking the advantage of natural heterogeneity of the formation.\nAgartan, E., L.

            "abstract": "An analysis of the occurrence of fire in Alaskan tundra was completed using the relatively complete historical record of fire for the region from 1950 to 2013. Spatial fire data for Alaskan tundra regions were obtained from the Alaska Large Fire Database for the region defined from vegetation and ecoregion maps. A detailed presentation of fire records available for assessing the fire regime of the tundra regions of Alaska as well as results evaluating fire size, seasonality, and general geographic and temporal trends is included. Assessment of future fire potential was determined for three future climate scenarios at four locations across the Alaskan tundra using the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI). Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) weather variables were used for historical (1850-2005) and future (2006-2100) time periods. The database includes 908 fire points and 463 fire polygons within the 482,931 km2 of Alaskan tundra. Based on the polygon database 25,656 km2 (6,340,000 acres) has burned across the six tundra ecoregions since 1950. Approximately 87% of tundra fires start in June and July across all ecoregions. Combining information from the polygon and points data records, the estimated average fire size for fire in the Alaskan Arctic region is 28.1 km2 (7,070 acres), which is much smaller than in the adjacent boreal forest region, averaging 203 km2 for high fire years. The largest fire in the database is the Imuruk Basin Fire which burned 1,680 km2 in 1954 in the Seward Peninsula region (Table 1). Assessment of future fire potential shows that, in comparison with the historical fire record, fire occurrence in Alaskan tundra is expected to increase under all three climate scenarios. Occurrences of high fire weather danger (>10 FWI) are projected to increase in frequency and magnitude in all regions modeled. The changes in fire weather conditions are expected to vary from one region to another in seasonal occurrence as well as severity and frequency of high fire weather danger. While the Alaska Large Fire Database represents the best data available for the Alaskan Arctic, and is superior to many other regions around the world, particularly Arctic regions, these fire records need to be used with some caution due to the mixed origin and minimal validation of the data; this is reviewed in the presentation.",

We conducted a meta-analysis of both N2O emissions and NO3- leaching losses to quantify their individual responses to fertilization rate, tillage, and other practices. Overall, we assembled over 40 studies that reported fertilization rate, yield, and either N2O emissions or NO3- leaching losses over the growing season from North American corn fields. Our complete database ultimately included over 600 observations of N2O emissions or NO3- leaching. Notably, we found no individual studies that reported both NO3- leaching and N2O emissions. We used multiple regression to quantify the response of N loss pathways to fertilization rate; rotation crop and tillage practice; and climate and soil type. We also included yield as a predictor to better account for the magnitude of surplus N. We found insufficient data to address effects of fertilizer placement, timing and source. On a mass basis, NO3- losses were far greater than N2O emissions. Both NO3- leaching and N2O emissions exhibited positive relationships with fertilizer rate and surplus N, but the responses of N loss pathways to environmental conditions and to various management practices varied considerably. These results suggest that minimizing excess fertilizer application will both improve water quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but that other practices such as tillage induce tradeoffs between these N loss pathways.",

In a pioneering study, using a large ensemble of future simulations with CCSM3 (the Community Climate System Model, version 3), Deser et al (2012) found that surface air temperature was easily predictable, whereas sea level pressure was considerably more difficult to predict (i.e. a very large number of ensemble members was required). We reassess this conclusions using the new, recently completed, Large Ensemble of coupled model simulations using CESM1-CAM5 (the Community Earth System Model, with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5). In contrast to the earlier work, we here demonstrate that forced response of more widely used metrics of the atmospheric circulation, the latitude and strength of the midlatitude jets, emerges from internal variability with as few as ten ensemble members, over the course of the 21st Century.",

The coastal forecasts are generated as the wave is registered at regional DART stations (46402, 46043, 46409, 46410). Note that while the DART array spans the Pacific Rim, the inversion-based forecasting methodologies can incorporate data from only 1-3 stations in the vicinity of the tsunami origin. We present a forecasting method which complements existing forecasting tools by using tsunami observations in a region to generate regional predictions independent of the tsunami source estimate. This method allows to utilize observing capabilities of the DART array, as well as tsunami detectors in cabled underwater networks (e.g. NEPTUNE in Canada). Future instrumentation on submarine communication cables will supply larger selection of open-ocean measurements and many more opportunities for this method.\nFigure: (Top) record of the 2012/10/28 Haida Gwaii tsunami at DART 46411; (Bottom) the tsunami record at Monterey tide gage (red) and its forecast (blue).

            "abstract": "The Math You Need (TMYN) modules were introduced at Baylor University in fall 2012 to address issues of math anxiety common among freshmen non-majors completing their lab science requirement, and to reduce lab time spent reviewing basic math concepts. Modules and associated assessment questions commonly use geoscience examples to illustrate the mathematical principles involved, reinforcing topics addressed in lab. Large enrollments in the course selected for these modules necessitate multiple graduate teaching assistants in the lab, making the online nature of the modules and minimal required involvement of the teaching assistants even more valuable. Students completed three selected modules before encountering associated topics in lab, as well as a pre and post-test to gauge improvement. This presentation will review lessons learned and changes made in the first two years of TMYN at Baylor. Results indicate continued increases in mean pre to post test scores (e.g. 3.2% in fall 2012 to 11.9% in spring 2014), percentage of student pre to post- test improvement (59% in fall 2012 to 72% in spring 2014) and student participation (95 in fall 2012 to 186 in spring 2014). Continued use of these modules is anticipated.",

            "abstract": "Data assimilation, e.g. in meteorology and geophysics, requires an estimate of the model noise, which is typically hard to find, in particular because the noise depends on the signal, i.e. on the values of the variable one is trying to estimate, and is difficult to separate from the signal. A global approach to the estimation of noise from data will be presented, in which the system of interest is imbedded in a stationary ensemble, and then the noise is separated from the signal via a reversible transformation of the ensemble. The global approach is particularly useful if the observation noise is significant. As an example, a global method is used to estimate the noise in a truncation of the Lorenz 96 model, and the results are compared with earlier work on stochastic parametrization and related constructions.",

            "abstract": "Subaqueous mudflows are known to be ubiquitous across the Mississippi River delta front (MRDF) and have been identified as a hazard to offshore infrastructure. Among other factors, sediment accumulation rates and patterns play an important role in governing the stability of delta front sediment. High sedimentation rates result in underconsolidation, slope steepening, and increased biogenic gas production, which are all known to decrease stability. Sedimentation rates are highly variable across the MRDF, but are highest near the mouth of Southwest Pass, which carries the largest percentage of Mississippi River sediment into the Gulf of Mexico. Since the 1950s, the sediment load of the Mississippi River has decreased by ~50% due to dam construction upstream. The impact of this decreased sediment load on MRDF mudflow dynamics has yet to be examined. We compiled MRDF bathymetric datasets, including historical charts, industry and academic surveys, and NOAA data, collected between 1764 and 2009, in order to identify historic trends in sedimentation patterns.\nThe progradation of Southwest Pass (measured at 10 m depth contour) has slowed from ~66 m/yr between 1764 and 1940 to ~25 m/yr between 1940 and 1979, with evidence of further deceleration from 1979-2009. Decreased rates of progradation are also observed at South Pass and Pass A Loutre. Advancement of the delta also decelerated in deeper water (15-90 m) offshore from Southwest Pass. In this area, from 1940-1979, depth contours advanced seaward ~25 m/yr, but did not advance from 1979-2005. Furthermore, over the same area and time ranges, the sediment accumulation rate decreased by ~82%. We expect these sedimentation trends are occurring across the delta front, with potential impacts on spatial and temporal patterns of subaqueous mudflows. The MRDF appears to be entering a phase of decline, which will likely be accelerated by future upstream sediment diversion projects. New geophysical data will be required to assess potential mudflow hazards associated with new MRDF sedimentation rates and patterns (See Part 2, Obelcz et al.).",

            "abstract": "Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is a federal non-profit agency within the Pacific Northwest responsible for marketing the power generated from 31 federal hydro projects throughout the Columbia River Basin. The basin encompasses parts of five states and portions of British Columbia, Canada. BPA works with provincial entities, federal and state agencies, and tribal members to manage the water resources for a variety of purposes including flood risk management, power generation, fisheries, irrigation, recreation, and navigation. This basin is subject to significant hydrologic variability in terms of seasonal volume and runoff shape from year to year which presents new water management challenges each year. The power generation planning group at BPA includes a team of meteorologists and hydrologists responsible for preparing both short-term (up to three weeks) and mid-term (up to 18 months) weather and streamflow forecasts including ensemble streamflow data. Analysts within the mid-term planning group are responsible for running several different hydrologic models used for planning studies. These models rely on these streamflow ensembles as a primary input. The planning studies are run bi-weekly to help determine the amount of energy available, or energy inventory, for forward marketing (selling or purchasing energy up to a year in advance). These studies are run with the objective of meeting the numerous multi-purpose objectives of the basin under the various streamflow conditions within the ensemble set. In addition to ensemble streamflows, an ensemble of seasonal volume forecasts is also provided for the various water conditions in order to set numerous constraints on the system. After meeting all the various requirements of the system, a probabilistic energy inventory is calculated and used for marketing purposes.",

It is a partnership of globally distributed expert organizations, focusses on developing innovative techniques and datasets in support of agricultural monitoring and its impact on the environment in support of GEOGLAM.\nSIGMA has 3 generic objectives which are: (i) develop and test methods to characterize cropland and assess its changes at various scales; (ii) develop and test methods to assess changes in agricultural production levels; and; (iii) study environmental impacts of agriculture. Firstly, multi-scale remote sensing data sets, in combination with field and other ancillary data, are used to generate an improved (global) agro-ecological zoning map and crop mask. Secondly, a combination of agro-meteorological models, satellite-based information and long-term time series are be explored to better assess crop yield gaps and shifts in cultivation. The third research topic entails the development of best practices for assessing the impact of crop land and cropping system change on the environment. In support of the GEO JECAM (Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring) initiative, case studies in Ukraine, Russia, Europe, Africa, Latin America and China are carried out in order to explore possible methodological synergies and particularities according to different cropping systems.

            "abstract": "Snow albedo is critical to surface energy budgets and thus to the timing of mid-winter and vernal melt events in seasonal snow packs. Timing of these melt events is important in predicting flooding, understanding plant and animal phenology, and the availability of winter recreational activity. The state of New Hampshire experiences large spatial and temporal variability in snow albedo as a result of differences in meteorological conditions, physical snow structure, and chemical impurities in the snow, particularly highly absorptive black carbon (BC) and dust particles. This work focuses on the winters of 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, comparing three intensive study sites. Data collected at these sites include sub-hourly meteorological data, near daily measurements of snow depth, snow density, surface IR temperature, specific surface area (SSA) from contact spectroscopy, and spectrally resolved snow albedo using an ASD FieldSpec4 throughout the winter season. Additionally, snow samples were analyzed for black carbon content and other chemical impurities including Cl-, NO3-, NH4 , K , Na , Mg2+ , Ca2+ and SO42-. For each storm event at the three intensive sites, moisture sources and paths were determined using HYPLIT back trajectory modeling to determine potential sources of black carbon and other impurities in the snow. Storms with terrestrial-based paths across the US Midwest and Canada resulted in higher BC content than storms with ocean-based paths and sources. In addition to the variable storm path between sites and between years, the second year of study was on average 2.5°C colder than the first year, impacting duration of snow cover at each site and the SSA of surface snow which is sensitive to frequency of snow events and relies on cold temperatures to reduce grain metamorphism. Combining an understanding of storm frequency and path with physical and chemical attributes of the snow allows us to investigate snow albedo sensitivities with implications for understanding the impacts of future climate change on snow albedo in the Northeastern US.",

Through these reconstruction techniques one may explicitly reconstruct any climate variable of interest, from surface temperature to atmospheric or oceanic circulation. Yet standard DA approaches must be modified to meet the challenges of the available paleoclimatic data, including dating uncertainty and multiple time scales. We present the first DA-based reconstruction technique that can address dating uncertainty and arbitrary proxy time scales. We examine this technique with pseudoproxy tests incorporating proxy dating uncertainty, varying proxy time scales, varying proxy network and noise characterizations and generating pseudoproxies through proxy system models. We also apply this DA technique to the PAGES2k proxy database over the Common Era. Through both the pseudo and real proxy tests we identify dynamical fields of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system that can be most robustly reconstructed.",

            "abstract": "Bed load particles move as a complex mixture of rolling, sliding, and small saltating motions on the stream bed. We track particle motions from start to stop using high speed imagery of coarse sand particles in flume experiments. This work utilizes a rich data set to provide foundational support for a statistical mechanics approach to bed load transport. The streamwise and cross-stream particle accelerations form Laplacian-like distributions, centered on zero, such that the positive and negative accelerations are balanced, which is consistent with equilibrium transport conditions wherein the mean particle acceleration must equal zero. Measurements from the imagery are censored by the window size and the sampling time, wherein particle `hops' are only measured if they both start and stop in the field of view (spatial censorship) and during the analyzed period of time (temporal censorship). We focus on the former, by considering data from complete particle hops in different sampling windows. Although all hop data are censored, we find that with a decreasing window size, longer hop distances and travel times are preferentially censored from the data. Furthermore, this suggests the streamwise hop distances scale with travel times to the second power, rather than previous estimates of a 5/3 power relationship. Data from a new experiment, with a higher particle activity, suggest similar forms of the instantaneous velocities and hops compared to lower activity data. Furthermore, the relationship between the streamwise hop distance and travel times appears to scale with the second power. Data from this new experiment will provide further insight concerning the nature of bed load transport from coupled measurements of particle transport and near-bed fluid velocities, which will ultimately inform statistically expected sediment behaviors.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the impacts of large-scale gravity waves (periods of multiple hours) on propagation environments for smaller-scale gravity waves (periods less than an hour). Large-scale gravity waves account for wind and temperature perturbations that can modulate the large-scale flow and either enhance or suppress the propagation of short-period waves to higher altitudes, thus also modulating their vertical transport of momentum. Specific cases are discussed using data from the DEEPWAVE mission, which took place from Christchurch, New Zealand in June and July 2014.\nThe measurements used in this investigation utilize sodium and Rayleigh lidars that were aboard the NSF Gulfstream V research aircraft, as well as temperatures from Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mappers (AMTMs) aboard the aircraft and stationed at the Lauder research station in New Zealand. The AMTM allows for temperatures to be derived from hydroxyl layer emissions. The Rayleigh lidar allows for temperatures to be measured vertically from ~25-50km. The sodium lidar allows for sodium density perturbations to be measured from ~80-100km. The combination of these instruments allows for more complete assessments of large-scale wave activity (hundreds of km) as well as smaller scale wave events (<100 km). The temperature measurements from both the lidars and AMTMs allow for the phase of the gravity waves at given locations and times to be determined.\nAn example of an event is given in the attached keogram figure for June 21-22, 2014 from the Lauder AMTM. This night shows a gravity wave that appears to be propagating from ~10:00-12:30 UT in a distinct phase of a larger scale wave with a period in the range of 4-6 hours. Using case studies such as this, we aim to further understand the influences of such dynamics in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.",

According to the ocean dynamical thermostat theory, warming (cooling) of the tropical Pacific Ocean may lead to a more La Niña (El Niño)-like mean state due to zonally asymmetric heating and subsequent easterly (westerly) wind anomalies at the equator (Clement and Cane, 1999). Attempts to understand these feedbacks on millennial timescales across Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) have proven to be fruitful in the western equatorial Pacific (WEP) (Stott et al., 2002), yet complimentary, high-resolution records from the EEP are lacking. To provide a more complete understanding of the feedback mechanisms of the dynamical thermostat across periods of abrupt climate change, we reconstruct thermocline temperature variability across MIS 3 from a sediment core located in the EEP, directly within the equatorial cold tongue upwelling region (core MV1014-02-17JC). Temperature anomalies in thermocline waters of the EEP are integrally linked to the ENSO system, with large positive and negative anomalies recorded during El Niño and La Niña events, respectively. Mg/Ca ratios in the thermocline-dwelling planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina dutertrei were measured at 2 cm intervals, resulting in a temporal resolution of <200 years. Preliminary results across Interstadials 5-7 reveal warmer thermocline temperatures (an increase in Mg/Ca of .25 ± .02 mmol/mol) during periods of cooling following peak Interstadial warmth over Greenland, as seen from the NGRIP δ18O record. Thus, periods of cooling over Greenland appear to correspond to an El Niño-like mean state in the tropical Pacific, in line with predictions of an ocean dynamical thermostat. Interestingly, Heinrich Event 3 corresponds to cooler thermocline temperatures, suggesting a different forcing mechanism of tropical Pacific mean state variability across Heinrich Events. The record will be extended back to 80 kyr BP, and we will also measure Globigerinoides ruber Mg/Ca ratios across MIS 3 to calculate the zonal E-W sea surface temperature gradient using published records from the WEP.",

Therefore, understanding and monitoring the distribution frequencies of treefall gaps is relevant to better understanding and predicting the carbon budget in response to global change and land use change. In this work we characterize and quantify the frequency distribution of natural canopy gaps. We observe then interaction between environment variables and gap formation across tropical rainforest of the French Guiana region by using high resolution airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). We mapped gaps with canopy model distribution on 40000 ha of forest. We used a Bayesian modelling framework to estimate and select useful covariate model parameters. Topographic variables are included in a model to predict gap size distribution. We discuss results from the interaction between environment and gap size distribution, mainly topographic indexes. The use of both airborne and space-based techniques has improved our ability to supply needed disturbance information. This work is an approach at plot scale. The use of satellite data will allow us to work at forest scale. The inclusion of climate variables in our model will let us assess the impact of global change on tropical rainforest.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that groundwater pumpage must be balanced by a loss of water elsewhere. This loss comes primarily from storage depletion at early times and increasingly from capture at later times. Capture includes some combination of increases in recharge to the aquifer and decreases in discharge from the aquifer induced by the pumpage. Most capture is manifested as streamflow depletion (e.g., through induced infiltration and/or reductions in baseflow). However, decreasing evapotransirative discharge from an aquifer would constitute a type of capture that does not affect streamflow. In his classic 1940 paper Theis recommends that wells be placed in areas where groundwater “is being lost by evaporation or transpiration by non-productive vegetation,” thereby utilizing this “lost” water with a minimal lowering of the water table. This study uses numerical simulation of a hypothetical unconfined stream-aquifer system in an arid climate, where streamflow depletion is typically a major concern, to assess how capture of evapotranspiration (ET) can influence the sources of water for a pumping well when the ET losses are directly affected by spatial and temporal changes in the depth to the water table. Consequently, streamflow depletion for a given pumping rate can be affected by capture of ET and how that varies with well location and the history of development and drawdown. We assume the standard MODFLOW linear model for changes in groundwater ET as the water table declines to a specified extinction depth. In one scenario in which about half the recharge to the aquifer is lost to ET under predevelopment conditions, the percentage of well discharge balanced by decreased ET changed from 1.1% after one year to 18% after 200 years of simulated pumpage. The actual ET rate decreased from 5,372 m3/d under predevelopment conditions to 5,001 m3/d after 200 years of development (a 7% reduction in total ET losses). At this same time, 77% of pumpage is derived from streamflow depletion, which can be contrasted with an equivalent scenario in which there is no ET; in that case 94% of pumpage is derived from streamflow depletion after 200 years. Recognition of the potential contribution of captured ET to balance well pumpage should help efforts to optimize groundwater development in shallow aquifer systems.",

            "abstract": "The eddy covariance (EC) technique measures fluxes of water vapor and carbon dioxide between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) is the balance between ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP), and evapotranspiration (ET) is the sum of transpiration and evaporation. In order to relate these measurements to physical and ecological processes, it is often necessary to partition the fluxes into their components. While established techniques for partitioning NEE are widely used in the EC community, partitioning of ET remains a challenge. A recently developed partitioning procedure uses assumed correlations between stomatal (photosynthesis and transpiration) and non-stomatal (respiration and evaporation) sources of water vapor and CO2 to simultaneously partition NEE and ET into their respective components. Because the technique uses the same high-frequency measurements as EC, it is easily applicable to existing EC datasets, provided ecosystem-scale water use efficiency can be specified. We applied the method to a ten-year record of EC fluxes at the Morgan Monroe State Forest (MMSF) Ameriflux site, using estimates of water use efficiency from recent leaf-level gas exchange measurements. The technique has been tested in agricultural systems, but has not previously been evaluated in forests. ER and GPP from the correlation-based procedure qualitatively matched estimates from a more traditional partitioning method based on fitting nighttime NEE to a function of temperature and calculating GPP as the residual during the day, although the magnitudes of GPP and ER from the correlation-based technique were higher than those from the traditional technique. Partitioned respiration and evaporation were also consistent with sub-canopy flux measurements. Transpiration accounted for the majority of ET during the growing season, but had a strong seasonal cycle. Both evaporation and transpiration declined during periods of low soil moisture, but transpiration had a stronger response, with an especially pronounced decline during a severe midseason drought in 2012. Our results show that this technique can effectively partition fluxes over forest canopies, and could help to enable routine ET partitioning of EC measurements for eco-hydrological studies.",

Furthermore, changes in orographic precipitation have broad implications for reservoir storage and flood risks. As part of the CalWater I field campaign (2009-2011), the impacts of aerosol sources on precipitation were investigated in the California Sierra Nevada Mountains. In 2009, the precipitation collected on the ground was influenced by both local biomass burning and long-range transported dust and biological particles, while in 2010, by mostly local sources of biomass burning and pollution, and in 2011 by mostly long-range transport of dust and biological particles from distant sources. Although vast differences in the sources of residues were observed from year-to-year, dust and biological residues were omnipresent (on average, 55% of the total residues combined) and were associated with storms consisting of deep convective cloud systems and larger quantities of precipitation initiated in the ice phase. Further, biological residues were dominant during storms with relatively warm cloud temperatures (up to ‑15°C), suggesting biological components were more efficient IN than mineral dust. On the other hand, when precipitation quantities were lower, local biomass burning and pollution residues were observed (on average 31% and 9%, respectively), suggesting these residues potentially served as CCN at the base of shallow cloud systems and that lower level polluted clouds of storm systems produced less precipitation than non-polluted (i.e., marine) clouds. The direct connection of the sources of aerosols within clouds and precipitation type and quantity can be used in models to better assess how local emissions versus long-range transported dust and biological aerosols play a role in impacting regional weather and climate, ultimately with the goal of more accurate predictive weather forecast models and water resource management.",

These rates are compared to regional and global trends in ocean mass addition estimated directly using data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) from 2003–2013. Despite the two independent methods reflecting different time periods and spatial sampling coverage, they both capture the same large scale mass addition trend patterns of higher rates of mass addition in the North Pacific, South Atlantic, and the Indo-Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean, with smaller mass addition trends in the Indian, North Atlantic, South Pacific, and the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean. The global mean trend of ocean mass addition using both methods is 1.5 (±0.4) mm yr-1, reflecting 1996–2006 for the residual method and 2003–2013 for the GRACE method. Furthermore, the residual method is used to evaluate the error introduced into the mass budget if the deep steric contributions below 700, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 m are neglected revealing an error of 65%, 38%, 13%, 8% and 4% respectively.

We first estimate the glaciological sensitivity, or change in glacierized area with change in equilibrium line altitude (ELA), for each sub-basin using a glacier inventory and SRTM DEM. We assign a climatic sensitivity of the ELA to temperature changes (dELA/dT) based on published values for tropical and sub-tropical glaciers and a high-resolution annual precipitation field. To assess the change in glacier meltwater contribution as a result of warming, we first estimate baseline glacier meltwater contributions using a mass balance gradient and estimated current ELA. Future climate warming scenarios of +1K and +2K are then used to examine the change in glacier meltwater contributions based on the increased ELA and ablation area. Finally, we calculate a glacier significance index that examines the relative importance of melt within each sub-basin, and discuss regional variations in glacier sensitivity and significance.",

            "abstract": "The importance of pH in aqueous chemistry is evident; yet, its role in reactive transport is complex. Consider a column flow experiment through silica glass beads. Take the column to be saturated and flowing with solution of a distinct pH. An instantaneous change in the influent solution pH can yield a breakthrough curve with both a rarefaction and shock component (composite wave). This behavior is unique among aqueous ions in transport and is more complex than intuition would tell. Analysis of the hyperbolic limit of this physical system can explain these first order transport phenomenon. This analysis shows that transport behavior is heavily dependent on the shape of the adsorption isotherm. Hence it is clear that accurate surface chemistry models are important in reactive transport. The proton adsorption isotherm has nonconstant concavity due to the proton’s ability to partition into hydroxide. An eigenvalue analysis shows that an inflection point in the adsorption isotherm allows the development of composite waves. We use electrostatic surface complexation models to calculate realistic proton adsorption isotherms. Surface characteristics such as specific surface area, and surface site density were determined experimentally. We validate the model by comparison against silica glass bead flow through experiments. When coupled to surface complexation models, the transport equation captures the timing and behavior of breakthrough curves markedly better than with commonly used Langmuir assumptions. Furthermore, we use the adsorption isotherm to predict, a priori, the transport behavior of protons across pH composition space. Expansion of the model to multicomponent systems shows that proton adsorption can force composite waves to develop in the breakthrough curves of ions that would not otherwise exhibit such behavior. Given the abundance of reactive surfaces in nature and the nonlinearity of chemical systems, we conclude that building a greater understanding of proton adsorption is of utmost importance to reactive transport modeling.",

A series of flume experiments are in progress, with the aim of understanding the effects of bed depressions on the hyporheic flow of oxygenated water. This study focuses on fish nests, also called redds, which represent a typical depression or scour feature. Previous research has shown that redd topography induces hyporheic circulation, but experiments regarding the oxygen concentration in and around the redds have not been conducted. We are determining the ways in which redds affect dissolved oxygen distribution and how this is controlled by hyporheic flow. The oxygen concentration across the cross-sectional plane of a fish nest is measured using a planar optode and microsensors. Hydraulic measurements include pressure measurements along the sediment-water interface and dye visualization. The redd design is based on a salmonid redd, which consists of a scour feature and a tailspin. The salmonid eggs are found in the tailspin. We hypothesize that the oxygen concentration will be greatest in close proximity to the gravel base of the redd and concentration will decrease with increasing depth and distance from the redd. Higher oxygen concentrations in the tailspin supports the placement of fish eggs within that area as opposed to a less oxygenated area of the streambed. Thus, fish nests are likely bio-engineered to optimize hyporheic flow and biogeochemistry to improve egg viability.",

            "abstract": "Smooth plains occupy c. 27% of the surface of Mercury. Embayment relations, spectral contrast with surroundings, and morphologic characteristics indicate that the majority of these plains are volcanic. The largest deposits are located in Mercury's northern hemisphere and include the extensive northern plains (NP) and the Caloris interior and exterior plains (with the latter likely including basin material). Both the NP and Caloris deposits are, within statistical error, the same age (~3.8–3.9 Ga). To test whether this age reflects a period of global volcanism on Mercury, we determined crater size–frequency distributions for four smooth plains units in the planet's southern hemisphere interpreted to be volcanic. Two deposits are situated within the Beethoven and Tolstoj impact basins; two are located close to the Debussy and the Alver and Disney basins, respectively. Each deposit hosts two populations of craters, one that postdates plains emplacement and one that consists of partially to nearly filled craters that predate the plains. This latter population indicates that some time elapsed between formation of the underlying basement and plains volcanism, though we cannot statistically resolve this interval at any of the four sites. Nonetheless, we find that the age given by the superposed crater population in each case is ~3.8 Ga, and crater density values are consistent with those for the NP and Caloris plains. This finding supports a global phase of volcanism near the end of the late heavy bombardment of Mercury and may indicate a period of widespread partial melting of Mercury’s mantle. Notably, superposition relations between smooth plains, degraded impact structures, and contractional landforms suggest that by this time interior cooling had already placed Mercury’s lithosphere in horizontal compression, tending to inhibit voluminous dike-fed volcanism such as that inferred responsible for the NP. Most smooth plains units, including the Caloris plains and our four study sites, are spatially associated with impact structures; even the NP lie in a regional depression that may be impact-related. Because impacts remove overburden, deposit subsurface heat, and relax pre-existing stress, basins and craters may represent preferential sites for volcanic resurfacing on a globally contracting planet.",

To better understand the mechanisms governing the formation and distribution of methane hydrate in marine sediments such as these, we employ a basin-scale reservoir model. We modified a methane hydrate reservoir simulator to include the effects of basin sedimentation, pore water salinity, and microbial methanogenesis. The output of the model is compared to well-characterized methane hydrate distributions at Walker Ridge in the Gulf of Mexico. Our approach employs new methods for determining pore-scale properties. Rather than using empirical formulas that approximate the permeability distribution with depth as a function of compaction porosity, we constrain input permeability directly from analysis of downhole logs. Pore size is determined using a similar method and is used to constrain hydrate equilibrium conditions. Given the expected sand/clay pore size contrast at WR 313 (factor of roughly 3), the dissolved methane concentration gradient between sands and clays caused by their pore size difference is relatively small. This manifests in slower hydrate formation in sands at shallower intervals, with hydrate forming more rapidly deeper in the section due to the diffusive gradients being enhanced by greater spatial solubility gradients. This work is an important step in furthering our ability to properly predict subsurface methane hydrate distributions.",

            "abstract": "Barrier islands are dynamic landscapes that are believed to minimize storm impact to mainland communities and also provide important ecological services in the coastal environment. The protection afforded by the island and the services it provides, however, depend on island resiliency in the face of accelerated sea level rise, which is in turn dependent on the rate of island recovery following storm events that may also change in both frequency and magnitude in the future. These changes in frequency may affect even large dunes and their resiliency, resulting in the island transitioning from a high to a low elevation. Previous research has shown that the condition of the foredune depends on the recovery of the nearshore and beach profile and the ability of vegetation to capture aeolian-transported sediment. An inability of the foredune to recover may result in mainland susceptibility to storm energy, inability for ecosystems to recover and thrive, and sediment budget instability. In this study, LiDAR data is used to quantify the rates of dune recovery at Fire Island, NY, the Outer Banks, NC, Santa Rosa Island, FL, and Matagorda Island, TX. Preliminary results indicate foredune recovery varies significantly both alongshore and in the cross-shore, suggesting that barrier island response and recovery to storm events cannot be considered from a strictly two-dimensional (cross-shore) perspective.",

            "abstract": "Extreme heat has affected parts of the United States during recent summers, particularly 2011 and 2012. Severe cold has also occurred in recent years. This has created a perception that the temperature climate of the U.S. has become more extreme. Is this the case? We address this question by computing probability distribution functions (PDFs) for each season and evaluating temporal changes for the 20th and early 21st centuries using a new gridded monthly temperature data set. We examine changes in the mean, width, and shape of the PDFs for seven U.S. regions, as defined in the third National Climate Assessment.\nDuring the past 2-3 decades, there has been a shift toward more frequent very warm months, but this has been accompanied by a decrease in the occurrence of very cold months. Thus, overall we determine that the temperature climate of the U.S. has not become more extreme. The 1930s were an earlier period of frequent very warm months, but this was primarily a result of very warm daytime temperatures, while the occurrence of months with very high nighttime temperatures was not unusually large during that period.\nThere are important regional variations in these results. In particular, the shift to more frequent very warm months is not predominant in the southeast U.S. annually or in parts of the central U.S. in the summer. This lack of warming is a feature of daytime maximum temperature, not nighttime minimum temperature.",

            "abstract": "We present a preliminary analysis of the crustal and upper mantle structure for off-shore regions in the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. These regions have anomalous oceanic lithosphere: the upper mantle of the North Atlantic ocean is affected by the Iceland plume, while the Arctic ocean has some of the slowest spreading rates. Our specific goal is to constrain the density structure of the upper mantle in order to understand the links between the deep lithosphere dynamics, ocean spreading, ocean floor bathymetry, heat flow and structure of the oceanic lithosphere in the regions where classical models of evolution of the oceanic lithosphere may not be valid. The major focus is on the oceanic lithosphere, but the Arctic shelves with a sufficient data coverage are also included into the analysis.\nOut major interest is the density structure of the upper mantle, and the analysis is based on the interpretation of GOCE satellite gravity data. To separate gravity anomalies caused by subcrustal anomalous masses, the gravitational effect of water, crust and the deep mantle  is removed from the observed gravity field. For bathymetry we use the global NOAA database ETOPO1. The crustal correction to gravity is based on two crustal models: (1) global model CRUST1.0 (Laske, 2013) and, for a comparison, (2) a regional seismic model EUNAseis (Artemieva and Thybo, 2013). The crustal density structure required for the crustal correction is constrained from Vp data. Previous studies have shown that a large range of density values corresponds to any Vp value. To overcome this problem and to reduce uncertainty associated with the velocity-density conversion, we account for regional tectonic variations in the Northern Atlantics as constrained by numerous published seismic profiles and potential-field models across the Norwegian off-shore crust (e.g. Breivik et al., 2005, 2007), and apply different Vp-density conversions for different parts of the region. We present preliminary results, which we use to examine factors that control variations in bathymetry, sedimentary and crustal thicknesses in these anomalous oceanic domains.",

            "abstract": "One obstacle to climate science education is the perception that climate literacy plays little or no role in the formation of opinions about the reality and seriousness of anthropogenic global warming (AGW), or that members of the non-specialist public already know enough climate science to hold an informed opinion. Why engage in climate science education if climate literacy does not matter? The idea that resistance to or dismissal of the findings and policy implications of climate science can be addressed simply by providing more and better information—the ‘deficit model’—has been heavily critiqued in recent years. However, the pendulum is in danger of swinging too far in the opposite direction, with the view that information deficits either do not exist or are not relevant at all to attitude formation, and that cultural perspectives are sufficient by themselves to explain attitudes to AGW.\nThis paper briefly reviews several recent publications that find a correlation between higher levels of climate literacy and greater acceptance of or concern about AGW, then presents results from a survey completed by 458 students at a primarily undergraduate institution in northern Utah in April-May 2013. These data indicate that attitudes to AGW are largely tribal, based on political outlook, Democrats being more concerned, Republicans less concerned. Overall levels of climate literacy demonstrated by respondents were low, but concern about AGW increased with higher levels of climate literacy among Republicans—though not among Democrats, for whom acceptance of AGW appears to be more an article of faith or badge of identity. Findings such as this suggest that, contrary to some recent critiques of the deficit model, information deficits do exist and do matter for opinion formation on AGW, although cultural factors are clearly also of great importance. Climate science education therefore can potentially help engage members of the public in issues related to AGW.",

In particular, our knowledge of the relationship between precipitation and synoptic/mesoscale sea surface wind patterns suffers due to the lack of observations over the ocean. Satellite-based scatterometer wind retrievals, with their ability to observe surface winds near rainfall, coupled with atmospheric reanalysis enable the investigation of the relationships between flows and surface atmosphere exchanges of water and energy near precipitation. In this study, we examine the interactions between surface wind features and the oceanic state, and the kinematic and thermodynamic environment surrounding heavy rain producing oceanic tropical convective systems (excluding tropical cyclones). Three-hourly rainfall data from the TRMM product 3B42 are used to identify extreme precipitation events, and composites of surrounding meteorological fields are examined to understand the forcing and maintenance of these systems. Atmosphere-ocean surface heat and moisture fluxes are analyzed with corresponding meteorological fields provided by MERRA reanalyses, as well as bulk aerodynamic formulae using scatterometer data. In addition, QuikSCAT, ASCAT, and RapidSCAT are used to represent surface wind data surrounding the precipitation systems in question, and differences between MERRA and scatterometer near surface winds are investigated. The goal of this research is to understand the co-evolution of surface wind kinematic features and heavy precipitation, and their water and energy budgets in intense oceanic tropical rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Sustainability awareness is increasingly a subject in educational settings. Marine science classes are perfect\nsettings of establishing sustainability awareness owing to declining populations of organisms and perceived\ncollapse in fisheries worldwide. Students in oceanography classes often request more direct exposure to actual\nocean situations or field trips. During regular session (13 week) or shorter term (4 week) summer classes such long\ntrips are logistically difficult owing to large numbers of students involved or timing. This new approach to such a\ncourse supplement addresses the requests by utilizing local resources and short field trips for a limited number of\nstudents (20) to locations in which Ocean experiences are available, and are often supported through education\nand outreach components. The vision of the class was a mixture of classroom time, readings, along with paper\nand laboratories. In addition, short day-long trips to locations where the ocean was “captured” were also used to\nsupplement the experience as well as speakers involved with aquaculture. Central Virginia is a fortunate location\nfor such a class, with close access for travel to the Chesapeake Bay and numerous field stations, museums with\nocean-based exhibits (the Smithsonian and National Zoo) that address both extant and extinct Earth history, as\nwell as national/state aquaria in Baltimore and Virginia Beach. Furthermore, visits to local seafood markets at\nlocal grocery stores, or larger city markets in Washington, Baltimore and Virginia Beach, enhance the exposure to\nproductivity in the ocean, and viability of the fisheries sustainability. The course could then address not only the\nparticulars of the marine science, but also aspects of sustainability with discussions on ethics, including keeping\nanimals in captivity or overfishing of particular species and the special difficulties that arise from captive or\nculturing ocean populations. In addition, the class was encouraged to post web-based journals of experiences in\norder to share opinions of observations in each of the settings, including the evaluation of the foods they were\nconsuming during the class",

Natural biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants occur in in situ reactive zones present in both the vadose and saturated zones. Biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons results in a mass discharge of gaseous biodegradation products through the vadose zone and transport of dissolved gases through the saturated zone. While previous studies have focused solely on transport of degradation products or geochemical parameters in groundwater or efflux of gaseous byproducts from the vadose zone, this study examines both pathways for discharge of degradation products. Quantifying the mass discharge of the biodegradation products through these zones is important to estimate the rates of natural source attenuation, assess the success of monitored natural attenuation, and quantify and document contaminant mass loss. In this study, surface efflux and groundwater mass discharge rates of biodegradation products (carbon dioxide, methane, and other intermediates) were quantified using field data. Field and analytical methodologies will be presented along with the results of the data analysis and a discussion of the uncertainties. Based on the data analysis, the surface efflux pathway through the vadose was found to be the dominant pathway for carbon loss at the monitored field site.",

My previous work present methods of using novel viscoacoustic and viscoelastic wave equations to recover the time invariance property of such wave equations for viscoacoustic and viscoelastic time-reversal modeling. More importantly, attenuation effects are compensated for during time-reversal wave propagation. In this paper, I investigate the possibility of retrieving the Green’s function through time-reversal modeling techniques in attenuating media. I consider two different models to illustrate the feasibility of Green’s function retrieval in attenuating media. I consider the viscoacoustic as well as the viscoelastic situation. Numerical results show that the Green’s function can be retrieved in the correct amplitude and phase by time-reversal modeling with compensating both amplitude loss and dispersion effects.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation has the ability to influence local water, carbon and energy fluxes in complex ways. In many climate models, dynamic vegetation is closely linked to soil moisture since 95% of all roots are located in the upper 2m of soil. However, in some ecosystems this bottom 5% of roots contributes an important percentage of net transpiration through the processes of hydraulic lift and redistribution.\nHydraulic lift and redistribution is the movement of water by vegetation through the use of a passive water potential gradient. During periods where water is readily available, vegetation is able to store excess water in deeper soils. When conditions become more arid, the vegetation is able to bring this water back up to the near surface in order to re-hydrate the soil. This water is then used in transpiration and also aids in soil decomposition and nutrient breakdown in the upper soil layers.\nWhile hydraulic lift and redistribution has been identified in individual plant species, there has been limited work to understand the contribution of deep root functioning on broader spatial scales. Here we propose to use satellite data products in conjunction with ground-based observations in order to better determine the atmospheric link to deep moisture across land cover types within the state of Oklahoma. For this preliminary assessment, we will utilize the 8-day MOD 16 evapotranspiration product along with soil moisture observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet to compare and contrast a paired dry and wet case study period. We hypothesize that the presence of deep root functioning in certain land cover types increases resiliency to drought and will be observable between the case studies as reduced suppression of evapotranspiration and enhanced latent cooling of the surface.",

            "abstract": "Lagrangian trajectory calculations, in which air-parcel paths are determined from wind fields from operational analysis and reanalysis data, are standard tools for diagnosing dynamical interactions and chemical concentrations in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. However, due to poor observational sampling, these calculations suffer from uncertainties that are difficult to account for. Potentially large contributors to these uncertainties are velocity fluctuations at space and time scales not resolved by the analysis data sets used to calculate trajectories. These fluctuations cause trajectories to disperse from paths determined by resolved winds. While filling the data voids at small scales is not a viable alternative for the foreseeable future, the small-scale variability has robust statistical relationships with variations at resolved scales. We examine these relationships and their uncertainties using wind fields from the high-resolution (12 km in the horizontal) ECMWF operational analysis and from aircraft observations from ATTREX. Estimates of the corresponding trajectory dispersion are then determined using a stochastically forced Lagrangian trajectory model.",

These small organic amines are often highly soluble, being found in atmospheric condensed phases such as fogwater and rainwater. Additionally, they display acid-neutralization ability often greater than ammonia, yet little is known regarding their kinetic and thermodynamic properties. This presentation will describe the molecular level details of a model amine system at the vapor/liquid interface in the presence of acidic gas. We find that this amine system shows very unique properties in terms of its bonding, structure, and orientation at aqueous surfaces.

            "abstract": "Mullins Glacier is a cold-based debris-covered glacier feeding into Beacon Valley, at high altitude in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Ice is exposed at the headwall in Mullins Valley but the majority of the glacier is buried beneath a sublimation till (lag deposit composed of englacial and supraglacial debris). This till is initially ~10 cm thick but gradually thickens to ~60 cm at the glacier terminus (~8 km distant). Mullins Glacier has been postulated to be one of the world’s oldest alpine glaciers: tephrachronology places a minimum age of the overlying sublimation till near the terminus at 7.9 Ma. Our measurements of the complex resistivity (aka spectral induced polarization or dielectric spectroscopy) of massive Mullins Glacier ice reveal two distinct origins. The electrical properties of clean ice or ice with rock fragments are typical of meteoric polar ice (Stillman et al., JGR, 2013). However, \"dirty\" ice is electrically distinct, indicating soluble impurity content near lattice saturation. This behavior, which we also observed for Lake Vostok accretion ice, is consistent with freezing from saline, draining water. Therefore one hypothesis it that the dirty ice formed by infiltration in former clement environments. However, very efficient segregation is subsequently required, and not all dirty ice is at the top of the ice column. Dirty ice likely samples debris bands, which are more commonly observed in cores where Mullins Glacier has advanced onto the main (Beacon) valley floor and is nearly stagnant. If debris bands are correlated to lattice impurity saturation via the dirty ice, then they may have been transiently at or near melting. This may be a primary feature of the environment during debris accumulation or simply due to the high thermal inertia of debris. Alternatively, debris bands and associated salts may be carried below the annual thermal wave where they experience near-constant, supereutectic temperatures. Elevated temperatures may be electrically imprinted even in cold-based glaciers.",

            "abstract": "Observations of Solar-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) are currently retrieved from the GOSAT and GOME-2 satellites, and will become available from OCO-2 shortly. The GOSAT (and OCO-2) satellite has a midday overpass time, while GOME-2 has a variable observation of approximately 0800-1100 local time. Previous studies have demonstrated a linear relationship between SIF and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), but lack the ability to investigate causes of spatiotemporal variability. We demonstrate an ability to simulate SIF using a landsurface model (the Simple Biosphere Model; SIB) for direct comparison to observations. We calculate fluorescence yield based on known relationships between photosynthesis and fluorescence, and calculate total SIF using existing leaf-to-canopy scaling factors.\nWe find that simulated SIF exceeds GOSAT retrieved SIF, especially in tropical and Boreal forests. Simulated SIF exceeds GOME-2 values in Boreal forest and in lower-productivity areas such as marginal desert and tundra. Observed SIF GOME-2 in croplands is significantly higher than simulations. SIF simulated for low- and high-productivity grassland and savanna show much less seasonal and interannual amplitude when compared to values from both satellites, implicating that model phenology and/or response to meteorological forcing is damped. Simulated SIF seasonal cycles are similar to observed from both satellites, and simulations are able to reproduce drought events such as occurred in Russia in 2010 and the Central USA in 2012. As simulated SIF more closely resembles observations, model estimates of GPP become more robust, as does our ability to understand and recreate the mechanisms involved in vegetation response to seasonal cycles and anomalous stress events such as drought.",

            "abstract": "Photoelectrons escape from the ionosphere on sunlit polar cap field lines. In order for those field lines to carry zero current without significant heavy ion outflow or cold electron inflow, field-aligned potential drops must form to reflect a portion of the escaping photoelectron population back to the ionosphere. Using a 1-D ionosphere-polar wind model and measurements from the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR-N), this paper shows that these reflected photoelectrons are a significant source of heat for the sunlit polar cap ionosphere. The model includes a kinetic suprathermal electron transport solver, and it allows energy input from the upper boundary in three different ways: thermal conduction, soft precipitation, and potentials that reflect photoelectrons. The simulations confirm that reflection potentials of several 10s of eV are required to prevent cold electron inflow and demonstrate that the flux tube integrated change in electron heating rate (FTICEHR) associated with reflected photoelectrons can reach 109 eV cm-2s-1. Soft precipitation can produce FTICEHR of comparable magnitudes, but this extra heating is divided among more electrons as a result of electron impact ionization. Simulations with no reflected photoelectrons and with downward field-aligned currents (FAC) primarily carried by the escaping photoelectrons have electron temperatures which are ~250-500 K lower than the RISR-N measurements in the 300-600 km region; however, simulations with reflected photoelectrons, zero FAC, and no other form of heat flux through the upper boundary can satisfactorily reproduce the RISR-N data.",

The performance of the state of the art Hamamatsu C12703-01 Silicon Avalanche photodiode (SAD) was compared to that of the Hamamatsu R928 Photomultiplier tube (PMT). The Hamamatsu R928 evolved from a sequence of photometric detectors with a long history of use in support of laboratory and remote sensing studies, tracing backwards to include the RCA 1P21 and the RCA 931A. Two newly acquired SADs were bench tested along with a new R928 photomultiplier tube that was thermoelectrically cooled to -10 deg C. The SAD’s employed electronic thermal compensation supplied by the manufacturer. The SADs and PMT measured electromagnetic radiation from solid-state lasers of wavelength 635 nm after the radiation was reflected from diffusely-scattering surfaces of varying albedos. The SADs were housed on tripods that were co-aligned with the PMT and laser. The photometric detectors were placed 4.3 meters from a reflecting disk. The disk was rotated to reduce the effect of laser speckle. All detectors in the experiment were equipped with notch filters that transmit light only of the wavelength emitted by the laser. Three SR830 DSP Lock-in Amplifiers were connected to the detectors and various setting configurations were compared in order to optimize signal to noise. Neutral Density filters (ND 0,3 and ND 0,9) were placed in the light path to determine the linearity in the response function of the detectors. We conclude that in this application SADs and PMTs produce comparable photometric precision and fidelity. SADs offer greater convenience because thermal compensation circuitry is integrated with the detector. This work was partially supported by NASA’s Cassini Science Investigation program.",

A total of 32 measurements of seismic noise have been completed on this site in order to see if lithological site effects are detectable with this H/V method. After checking the H/V curve reliability criteria (length of the window to be analyzed, the number of windows analyzed, standard deviation) and the criteria for clear peaks in H/V (conditions for the amplitude, conditions for stability) found in the SESAME project in 2004, the results of the H/V spectra obtained are generally very consistent and clearly indicate site effects with peak resonance frequencies between 3 and 14 Hz. The presence of these well defined frequency peaks in the H/V spectral ratio indicates that the ground motion can be amplified by geomorphological site effects.\nComparative analyzes of these H/V measurements with Grilla and Geopsy software were made in this paper to estimate the amplification magnitude of these effects. Graphical comparisons between the Grilla and Geopsy H/V maps were completed in this study and allow us to identify typical areas and their associated fundamental resonance frequencies.",

Recent reports from field measurements and laboratory studies show that some SOA particles are better represented by a semi-solid low viscosity tar-like material rather than a ideal liquid often assumed in regional and global models. Characterizing the phase of SOA is crucial to understanding how particles interact with trace gases and how it ultimately impacts their growth and evolution in the atmosphere. We report here laboratory studies carried out in the unique UCI large-volume, slow-flow, aerosol flow reactor. Particles from the ozonolysis of a-pinene were formed at various relative humidities (RH from < 3% to 90%) and collected onto a custom ATR-FTIR impactor. The observed impaction pattern provided insights into changes in phase/viscosity of the SOA as a function of relative humidity. In addition, attenuated total reflectance FTIR and mass spectrometry measurements provided information on simultaneous changes on composition. Application of ATR-FTIR combined with PTR-MS provided additional data on the volatility of the SOA at room temperature and diffusion coefficients of two key components pinonaldehyde and acetic acid present in the SOA. Implication for modeling the growth and ultimately the lifetime of SOA in the atmosphere will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The reflection variation and the polarization change with phase angle of radiation scattered from particulate materials has been studied for a century in efforts to understand the nature of clouds, aerosols, planetary ring systems and planetary regolith materials. The increase in reflectance as phase angle decreases, the ‘Opposition Effect’, has been well documented in astronomical observations and laboratory studies. Variations in linear polarization near small phase angles have also been well studied (e.g. Shkuratov et al.,2002, Rosenbush et al. 2015). While the phenomena have been well documented, a generally accepted physical explanation is still lacking despite many excellent theoretical modeling efforts.\nWe have undertaken a reductionist approach in deconstructing the process. We have fabricated a goniometer which permits us to present samples with discrete wavelengths of monochromatic light that is linearly polarized in and perpendicular to the scattering plane. We also can illuminate our samples with both right handed and left handed circular polarization senses. Silicon Avalanche Photodiodes record the reflected radiation from the sample after it has passed through linear and circular polarizing analyzers(Kroner et al.).\nThis reductionist approach permits us to measure the reflectance and polarization phase curves and the change in linear and circular polarization ratio (LPR and CPR) with phase angle between 0.056 and 17 degrees. LPR and CPR are found to be important indicators of the amount of multiple scattering in the medium (Hapke, 1990, Nelson et al, 1998, 2000;Hapke, 2012).\nThis approach provides a way to distinguish between suggested models and to gain greater insight into the process of the scattering of electromagnetic radiation in a variety of media.\nThis work was supported by NASA’s Cassini Science Program\nHapke, B.

            "abstract": "The synergistic effects of evaporation (E), precipitation (P), and Ekman transport make the SPURS (Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study) region in the subtropical North Atlantic (15-30°N, 30-45°W) the ideal location for the world’s highest open ocean sea surface salinity. Using the MERRA and ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalyses, we reproduce the mean hydrologic state of the atmosphere over the SPURS region since 1979 and roughly deduce the change in salinity across the meridional domain due solely to interactions between E-P and Ekman transport. Our findings suggest a region that is highly evaporative at a mean rate of 4.87 mm/day with a standard deviation of 1.2 mm/day and little seasonality. Precipitation is much more variable with an annual fall maximum around 3 mm/day but only a mean rate of 1.37 mm/day with a standard deviation of 1.46 mm/day. The resulting E-P variable has a mean rate of 3.50 mm/day with a standard deviation of 1.92 mm/day and matches well with the moisture flux divergence term although the former is typically larger by a small margin. Strong prevailing easterly trade winds generate northward Ekman transports that advect water northward to the salinity maximum around 25°N. A short calculation shows that atmospheric moisture dynamics could potentially account for almost half of the change in salinity between 15°N and 25°N giving an estimate of the role that surface freshwater flux plays in the maintenance of the salinity maximum.",

            "abstract": "The vertical distribution of clouds in the trades, and how this distribution is linked to the thermodynamic structure of the lower troposphere, is emerging as a key factor in the assessment of modeled cloud feedbacks. The spread in cloud feedbacks and climate sensitivity may be attributed to how efficiently models dry the lower troposphere as climate warms. This relates to how models mix moisture vertically, and thus to how their clouds are distributed.\nA three year record of cloudiness and boundary layer structure from a ground-based remote sensing station at Barbados, situated in a typical trade-wind region, is used to gain insight into the major components of the cloud distribution, and how these vary with changes in atmospheric structure. These insights are then used to evaluate modeled cloud behavior in single time step (half-hourly) output of the ECMWF IFS and CMIP5 models, at a grid point nearby Barbados.\nCloudiness is found to be regulated by two components with a different sensitivity to the large-scale flow. Cloud near cloud base is on average the largest contributor to cloudiness, but is relatively constant on time scales much longer than a day. This is because turbulence and cumulus convection adjust fast to perturbations, and self-regulate the cumulus mass flux and cloudiness near cloud base. A secondary component consists mainly of stratiform outflow layers near the detrainment level of cumulus tops, which carry most of the variability on longer time scales. The organization of convection into larger and deeper clusters, which can vertically transport large amounts of moisture, appear key in regulating such outflow layers.\nSeveral models fail at reproducing these smaller scale processes that control trade-wind cloudiness in the current climate. The stratiform component in modeled distributions of trade-wind cloudiness is seldom pronounced, and their distributions tend to be bottom-heavy. Whereas observations suggest that changes in clouds are more likely manifested in the component of cloud aloft, models show large variances in their cloud base component instead. Hence, changes in cloudiness into a warmer climate predicted by models may be largely carried by changes that are unlike nature.",

This plasma carries the sun's magnetic field along with it, where it interacts with and causes disruptions in the earth's magnetic field. Our understanding of the solar wind is vital to efforts toward minimizing the impact of these disturbances on both ground and space-based systems. Using interplanetary scintillation data gathered by the ground-based Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) in India, we have constructed boundary maps of solar wind velocities at 1 day intervals. For a simple, first approximation, we use what is called the \"P-point\" method to crudely estimate the solar wind velocity at the point of closest approach to the Sun along each line of sight. Then we trace the P-point values back to a spherical surface at 0.2 AU where we interpolate them to a structured gird. The resulting boundary maps can serve as the initial input to a time-dependent MHD tomography program being developed at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.",

            "abstract": "Climate models are sensitive to the representation of ocean mixing processes. This has motivated recent efforts to collect observations aimed at improving mixing estimates and parameterizations. The US/UK field program Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES), begun in 2009, is providing such estimates upstream of and within the Drake Passage. This region is characterized by topography, and strong zonal jets. In previous studies, mixing length theories, based on the assumption that eddies are dominated by a single wavenumber and phase speed, were formulated to represent the estimated mixing patterns in jets. However, in spite of the success of the single wavenumber theory in some other scenarios, it does not effectively predict the vertical structures of observed eddy diffusivities in the DIMES area. Considering that eddy motions encompass a wide range of wavenumbers, which all contribute to mixing, in this study we formulated a multi-wavenumber theory to predict eddy mixing rates. We test our theory for a domain encompassing the entire Southern Ocean. We estimated eddy diffusivities and mixing lengths from one million numerical floats in a global eddying model. These float-based mixing estimates were compared with the predictions from both the single-wavenumber and the multi-wavenumber theories. Our preliminary results in the DIMES area indicate that, compared to the single-wavenumber theory, the multi-wavenumber theory better predicts the vertical mixing structures in the vast areas where the mean flow is weak; however in the intense jet region, both theories have similar predictive skill.",

            "abstract": "In April of 2014, NOAA/OAR/ESRL Global Systems Division (GSD) and Trimble, in collaboration with Earth Networks, Inc. (ENI) signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to transfer the existing NOAA GPS-Met Data Acquisition and Processing System (GPS-Met DAPS) technology to a commercial Trimble/ENI partnership.\n NOAA's GPS-Met DAPS is currently operated in a pseudo-operational mode but has proven highly reliable and running at over 95% uptime. The DAPS uses the GAMIT software to ingest dual frequency carrier phase GPS/GNSS observations and ancillary information such as real-time satellite orbits to estimate the zenith-scaled tropospheric (ZTD) signal delays and, where surface MET data are available, retrieve integrated precipitable water vapor (PWV). The NOAA data and products are made available to end users in near real-time. The Trimble/ENI partnership will use the Trimble Pivot™ software with the Atmosphere App to calculate zenith tropospheric (ZTD), tropospheric slant delay, and integrated precipitable water vapor (PWV).\nEvaluation of the Trimble software is underway starting with a comparison of ZTD and PWV values determined from GPS stations located near NOAA Radiosonde Observation (Upper-Air Observation) launch sites. A success metric was established that requires Trimble’s PWV estimates to match ESRL/GSD's to within 1.5 mm 95% of the time, which corresponds to a ZTD uncertainty of less than 10 mm 95% of the time. Initial results indicate that Trimble/ENI data meet and exceed the ZTD metric, but for some stations PWV estimates are out of specification. These discrepancies are primarily due to how offsets between MET and GPS stations are handled and are easily resolved. Additional test networks are proposed that include low terrain/high moisture variability stations, high terrain/low moisture variability stations, as well as high terrain/high moisture variability stations.\nWe will present results from further testing along with a timeline for the transition of the GPS-Met DAPS to an operational commercial service.",

Understanding how the human-natural system couple and decouple biogeochemical cycles across urbanization gradients is crucial for human health and environmental sustainability. Natural processes of nutrient deposition, export, uptake, and internal cycling can be disrupted by human activities. Residential landscape management (e.g. composting, leaf litter collection, fertilizer application) interrupts these natural biogeochemical cycles; therefore, it is key to characterize these practices and their impacts. This study looks at private land management practices along a rural to urban gradient in Boston, Massachusetts. We used a mail survey instrument coupled with biogeochemical measurements and remote sensing derived estimates of aboveground biomass to estimate biogeochemical modifications associated with residential landscape management practices. We find parcel size influences management behavior, management practices differ for leaf litter and lawn clippings, and fertilizer application is unrelated to parcel size or degree of urban-ness. These management practices result in nutrient redistribution that differs with residential characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a key role in transporting water and energy in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Remotely sensed images from Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are increasingly used for estimating spatial and temporal distribution of ET using different modeling algorithms. Landsat and MODIS have different spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions thus resulting in ET maps of different visual and analytical qualities. Downscaling is a great way of utilizing the combined benefits of the high temporal resolution of MODIS images and fine spatial resolution of Landsat images. We have evaluated the performance of the output regression with intercept method for data downscaling in the Colorado River basin. Our results showed that application of regression coefficients computed over large areas such as the Colorado River Basin are not able to produce accurate ET maps. Thus we developed the Linear with Zero Intercept (LinZI) method for downscaling MODIS-based monthly ET maps to the Landsat-scale ET maps for the Colorado River Basin. We obtained a high agreement between downscaled monthly ET maps using the LinZI method and the eddy covariance measurements from seven flux sites within the Colorado River Basin. The mean absolute error of the monthly ET ranged from 8 mm to 25 mm, and the coefficient of determination varied from 0.53 to 0.88. Most of the discrepancies between measured and downscaled monthly ET were mainly at two flux sites due to the prevailing flux footprint. Downscaled monthly ET using the LinZI method nicely captured the temporal variation in the sampled land cover classes. We plan to use the LinZI method for estimating ET at finer temporal resolution (such as 8 days) with further evaluation. The proposed downscaling method will be very useful in advancing the application of remotely sensed images in water resources planning and management.",

            "abstract": "Superimposed on the continued increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration is a prominent seasonal cycle. Ground-based and aircraft-based observation records show that the amplitude of this seasonal cycle has increased. Will this trend continue into future? In this paper, we analyzed simulations for historical (1850-2005) and future (RCP8.5, 2006-2100) periods produced by 10 Earth System Models participating the Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Our results show a model consensus that the increase of CO2 seasonal amplitude continues throughout the 21 century. The seasonal amplitude of the multi-model global mean detrended CO2 increases from 1.6 ppm during 1961-1970 to 2.7 ppm during 2081-2090, and the mean relative amplitude increases by 62±19%. This increase is dominated by a 68±25% increase from Net Biosphere Production (NBP). We then show the increase of NBP amplitude mainly comes from enhanced ecosystem uptake during Northern Hemisphere growing season under future CO2 and temperature conditions. Separate analyses on net primary production and respiration reveal that enhanced ecosystem carbon uptake contributes to about 75% of the amplitude increase. Stimulated by higher CO2 concentration and high-latitude warming, enhanced net primary production likely outcompetes increased respiration at higher temperature. Zonal distribution and the spatial pattern of NBP change suggest that regions north of 45°N dominate the amplitude increase. We also found that changes of NBP and its seasonal amplitude are significantly (R=0.73, p<0.05) correlated—models that simulate a stronger carbon uptake tend to show higher change of NBP seasonal amplitude.",

            "abstract": "An increased warming trend over the Arctic in recent years has been documented using observations, and is expected to continue by climate model projections. This increase may shift the springtime transition time, resulting in a longer sea-ice melt and vegetation growing period over the Arctic. In this study, we investigated variability of and changes in the spring transition in a warming climate and examined attributions of various dynamic and thermodynamic processes. The results demonstrate a dramatic increase in springtime surface air temperature (SAT) over the Arctic since 1979. Physical analysis reveals the importance of large-scale poleward moisture and energy advection accompanied by an enhancement in net downward radiation flux, which result in the surface warming. The cloudiness could impact the surface radiation budget and retreat of sea ice cover reduces surface albedo, making an additional contribution to the surface warming. In addition to the overall evaluation of these physical processes, composite analysis suggests that relative contributions from these processes to the increased springtime SAT vary across different geographic sub-regions.",

            "abstract": "Gross primary production (GPP) of croplands may be used to quantify crop productivity and evaluate a range of management practices. Eddy flux data from three soybean (Glycine max L.) fields under different management practices (no-till vs till; rainfed vs irrigated) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived vegetation indices (VIs) were used to evaluate the biophysical performance of VIs and crop phenology, and to model GPP using a satellite-based vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM). The VIs tracked soybean phenology well and delineated the growing season length. The results show that the carbon uptake period and seasonal sums of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and GPP can be inferred from the length of the vegetation activity period from satellite remote sensing data. Land surface water index (LSWI) tracked drought-impacted vegetation well. On a seasonal scale, NEE of the soybean sites ranged from -37 to -264 g C m-2. The result suggests that rainfed soybean fields needed about 450-500 mm of well-distributed seasonal rainfall to maximize the net carbon sink. During non-drought conditions, VPM accurately estimated seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of GPP of soybean under different management practices. However, some large discrepancies between GPPVPM and GPPEC were observed under drought conditions as the VI did not reflect the corresponding decrease in GPP. Diurnal GPP dynamics showed a bimodal distribution with a pronounced midday depression at the period of higher water vapor pressure deficit (> 1.2 kPa). A modified Wscalar based on LSWI, to account for the water stress, in VPM helped quantify the reduction in GPP during severe drought and the model’s performance improved substantially. The results of this study demonstrate the potential use of remotely sensed VIs for better understanding of carbon dynamics and extrapolation of GPP of soybean croplands.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the height of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is important to understand the transport behavior, mixing, and surface concentrations of air pollutants. In Reno, NV, located in complex, mountainous terrain with high desert climate, the daytime boundary layer can rise to an estimated 3km or more on a summer day due to surface heating and convection. The nocturnal boundary layer, conversely, tends to be much lower and highly stable due to radiative cooling from the surface at night and downslope flow of cool air from nearby mountains. With limited availability of radiosonde data, current estimates of the PBL height at any given time or location are potentially over or underestimated. To better quantify the height and characterize the PBL physics, we developed portable, lightweight sensors that measure CO2 concentrations, temperature, pressure, and humidity every 5 seconds. Four of these sensors are used on a tethered balloon system to monitor CO2 concentrations from the surface up to 300m. We will combine this data with Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) data that measures vertical profiles of wind speed, temperature, and humidity from 40m to 400m. This experiment will characterize the diurnal evolution of CO2 concentrations at multiple heights in the PBL, provide insight into PBL physics during stability transition periods at sunrise and sunset, and estimate the nighttime PBL depth during August in Reno. Further, we expect to gain a better understanding of the impact of mixing volume changes (i.e., PBL height) on air quality and pollution concentrations in Reno. The custom portable sensor design will also be presented. It is expected that these instruments can be used for indoor or outdoor air quality studies, where lightness, small size, and battery operation can be of benefit.",

            "abstract": "The PRISM monthly climatology has been widely used by various agencies for diverse purposes. In the River Forecast Centers (RFCs), the PRISM monthly climatology is used to support tasks such as QPE, or quality control of point precipitation observation, and fine tune QPFs. Validation studies by forecasters and researchers have shown that interpolation involving PRISM climatology can effectually reduce the estimation bias for the locations where moderate or little orographic phenomena occur. However, many studies have pointed out limitations in PRISM monthly climatology. These limitations are especially apparent in storm events with fast-moving wet air masses or with storm tracks that are different from climatology. In order to upgrade PRISM climatology so it possesses the capability to characterize the climatology of storm events, it is critical to integrate large-scale atmospheric conditions with the original PRISM predictor variables and to simulate them at a temporal resolution higher than monthly. To this end, a simple, flexible, and powerful framework for precipitation estimation modeling that can be applied to very large data sets is thus developed.\nIn this project, a decision tree based estimation structure was developed to perform the aforementioned variable integration work. Three Atmospheric River events (ARs) were selected to explore the hierarchical relationships among these variables and how these relationships shape the event-based precipitation distribution pattern across California. Several atmospheric variables, including vertically Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT), temperature, zonal wind (u), meridional wind (v), and omega (ω), were added to enhance the sophistication of the tree-based structure in estimating precipitation. To develop a direction-based climatology, the directions the ARs moving over the Pacific Ocean were also calculated and parameterized within the tree estimation structure. The results show that the involvement of the atmospheric variables in addition to the applications of the decision tree algorithm can aptly capture the precipitation distribution patterns of extreme events. This generated storm-based precipitation climatology can be used to improve the quality of Mountain Mapper procedures in the RFCs.",

Indirect radiative effects are based on the way in which aerosols interact and alter cloud optical and microphysical properties. One area of interactions occurs during cloud formation when aerosols act as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) or Ice Nuclei (IN), and can modify cloud particle/droplet size and number distributions, and hence, influence Earth’s radiation budget. Dominant sources of ocean-derived aerosols that may serve as CCN include sea spray and biogenicly formed aerosol. In this study, we use 10-years of global observations from the A-Train satellites to show seasonal variations of cloud droplet number concentrations, ocean chlorophyll concentrations, distributions of aerosol angstrom parameter and rainfall. Potential cloud-aerosol interactions are explored by considering seasonal and spatial correlations between derived microphysical properties of clouds and aerosols.

Moreover, predictions regarding the near-term and long-term future effects of SLC in this region are inconclusive because there is uncertainty regarding its long-term causes. As a result, the findings of a study of the various components of sea-level change on the U.S. East Coast will be presented. A model for SLC on the East Coast will be developed consisting of SLC due to thermosteric changes, glacial isostatic adjustment, and gravitationally self-consistent calculations for SLC due to present-day melting from Greenland and other areas from GRACE data.

Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain these low numbers, including the effect of glassy secondary organic aerosol acting as heterogeneous ice nuclei (IN). In this study, we explored these effects using the CAM5.3 model. SOA fields were provided by an offline version of the University of Michigan-IMPACT model, which has a detailed process-based mechanism that describes aerosol microphysics and SOA formation through both gas phase and multiphase reactions. The transition criterion of SOA to glassy heterogeneous IN follows the parameterization developed by Wang et al. 2012. With this parameterization, glassy SOA IN form mainly when the temperature (T) is lower than 210K.\nIn the default CAM5.3 set-up in which only the fraction of Aitken mode sulfate aerosols with diameter larger than 100nm participate in the ice nucleation (Liu and Penner 2005 parameterization), glassy SOA IN are shown to decrease the ice number (Ni) by suppressing some of the homogeneous freezing at low temperatures thereby leading to an improved representation of the relationship between Ni and T compared to the observations summarized by Kramer et al. 2009.\nHowever, when we allow the total number of the Aitken mode sulfate particles to participate in homogeneous freezing, glassy SOA IN have only a small impact on the relationship between Ni and T. If the subgrid updraft velocity is decreased to 0.1 m/s (compared to 0.2 m/s in the default set-up), there is a large decrease of Ni, since homogeneous freezing is more easily suppressed by glassy SOA IN at these updrafts.\nWe also present the effects of glassy SOA IN using an alternative ice nucleation scheme (Barahona and Nenes, 2009).",

MORDOR is a lumped, reservoir, elevation based model with hourly or daily areal rainfall and air temperature as the driving input data. The principal hydrological processes represented are evapotranspiration, direct and indirect runoff, ground water, snow accumulation and melt and routing. The model has been intensively used at EDF for more than 20 years, in particular for modeling French mountainous watersheds. In the matter of parameters calibration we propose and test alternative multi-criteria techniques based on two specific approaches: automatic calibration using single-objective functions and a priori parameter calibration founded on hydrological watershed features. The automatic calibration approach uses single-objective functions, based on Kling–Gupta efficiency, to quantify the good agreement between the simulated and observed runoff focusing on four different runoff samples: (i) time-series sample, (I) annual hydrological regime, (iii) monthly cumulative distribution functions and (iv) recession sequences.The primary purpose of this study is to analyze the definition and sensitivity of MORDOR parameters testing different calibration techniques in order to: (i) simplify the model structure, (ii) increase the calibration-validation performance of the model and (iii) reduce the equifinality problem of calibration process. We propose an alternative calibration strategy that reaches these goals. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating MORDOR model to daily data for 50 watersheds located in French mountainous regions.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols play a critical role in climate directly by scattering and absorbing solar radiation and indirectly by modifying the cloud formation. Currently, the direct and indirect effects of aerosols represent the largest uncertainty in climate predictions models. Some aerosols are directly emitted, but the majority are formed in the atmosphere by the oxidation of gaseous precursors. However, the formation of aerosols at the molecular level is not fully characterized. Certain category of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), which represent a significant fraction of the total aerosol burden, can be light-absorbing, also known as brown carbon. However, the overall contribution of SOA to the brown carbon and the related climate forcing is poorly understood. Such incomplete understanding is due in part to the chemical complexity of SOA and the lack of knowledge regarding SOA formation, transformation, and optical properties. Based on previous laboratory experiments, field measurements, and modeling studies, it has been suggested that the polymers and oligomers play an important role in the SOA formation. Atmospheric polymers could be produced by the hydration or heterogeneous reactions of epoxides and small α-dicarbonyls. Their aqueous chemistry products have been shown to give light-absorbing and high molecular weight oligomeric species, which increase the SOA mass production and alter the direct and indirect effect of aerosols. In this paper, the aerosol chemistry of small α-dicarbonyl compounds with amines is investigated and the associated optical properties are measured using spectroscopic techniques. The differences between primary, secondary and tertiary amines with glyoxal and methylglyoxal are evaluated in terms of SOA browning efficiency. Atmospheric implications of our present work for understanding the formation of light-absorbing SOA will be presented, particularly in terms of the product distribution of light-absorbing SOA formed by aqueous phase reactions.",

            "abstract": "The spatial distribution patterns and response of terrestrial ecosystems to climatic controls vary depending on different land cover types, geographic location, and the relative influence of these feedbacks. Therefore understanding the long term relationship between land cover and climate variation over a large spatial extent is necessary. In this research, we studied the relationship between the spatial distribution of shrubland ecosystems and climate conditions of both temperature and precipitation in the western United States. The spatial distribution and cover intensities of shrubland ecosystems components including shrub, sagebrush, herbaceousness, and bare ground were quantified through the shrubland mapping project conducted by the USGS. The fractional cover of shrubland components were quantified through multiple scale modeling with regression tree models using both high-resolution WV-2 and Landsat 8 images. Climate records between 1980 and 2012 from Daymet were used to characterize regional climate condition into different climatic clusters following the spatial and temporal features of different climate variables. Subsequently, land cover data and the fractional cover of shrubland ecosystems components were employed to assess responses of different shrubbland ecosystem species to climate controls in different climate clusters. The spatial correlations between shrubland species and climate conditions reveals different responses of shrubland species to climatic controls through either warming-induced effects or moisture-induced effects. We also compared the response of fractional forest cover to climate controls in these climatic clusters. Our results explain the strengths of climate controls imposed by both temperature and precipitation. These analysis results provide insights into the fundamental relationship between shrubland species and climate controls.",

            "abstract": "Urban forests provide important ecosystem services related to climate, nutrients, runoff and aesthetics. Assessment of variations in urban forest growth is critical to urban management and planning, as well as to identify responses to climate and other environmental changes. We estimated annual relative basal area increment by tree rings from 37 plots in Madison, Wisconsin and neighboring municipalities. We related relative basal area growth to variables of vegetation traits derived from remote sensing, including structure (aboveground biomass, diameter, height, basal area, crown width and crown length) from discrete-return airborne lidar, and biochemical variables (foliar nitrogen, carbon, lignin, cellulose, fiber and LMA), spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, PRI, NDII etc.) and species composition from AVIRIS hyperspectral imagery. Variations in tree growth was mainly correlated with tree species composition (R2 = 0.29, RMSE = 0.004) with coniferous stands having a faster growth rate than broadleaf plots. Inclusion of stand basal area improved model prediction from R2 = 0.29 to 0.35, with RMSE = 0.003. Then, we assessed the growth by functional type, we found that foliar lignin concentration and the proportion of live coniferous trees explained 57% variance in the growth of conifer stands. In contrast, broadleaf forest growth was more strongly correlated with species composition and foliar carbon (R2 = 0.59, RMSE = 0.003). Finally, we compared the relative basal area growth by species. In our study area, red pine and white pine exhibited higher growth rates than other species, while white oak plots grew slowest. There is a significant negative relationship between tree height and the relative growth in red pine stands (r = -0.95), as well as a strong negative relationship between crown width and the relative growth in white pine stands (r = -0.87). Growth declines as trees grow taller and wider may partly be the result of reduced photosynthesis and water availability. We also found that canopy cellulose content was negatively correlated with growth in white oak (r = -0.59), which could be caused by trade off of carbon allocation from shoot storage to leaves. These results demonstrate the potential of lidar and hyperspectral imagery to characterize important traits associated with biomass accumulation in urban forests.",

            "abstract": "Alfven wings are known to arise from the interaction of a conducting or mass-loading object with a flowing magnetized plasma. In such an interaction, the plasma and the magnetic flux are slowed down and diverted around the interacting object. The Alfvenic wing current system facilitates the exchange of momentum between the object and the flowing plasma. The strength of interaction is governed by the effective conductivity of the object as well as the Alfven conductance of the magnetized plasma.\nAlfven wings are not expected to be generated when an inert object such as Rhea interacts with the corotating plasma of Saturn's magnetosphere. In such an interaction, the plasma impacting the moon is expected to be absorbed by the moon whereas the magnetic flux passes unimpeded through the moon. However, in two close polar passes of Rhea called R2 and R3, Cassini clearly observed magnetic field signatures consistent with Alfven wings. In addition, observations from a high inclination flyby (CA > 100 RH) of Rhea on June 3, 2010 showed that the Alfven wing continues to propagate away from Rhea even at this large distance.\nWe have performed 3-dimension hybrid simulations of Rhea to understand the interaction of Rhea with Saturn's magnetosphere. We show that in the wake region of Rhea, the plasma pressure is much lower than the background and a pressure gradient is generated that is directed in the direction of corotating plasma. The resulting pressure gradient force directs plasma from downstream region towards Rhea in order to refill the wake. This back-filling slows down the plasma in the wake. As the plasma is close to corotational speed outside of the plasma wake, an Alfven wing is generated that bends the magnetic flux tubes and transports momentum directed in the flow direction from regions above and below the wake into the wake. We will illustrate the global current circuit that facilitates this transfer of momentum.",

            "abstract": "Boundary forces generated by debris flows can be powerful enough to erode bedrock and cause considerable damage to infrastructure during runout. Bedrock wear can be separated into impact and sliding wear processes. Here we focus on sliding wear. We have conducted experiments with a 40-cm-diameter grainflow-generating rotating drum designed to simulate dry channelized debris flows. To generate sliding erosion, we placed a 20-cm-diameter bedrock plate axially on the back wall of the drum. The rotating drum was half filled with 2.3-mm-diameter grains, which formed a thin grain-avalanching layer with peak flow speed and depth close to the drum axis. The whole experimental apparatus was placed on a 100g-ton geotechnical centrifuge and, in order to scale up the stress level, spun to a range of effective gravity levels. Rates and patterns of erosion of the bedrock plate were mapped after each experiment using 3d micro-photogrammetry. High-speed video and particle tracking were employed to measure granular flow dynamics. The resulting data for granular velocities and flow geometry were used to estimate impulse exchanges and forces on the bedrock plate. To address some of the complexities of granular flow under variable gravity levels, we developed a continuum model framed around a GDR MiDi rheology. This model allowed us to scale up boundary forcing while maintaining the same granular flow regime, and helped us to understand important aspects of the flow dynamics including e.g. fluxes of momentum and kinetic energy. In order to understand the detailed processes of boundary forcing, we performed numerical simulations with a new contact dynamics model. This model confirmed key aspects of our continuum model and provided information on second-order behavior such as fluctuations in the forces acting on the wall. By combining these measurements and theoretical analyses, we have developed and calibrated a constitutive model for sliding wear that is a threshold function of granular velocity and stress.",

The drainage basins in this region of Hudson Bay coincide roughly with the present-day tree line location and are within the forest-tundra transition zone. CAT- Scan and multi-sensor core logger data revealed relatively uniform sediments throughout the core. 14C-based geochronology indicates that the combined record extends to ~3200 cal BP and that accumulation rates were relatively constant (0.1-0.2 cm/y). Organic carbon, inorganic carbon and nitrogen contents display down-core variability consistent with changes in organic matter inputs but overall relatively stable depositional conditions over the last 3,000 years. Compositionally, we measured steady increases in the carbon:nitrogen ratios and lignin phenol content of sedimentary organic matter from 3200 cal BP to present consistent with enhanced inputs of vascular plant-derived organic matter. Lignin compositions (i.e. S/V and C/V phenol ratios) throughout the core are consistent with contributions from a mixture of conifer and angiosperm non-woody plant sources. Steady decreases in both S/V and C/V phenol ratios since 3200 cal BP to the present indicate enhanced contributions from conifer-dominated vegetation and are consistent with a steady expansion of boreal forests (white and black spruce) over shrub -dominated tundra (dwaf birch, willows, sedges) in this southern Arctic region over the late Holocene. No clear trends in the ratio of combustion products over lignin products are evident, suggesting a low fire frequency in the area during the covered time span of the record.",

            "abstract": "Tens of millions of detectable meteors ablate in the Earth's upper atmosphere each second, creating turbulent plasma trails that persist for up to minutes as they dissipate into the background ionosphere. These trails produce easily detected radar signals with a wealth of information. This talk will present a detailed analysis of two aspects of meteor physics: (1) the early evolution of meteors as they first ionize and create radar reflections called head echoes, and (2) the later evolution as meteor plasmas develop turbulence and create radar signals called non-specular or range spread meteor trail echoes.\nHead echoes form when sublimated material from a meteoroid initially collides with atmospheric molecules and ionize. Kinetic theory shows that this plasma develops over a length-scale close to the ion mean-free-path but with a highly non-Maxwellian velocity distribution. We have developed an analytical model that improves the quantitative interpretation of head echo radar measurements and ionization efficiency (called the Beta parameter). This will help us calculate meteoroid and atmosphere parameters from radar head-echo observations.\nNon-specular meteor trail echoes develop when meteor plasmas become turbulent allowing the reflection of radar signals. We will analyze this system using 3D simulations of a dense column of meteor plasma embedded in a background ionosphere/thermosphere. While the meteor diffuses across the Earth's geomagnetic field B0, large electric fields develop because of the interplay between highly mobile but magnetized electrons and the heavier but collisionally demagnetized ions. These fields point mostly perpendicular to B0 and change slowly in the direction of B0. These simulations show that the electric field causes a substantial restructuring of the ionospheric plasma outside the trail but connected to it via B0. They also demonstrate the diffusive expansion of the trail and the development of waves both within and outside the trail. These massively parallel particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations reveal the nature of the highly anisotropic diffusion of meteors with some interesting surprises.",

The anomalous EAWM and ASM enhance surface westerlies over the western tropical Pacific Ocean (WTP). It is proposed that the enhanced surface westerlies over the WTP prior to El Niño onset are generally associated with the concurrent anomalous EAWM and ASM. A simple analytical atmospheric model is constructed to test the hypothesis that the emergence of enhanced surface westerlies over the WTP can be linked to concurrent EAWM and ASM anomalies. Model results indicate that when anomalous northerlies from the EAWM converge with anomalous southerlies from the ASM, westerly anomalies over the WTP are enhanced. This result provides a possible explanation of the co-impact of the EAWM and the ASM on the onset of El Niño through enhancing the surface westerly over the WTP.",

Here we present a methodology that includes procedures for creating and evaluating multiple classifications. The approach uses a k-means clustering algorithm to classify soil textures across the USDA soil texture triangle. These classifications are based on hydrologic responses to the hydrologic processes of infiltration, drainage, and evapotranspiration. Two similarity indices are introduced to quantify differences among cluster-based classifications, including the USDA soil texture classification as well as each classification. To improve our understanding of the new similarity indices, the methods were tested against commonly used indices which are based on distance (Rand, Jaccard, VI) or membership (Hubert’s, Normalized Γ) to compare clusters. Using quantitative measures to compare classifications results in a quick and scalable way to find observations that cluster in similar ways. We propose that this could be a novel approach to identifying measurements that could be characterize hydrologic processes of interest. Intriguingly, some classifications are dissimilar to the USDA soil texture classes. The results are able to capture common but unique hydrologic responses shared by different soil textures that cross multiple USDA soil texture classes. By clustering on a single variable, the resulting clusters have a physical meaning and represent soils that share specific and similar hydrologic responses and behaviors. This provides greater insight into the importance of soil texture heterogeneity and determining relevant soil texture values.",

            "abstract": "Drought has become an increasingly severe threat to water and food security recently. This study presents a novel method to calculate the return period of drought, considering drought as event characterized by expected drought inter-arrival time, duration, severity and peak intensity. Recently, Copula distribution, a multivariable probability distribution, is used to deal with strongly correlated variables in analyzing complex hydrologic phenomenon. This study assesses drought conditions in Northern India, including 8 sites, in the past century using Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) from two latest datasets, Dai (2011, 2013) and Sheffield et al. (2012), which concluded conflicting results about global average drought trend. Our results include the change of the severity, intensity and duration of drought events during the past century and the impact of the drought condition on crop yields in the region. It is found that drought variables are highly correlated, thus copulas joint distribution enables the estimation of multi-variate return period. Based on Dai’s dataset from 1900 to 2012, for a fixed drought return period the severity and duration is lower for the period before1955 in sites close to the Indus basin (site 1) or off the coast of the Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal) (site 8), while they are higher for the period after 1955 in other inland sites (sites 3-7), (e.g., severity in Fig.1). Projections based on two models (IPCC AR4 and AR5) in Dai (2011, 2013) suggested less severity and shorter duration in longer-year drought (e.g., 100-year drought), but larger in shorter-year drought (e.g., 2-year drought). Drought could bring nonlinear responses and unexpected losses in agriculture system, thus prediction and management are essential. Therefore, in the years with extreme drought conditions, impact assessment of drought on crop yield of corn, barley, wheat and sorghum will be also conducted through correlating crop yields with drought conditions during corresponding growing seasons.\nA.

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas and the primary stratospheric ozone depleting substance. Agriculture is the main source of N2O emissions as a result of high nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses bottom-up emission factors (EFs) to estimate annual emissions from direct and indirect sources. Top-down N2O emission estimates based on independent tall tower observations indicate that bottom-up approaches severely underestimate the annual budget at the regional scale. It is well established that indirect N2O emissions from streams are poorly characterized due to a scarcity of observations, poorly constrained piston velocity relationships, and high variability among surface water types. Indirect emissions from streams represent a large source of uncertainty in the global N2O budget. Here we examine the extent to which indirect emissions from streams contribute to the regional budget and propose a strategy for scaling up indirect emissions based on stream order relations. Two years of floating chamber-based flux measurements showed that N2O emissions from headwater streams (drainage ditches) in an agricultural landscape often exceeded 45 nmol N2O m-2 s-1 and decreased exponentially as a function of stream order. This scaling function was used to estimate indirect emissions for the region and indicated that the IPCC EF5r significantly underestimated the observed emissions within a representative watershed of the US Corn Belt in the Midwestern United States. Headwater streams and rivers contributed ~75% and <1% respectively to the watershed indirect N2O budget, highlighting the need to better constrain low order stream system emissions. Furthermore, instantaneous fluxes from high order streams were well constrained and significantly smaller than low order streams. Consequently, a single EF for all streams and rivers does not appear to be appropriate. Our findings suggest that bottom-up models likely underestimate N2O emissions in the US Corn Belt in part because low order stream emissions are underestimated.",

            "abstract": "Mapping forest structure and aboveground biomass globally is a major challenge that the remote sensing community has been facing for decades. Radar backscatter is sensitive to biomass only up to a certain amount (about 150 tons/ha at L-band and 300 tons/ha at P-band), whereas lidar remote sensing is strongly limited by poor spatial coverage. In recent years radar interferometry, including its extension to polarimetric radar interferometry (PolInSAR), has emerged as a new technique to overcome the limitations of radar backscatter. The idea of PolInSAR is to use jointly interferometric and polarimetric radar techniques to separate different scattering mechanisms and retrieve the vertical structure of forests. The advantage is to map ecosystem structure continuously over large areas and independently of cloud coverage. Experiments have shown that forest height - an important proxy for biomass – can be estimated using PolInSAR with accuracy between 15% and 20% at plot level.\nAt AGU we will review the state-of-art of repeat-pass PolInSAR for biomass mapping, including its potential and limitations, and discuss how merging lidar data with PolInSAR data can be beneficial not only for product cross-validation but also for achieving better estimation of ecosystem properties over large areas. In particular, lidar data are expected to aid the inversion of PolInSAR models by providing (1) better identification of ground under the canopy, (2) approximate information of canopy structure in limited areas, and (3) maximum tree height useful for mapping PolInSAR temporal decorrelation. We will show our tree height and biomass maps using PolInSAR L-band JPL/UAVSAR data collected in tropical and temperate forests, and P-band ONERA/TROPISAR data acquired in French Guiana. LVIS lidar data will be used, as well as SRTM data, field measurements and inventory data to support our study. The use of two different radar frequencies and repeat-pass JPL UAVSAR data will offer also the opportunity to compare our results with the new airborne P-band ECOSAR and L-band DBSAR instruments developed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.",

            "abstract": "Harmonic analysis of terrestrial gravimetry supports the computation of Earth Gravitational Models [EGMs]. Historically, incorporating terrestrial data into an EGM can be achieved by first gridding the data to form equi-angular gravity anomaly area-means. Each computed mean value typically estimates the average of the anomaly across the surface of an equiangular prism in a Digital Elevation Model [DEM]. Appropriate solid-harmonic analysis can then be applied to the gridded values. This yields a harmonic model which should ‘best’ reproduce these mean values via solid-harmonic synthesis across the surface of each DEM prism. Such nominally ‘terrestrial’ harmonic models can then be combined with satellite gravity information to yield a combination EGM.\nImportantly, these terrestrial harmonic models also provide a useful tool for assessing the terrestrial gravimetry which supported them. Low degree (Nmax=200/250) discrepancies between the terrestrial models and their GRACE/GOCE ‘satgrav’ counterparts are already highlighting problem areas in U.S. gravimetry data holdings. However, also interesting are the residuals (mis-closes) between the derived harmonic models and their input anomaly data grids. This is because these equi-angular data grids can be usefully conceived as digital planimetric leveling traverses. They combine mean gravity estimates with mean changes in elevation, thereby necessarily yielding implied estimates for mean changes in geopotential from one DEM prism surface to the next. We consider a hypothetical closed ‘leveling’ loop, in which mean geopotential changes are digitally integrated around a circuit of data prims. If this gridded data correctly represents a conservative field, then the integrated geopotential differences should sum to zero, within the resolution of the data grid. However, for large data errors which deviate significantly from a conservative field, the digitally integrated geopotential will not close to zero. Here the purely harmonic model cannot reproduce the non-conservative data grid, and we will observe a large residual between the two. This provides for the possibility of detecting errors in the data grid, and in the supporting terrestrial gravimetry.\nHere we present initial results from this approach, and look to future applications.",

I describe the activities of the Real-time Earthquake Analysis for Disaster Mitigation (READI) working group. The group leverages 600+ real-time GPS stations in western North America operated by UNAVCO (PBO network), Central Washington University (PANGA), US Geological Survey & Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SCIGN project), UC Berkeley & US Geological Survey (BARD network), and the Pacific Geosciences Centre (WCDA project). Our goal is to demonstrate an earthquake and tsunami early warning system for western North America. Rapid response is particularly important for those coastal communities that are in the near-source region of large earthquakes and may have only minutes of warning time, and who today are not adequately covered by existing seismic and basin-wide ocean-buoy monitoring systems. The READI working group is performing comparisons of independent real time analyses of 1 Hz GPS data for station displacements and is participating in government-sponsored earthquake and tsunami exercises in the Western U.S. I describe a prototype seismogeodetic system using a cluster of southern California stations that includes GNSS tracking and collocation with MEMS accelerometers for real-time estimation of seismic velocity and displacement waveforms, which has advantages for improved earthquake early warning and tsunami forecasts compared to seismic-only or GPS-only methods. The READI working group’s ultimate goal is to participate in an Indo-Pacific Tsunami early warning system that utilizes GNSS real-time displacements and ionospheric measurements along with seismic, near-shore buoys and ocean-bottom pressure sensors, where available, to rapidly estimate magnitude and finite fault slip models for large earthquakes, and then forecast tsunami source, energy scale, geographic extent, inundation and runup. This will require cooperation with other real-time efforts around the Pacific Rim in terms of sharing, analysis centers, and advisory bulletins to the responsible government agencies. The IAG's Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS), in particular its natural hazards theme, provides a natural umbrella for achieving this objective.",

            "abstract": "While the dynamics of groundwater evaporation are well known, it is still challenging to reconstruct the water patterns in areas where water is not available anymore. We selected a specific location in White Sands National Monument (WSNM), New Mexico, to validate a method to extract information from hydrated minerals regarding past groundwater evaporation patterns in evaporitic basins. WSNM has gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) dunes and crystals precipitated from the evaporation of an ancient lake. Our approach aims to extract the water of crystallization of gypsum and measure its oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions, in order to reconstruct the groundwater history of the area. The idea is that as the mother brine evaporates its isotopic composition changes continuously, recorded as water of crystallization in successive growth zones of gypsum. To check if the isotopic composition of the salt could effectively differentiate between distinctive humidity conditions, the methodology was tested first on synthetic gypsum grown under controlled humidity and temperature conditions. T and RH% were maintained constant in a glove box and precipitated gypsum was harvested every 24 hours. d2H and d18O of water of crystallization from the synthetic gypsum was extracted using a specially developed technique on a TC/EA. The brine was measured using a Gas Bench II for d18O and an H-Device for d2H on a Thermo Finnigan MAT 253 mass spectrometer. With the method tested, we measured natural gypsum. In order to identify the growth zones we mapped the surface of the crystals using an experimental space flight XRF instrument. Crystals were then sampled for isotopic analyses. Preliminary results suggest that site-specific groundwater changes can be described by the isotopic variations. We will show that the methodology is a reliable and fast method to quantify hydrological changes in a targeted environment. The study is currently ongoing but the full dataset will be presented at the conference.",

Recently a new Goddard one-moment bulk microphysics with four-ice classes (cloud ice, snow, graupel, and frozen drops/hail) has been developed based on cloud-resolving model simulations with large-scale forcings from field campaign observations. The new scheme has been successfully implemented to the MMF and two MMF experiments were carried out with this new scheme and the old three-ice classes (cloud ice, snow graupel) scheme. The MMF has global coverage and can rigorously evaluate microphysics performance for different cloud regimes. The results show MMF with the new scheme outperformed the old one. The MMF simulations are also strongly affected by the interaction between large-scale and cloud-scale processes. Two MMF sensitivity experiments with and without nudging large-scale forcings to those of ERA-Interim reanalysis were carried out to study the impacts of large-scale forcings. The model simulated mean and variability of surface precipitation, cloud types, cloud properties such as cloud amount, hydrometeors vertical profiles, and cloud water contents, etc. in different geographic locations and climate regimes are evaluated against GPM, TRMM, CloudSat/CALIPSO satellite observations. The Goddard MMF has also been coupled with the Goddard Satellite Data Simulation Unit (G-SDSU), a system with multi-satellite, multi-sensor, and multi-spectrum satellite simulators. The statistics of MMF simulated radiances and backscattering can be directly compared with satellite observations to assess the strengths and/or deficiencies of MMF simulations and provide guidance on how to improve the MMF and microphysics.",

            "abstract": "Natural waters that are isolated from the atmosphere in confined aquifers, euxinic basins and sediment pore waters often become sulfidic. These waters are conventionally described simply as reducing environments. But because nature does not constrain their exposure to reducing equivalents (e.g. from organic matter) and oxidizing equivalents (e.g. from Fe,Mn oxides), these reducing environments in fact vary cryptically in their redox characteristics. The implications for trace metal and metalloid cycles are only beginning to be explored. The activity of zero-valent sulfur (aS0), a virtual thermodynamic property, is a potentially useful index for describing this variation. At a particular temperature and ionic strength, aS0 can be quantified from knowledge of pH and the total S(0) to total S(-II) ratio. Although data are incomplete, the deep waters of the Black Sea (aS0 ca. 0.3) appear to be more reducing than the deep waters of the Cariaco Basin (aS0 ca. 0.5) even though both are perennially sulfidic. An apparent manifestation is a greater preponderance of greigite relative to mackinawite in the Cariaco Basin. Interestingly, greigite is stable relative to mackinawite in both basins but predominates only at the higher aS0. Values of aS0 in sulfidic natural waters span the range over which Hg-polysulfide complexes gain predominance over Hg sulfide complexes. Competition between these ligands is thought to influence biological methylation, mercury’s route into aquatic and human food chains. In sulfidic deep ground waters, the redox state and consequent mobility of As, a global human hazard, will depend on aS0. At intermediate sulfide concentrations, higher aS0 favors more highly charged and thus less mobile As(V) species relative to As(III) species despite the overall reducing characteristics of such waters.\nHelz, G.R.

            "abstract": "A recent study has argued that the California Undercurrent, and poleward eastern boundary currents in general, generate mixing events through centrifugal instability (CI). Conditions favorable for CI are created by the strong horizontal shears developed in turbulent bottom layers of currents flowing in the direction of topographic waves. At points of abrupt topographic change, like promontories and capes, the coastal current separates from the boundary and injects gravitationally stable but dynamically unstable flow into the interior. The resulting finite amplitude development of the instability involves overturnings and diabatic mixing. The purpose of this study is to examine the energetics of CI in order to characterize it as has been done for other instabilities and develop a framework in which to estimate its regional and global impacts. We argue that CI is roughly twice as efficient at mixing as is Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and that roughly 10% of the initial energy in a CUC-like current is lost to either local mixing or the generation of unbalanced flows. The latter probably leads to non-local mixing. Thus centrifugal instability is an effective process by which energy is lost from the balanced flow and spent in mixing neighboring water masses. We argue the importance of the mixing is regional in nature, but of less importance to the global budgets given its regional specificity.",

            "abstract": "The mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet has been reduced over recent decades as a consequence of warming, the impact of which is already detectable on global sea level. However, temperature projections suggest that at interior high-altitude sites on the ice it could be decades or more before warming forces these regions to transition from a dry to wet snow facies. Shifts in boundary layer dynamics, including atmosphere-ice sheet hydrological exchange and cloud radiative forcing could expedite or delay this transition. These processes are important with respect to future ice sheet stability, yet they remain difficult to constrain. Using continuous in situ measurements of vertical profiles of the isotopic composition of water vapor at Summit Camp, the highest observatory on the ice sheet, we document the presence of a hydrologic balance between surface sublimation and condensation fluxes. This exists because of a nearly persistent temperature inversion, which hinders the efficiency with which surface water vapor mixes into the free atmosphere. In the presence of a strong temperature inversion, fog and ice particles form near the ice-atmosphere interface from surface moisture fluxes. When this condensate precipitates on or settles to the surface, it ballasts the ice sheet’s mass. A decade-long trend towards lower annual accumulation at Summit may therefore reflect continuous replacement of the near surface atmosphere due to reduced atmospheric stability. If this tendency toward destabilization continues, it could accelerate mass loss at interior sites on the ice sheet. The role of boundary layer stability in ice sheet hydrological budgets discussed here is applicable beyond the accumulation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate concretions often occur within fine-grained, organic-rich sedimentary rocks. This association reflects the common production of diagenetic minerals through biologic cycling of organic matter. Chemical analysis of carbonate concretions provides the rare opportunity to explore ancient shallow diagenetic environments, which are inherently transient due to progressive burial but are an integral component of the marine carbon cycle. The late Cretaceous Holz Shale (~80 Ma) contains abundant calcite concretions that exhibit textural and geochemical characteristics indicative of relatively shallow formation (i.e., near the sediment-water interface). Sampled concretions contain between 5.4 and 9.8 wt.% total inorganic carbon (TIC), or ~45 and 82 wt.% CaCO3, compared to host shale values which average ~1.5 wt.% TIC. Organic carbon isotope compositions (δ13Corg) are relatively constant in host and concretion samples ranging from ­–26.3 to –24.0‰ (VPDB). Carbonate carbon isotope compositions (δ13Ccarb) range from –22.5 to –3.4‰, indicating a significant but not entirely organic source of carbon. Concretions of the lower Holz Shale exhibit considerably elevated δ13Ccarb values averaging –4.8‰, whereas upper Holz Shale concretions express an average δ13Ccarb value of –17.0‰. If the remaining carbonate for lower Holz Shale concretions is sourced from marine fluids and/or dissolved marine carbonate minerals (e.g., shells), a simple mass balance indicates that ~28% of concretion carbon was sourced from organic matter and ~72% from late Cretaceous marine inorganic carbon (with δ13C ~ +2.5‰). Upper Holz Shale calculations indicate a ~73% contribution from organic matter and a ~27% contribution from inorganic carbon. When normalized for carbonate, organic contents within the concretions are ~2-13 wt.% enriched compared to host contents. This potentially reflects the protective nature of cementation that acts to limit permeability and chemical destruction of organic material. These data imply that concretion growth in shallow sediments can act as a significant and long-term sink for both marine inorganic and organic carbon.",

            "abstract": "The southern hemisphere westerlies force and respond to circulation and heat exchange with the Southern Ocean, which in turn plays a large role in global climate change. Southern Patagonia is the only significant land mass in the path of the southern westerlies, so it is an ideal location to examine variability of this wind system and its relation to regional and global climate. Precipitation and wind strength exhibit a strong positive correlation, and we take advantage of this relationship to use a paleoclimate archive to probe past changes in the wind field. We examined a 3.6m long sediment core from Lago Sarmiento (51.06˚S, 72.91˚W) in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile, for indicators of past environmental change. Here we present a high resolution, multi-proxy record of regional paleoclimate that includes physical, biological, and chemical data sets. We measured magnetic susceptibility, weight percent organic carbon and nitrogen, δ13C of bulk sediment, and weight percent carbonate of the core. These results provide information about precipitation, relative wind strength, volcanic activity, and biological productivity in and around Lago Sarmiento over the past 4,000 years. Our age model for the core is based in part on tephrochronology. We identified three tephras, or volcanic ashes, in the core at 68-71, 110-112, and 284-286cm that are supported visually and with magnetic susceptibility measurements. Analysis of the C:N ratio of the Lago Sarmiento core demonstrates a long-term increase in the deposition of terrestrial organic matter in Lago Sarmiento over time, perhaps indicating a change from grassland to woodland due to increased precipitation. The largest excursions in the C:N ratio occur at 20, 53, 139-140, 225-226, and 252cm. The average δ13C of organic carbon is -24.81‰, and large decreases occur at 9, 45, 180, 245-246, and 252-253cm, which could indicate overturning events in the lake. The average weight percent carbonate is 18%, with large decreases at 69-70, 98-111, 284-285, and 334-337cm, which we interpret as decreases in lake productivity. These results encompass new knowledge about the paleoclimate patterns in and around Lago Sarmiento and have significant implications for climate change, human health, and environmental policy.",

            "abstract": "Human actions have doubled the amount of nitrogen in the terrestrial biosphere. Although nitrogen application in the form of fertilizers increases food production, excess nitrogen can be harmful to the environment and to human well-being. Excess nitrogen in streams is transported into downstream water bodies, which leads to increased eutrophication and associated problems such as harmful algal blooms and/or hypoxic conditions.\nThe amount of nitrogen exported to streams depends on several factors, including nitrogen input to the watershed, land use, and precipitation. Previous studies have developed models for predicting nitrate load using stream discharge, in order to estimate the contribution of various factors to total nitrogen load, to identify strategies for reducing nitrogen load, and to assess future changes in nitrogen load resulting from anticipated changes in precipitation patterns. Applying these models to estimate future nitrogen loads thus requires running a rainfall-runoff model driven by climate model predictions before nitrogen loading can, in turn, be estimated, thereby compounding uncertainties.\nIn this study, we present a statistical modeling approach that circumvents this two-step process by estimating nitrogen loading directly from precipitation predictions that can be obtained from climate model outputs. The proposed model uses net anthropogenic nitrogen input (NANI), land use type, and precipitation as input parameters.\nPreliminary results show that the model explains greater than 65% of the variance in the observed annual log transformed nitrogen loads across various catchments throughout the United States. The model is applied to the watersheds comprising the Mississippi river basin to identify the spatial distribution of the sources of nitrogen loading and the inter-annual variation in nitrogen loads under current conditions. Additionally, the model is used to examine changes in magnitude and spatial patterns of nitrogen loading for precipitation patterns under future climate conditions as represented by the CMIP5 ensemble simulations.",

            "abstract": "Answering the question of what controls the fate and stabilization of organic carbon in forest soils is central to understanding the role of western US ecosystems in mitigating climate change, optimizing forest management, and quantifying local and regional terrestrial carbon budgets. Over half of forest soil C is stored belowground, stabilized by a number of separate, but interacting physical, chemical and biological mechanisms. Here we synthesize data from a series of field and laboratory studies focused on identifying mineral, physical, and landscape position controls on belowground C stabilization mechanisms in western U.S. conifer ecosystems. Results from these studies demonstrate an important for role for short-range-order Fe- and Al-oxyhydroxides and Al-humus complexes in C stabilization, and that the soil mineral assemblage moderates C cycling via control on partitioning of C into physical fractions (“free”, “occluded”, “mineral”) with varying MRT and chemistry. Measures of occluded fraction chemical composition by 13C-NMR indicate this fraction is 2-5 times more enriched in pyrogenic C than the bulk soil and that this fraction is on the order of ~25 to 65% charred materials. Radiocarbon analyses of a large set of conifer soil samples from California and Arizona further indicate the occluded fraction is generally older than either the free light or mineral fraction. In particular, soil C in convergent, water and sediment gathering portions of the landscape are enriched in long MRT charred materials. These results indicate an important role for the interaction of soil mineral assemblage, wildfire, and erosion in controlling belowground C storage and stabilization in western conifer forests. Drought and wildfire are expected to increase with climate change and thus may exert significant control on belowground C storage directly through biochemical and physical changes in aboveground biomass, production of charred materials, and indirectly via post-fire physical erosion and redistribution of C-rich sediment across the landscape.",

            "abstract": "We report a recent study comparing electron and ion energization and transport mechanisms in the magnetotail during substorms. The simulation scheme combines global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling of the magnetosphere driven by realistic upstream solar wind conditions, with large-scale kinetics (LSK) simulations in which we calculate the trajectories of millions of test particles in the electric and magnetic fields from the MHD simulation. In particular, during a modest substorm event that occurred on February 7, 2009, we found multiple earthward propagating dipolarizations driven by reconnection outflow jets in the MHD simulation results. Ion trajectories in the ion LSK simulation show that ions that originating near the reconnection site first gained energy non-adiabatically, and then gained energy adiabatically as they “caught up with and then rode on” the earthward propagating dipolarizations. Consequently, the integrated high-energy (>25 keV) ion fluxes were enhanced where and when the dipolarizations intensified. High-speed flows in narrow channels controlled the earthward ion transport in the magnetotail due to the dominance of E×B drift. The mechanisms of non-local energization by dipolarizations and transport controlled by high-speed flows operate similarly for electrons as reported in studies of other events by Ashour-Abdalla et al. [2011] and Pan et al. [2014]. We perform an electron LSK simulation for the same February 7, 2009 event to examine these similarities.",

            "abstract": "Strike-slip faults along mid-ocean ridge spreading centers are generally thought to be restricted to transform boundaries connecting rift segments. Faults that are parallel to spreading centers are generally assumed to be normal faults associated with tectonic extension. However, clear evidence of north-south (rift-parallel), strike-slip displacements occur widely around the southern portion of Eyjafjörður, northern Iceland about 50 km west of the Northern Rift Zone. The area is south of the southernmost strand (Dalvík Lineament) of the NW-SE-trending, dextral-slip, Tjӧrnes Fracture Zone (where N-S, sinistral, strike-slip “bookshelf” faulting occurs). Faults in the Eyjafjörður area cut 8.5-10 m.y. basaltic crust and are parallel to spreading-related dikes and are commonly concentrated along dike margins. Fault rocks range from fault breccia to gouge. Riedel shears and other kinematic indicators provide unambiguous evidence of shear sense. Most faults show evidence of sinistral, strike-slip movement but smaller proportions of normal and oblique-slip faults also are present. Cross cutting relations among the different types of faults are inconsistent and appear to be related to a single deformation event. Fault slip-line kinematic analysis yields solutions indicating sinistral-normal oblique-slip overall. These results may be interpreted in terms of either previously unrecognized transform-fault bookshelf faulting or slip accommodating block rotation associated with northward propagation of the Northern Rift Zone.",

            "abstract": "Land management is a key driver of land change in many parts of the world. Activities such as livestock farming and timber production can have a dramatic impact on the environment and are often guided by local policies and practices. Evaluation of these impacts is particularly important in a country like New Zealand, where since 1991 political boundaries have largely coincided with environmental boundaries (catchments). In this study we look at the entire country of New Zealand and identify disturbance trends at high spatial and temporal resolution using widely available remote sensing data, with the goal of analyzing the effect of land management practices on local ecosystems.\nExisting remote sensing capabilities require a compromise between spatial and temporal resolution. Free access to the entire Landsat archive provides a valuable resource for analyzing land cover and land use change at a very useful 30m spatial resolution; however, the 16-day temporal cycle, which is often lengthened considerably by cloud cover, limits the observation of short term changes that can result from disturbance events. The revisit cycle of the MODIS sensors aboard Terra and Aqua provides a surface reflectance dataset at much higher temporal resolution, yet at 500m spatial resolution, they lack the detail necessary to accurately track small changes in the landscape. A combination of the two products offers the ideal tool for disturbance analysis.\nDisturbance detection methods in forested areas are well established, but here we present an alternative method for detecting disturbance in grassland areas. Utilizing both Landsat TM/ETM surface reflectance data and MODIS Nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) covering the entire country of New Zealand (26 Landsat path/rows) for the period 2000–2012, we calculate disturbance indices in both forests and grasslands for both datasets based on normalized values of the Tasseled Cap transformation and then validate and analyze the disturbance time series. We investigate the time series to assess both the subtle changes in the landscape caused by livestock grazing and the dramatic changes brought about by plantation forestry.",

            "abstract": "Blind Source Separation (BSS) is a widely used technique in many branches of data processing, but not in CTBT related applications so far. BSS methods are attractive for they use minimal a priori information about the signals they are dealing with. Homomorphic deconvolution and cepstral smoothing are probably the only methods not widely used in CTBT that can be attributed to given technique. However Expert Technical Analysis (ETA) in CTBTO may face the problems which cannot be resolved with only certified CTBTO applications and may demand specific techniques not presently used in a practice. The case which has to be considered within the ETA framework is the unambiguous separation of signals with close arrival times. There are two scenarios of interest: (1) separation of two almost co-located explosions conducted within fractions of seconds, and (2) extraction of explosion signals merged with wavetrains from strong earthquake. The importance of resolving the problem related to case 1 is obvious since it’s connected with the correct explosion yield estimation. Case 2 is a well-known scenario of conducting clandestine nuclear tests. These cases can hardly be resolved with the conventional methods implemented at the International Data Centre, especially if the signals have close slowness and azimuth. The approach we use here is applying one of the blind source separation methods - Independent Component Analysis, implying non-Gaussianity of the signal’s mixture underlying processes. We have tested the technique with synthetic data and Monte-Carlo modelling, and with the data from three DPRK tests and mining explosions conducted in Central Russia. The data was recorded by the International Monitoring System of CTBTO and by small-aperture seismic array Mikhnevo (MHVAR) operated by the Institute of Dynamics of Geospheres, Russian Academy of Science. The approach demonstrated good ability of separating sources conducted practically simultaneously and/or having close arrival times and recovering their waveforms from the mixture. Perspectives and limitations of the method are discussed.",

            "abstract": "There has been a long tradition of estimating the amount of climate change that would result from various carbon dioxide emission or concentration scenarios but there has been relatively little quantitative analysis of how long it takes to feel the consequences of an individual carbon dioxide emission. Using conjoined results of recent carbon-cycle and physical-climate model intercomparison projects, we find the median time between an emission and maximum warming is 10.1 years, with a 90% probability range of 6.6 to 30.7 years.\nWe evaluate uncertainties in timing and amount of warming, partitioning them into three contributing factors: carbon cycle, climate sensitivity and ocean thermal inertia. To characterize the carbon cycle uncertainty associated with the global temperature response to a carbon dioxide emission today, we use fits to the time series of carbon dioxide concentrations from a CO2-impulse response function model intercomparison project’s 15 ensemble members (1). To characterize both the uncertainty in climate sensitivity and in the thermal inertia of the climate system, we use fits to the time series of global temperature change from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5; 2) abrupt4xco2 experiment’s 20 ensemble’s members separating the effects of each uncertainty factors using one of two simple physical models for each CMIP5 climate model. This yields 6,000 possible combinations of these three factors using a standard convolution integral approach.\nOur results indicate that benefits of avoided climate damage from avoided CO2 emissions will be manifested within the lifetimes of people who acted to avoid that emission. While the relevant time lags imposed by the climate system are substantially shorter than a human lifetime, they are substantially longer than the typical political election cycle, making the delay and its associated uncertainties both economically and politically significant.\n",

            "abstract": "JMARS (Java Mission-planning and Analysis for Remote Sensing) is a free geospatial application developed by the Mars Space Flight Facility at Arizona State University. Originally written as a mission planning tool for the THEMIS instrument on board the MARS Odyssey Spacecraft, it was released as an analysis tool to the general public in 2003. Since then it has expanded to be used for mission planning and scientific data analysis by additional NASA missions to Mars, the Moon, and Vesta, and it has come to be used by scientists, researchers and students of all ages from more than 40 countries around the world.\nThe public version of JMARS now also includes remote sensing data for Mercury, Venus, Earth, the Moon, Mars, and a number of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Additional datasets for asteroids and other smaller bodies are being added as they becomes available and time permits.\nJMARS fuses data from different instruments in a geographical context. One core strength of JMARS is that it provides access to geospatially registered data via a consistent interface. Such data include global images (graphical and numeric), local mosaics, individual instrument images, spectra, and vector-oriented data. By hosting these products, users are able to avoid searching for, downloading, decoding, and projecting data on their own using a disparate set of tools and procedures. The JMARS team processes, indexes, and reorganizes data to make it quickly and easily accessible in a consistent manner. JMARS leverages many open-source technologies and tools to accomplish these data preparation steps.\nIn addition to visualizing multiple datasets in context with one another, JMARS allows a user to find data products from differing missions that intersect the same geographical location, time range, or observational parameters. Any number of georegistered datasets can then be viewed or analyzed simultaneously with one another. A user can easily create a mosaic of graphic data, plot numeric data, or project any arbitrary scene over surface topography. All of these visualization options can be exported for use in presentations, publications, or for further analysis in other tools.",

            "abstract": "Seismic studies have identified an extensive field (>20,000 km2) of seafloor depressions, or pockmarks, on the southwestern flank of the Chatham Rise, New Zealand. It has been suggested that these pockmarks result from gas hydrate dissociation linked to sea-level changes during glacial-interglacial cycles. Gas hydrates are predominately composed of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas. Surface sediment cores (~ 8 m) were collected from the pockmark field on the Chatham Rise during a research cruise in February 2013 to evaluate the association of the features with CH4 releases. A suite of geochemical parameters are interpreted to determine the methane contribution to solid phase sediment and pore water. The upward flux of CH4 in sediments is often quantified using pore water sulfate (SO42-) profiles, assuming steady-state consumption of SO42- and CH4 by anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM): CH4 + SO42- → HCO3- + HS- + H2O. This reaction is one of the primary controls on CH4 distributions in sediments. This work will present pore water SO42-, sulfide (HS-) and chloride (Cl-) depth profiles in sediment collected from the pockmark field. Theoretical SO42- distributions in the absence of AOM are compared to observed SO42- profiles as a preliminary assessment of the influence of CH4 on sediment geochemistry in and around the seafloor depressions.\nIn addition isotopically-light CH4 is incorporated into sediment carbon pools via AOM and subsequent CO2 fixation. Stable carbon isotope distributions in the organic and inorganic carbon pools are presented to determine the influence of CH4 in sediments in the vicinty of the pockmarks. Collectively, the geochemical data are used to assess the role of gas hydate dissociation in pockmark formation on the Chatham Rise. Despite sesimic data interpretation in this region there is no modern day contribution of CH4 to shallow sediment carbon cycling and data are presented to assess paleogeochemical methane cycling.",

A key limitation in forest AGB estimation from remote sensing, however, is the large uncertainty in forest cover estimates from the coarse-to-medium resolution satellite-derived land cover maps (present resolution is limited to 30-m of the USGS NLCD Program). The uncertainties in forest cover estimates at the Landsat scale result in high uncertainties for AGB estimation, predominantly in heterogeneous forest and urban landscapes. We have successfully developed an approach using a machine learning algorithm and High-Performance-Computing with NAIP air-borne imagery data for mapping tree cover at 1-m over California and Maryland. In a comparison with high resolution LiDAR data available over selected regions in the two states, we found our results to be promising both in terms of accuracy as well as our ability to scale nationally. The generated 1-m forest cover map will be aggregated to the Landsat spatial grid to demonstrate differences in AGB estimates (pixel-level AGB density, total AGB at aggregated scales like ecoregions and counties) when using a native 30-m forest cover map versus a 30-m map derived from a higher resolution dataset. The process will also be complemented with a LiDAR derived AGB estimate at the 30-m scale to aid in true validation. ",

Unfortunately, limited empirical data is available to constrain these model responses, especially from the temperature-sensitive southern GIS region. Here, we re-examine the Dye-3 ice core (southern Greenland) to provide insights as to whether the southern GIS survived the last interglacial period, a warming event that serves as an imperfect analogy to expected future polar warming. We present geochemical analyses of the trapped air from the basal ice of Dye-3 (1991-2035m depth) that characterize and date the ice. We analyzed the elemental and isotopic composition of O2, N2, and Ar (d15N, d38Ar/36Ar, d18O of O2, dAr/N2, dO2/N2, and dO2/Ar), and total air content of the trapped air to determine that this ice, previously dated to an age of 450-800 ka, is indeed glacial ice and not superimposed ice or accreted melt water. Dating of the trapped air was then achieved by measuring the paleoatmospheric d40Ar/38Ar and 17D of O2, which dates the air to 440 ka (±230 ka), with a minimum age of 130 ka. This confirms that the Dye-3 site was ice covered through the last interglacial, providing a significant constraint for climate and glaciological models of the GIS.",

Our current fielded gas sensing sUAS platforms are able to provide instantaneous in situ concentration measurements at locations within line of sight of the operator. Recent results from field experiments demonstrating methane detection and plume characterization will be discussed here, including performance assessment conducted via a controlled release experiment in 2013. The logical extension of sUAS gas concentration measurement is quantification of flux rate. We will discuss the preliminary strategy for quantitative flux determination, including intrinsic challenges and heritage from airborne science campaigns, associated with this point source flux quantification. This system approach forms the basis for intelligent autonomous quantitative characterization of gas plumes, which holds great value for applications in commercial, regulatory, and safety environments.",

            "abstract": "Low volatility organic compounds from the oxidation of isoprene have been observed under a variety of conditions during the FIXCIT atmospheric chamber study at Caltech in January of 2014. Data were obtained using a high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-CIMS) equipped with a nitrate-ion (NO3‑) source. The observed species, detected as clusters with the nitrate ion (m/z 62), range in elemental mass from approximately m/z 120-220 and span an elemental oxygen to elemental carbon ratio (O:C) range of 0.4 to 2.0. Using calibrations for simulant compounds obtained through subsequent laboratory studies, some of these highly oxidized isoprene products were quantified and their loadings and estimated production will be presented here. Ammonium sulfate aerosol seeds were injected into the chamber during several experiments, which enabled further investigation of the contribution of highly oxidized isoprene products to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) growth under a range of experimental conditions representative of the atmosphere where biogenic SOA has been shown to be an important contribution to submicron aerosol. Similar data were also obtained for oxidized species generated by the oxidation of semi-volatile isoprene products including isoprene hydroxyperoxide (ISOPOOH) and methacrolein (MACR) to further investigate mechanisms for isoprene oxidation and SOA formation. Measurements of these species’ uptake to chamber walls and seed aerosol will also be presented.",

The creation of tools is critical to help communities and natural resource managers better understand the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and the potential resulting implications for ecosystem services and conservation efforts. The Department of the Interior is leading an interagency effort to develop the Ecosystems Vulnerability theme as part of the President’s Climate Action Plan. This effort will provide seamless access to relevant datasets that can help address such issues as: risk of wildfires to local communities and federal lands; water sensitivity to climate change; and understanding the role of ecosystems in a changing climate.\nThis session will provide an overview of the proposed Ecosystem Vulnerability Challenge and Prize Competition, outlining the intended audience, scope, goals, and overall timeline. The session will provide an opportunity for participants to offer new ideas. Through the Challenge, access will be made available to critical datasets for software developers, engineers, scientists, students, and researchers to develop and submit applications addressing critical science issues facing our Nation today. Application submission criteria and guidelines will also be discussed. The Challenge will be open to all sectors and organizations (i.e. federal, non-federal, private sector, non-profits, and universities) within the United States. It is anticipated the Challenge will run from early January 2015 until spring of 2015.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols and clouds contribute to atmospheric variability and to Earth’s radiative balance, and while aerosol-cloud interactions have been studied in the past, long-term assessments of their regional interactions are only beginning to be realized. Changes in emissions and air quality policies as well as socioeconomic factors ultimately lead to changes in AOD (aerosol optical depth) with cascading effects on clouds and ultimately on the combined radiative effects where agreement is yet to be seen.\nIn this work, an assessment of any trends observed in the aerosol loading over the western North Atlantic Ocean during the period of 2000 to 2012 is presented. Monthly mean data from NASA’s MODIS instruments onboard both Terra and Aqua satellites are employed. Two aerosol models (GOCART and MERRAero) with the capability to model five individual aerosol species are also used and can separate anthropogenic from natural contributions to the total aerosol load and the aerosol trend. Preliminary results show two distinct regions of opposite trend in the satellite AOD over the western North Atlantic. From analysis of the model trends, the trends in these two regions are also of different origin: the negative AOD trend (ranging from -0.020 to -0.040 per decade) seen just off the eastern coast of the U.S. is of anthropogenic origin while the positive AOD trend (ranging from 0.015 to 0.030 per decade) seen in the south of the domain is of natural origins. Compelling evidence from a ground-based aerosol record (AERONET) as well as EPA emissions records corroborates the anthropogenic origin of the negative trend off the eastern U.S. coast. Finally, any trends seen in the cloud effective radius are explored to examine the presence of the first indirect effect (Twomey effect). The analysis from Aqua appears stronger and more coherent, likely a testament to its calibration stability relative to Terra. Statistical significance tests are performed for the 90% and 95% levels using the Student’s t-test. This research can not only provided information for modeling and validation studies of aerosol trends but also act as an initial study into the long-term impacts of air quality improvement policies on the aerosol field, aerosol-cloud interactions, and the combined complex radiative effects.",

            "abstract": "Seepage of natural gas at the seafloor is a broadly observed phenomenon, associated with hydrate systems and/or with shallow gas accumulations in the sub-surface. Regardless the geological setting, global observations indicate that gas seepage is most often episodic. Seepage episodes may occur with a predictable short-term periodicity (e.g., by seasonal or tidal related pressure and temperature changes) or longer term periodicity (e.g., glacial-interglacial changes). But seepage episodes can be also irregular, modulated for instance, by cracking and faulting. Identifying the processes modulating seepage is fundamental for reconstructing seepage history and for analyzing potential implications of seepage from geological sources on past and present climatic anomalies. We document the overlapping influence of fault reactivation and possibly glacial-interglacial cycles on cracking and seepage evolution within the deep water (1-2 km water depth), > 60 km long, and gas hydrate-charged Vestnesa drift in Fram Strait. The Vestnesa drift consists of a ~125° striking eastern segment with active seepage, and a seemingly inactive ~100° striking western segment. While the eastern segment is vulnerable to deformation at the northward propagating Knipovich oceanic ridge, the westward segment is within the deformation field of the Molloy ridge and the Spitsbergen transform fault zone. High resolution 3D P-Cable seismic data reveal the link between gas chimney distributions and small scale curvilinear, nearly vertical sub-seabed cracks and faults that reflect the influence of regional tectonics on each drift segment. Our observation and analysis can be extrapolated to similar systems where the tectonic history may have implications for modern deformation and fluid flow evolution within sediment ridges, only detectable by high or very high resolution 3D acoustic data.",

            "abstract": "The increase in surface albedo inherent to land clearing and cultivation (land-cover change, LCC) in the subtropical dry forests of the South American Chaco offsets part of the radiative forcing (RF) of the related carbon emissions. The magnitude of these albedo changes, however, is also dependent on shifts in agricultural practices (land-management change, LMC) and will influence the net effect on Earth's radiation balance as well as other potential feedbacks on climate. We quantified the surface albedo changes between 2001 and 2013 and the consequent shifts in the radiation balance resulting from LCC and LMC, using MODIS imagery a columnar radiation model parameterized with satellite data. Agricultural systems replacing dry forests presented a large variety of managements, ranging from pasture systems with remnant trees to different grain crops, displaying a wide range of phenologies. Cultivated lands showed higher and more variable albedo values (mean = 0.162, Standard Deviation = 0.013, n = 10,000 pixels) than the dry forests they replace (mean = 0.113, SD = 0.010, n = 10,000). These albedo contrasts resulted in a cooling RF of deforestation of -10.1 W m-2 on average, but both livestock and grain crop production systems showed large differences among the different land management options. For instance, livestock systems based on open pasture lands showed higher albedo change and RF (0.06 and -16.3 W m-2, respectively) than silvopastoral systems (0.02 and -4.4 W m-2). Similarly in cropping systems, the replacement of double-cropping by single summer crops, a widespread process in the region lately, resulted in higher albedo change (0.06 vs. 0.08) and RF (-16.3 vs. -22.3 W m-2). Although the effects of LCC on climate are widely acknowledged, those of LMC are still scarcely understood. In the Chaco region, the latter could play an important role and offer a yet-overlooked pathway to influence the radiative balance of our planet.",

A primary factor for this expectation is the large increase in atmospheric water vapor content expected with global warming, a simple application of the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relationship. However, the spatial variations of changes will also be modulated by changes in frequency, intensity and location of the storms that produce heavy rainfall. In this study, we explore one dimension of this complex issue, specifically the observational evidence for robust relationships among atmospheric temperature, total precipitable water, and the most extreme magnitudes of surface rainfall rates. We investigate the extent to which a C-C relationship is followed and whether this is dependent on rainstorm duration. This information is crucial to understanding how to incorporate climate change considerations into extreme rainfall design values.\n\nUsing high-frequency rainfall measurements from both in-situ networks such as the US Climate ",

Previous studies have separately quantified the importance of environmental conditions and convective properties with respect to intensity change; however, conjoined analyses have been rare. Using 15 years (1998–2012) of SHIPS and NCEP FNL reanalysis information for Atlantic and East Pacific storms, we analyze the sensitivity of intensity change for a detailed set of environmental parameters. Environmental conditions are then used to determine a threshold beyond which intensification is plausible. In conjunction with the environmental dataset, an expansive collection of passive microwave satellite (includes TMI, AMSR-E, and SSMI[S]) and TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) data is used to investigate the relative importance of various convective properties (specifically those proxies for convective intensity, symmetry, and area) in storms that meet the “plausible” threshold. An emphasis is placed on evaluating the hypothesis that, when a necessary set of environmental conditions is met, intensification is favored if the inner core consists of symmetric, moderately intense convection.",

            "abstract": "Thin plastic films, such as Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF), have been used as protective coatings or dust detectors on a number of missions including the Dust Counter and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA) instrument on Vega 1 and 2, the High Rate Detector (HRD) on the Cassini Mission, and the Student Dust Counter (SDC) on New Horizons. These types of detectors can be used on the lunar surface or in lunar orbit to detect dust grain size distributions and velocities. Due to their low power requirements and light weight, large surface area detectors can be built for observing low dust fluxes. The SDC dust detector is made up of a permanently polarized layer of PVDF coated on both sides with a thin layer (≈ 1000 Å) of aluminum nickel. The operation principle is that a micrometeorite impact removes a portion of the metal surface layer exposing the permanently polarized PVDF underneath. This causes a local potential near the crater changing the surface charge of the metal layer. The dimensions and shape of the crater determine the strength of the potential and thus the signal generated by the PVDF. The theoretical basis for signal interpretation uses a crater diameter scaling law which was not intended for use with PVDF. In this work, a crater size scaling law has been experimentally determined, and further simulation work is being done to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of crater formation. LS-Dyna, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code from the Livermore Software Technology Corp. was chosen to simulate micrometeorite impacts. It is capable of incorporating key physics phenomena, including fracture, heat transfer, melting, etc. Furthermore, unlike Eulerian methods, SPH is gridless allowing large deformities without the inclusion of unphysical erosion algorithms. Material properties are accounted for using the Grüneisen Equation of State. The results of the SPH model can then be fed into electrostatic relaxation models to enhance the fidelity of interpretation of charge signals from a PVDF detector. An electrostatic relaxation code was also used to determine the theoretical charge produced by the PVDF detector given a crater of specific depth and diameter. Experimental results and preliminary simulation results and conclusions will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The rupture velocities of intermediate- and deep-focus earthquakes --- how they vary between subduction zones, how they vary with depth, and what their maximum values are --- may help constrain the mechanism(s) of the earthquakes. As part of a global study of intermediate- and deep-focus earthquakes, I have used rupture directivity to estimate the rupture vector (speed and orientation) for 422 earthquakes >70 km depth with MW ≥5.7 since 1990. I estimate the rupture velocity relative to the local P-wave velocity (vr/α). Since the same method is used for all earthquakes, the results can be readily compared across study areas. The study areas --- Middle America, South America, Tonga-Kermadec, Izu-Bonin-Marianas, and Japan-Kurils-Kamchatka --- include some of the warmest and coldest subduction zones: subducting plate ages range from 9-150 Myr and descent rates range from 1-13 cm/yr. Across all subduction zones and depth ranges, for the 193 earthquakes with observable directivity and well-constrained rupture vectors, most earthquakes rupture on the more horizontal of the two possible nodal planes. However, the rupture vectors appear to be randomly-oriented relative to the slip vector, so the earthquakes span the continuum from Mode II (i.e., parallel slip and rupture vectors) to Mode III rupture (i.e., perpendicular slip and rupture vectors). For this earthquake population, the mean rupture velocity is 0.43 vr/α ± 0.14 vr/α. The mean earthquake rupture velocities are similar between all subduction zones. Since the local seismic wavespeed is faster in colder subduction zones, absolute rupture velocities are faster in colder subduction zones. Overall, the fastest rupture velocities exceed the local S-wave speed. The supershear ruptures are associated with earthquakes closer to Mode II than Mode III faulting. This is consistent with theoretical calculations, which limit the rupture velocity to the S-wave speed for Mode III rupture but the P-wave speed for Mode II rupture.",

Teachers have long served as team leaders, department chairs, and curriculum developers. But what happens when you go beyond these typical roles in professional development? Can teachers become lead communicators beyond the classroom? Can they become leaders of change on important topics like the climate?\nFor nearly a decade, PolarTREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating), funded by the National Science Foundation, has been teaming teachers with research projects in all fields of polar science. Teachers participate in hands-on field research experiences in the polar regions which focus heavily on climate change and climate science. Administrated by the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, the goal of PolarTREC is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing K-12 educators and polar researchers together.\nThe program fosters a teacher and researcher network, which accelerates the cross-pollination of knowledge in science practices, findings, and classroom implementation throughout disciplines. Evaluation data exposes a crucial dynamic that increases the potential for a successful climate change science campaign. Data indicates that teachers can tackle challenges such as reframing climate change science to better address the need for a particular campaign, as well as garnering the science project the necessary support through effective, authentic, and tangible communication efforts to policymakers, funders, students, and the public.\nResearchers reported the value of explaining their science, in-situ, allowed them to reframe and rework the objectives of the science project to attain meaningful outcomes. More than half of the researchers specifically noted that one of the strengths of the PolarTREC project is its benefit to the scientific process. The researchers also viewed PolarTREC as an essential outreach activity and improved the public perception of their scientific endeavors.\nThis presentation will speak to the PolarTREC program's best practice and findings on improved polar science communications as well as how the teachers have become the lead communicators in this time of rapid global change across all disciplines.",

            "abstract": "Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) plays a critical role in transporting heat, nutrients and CO2 from the Southern Ocean to the base of the equatorial thermocline in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP). In turn, the heat and nutrients storage below the thermocline (~100-500 m) in the EEP can exert large effect on Earth’s climate through ocean-atmosphere heat and CO2 exchange. Here we present a centennially resolved Holocene subsurface temperature reconstruction using Mg/Ca of Neogloboquadrina dutertrei from the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP). In the EEP N. dutertrei calcifies at about ~125 m which is below the Equatorial Undercurrent and the upper limit of the thermostad water in this region. During the early Holocene N. dutertrei temperatures vary between 14.5˚C and 16.5˚C, whereas by 8 kyr B.P. the temperature drops to 13˚C. The cooling by 8 kyr is also observed in the bottom water (~400 m) temperature reconstructions from Uvigerina spp. The early Holocene cooling of the thermostad water is likely linked to southern high latitude climate variability attributed to changes in the southern westerly winds (SWW). We posit that a more southern position of the SWW in the early Holocene increased the influence of warm subtropical water into the formation region of and thereby warming SAMW. Additionally, a southward position of the SWW increased SAMW production causing the southern high latitude signal to reach farther into the EEP. After 8 ky, thermostad temperatures show millennial and centennial variability, with low temperature between 4.8-3.6 kyr followed by high temperatures during the next 500 years. High resolution record of the last 2,000 years also show multidecadal to multicentennial thermostad temperature variability. The timing of this variability does not follow the Northern Hemisphere temperature variability including the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly. We conclude that in absence of a strong climate signal from the southern high latitudes during the mid to late Holocene the centennial variability in the EEP hydrography is dominated by intrinsic variability.",

            "abstract": "Fire is an important recurrent phenomenon that determines the distribution of global savanna biomes and tree cover in savanna ecosystems. Tropical savanna fires are almost exclusively ground fires, fueled by senescent herbaceous material, with crown fires being rare. Analyses of satellite-based fire activity and burned area (active fires and burn-scars) in tropical savannas reveal a close correlation with satellite-based estimates of total net primary productivity (NPP) in drier savannas, and apparent limitation by rainfall (fuel moisture) in wetter systems. However, these analyses of fire frequency and extent at continental scales ignore the different roles played by the herbaceous and woody vegetation components in promoting and/or suppressing fire ignition and spread. In this research we hypothesized that, since herbaceous vegetation provides the primary fuel, fire frequency and burn areas in African savannas and seasonal woodlands should correlate more closely with measurements of herbaceous NPP or end of season leaf area index (LAI), than with the NPP or LAI of the tree layer. Similarly, while fire patterns may correlate with patterns of total LAI and total NPP across Africa, the relationship will be confounded by variations in tree cover.\nOur objective is to understand how fire frequency and intensity vary with changes in herbaceous cover. To test our hypotheses we will use estimates of herbaceous and woody LAI that we have developed recently by partitioning MODIS LAI. We will explore how seasonal maximum herbaceous LAI and leaf area duration (LAD) (both potential proxies for accumulated fuel load) correlate with fire frequency in African savannas. We will demonstrate the MODIS LAI partitioning methodology, and present results on the divergent relationships between African savanna fires and total LAI, herbaceous LAI and herbaceous LAD.",

            "abstract": "Salt marshes are important intertidal wetlands strongly influenced by interactions between surface water and groundwater. Bordered by coastal water, the marsh system undergoes cycles of inundation and exposure driven by the tide. This leads to dynamic, complex pore-water flow and solute transport in the marsh soil. Pore-water circulations occur over vastly different spatial and temporal scales with strong link to the marsh topography. These circulations control solute transport between the marsh soil and the tidal creek, and ultimately affect the overall nutrient exchange between the marsh and coastal water. The pore-water flows also dictate the soil condition, particularly aeration, which influences the marsh plant growth. Numerous studies have been carried out to examine the pore-water flow process in the marsh soil driven by tides, focusing on stable flow with the assumption of homogeneity in soil and fluid properties. This assumption, however, is questionable given the actual inhomogeneous conditions in the field. For example, the salinity of surface water in the tidal creek varies temporally and spatially due to the influence of rainfall and evapotranspiration as well as the freshwater input from upland areas to the estuary, creating density gradients across the marsh surface and within the marsh soil. Many marshes possess soil stratigraphy with low-permeability mud typically overlying high-permeability sandy deposits. Macropores such as crab burrows are commonly distributed in salt marsh sediments. All these conditions are prone to the development of non-uniform, unstable preferential pore-water flow in the marsh soil, for example, funnelling and fingering. Here we present results from laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to explore such unstable flow. In particular, the analysis aims to address how the unstable flow modifies patterns of local pore-water movement and solute transport, as well as the overall exchange between the marsh soil and creek water. The changes would influence not only the marsh soil condition for plant growth but also nutrient cycling in the marsh soil and discharge to the coastal sea.",

            "abstract": "The Upper Sacramento River area is vital to California’s water supply, and is susceptible to major floods. Recent studies indicate that orographic precipitation in this complex terrain involves both inland penetrating atmospheric rivers (ARs) and the Sierra barrier jet (SBJ). The southerly SBJ induces orographic precipitation along south-facing slopes in the Shasta region, whereas landfalling ARs ascend up and over the statically stable SBJ and induce orographic precipitation along west-facing upper slopes in the Northern Sierra Nevada. This paper explores the hypothesis that extreme daily precipitation here is controlled by the presence of both a landfalling AR and a SBJ.\nThree 10-year-long (2000–2011) observational datasets are used. ARs are identified from the Neiman et al. (2008) AR catalog that uses an SSM/I satellite-based AR-detection method from Ralph et al. (2004), whereas SBJ conditions are determined from Chico, CA wind profiler data using the method from Neiman et al. (2010). Extreme daily precipitation is identified from the average of 8 rain gauges spanning the region known as the “Northern Sierra 8-Station Index.” The “index” is used by water managers to assess water supply. Extreme events are defined as the 50 largest daily precipitation totals in the index for the 10-year period (the top ~1.37%).\nThese dates in the 8-station index are compared with the catalogs of landfalling ARs and SBJs. In summary, 46 of 50 (92%) extreme daily precipitation events are associated with landfalling ARs on either the day before or the day of precipitation, whereas 45 of 50 (90%) extreme daily precipitation events are associated with SBJ conditions. 38 of 50 (76%) extreme daily precipitation events are associated with both a landfalling AR and an SBJ. The 10 days with the largest daily precipitation in the index were all associated with both a landfalling AR and an SBJ. Thus, extreme daily precipitation in Northern California is strongly controlled by the presence of both a landfalling AR and a SBJ.",

            "abstract": "The availability of high quality rain gage networks for extended periods of time during NASA ground validation (GV) field projects supporting the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM) allow for extensive analysis of precipitation characteristics over a variety of locations and meteorological regimes. Changes in drop size distribution (DSD) parameters (e.g. D0, Nw, LWC) over the course of a six week deployment are shown for the MC3E, IFloodS, and IPHEx experiments. During MC3E, median drop diameters (D0) progressively increased from late April through mid-May, coupled with a decrease in the normalized gamma number concentration (Nw). The environmental characteristics, such as CAPE, shear and moisture, that are most correlated with this change in DSD are investigated. It is hypothesized that increasing storm strength leads to larger precipitation particles that consume the available water at the expense of smaller particles, leading to increased D0 and lower Nw. In stratiform regions, stronger storms could lead to enhanced convergence and strong mesoscale ascent, resulting in the growth of larger ice particles and aggregates, also increasing D0 and lowering Nw.\nChanges in DSD are also examined from the perspective of polarimetric radar. The NASA S-band NPOL research radar is used to analyze changes in the DSD using the so-called self-consistency relationship between the ratio of specific differential phase (Kdp) to linear horizontal reflectivity (Zh) as a function of differential reflectivity (Zdr). The ability to detect changes in drop size distribution parameters from a high spatial and temporal resolution platform such as a radar would be useful for rainfall estimation. Changes in the self-consistency relationship during MC3E indicate an increase in Zdr from late April to mid-May, associated with a decrease in the ratio of Kdp/Zh. The polarimetric data from NPOL are also used to infer bulk microphysics in the column leading to changes in the drop size distribution.",

            "abstract": "To estimate the impacts of the ongoing and accelerating climate disruption on societally important infrastructure and ecosystems, the most important primary tools are global climate models (GCMs), which simulate the earth system response to changing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. A considerable barrier to the use of GCM output for local and regional studies is that the biases in the GCM output must be corrected, and the regional impacts inferred from large-scale simulated climate features. A simple and generally effective method for accommodating systematic biases in GCM output is 'quantile mapping,' which has been applied to many variables and shown to reduce biases on average, even in the presence of non-stationarity. This type of bias correction has been applied at spatial scales ranging from areas of hundreds of kilometers to individual points, such as weather station locations. Since water resources and other models used to simulate climate impacts are sensitive to biases in input meteorology, the temptation is great to apply bias correction at a scale such that the corrected GCM output closely resembles historically observed data, though there can undesirable consequences to doing so, especially where spatial correlation of driving climate variables is important. In this presentation, the trade-offs involved in bias correcting GCM precipitation and temperature, especially at different spatial scales, are explored in the context of simulating extreme high and low stream flows in the Western United States.",

Both of these are important for radiation belt dynamics. The ring current affects magnetic field geometry which in turn affects particle drift paths and plasmasphere erosion shrinks the region characterized by plasmaspheric hiss which would otherwise be present to scatter population of radiation belt seed electrons. Using the Van Allen Probes we investigate enhancements in the duskward electric field to lower L shells (L < 4 RE) and its role in ring current particle energization and erosion of the plasmasphere during two major storms; June 1, 2013 and February 19, 2014. During these storms, the electric field enhanced to low L shells with magnitudes ~1-2 mV/m in the co-rotating frame. The corresponding storm time ring current enhancements and plasmasphere erosions are examined in the context of these electric fields. The intensification in the duskward electric field is of long enough duration to transport particles from locations characteristic of the earthward edge of the plasma sheet (L shells ~ 8-10 RE) to the observed location of the ring current while energizing them though conservation of the first adiabatic invariant to energies typical of the ring current. It is also observed that the range in L shell over which the most intense nightside, duskward, electric field is observed is also that over which the higher pressure region of the ring current is located.",

            "abstract": "The Cretaceous northern Peninsular Ranges batholith (PRB) exemplifies emplacement in a combination oceanic arc / continental margin arc setting. Two approaches that can aid in understanding its statistical and spatial geochemistry variation are principle component analysis (PCA) and GIS interpolation mapping. The data analysis primarily used 287 samples from the large granitoid geochemical data set systematically collected by Baird and Welday. Of these, 80 points fell in the western Santa Ana block, 108 in the transitional Perris block, and 99 in the eastern San Jacinto block.\nIn the statistical analysis, multivariate outliers were identified using Mahalanobis distance and excluded. A centered log ratio transformation was used to facilitate working with geochemical concentration values that range over many orders of magnitude. The data was then analyzed using PCA with IBM SPSS 21 reducing 40 geochemical variables to 4 components which are approximately related to the compatible, HFS, HRE, and LIL elements. The 4 components were interpreted as follows: (1) compatible [and negatively correlated incompatible] elements indicate extent of differentiation as typified by SiO2, (2) HFS elements indicate crustal contamination as typified by Sri and Nb/Yb ratios, (3) HRE elements indicate source depth as typified by Sr/Y and Gd/Yb ratios, and (4) LIL elements indicate alkalinity as typified by the K2O/SiO2ratio.\nSpatial interpolation maps of the 4 components were created with Esri ArcGIS for Desktop 10.2 by interpolating between the sample points using kriging and inverse distance weighting. Across-arc trends on the interpolation maps indicate a general increase from west to east for each of the 4 components, but with local exceptions as follows. The 15km offset on the San Jacinto Fault may be affecting the contours. South of San Jacinto is a west-east band of low Nb/Yb, Gd/Yb, and Sr/Y ratios. The highest Sr/Y ratios in the north central area that decrease further east may be due to the far eastern granitoids being transported above a shear zone. Along the western edge of the PRB, high SiO2 and K2O/SiO2 are interpreted to result from sampling shallow levels in the batholith (2-3 kb), as compared to deeper levels in the central (5-6 kb) and eastern (4.5 kb) areas.",

Emissions transported from outside the basin, such as wildfires and agricultural burning, represent a potentially large contribution to air quality degradation.\nThis study analyzed PM10 filter samples from six different stations located across the MCMA from May, 2013, which represented the month with the most reported fire counts in the region between 2002-2013. Two meteorological regimes were established considering the number of satellite derived fire counts, changes in predominant wind direction, ambient concentrations of CO, PM10 and PM2.5, and precipitation patterns inside MCMA. The filter samples were analyzed for biomass burning tracers including levoglucosan (LEV), water-soluble potassium (WSK+); and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC). Results of these analyses show that LEV concentrations correlated positively with ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 (R2=0.61 and R2=0.46, respectively). Strong correlations were also found between WSOC and LEV (R2=0.94) and between WSK+ and LEV (R2=0.75). An average LEV/WSOC ratio of 0.0147 was estimated for Regime 1 and 0.0062 for Regime 2. Our LEV concentrations and LEV/WSOC ratios are consistent with results found during the MILAGRO campaign (March, 2006). To the best of our knowledge, only total potassium concentrations have been measured in aerosol samples from MCMA. Therefore, this is the first study in MCMA to measure ambient concentrations of WSK+.\nAnalysis of gravimetric mass concentrations showed that PM2.5 accounted for 60% of the PM10 mass concentration with an estimated PM10/PM2.5 ratio of 1.68. Estimates from our laboratory filter sample characterization indicated that we measured 37% of the total PM10 mass concentration. The missing mass is most likely crustal material (soil or dust) and carbonaceous aerosols that were not segregated into WSOC fraction.\nAssuming that LEV is inert in the atmosphere, the estimated biomass burning contributions to WSOC ranged from 7-23%. When assuming a LEV lifetime of 1.1 to 5 days, the estimated contributions increased on average 80%. Thus, we conclude that biomass burning sources had a large impact on WSOC and PM2.5 during May 2013, potentially explaining up to half of the measured WSOC.",

            "abstract": "An emission inventory (EI) is a conventional tool to quantify and monitor anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants into the atmosphere. Gridded EI can visually show geographical patterns of emissions and their changes over time. These patterns, when available, are often determined using location data collected by regional governments, industries, and researchers. Datasets such as Carbon Monitoring and Action (CARMA,\nwww.carma.org\n) are particularly useful for mapping emissions from large point sources and have been widely used in the EI community. The EI community is aware of potentially significant errors in the geographical locations of point sources, including power plants. The big challenge, however, is to review tens of thousands of power plant locations around the world and correct them where needed. The Power Plant Mapping Student Project (PPMSP) is a platform designed for students in 4th through 12th grade to improve the geographical location of power plants indicated in existing datasets to benefit international EI research. In PPMSP, we use VENTUS, a web-based platform (\nhttp://ventus.project.asu.edu/\n) that invites citizens to contribute power plant location data. Using VENTUS, students view scenes in the vicinity of reported power plant coordinates on Google Maps. Students either verify the location of a power plant or search for it within a designated radius using various indicators, an e-guide, and a power plant photo gallery for assistance. If the power plant cannot be found, students mark the plant as unverified. To assure quality for research use, the project contains multiple checkpoints and levels of review. While participating in meaningful research that directly benefits the EI research community, students are engaged in relevant science curricula designed to meet each grade level’s Next Generation Science Standards. Students study energy, climate change, the atmosphere, and geographical information systems. The curricula is integrated with math and writing, connecting to the Common Core Standards. PPMSP is designed to be accessible and relevant to all learners, including students learning English. With PPMSP, students are empowered to participate in relevant research and become future leaders in mitigating climate change.",

Plants can grow to their potential only if the soil supports an environment conducive to growth. Soil chemical composition and texture directly influence the rate of water and nutrient ion uptake in vegetation. Prairie Wetlands have experienced the most dramatic land use changes within the United States throughout the last century. Soils deteriorate from erosion, compaction, use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers associated with agriculture and urbanization. Transitioning soil regimes in the US have been the impetus for numerous restoration activities that attempt to protect or remediate loss to native or functional plant groups. Success of plant restoration efforts is dependent on knowledge about regional soil regimes. Camassia Quamash (Blue Camas), an ephemeral wetland bulbaceous herb is a culturally significant edible plant to the Pacific Northwest tribes and was only surpassed as a subsistence trade commodity by Salmon. The literature about camas and suitable soil types for it to grow is limited. The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes interest in restoring the plant to the Flathead Indian Reservation (FIR) prompted a series of research initiatives to document baseline parameters of remaining camas stands. Baseline soil conditions examining chemical regimes and soil textures on four FIR observed camas sites were analyzed. Samples indicated that remaining camas stands occurred in loamy nutrient rich prairie wetland to lightly forested soil regimes.",

            "abstract": "We treat paleoclimatic sampling as a sensor placement problem, attempting to find the locations where observations would optimally characterize the variability of climate fields of interest. Starting from a set of realistically-constrained, predefined potential sampling locations and observational uncertainties, we formulate optimized observing networks as the solution to a data-assimilation problem: given a stochastic representation of the Gaussian-distributed climate states of interest, which are linked to direct climate observations via a proxy system model, we may update the distribution and quantify the information gain from each possible sensor network. Furthermore, using submodular cost functions considerably reduces the size of the numerical optimization problem, as it enables iterative addition of sensors to the network. We illustrate this process with the design of an optimal network of coral δ18O used to jointly infer sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity fields. For example, given the current coral network, we show that an additional 25 to 75 observations would greatly improve the SST field reconstruction with the resampling rate being the highest in the central Pacific region.\nWe analyze the impact of various design choices on the resulting optimal sensor network, such as the cost function formulation, the quantification of uncertainty within the proxy system model and the targeted fields. We conclude with a discussion of applications to other proxy classes.",

Even though urban areas cover only 2% of the earth’s surface, they contribute about 70% of global carbon emissions. We aim to conduct a comparative analysis of fossil fuel CO2 (FFCO2) emissions in three large urban areas across different regions in the U.S. based on our spatially-explicit Hestia approach, called the ‘Hestia Project’. This research effort is the first to use bottom-up methods to quantify all FFCO2 emissions down to the scale of individual buildings, road segments, and industrial/electricity production facilities on an hourly basis for an entire urban landscape. The Hestia method relies on a large swath of input data such as criteria pollutant emissions reporting, stack monitoring, census data, tax assessor parcel data and traffic monitoring. The urban areas quantified with the Hestia approach include Indianapolis, Salt Lake City, and the Los Angeles Basin (encompassing over 80 cities). A comparative analysis will provide a better understanding of how and why FFCO2 emissions differ across time and space. We examine various factors such as heating/cooling degree days, population, GDP, industrial profile and building age. The study seeks to answer the following questions: 1) How and why do FFCO2 differ across the cities/regions? 2) What drives the different temporal profile of urban emissions? and 3) How do these vary across and within the urban landscape? The results from the study will benefit city planners and other stakeholders in managing urban development and greenhouse gas emissions mitigation.",

The Bucaramanga nest is the densest concentration of intermediate-depth seismicity in the world – which we observe using the regional network of Colombia (RSNC). The Bucaramanga nest exhibits both traditional repeating earthquakes as well as reverse polarity repeating earthquakes. These two populations of events, each with highly correlating waveforms (repeating events) and with reverse polarity to the other group, are defined using a divisive clustering algorithm based on waveform similarity. Using a feature extraction relocation process, we observe the two groups tightly clustered in regions of both space and time. We show two large features, each corresponding to a group of seismicity, and inspect sequences at a localized scale. Some events in a sequence are separated by as few as ~12 seconds in time and ~100s meters in space. A pattern of cascading failure provides further evidence for a thermal-shear failure mechanism of intermediate-depth earthquakes.",

Soil microorganism processes are spatiotemporally heterogeneous, limiting our ability to constrain the anthropogenic influence on N2O production at a global scale. The intramolecular position of 15N (β position 15N14N16O versus α position 14N15N16O) in addition to δ15Nbulk-N2O can aid in our understanding of both the biological controls and stratospheric influence of tropospheric N2O. A subset of 22 sites from the NOAA Global Monitoring Division Cooperative Sampling Network is being measured in order to describe the global distribution and seasonality of N2O isotopocules. Simultaneous and continuous measurement of N2O mole fraction, δ15Nbulk-N2O, δ15Nα-N2O, and δ15Nβ-N2O is conducted using the Picarro G5101-i wavelength-scanned cavity ring-down spectrometer coupled with a quantum cascade laser capable of the mid-infrared wavelength detection needed for N2O. While isotopic differences within and between sites are observed, long term measurement uncertainties of 0.7‰, 0.8‰, and 1.3‰ for δ15Nbulk, δ15Nα, and δ15Nβ respectively, limit our ability to detect tropospheric trends. Applying additional correction factors for environmental conditions and molecular interference may help to reduce these uncertainties. Due to the lack of isotopic reference material for N2O, we have developed an isotopic calibration technique using trace additions of δ15Nα and δ15Nβ to our reference gas at the ambient mole fraction needed for laser based isotopic measurement.",

We coupled the CHARON inlet to a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) which quantitatively detects most organic analytes and ammonia. The combined set-up measures submicron organic and ammonium nitrate/sulfate particles online.

            "abstract": "Tar balls, a subset of organic aerosol that is characterized by spherical shape and amorphous composition, are presumed to be brown-carbon (BrC) particles that contribute to light absorption in the atmosphere. Because of their distinctive shapes, compositions, and lack of crystallinity, tar balls are uniquely identifiable using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Using samples collected during BBOP, we performed a detailed investigation of their compositions, formation processes, and occurrence. They primarily originated from wildfires and are most abundant in relatively aged plumes (>several hours from emission). Their features are similar to those from Mexico measured during the 2006 MILAGRO campaign, but their number fractions are more abundant in the Idaho, Oregon, and Washington samples of BBOP. In order to determine the TB robustness with respect to heating, an experiment was carried out on a TEM grid containing a mixture of organic particles, nanosphere soot, and TBs during which the sample temperature was ramped from ~30 to 650 ºC. The TEM results collected at 30 and 600 ºC, the latter representing the filament temperature used by the AMS, indicate that material of lower volatility is lost by 600 ºC. Although there was some loss of material during the 15-minute temperature ramp, TBs were still present at the higher temperature. These preliminary findings suggest that the efficiency of AMS detection of TBs may be significantly less than unity and potentially translate to an underreporting of the aerosol mass for wildfire plumes. If tar balls have low AMS detection efficiencies, an underestimate in organic aerosol mass will result.",

(2007), the depocenter area, having an extension of ~ 10 km (E-W) x ~ 5 km (N-S), was delimited. The drilling campaign was carried out in April 2014, recovering a total of 51.50 m of sediment with a Usinger drilling machine (Ø 80 mm and 55 mm) and a Uwitec platform. To achieve efficient stratigraphic control at the site CHD (103° 02'W, 20° 15' N), 51.50 m of sediment were cored at three equidistant holes spread ca. 4 m: CHD-A (4.20 m), CHD-B (27.15 m) and CHD (20.15 m). The stratigraphic depth reached was 27.15 m. After recovery, the undisturbed sediment was extruded from iron tubes into PVC tubes and split longitudinally resulting one working half for laboratory work and the other as archive half. In total we obtained 103 \"half tubes\", that were protected with plastic film wrap and stored in plastic bags and keeping refrigerated at 4° C. The sediment collected is loose and its grain size is silty-clay, with the exception of volcanic material. The preliminary megascopic description of the sediment in CHD-A core based on color, presence of laminations, volcanic ash and black particles is as follows:\nCOLOR. (0 m-4.15 m) gray-brown; (4.15 m -22.15 m) dark gray; (22.15 m -27.15 m) gray-brown.\nLAMINATION. (0m-11.15m) Incipient to defined; (11.15m-22.15m) Absent; (22.15m-23.15m) Incipient; (23.15m-27.15m) Absent.\nVOLCANIC ASH. (0m- 27.15m) Few horizons mm in thickness. From 26.52 m - 26.66 m a thin layer of 14 cm was observed.\nBLACK PARTICLES. (0m-27.15m) Presence at different concentration of black particles (cf. charcoal)\nDIATOM & POLLEN. (0m-10m) Central diatom (Surirella sp and Cyclotella sp); Pinus sp.\nThe identification of different concentrations of charcoal is the opportunity to reconstruct the Holocene landscape dynamics in the watershed of Lake Chapala, regarding the fire history through anthracological studies. At the bottom (27.15 m) the conventional radiocarbon age is 9,740 BP. Thus a preliminary linear sedimetation rate is 2 mm yr-1.

            "abstract": "Soil erosion has long been identified as one of the key mechanisms affecting biogeochemical processes in the soil, through the transport and delivery of carbon and nutrients adsorbed to soil particles in the soil active layer. However, most biogeochemical models treat soil erosion contributions simplistically and lack the capacity to accurately account for the mechanisms that control soil erosion and deposition on the landscape. This stems from the fact that the majority of the biogeochemical models have traditionally been employed on landscapes where lateral and downslope fluxes due to soil erosion have been less significant compared to other vertical fluxes and processes occurring at a fixed location on the landscape. In intensely managed landscapes, however, this may not be the case since land management practices such as tillage and exposed land cover can lead to copious amounts of erosion on the landscape. Therefore, to better understand the role of soil erosion on soil biogeochemical cycling in IMLs, we present a framework for simulating the spatiotemporal effects of soil erosion and deposition on soil biogeochemical cycling. We focus specifically on tillage- and runoff-induced erosion since these are prevalent in IMLs. The framework employs a geospatial approach that loosely couples a GIS-based upland water erosion model, GeoWEPP, with a soil biogeochemistry model, Century, to predict downslope and lateral fluxes of soil erosion and the resultant impacts on soil biogeochemical cycling. The use of a geospatial approach allows us to better capture the effects of topography, soil type, land use/land cover, and climate on soil erosion fluxes as well as soil biogeochemical cycling. The spatiotemporal resolution of the framework makes it particularly beneficial for identifying hotspots in fields and hot moments at scales ranging from daily to annual time scales. We employ the framework to study the monthly redistribution of soil organic carbon over the course of a year in the South Amana Sub-Watershed, located in the headwaters of Clear Creek, Iowa, USA. Preliminary results indicate that the framework is able to capture observed erosional and depositional patterns in the watershed and can provide insight into soil carbon redistribution and sequestration.",

            "abstract": "Cross-correlation of time-series, or interferometry, applied to the ambient seismic field is an established method to observe the propagation of waves between pairs of sensors without involving transient sources. These reconstructed waves are routinely used to develop high-resolution images of the crust and upper mantle, or in mapping the time-dependent velocity changes associated with tectonic events. Using similar methods, recent work have highlighted more challenging observations, such as higher mode surface wave propagation and body wave reconstruction at various scales of the Earth: from the industrial surveys at the reservoir scale to the global scale. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the correct amplitude information can be used to image the anelastic attenuation of the medium and has led to a new type of ground motion prediction using virtual earthquakes method. The dependability of such amplitude retrieval had been debated and represents a difficult challenge due to uneven source distribution. In this study, we discuss the possibility to use the correlation of ambient noise correlation (similar to C3 method) to map the contribution of different source locations for Rayleigh wave reconstruction between receiver pairs. These maps constructed in terms of traveltime or amplitude perturbations of the Green’s function, can be considered as empirical sensitivity kernels with respect to the contribution of each virtual source. We propose for the first time to map these kernels using a dataset of continuous records from a dense array of about 2600 sensors deployed at the local-scale in Long Beach (CA, USA). Finally, these maps are used to analyze the impact of the original ambient noise directivity on the recovered Green’s functions and discuss the effects of the velocity lateral heterogeneity within the array. We aim at understanding, and thereby reducing, the bias in ambient field measurements.",

Several Federal agencies and academic groups have commissioned suites of indicators drawing upon and aggregating information available across the spectrum of climate data stewards and providers.\nAs a long-time participant in the applied climatology discipline, NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) has generated climate indicators for several decades.

The dune field rests on Navajo Sandstone, and is bisected by the Sevier Normal Fault, which also forms the bedrock escarpment along the eastern boundary of the lower dune field (LDF). Limited ground penetrating radar (GPR) collected previously, as well as recent ground-based LiDAR data and geomorphic observations, suggest that underlying bedrock is topographically lower in the center of the LDF than on its margins. In order to image the dune-bedrock interface and any structures contained within the bedrock, including buried faults, 50-MHz and 100-MHz GPR antennae with 400-V transmitters were used to conduct over 25 transects, totaling several kilometers, across the LDF. We recorded radar reflections at depths of up to 30 m within the bedrock beneath the modern dunes. Outcrops and/or shallow boreholes along some transects provide ground truth for dune-bedrock contacts. The resulting radar profiles suggest at least two antithetic fault zones within the LDF that, in places, appear to control the location of smaller dunes. Further examination of the relationship between these fault zones and dune forms, as imaged with LiDAR, will help inform whether or not these structural controls affect variation in dune type and patterning across the LDF, and may also explain why the CPSD exist in this location.",

            "abstract": "Coarse-grained ripples, also known as “megaripples,” are large sand ripples found in both aeolian and aquatic environments on Earth, and are common on Mars. The formation and morphology of coarse-grained ripples are not as well understood as more common splash ripples. Current understanding suggests that formative wind speeds are above the saltation threshold for the fine grains, but below this threshold for coarse grains found on the crests, such that they creep. Based on this idea, we hypothesize that wind speeds above this coarse-grain saltation threshold will destroy the ripples. We further hypothesize that these ripples do not have an equilibrium size; rather, their size is related to the persistence of formative winds in a given direction. To test this model, we studied windblown coarse-grained ripples in White Sands, New Mexico. Terrestrial LiDAR was used to obtain high resolution ripple morphology and migration over a three month period. Wind velocity profiles and concurrent saltating grain size data were collected during a wind storm to directly relate modes of transport to particle size and wind stress. These local data were used to calibrate wind records from a nearby meteorological station to estimate local fluid stress using a long-term record. LiDAR data indicate that these ripples were destroyed and reoriented between March and June 2013, while the wind record shows that the coarse-grain saltation threshold was indeed exceeded during this time. Morphological analysis indicates that the lee slope of these ripples is set by saltation impact – similar to splash ripples – but that height, wavelength and stoss slope are not related to instantaneous transport conditions. The historical wind record also shows that the range of wind directions decreases rapidly with increasing speed, restricting strong winds to a narrow range of direction. From these results we explore the idea that coarse-grained ripples are typically larger and less frequently destroyed than splash ripples because the stronger winds required to create them are drawn from a more consistent direction. The ability to constrain wind conditions required to form and destroy coarse-grained ripples gives insight into formational conditions both in preserved paleo-ripples on Earth, and also on Mars where these bedforms are ubiquitous.

            "abstract": "The coronagraph systems carried on STEREO A &B as well as SOHO were used to collect data above the limb of the visible disk over the period 2011-2014. This corresponds roughly to the maximum of solar cycle24. EUV telescopes on the two STEREO spacecraft as well as those located on the SDO platform provided disk imagery of the EUV chromosphere and corona. About one third of the events examined occurred on the backside of the sun as viewed from Earth and have little or no signature detected with the GOES X-ray Flux instruments.\nThe spatial resolution used ranges from 3-arc sec in the EUV Disk observations to 30-arc sec in the corona at 20 solar radii. Time sequences with a cadence of 5-10 minutes were used for disk and coronagraph collection rates.\nOf particular interest are the association of major flare activity and the detection of large halo-type mass ejection events. In a majority of cases (34 of 37 events, a four part sequence of events was detected by the combined instrument systems.\nThese include (1) flare initiation and early onset (2)Large-Scale Coronal Propagating Fronts(LCPF), The properties of these features were measured using the collection of EUV He II 304 and Fe XII 193 disk imagers. (3) Evacuation of material from the lower corona 1-4solar radii was visualized appearing behind a bright front CME arch in coronagraph images of the lower corona (STEREO and SOHO) and (4) formulation of a CCME structure where mass expands 3-dimensionally into the corona as visualized from 4 to 20 solar radii as the CME leaves the Sun (C2 SOHO and Cor2 STEREO). In the cases of large X- class flares, a small reduction of the brightness (1-6 %of pre-flare) in F XIII 193 image sequences. These reduced emission features are seen easily in the running difference data for periods of scores of minutes following flare initiation. These transient features are centered on the originating active region and are highly correlated in space and time with the coronagraph observations. Disk structure of reduced intensity is dynamic and has final scale size of a fraction of a solar diameter. This suggests a method of detecting major CME initiation from disk active regions that does not require use of coronagraphic technique.",

Paired planktic foraminiferal Mg/Ca and δ18Oc constrain sea surface temperatures and isolate millennial-scale variations in the δ18O of surface waters (δ18Osw), which resulted from changes in river runoff in the northwestern Bay. Concurrently with low δ18Osw events, benthic foraminiferal δ13C decreased, suggesting an increased influence of an aged water mass at this intermediate depth site during the low salinity events. Benthic foraminiferal Cd/Ca results support the identification of this water mass as aged Glacial Antarctic Intermediate Water (GAAIW). Lagged correlation analysis (r= 0.41) indicates that changes in subsurface properties led changes in surface properties by an average of 380 years. The implication is that Southern Hemisphere climate exerted a controlling influence on the Indian monsoon during the last glacial period.",

            "abstract": "Extensive efforts by the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory in response to the 2004–2008 dome building eruption at Mount St. Helens recorded the extrusion of seven dacite spines. Efforts included a network of time-lapse cameras. Published studies of decimated data from these cameras show strong correlations between (long-term) extrusion velocities determined from the camera imagery and ancillary geophysical data, such as dome tilt and RSAM seismicity. However, more detailed analysis of these data should provide better constraints on physical processes behind dome extrusion.\nHere we apply modern computer vision techniques to explore the spatiotemporal variability and interactions occurring during spine extrusion and dome growth. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) delineates the deformation field in a series of images at sub-pixel level, and quantifies dome, talus and glacier deformation at unprecedented resolution, revealing spatiotemporal variability of the strain field on the time scale of hours.\nWe identify sharp boundaries between the vertically extruding spine, laterally displaced material, and downward-creeping talus. The spine growth at Mount St. Helens appears locally constrained and structurally separated into distinct segments. The velocities of different dome segments are generally correlated, but displacement patterns of the talus are more complex. We identify short term fluctuations with periods of hours to days superimposed on longer term fluctuations having periods of several weeks. The short term episodes of high displacement rates are often associated with strongly degassing plumes observed in the camera imagery. Over longer periods (days to weeks), extrusion rates form a sinusoidal fluctuating pattern, marked by sharp increases and gradual decreases in velocity. These observations substantiate the correlations with seismic and geodetic data shown in previous studies, but more closely constrain the velocity fluctuations of each spine. These fluctuations are related to drag on the spine margins, as shown by seismicity and dome tilt. Comparison of our results with complementary data streams allows us to assess the role of meteorological, magmatic and internal processes on frictional resistance, and thus the extrusion velocities.",

We build upon a simple threshold-delay concept with provisions for influences of soil temperature and photoperiod on plant growth. Modelled soil water content and grassland growth are based upon limited set of widely available climatic drivers such as daily precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature, to facilitate scaling, and validated against near-surface remote sensing (PhenoCam) data of vegetation greenness.

One event (on 4 June 2011) is the cleanest example, because it was not accompanied by energetic ions at MESSENGER having energies greater than 50±10 MeV/nuc. The purpose of this study is to assemble a set of conditions common to all events that can help identify the physical conditions at their origin. We classified the nine events into three categories: (1) those having tight magnetic connection to the Sun as well as to spacecraft at 1 AU that can separately measure the energetic proton, alpha particle, and electron flux spectra, (2) those with sufficiently close connection that the energetic flux spectra can be compared, (3) those that have only marginal connections, and (4) those that are also seen at Earth. Four events fall into category (1), three into category (2), two into category (3), and parts of four events overlapped neutron events also seen by the scintillation FIBer solar neutron telescope (FIB) detector placed on the International Space Station in 2009. Seven of the nine events that have either tight or marginal magnetic connection have alpha particle abundances less than 2%. For each event, we modeled expected fast neutron count rates from the 1 AU ion spectrum, a process that accounts for the transport of the neutrons through the spacecraft to the NS. The ratios of measured to predicted fast-neutron counts range between 2.0 and 12.1.",

The 2007 National Research Council’s Decadal Survey of Earth Science and Applications from Space recommended Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) as a mid-term, Tier II, space mission to address global sources, sinks, and transport of atmospheric CO2. As part of the development of a capability for the NASA ASCENDS mission, NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) and Exelis, Inc. have been collaborating to develop, demonstrate and mature the IM-CW lidar approach for measuring atmospheric column CO2 mixing ratios from a space platform using the integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar technique with preferential weighting of the CO2 measurements to the mid to lower troposphere. The Multi-Functional Fiber Laser Lidar (MFLL), a system developed as a technology demonstrator for the ASCENDS mission, has been used to demonstrate high precision column CO2 retrievals from various aircraft platforms. The MFLL operates using a novel IM-CW IPDA approach to make simultaneous CO2 and O2 column measurements in the 1.57-micron and 1.26-micron spectral regions, respectively, to derive the column-average CO2 dry-air mixing ratios. Measurements from the 2014 summer field experiment focused on advancing CO2 & O2 measurement technologies under day and night conditions in realistic environments, assessing CO2 emissions over large metropolitan areas, observing and evaluating CO2 drawdown and diurnal trends over large agricultural regions, obtaining reflectance data and CO2 & O2 measurements over rough ocean surfaces with high surface wind speeds (~10 m/s), and carrying out CO2 & O2 intercomparisons with OCO-2 and GOSAT over the western United States. Initial results from MFLL for the aforementioned flight campaign objectives will be presented where precision and accuracy of the CO2 and O2 optical depths, as well as the column-average CO2 mixing ratios, will be evaluated with respect to in-situ aircraft measurements of CO2 and meteorological state parameters.\n ",

            "abstract": "Ocean warming due to rising atmospheric CO2 has increasing impacts on ocean ecosystems by modifying the ecophysiology and distribution of marine organisms, and by altering ocean circulation and stratification. We explore ocean NPP and EP changes at the global scale with simulations performed in the framework of the fifth Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5). Global NPP and EP are reduced considerably by the end of the century for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario, although models differ in their significantly in their direct temperature impacts on production and remineralization.\nThe Earth system models used here project similar NPP trends albeit the magnitudes vary substantially. In general, projected changes in the 2090s for NPP range between -2.3 to -16.2% while export production reach -7 to -18% relative to 1990s. This is accompanied by increased stratification by 17-30%. Results indicate that globally reduced NPP is closely related to increased ocean stratification (R2=0.78). This is especially the case for global export production, that seems to be mostly controlled by the increased stratification (R2=0.95). We also identify phytoplankton community impacts on these patterns, that vary across the models. The negative response of NPP to climate change may be through bottom-up control, leading to a reduced capacity of oceans to regulate climate through the biological carbon pump. There are large disagreements among the CMIP5 models in terms of simulated nutrient and oxygen concentrations for the 1990s, and their trends over time with climate change. In addition, potentially important marine biogeochemical feedbacks on the climate system were not well represented in the CMIP5 models, including important feedbacks with aerosol deposition and the marine iron cycle, and feedbacks involving the oxygen minimum zones and the marine nitrogen cycle. Thus, these substantial reductions in primary productivity and export production over the 21st century simulated under the RCP 8.5 scenario were likely conservative estimates, and may need to be revised as marine biogeochemistry in Earth System Models (ESMs) continues to be developed.",

            "abstract": "Two outstanding goals of solid earth geophysics are to determine the chemical structure of the Earth and to understand the dynamics of its interior. The dynamics of the mantle are controlled by density variations and combined knowledge of density structure and seismic velocities provide the strongest constraints on chemical heterogeneity. Unfortunately, most of the traditional geophysical methods such as seismic tomography and geodynamic modeling alone cannot adequately resolve the density structure within the mantle. Thus, seismic, geodynamic and mineral physics joint inversion methods have been applied to better understand the dynamics of the mantle in recent years (e.g. Simmons et al. 2010). In these joint inversions, P wave and S wave travel times, as well as four convection-related geodynamic observations (free air gravity, tectonic plate motion, dynamic topography, and the excess ellipticity of the core-mantle boundary) can be used to produce 3-D models of density and seismic velocities simultaneously. The approach initially attempts to find a model that assuming temperature controls lateral variations in mantle properties and then to consider more complicated lateral variations that account for the presence of chemical heterogeneity to further fit data. Here we present new joint inversion results include 50% more new S wave travel time data than in previous work and geodynamic data that extend to larger spherical harmonic degrees. In addition, temperature derivatives of P and S velocity and density have been determined using an updated mineral physics dataset. For the first time we include non-linear anelastic temperature effects on velocities in the joint inversion. The anelastic effects decrease the required high density component within the lower mantle superplumes. The hypothesis that temperature variations explain most observed heterogeneity within the mantle is consistent with our data.\n",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade, ion microprobe analysis of speleothems (cave carbonates) has increased the temporal resolution of their oxygen isotope (δ18O) paleoclimate proxy records. Recent improvements in methodology, standardization, and imaging at the WiscSIMS lab make it possible to examine sub-annual patterns of δ18O variability at 10-µm-scale, revealing new seasonal paleoenvironmental information. We applied this technique to an important suite of Chinese stalagmites with conventional drill-sampled δ18O records that reflect changes in Asian Monsoon dynamics across the last deglaciation.\nSeasonal-resolution δ18O analyses in the Chinese stalagmites reveal regular patterns of annual δ18O variability. Quantitative assessment of the patterns identifies two important components in the δ18O records. First, the source and rainout histories of water vapors that ultimately yield rainfall over China play a primary role in determining the δ18O value of speleothem calcite year-round. Second, intra-annual patterns of calcite δ18O variability indicate that the annual proportion of monsoon precipitation changes systematically during the last deglaciation; the annual proportion of monsoon rainfall is greater during the Holocene and Bølling-Allerød than during the Younger Dryas.\nThis is the first time these components have been characterized in any speleothem δ18O record of monsoon dynamics because seasonal δ18O variability is lost by conventional drill-sampling. Ion microprobe analysis of speleothems can also produce year-by-year records of δ18O across abrupt climate change events. At the Younger Dryas-Holocene transition in a Kulishu Cave stalagmite, which spanned 16 years at 11.53 ky BP, there is a relatively smooth decrease in year-round δ18O(calcite). In contrast, the intra-annual δ18O patterns indicate that the increase in the annual proportion of monsoon rainfall across this transition is stochastic, implying that this record can distinguish the regional monsoon response from the hemisphere-wide atmospheric reorganization.",

            "abstract": "The NASA GIFTS program designed and constructed a flight-ready hyperspectral infrared sounder for geostationary orbit. Efforts are now underway to launch a constellation of similar instruments. Salient characteristics included 4 km spatial resolution at nadir and 0.6 cm-1 spectral resolution in two infrared bands. Observing system experiments have demonstrated the success of assimilated hyperspectral infrared radiances from IASI and AIRS in improving weather forecast skill. These results provide circumstantial evidence that additional observations at higher spatial and temporal resolution would likely improve forecast skill further. However, there is only limited work investigating the magnitude of this skill improvement in the literature. Here we present a systematic program to quantify the additional skill of a constellation of geostationary hyperspectral sounders through observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) using the WRF model and the WRFDA data assimilation system.\nThe OSSEs will focus first on high-impact events, such as the forecast for Typhoon Haiyun, but will also address quotidian synoptic forecast skill. The focus will be on short-term forecast skill (<24 hours lead time), in accord with WRF’s mesoscale design, and with the view that high time frequency observations are likely to make the biggest impact on the skill of short-range forecasts. The experiments will use as their starting point the full existing observational suite, so that additionality can be addressed, but will also consider contingencies, such as the loss of particular elements of the existing system, as well as the degree to which a stand-alone system of hyperspectral sounds would be able to successfully initialize a regional forecast model. A variety of settings, tropical and extratropical, marine and continental will be considered.",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) are mostly atmospheric phenomena but they also generate significant ground motions in the solid earth when they become strong. If a dense seismological array existed along the path of a hurricane, we could learn about some processes near the hurricane eye and the change of its intensity through seismic data.\nWe found a few cases of tropical cyclones that passed through the Transportable Array of Earthscope (TA) in the last four years. They provide some interesting time-evolving characteristics of hurricanes but in most cases seismic signals are too weak to gain any insight into the processes. The only exception we have found so far is Hurricane Isaac in 2012.\nHurricane Isaac was mostly a tropical storm during its lifetime but it became a hurricane about 12 hours before the first landfall at the mouth of the Mississippi river at 0000 UTC August 29. The eye then went back over the ocean, but stayed near the coast, and made landfall again at 0800 UTC August 29. After this landfall, it went through the TA. This gave us an opportunity to study the decay of this hurricane based on seismic data.\nOur basic data are amplitude-distance plots for each 6-hour hurricane location. We confine our analysis to frequencies below 0.02 Hz because in higher frequency bands seismic waves were broader oceans, not necessarily near the hurricane eye. Right after the landfall, we found a sharp peak at about 75 km from the eye. This is most likely the location of the eyewall, where a strong ascending flow is known to exist. Over the next 12 hours, we see this peak deteriorate, which is undoubtedly related to the decay of the hurricane after landfall. The peak remained at the same location for these 12 hours and then in the following 18 hours started to move farther from the eye, to about 250 km. Therefore, we can monitor how the eyewall deteriorated over the 30 hours after landfall.\nThe emphasis of this study will be on Hurricane Isaac but we will also report other cases for comparison and to clarify what we can learn about the processes near the hurricane eye by seismic data.",

The sources of these organic compounds are also being investigated through laboratory experiments in which Mars analogue mixtures are analyzed by Py-GC-MS and EGA under SAM-like conditions. In this study we examined the hydrocarbon trap, a component of the SAM Py-GC-MS system, as a potential source of some of the compounds detected on Mars. Analogue mixtures consisting of olivine sand and varying amounts of Cl-containing salts and magnetite were analyzed with Py-GC-MS operated under SAM-like conditions (i.e. trap materials and pyrolysis and GC temperature programs were the same as SAM analyses). Carbon dioxide, benzene and toluene were identified in all experiments and chlorobenzenes (CBs) and HCl were identified in the experiments with Cl salts. As the concentration of Cl salts increased the abundance of CBs, HCl and CO2 increased whereas the abundance of benzene and toluene remained stable. In order to confirm that these compounds originate from the trap we analyzed the samples while bypassing the trap. Benzene was detected, although at much lower concentrations, and toluene could not be definitively identified. Traces of CB were also detected when Cl salts were analyzed without the trap, again at lower concentrations. Additionally, traces of phthalic acid were detected in the Cl salt samples; this compound readily forms CBs in the presence of HCl (Miller et al., 2013). From this we can conclude that traces of benzene, toluene, and CBs can be degradation products originating from the hydrocarbon trap. Understanding how these compounds form and their relationship to the concentration of different mineral decomposition products helps us interpret the significance of all the organic compounds identified in SAM GC-MS data.",

Although the vertical winds are typically small, significantly smaller than typical zonal and meridional winds, they can be non-zero under certain conditions. Recent development in observing instrumentation (primarily the Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI)) now permits substantial progress to be made on specifying this component of the neutral wind vector. In this paper, neutral vertical wind data from Brazil FPI observations at around 240-km altitude during 2009 to 2014 are used for a climatological study of the equatorial vertical wind. This study included examination of the dependence on seasonal, solar, and geomagnetic activity. First, the data have been binned according to the local time, and the seasonal dependence of the local time variation is analyzed. Second, the examination of vertical neutral wind dependency on solar and geomagnetic activity is performed. The correlation of the vertical wind with F10.7, Kp and Dst parameters has also been studied. These results give us an unprecedented view of the behavior of the nighttime vertical wind at low latitudes, which is critical to specifying the dynamics of the upper atmosphere more globally.",

However, aerosol predictions by current chemistry transport models remain inaccurate, in no small part resulting from uncertainty of aerosol emission estimates. Here, we conducted observing system simulation experiments (OSSE) for future geostationary satellite to assess the potential of using hourly aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals to constrain emissions. Specifically, hourly pseudo AOD observations over North America were generated by WRF-Chem, and were applied to constrain emissions through GEOS-Chem adjoint model in two experiments. One experiment simulated assimilating polar-orbiting observations saying MODIS by providing data once a day, while another experiment simulated assimilating geostationary satellite observations saying TEMPO by providing data hourly in the daytime. Results show that SO2, NOx, and NH3 emissions constrained by high temporal resolution observations get better agreement with WRF-Chem emissions in terms of total amount and spatial distribution. This suggests that TEMPO could offer better constraints for aerosol emissions than polar-orbiting satellites.",

            "abstract": "With the large influence of agricultural land use on biophysical and biogeochemical cycles, integrating cultivation into Earth System Models (ESMs) is increasingly important. The Community Land Model (CLM) was augmented with a CLM-Crop extension that simulates the development of three crop types: maize, soybean, and spring wheat. The CLM-Crop model is a complex system that relies on a suite of parametric inputs that govern plant growth under a given atmospheric forcing and available resources. However, the strong nonlinearity of ESMs makes parameter fitting a difficult task. In this study, our goal is to calibrate ten of the CLM-Crop parameters for one crop type, soybean, in order to improve model projection of plant development and carbon fluxes. We used measurements of gross primary productivity, net ecosystem exchange, and plant biomass from AmeriFlux sites to choose parameter values that optimize crop productivity in the model. Calibration is performed in a Bayesian framework by developing a scalable and adaptive scheme based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our scheme can perform model calibration using very few evaluations and, by exploiting parallelism, at a fraction of the time required by plain vanilla Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We present the results from a twin experiment (self-validation) and calibration results and validation using real observations from an AmeriFlux tower site in the Midwestern United States, for the soybean crop type. The improved model will help researchers understand how climate affects crop production and resulting carbon fluxes, and additionally, how cultivation impacts climate.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of subreach river bathymetry from remotely-sensed surface velocity data is presented using variational inverse modeling applied to the 2D depth-averaged, shallow-water equations (SWEs). A nested approach is adopted to focus on obtaining an accurate estimate of bathymetry over a small region of interest within a larger complex hydrodynamic system. This approach reduces computational cost significantly. We begin by constructing a minimization problem with a cost function defined by the error between observed and estimated surface velocities, and then apply the SWEs as a constraint on the velocity field. An adjoint SWE model is developed through the use of Lagrange multipliers, converting the unconstrained minimization problem into a constrained one. The adjoint model solution is used to calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to bathymetry. The gradient is used in a descent algorithm to determine the bathymetry that yields a surface velocity field that is a best-fit to the observational data. In this application of the algorithm, the 2D depth-averaged flow is computed within a nested framework using Delft3D-FLOW as the forward computational model. First, an outer simulation is generated using discharge rate and other measurements from USGS and NOAA, assuming a uniform bottom-friction coefficient. Then a nested, higher resolution inner model is constructed using open boundary condition data interpolated from the outer model (see figure). Riemann boundary conditions with specified tangential velocities are utilized to ensure a near seamless transition between outer and inner model results. The initial guess bathymetry matches the outer model bathymetry, and the iterative assimilation procedure is used to adjust the bathymetry only for the inner model. The observation data was collected during the ONR Rivet II field exercise for the mouth of the Columbia River near Hammond, OR. A dual beam squinted along-track-interferometric, synthetic-aperture radar (ATI-SAR) system was used which provides high-resolution nearly bank-to-bank vector-surface-velocity observations of the river mouth. Data and bathymetry estimation results are presented, and the algorithm results are compared to contemporaneous USGS measured bathymetry data, with favorable results.",

Our drive for ever greater simulation resolution/complexity/length/repetition, coupled with new remote and in-situ sensing platforms present us with problems in computation, data handling, and information management, to name but three. These problems are compounded by the background trends: Moore's Law is no longer doing us any favours: computing is getting harder to exploit as we have to bite the parallelism bullet, and Kryder's Law (if it ever existed) isn't going to help us store the data volumes we can see ahead. The variety of data, the rate it arrives, and the complexity of the tools we need and use, all strain our ability to cope. The solutions, as ever, will revolve around more and better software, but \"more\" and \"better\" will require some attention.\nIn this talk we discuss how these issues have played out in the context of CMIP5, and might be expected to play out in CMIP6 and successors. Although the CMIPs will provide the thread, we will digress into modelling per se, regional climate modelling (CORDEX), observations from space (Obs4MIPs and friends), climate services (as they might play out in Europe), and the dependency of progress on how we manage people in our institutions. It will be seen that most of the issues we discuss apply to the wider environmental sciences, if not science in general. They all have implications for the need for both sustained infrastructure and ongoing research into environmental informatics.",

            "abstract": "Volcanism in the South Aegean Sea first occurred about 3-4 million years ago, along four different volcanic island groups, including both onshore and recently discovered offshore volcanoes: 1) Starting from the west, the Methana group consists of the Methana stratovolcano, composed exclusively of volcaniclastics and lavas, creating cones and domes onland and the Paphsanias submarine cone in the Epidavros tectonic graben, bordered by E-W normal faults. It has a 2 km basal diameter at 400 m depth and its top rises to 150 m. 2) The Milos-Antimilos group consists of volcanic domes and calderas onland and three submarine domes to the east of Antimilos. A hydrothermal vent field is limited in the SE coastal zone of Milos, 3) The Santorini group consists of: (i) the older volcanic cones of Christianna islets and three submarine domes east of them, (ii) Santorini volcano which during the last 500 ka experienced repeated caldera collapses following Plinian eruptions and edifice rebuilding, represented by the growth of the Kamenes islands after the last catastrophic Late Bronze age eruption. (iii) a chain of about twenty submarine volcanic domes and craters in the Kolumbo zone northeast of Santorini. Kolumbo volcano is a 3 km diameter cone with a 1500 m wide crater, a crater rim as shallow as 18 m depth and a flat crater floor at 505 m depth containing an active hydrothermal vent field degassing 99% of CO2. 4) The Kos-Nisyros group at the eastern edge of the Hellenic Volcanic arc, comprises several domes and craters offshore and Nisyros volcano consists exclusively of alternating lava and pyroclastic deposits following several phases of reconstruction and caldera collapse. The rhyodacitic domes of Profitis Ilias are the latest evolutionary stage of Nisyros volcano which disrupted a pre-existed caldera and may be regarded as an earlier reconstruction phase similar to the Kameni islands at Santorini.\nThe volcanic relief reaches 1100-1200 m in most cases. This is produced from the outcrops of the volcanic centers emerging usually at 400-600 m depth and ending either below sea level or at high altitudes of 600-700 m on the islands. All volcanic edifices are located within neotectonic grabens formed by normal faulting, sometimes overprinted by subvertical strike-slip structures.",

            "abstract": "Ice nucleation is the initial step in forming mixed-phase and cirrus clouds, and is well established as an important influence on global climate. Laboratory studies investigate at which cloud relevant conditions of temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) ice nucleation occurs and as a result, numerous fundamentally different ice nucleation descriptions have been proposed for implementation in cloud and climate models. We introduce a new immersion freezing model based on first principles of statistics to simulate individual droplet freezing requiring only three experimental parameters, which are the total number of droplets, the uncertainty of applied surface area per droplet, and the heterogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficient, Jhet, as a function as a function of T and water activity (aw), where in equilibrium RH=aw. Previous studies reporting frozen fractions (f) or Jhet for a droplet population are described by our model for mineral, inorganic, organic, and biological ice nuclei and different techniques including cold stage, oil-immersion, continuous flow diffusion chamber, flow tube, cloud chamber, acoustic levitation and wind levitation experiments. Taking advantage of the physically based parameterization of Jhet by Knopf and Alpert (Faraday Discuss., 165, 513-534, 2013), our model can predict immersion freezing for the entire atmospherically relevant range of T, RH, particle surface area, and time scales, even for conditions unattainable in a laboratory setting. Lastly, we present a rigorous experimental uncertainty analysis using a Monte Carlo method of laboratory derived Jhet and f. These results imply that classical nucleation theory is universal for immersion freezing. In combination with a aw based description of Jhet, this approach allows for a physically based and computational little demanding implementation in climate and cloud models.",

            "abstract": "Restoration of Chinook salmon and steelhead is a priority in the Sacramento River Basin since they were listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1989 and 1998, respectively. Construction of Shasta Dam and Reservoir obstructed fish migration, resulting in severe population declines. Efforts have been undertaken to restore the fisheries, including evaluation of opportunities for reintroducing Chinook salmon upstream of the dam and providing juvenile fish passage downstream past Shasta Dam. Shasta Reservoir and the Sacramento River and McCloud River tributaries have been modeled with CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) to assess hydrodynamic and temperature conditions with and without surface curtains to be deployed in the tributaries. Expected head-of-reservoir tributary conditions of temperature and water depth are being simulated under dry, median and wet year conditions. Model output is analyzed during months of downstream migration of fish from upstream Sacramento and McCloud River tributaries. W2 will be used to determine presence of favorable conditions for juvenile rearing with proposed surface temperature curtains. Evaluation of favorable conditions for fish includes assessment of water temperature, velocities, and depth. Preliminary results for head-of-reservoir conditions and the influence of temperature curtains modeled with W2 will be presented. Study findings may assist in formulation of juvenile fish passage alternatives for Shasta Lake.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice thickness is a fundamental climate state variable. However, observations of ice thickness have been sparse in time and space making the construction of observation-based time series difficult. Moreover, different groups use a variety of methods and processing procedures to measure ice thickness and each observational source likely has different and poorly characterized measurement and sampling biases. Observational sources include upward looking sonars mounted on submarines or moorings, electromagnetic sensors on helicopters or aircraft, and lidar or radar altimeters on airplanes or satellites. Are these data sources now adequate so that we can construct time series of the mean sea ice thickness with meaningful information about thickness changes? How do the different measurement systems compare in the mean? Are there systematic differences? Very few of the observations provide overlapping measurements of ice of a variety of thickness classes or types for direct comparisons. Error characteristics may vary considerably depending on the presence or thickness of the ridged ice. Here we use a curve-fitting approach to evaluate the systematic differences between eight different observation systems in the Arctic Basin, including ICESat and IceBridge measurements. The approach determines the large-scale spatial and temporal variability of the ice thickness as well as the mean differences between the observation systems using over 3000 estimates of the ice thickness. The thickness estimates are measured over spatial scales of approximately 50 km or time scales of 1 month and the primary time period analyzed is 2000–2013 when the modern mix of observations is available. Good agreement is found between five of the systems, within 0.15 m, while systematic differences of up to 0.5 m are found for three others compare to the five. The annual mean ice thickness for the central Arctic Basin based on observations only has decreased from 3.45 m in 1975 to 1.11 m in 2013, a 68% reduction and there is no indication it may be leveling off as seen in an earlier study of submarine ice drafts by Rothrock et al. (2008). This is nearly double the 36% decline report by them. These results provide additional direct observational confirmation of sea ice losses found in model reanalyses.",

            "abstract": "Miniature multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to directly sample the lower atmosphere over land and over the ocean in the vicinity of ships or shorelines. These UAVs are generally inexpensive and easy to operate. The author used the InstantEye quad-rotor UAV, manufactured by Physical Sciences Inc., as a test platform for meteorological measurements. In this case, the atmospheric sensor was the RS-92 radiosonde manufactured by Vaisala Inc. The author will present quantitative results of several experiments performed over land at Camp Roberts, California in which the InstantEye with radiosonde sensors was flown alongside a calibrated meteorological tower, thus allowing the accuracy of the UAV measurements to be quantified. Measurements near the surface were most strongly affected by turbulent fluctuations during sunny, low wind days over a dry surface. The rotor wash (1) provides sensor aeration which counteracts radiation contamination effects (2) creates a dynamic pressure effect in lowest 1.5 m and (3) moves air from a different level (1 - 2 m). Horizontal motion of the UAV had little effect on the measurements. The accuracy of the mean temperature measurements in the surface layer during unstable conditions was estimated to be 0.2 to 0.3 C, if samples are taken for at least one minute, except in the lowest 1.5 m above the surface, where rotor wash effects brought hot surface air to the sensors, degrading the accuracy. Above the turbulent surface layer, the temperature measurements approached a 0.1 C accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Field- and seismic-reflection-based studies have documented the influence of pre-existing thrust faults on normal-fault development during subsequent extension. Published experimental (analog) models of shortening followed by extension with dry sand as the modeling medium show limited extensional reactivation of moderate-angle thrust faults (dipping > 40º). These dry sand models provide insight into the influence of pre-existing thrusts on normal-fault development, but these models have not reactivated low-angle (< 35º) thrust faults as seen in nature. New experimental (analog) models, using wet clay over silicone polymer to simulate brittle upper crust over ductile lower crust, suggest that low-angle thrust faults from an older shortening phase can reactivate as normal faults.\nIn two-phase models of shortening followed by extension, normal faults nucleate above pre-existing thrust faults and likely link with thrusts at depth to create listric faults, movement on which produces rollover folds. Faults grow and link more rapidly in two-phase than in single-phase (extension-only) models. Fewer faults with higher displacements form in two-phase models, likely because, for a given displacement magnitude, a low-angle normal fault accommodates more horizontal extension than a high-angle normal fault. The resulting rift basins are wider and shallower than those forming along high-angle normal faults.\nFeatures in these models are similar to natural examples. Seismic-reflection profiles from the outer Hebrides, offshore Scotland, show listric faults partially reactivating pre-existing thrust faults with a rollover fold in the hanging wall; in crystalline basement, the thrust is reactivated, and in overlying sedimentary strata, a new, high-angle normal fault forms. Profiles from the Chignecto subbasin of the Fundy basin, offshore Canada, show full reactivation of thrust faults as low-angle normal faults where crystalline basement rocks make up the footwall.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean displays a zonal dipole (wavenumber one) pattern in sea surface temperature (SST), with a cool zonal anomaly in the Atlantic and Indian sectors and a warm zonal anomaly in the Pacific sector, associated with the large northward excursion of the Malvinas and southeastward flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). To the north of the cool Indian sector is the warm, narrow Agulhas Return Current (ARC). Air-sea heat flux is largely the inverse of this SST pattern, with ocean heat gain in the Atlantic/Indian, cooling in the southeastward-flowing ARC, and cooling in the Pacific, based on adjusted fluxes from the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE), a ⅙° eddy permitting model constrained to all available in situ data. This heat flux pattern is dominated by turbulent heat loss from the ocean (latent and sensible), proportional to perturbations in the difference between SST and surface air temperature, which are maintained by ocean advection. Locally in the Indian sector, intense heat loss along the ARC is contrasted by ocean heat gain of 0.11 PW south of the ARC. The IPCC AR5 50 year depth-averaged 0-700 m temperature trend shows surprising similarities in its spatial pattern, with upper ocean warming in the ARC contrasted by cooling to the south. Using diagnosed heat budget terms from the most recent (June 2014) 6-year run of the SOSE we find that surface cooling in the ARC is balanced by heating from south-eastward advection by the current whereas heat gain in the ACC is balanced by cooling due to northward Ekman transport driven by strong westerly winds. These results suggest that spatial patterns in multi-decadal upper ocean temperature trends depend on regional variations in upper ocean dynamics.",

In situ observations of snow cover extent, since the 1960s and satellite measurement of surface albedo during the last decade, both suggest that the glaciers and snow pack in the region have gradually retreated, accompanied by surface warming of about 2.5ºC observed over the peak altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. To-date none of the climate models have simulated either the record surface warming or its anomalously strong altitude dependence.\nUsing a high-resolution (100 km) ocean-atmosphere global climate model and an observationally constrained black carbon (BC) forcing that is about a factor of 2.5 larger than the IPCC-model forcing values, we reproduce the observed altitude dependence of warming trends and the spatial pattern of reductions in snow depths and snow cover extent. We conclude that BC aerosols, by direct atmospheric heating and deposition on the snow surface, play a major role in causing the trends, especially the vertical gradient of temperature change and a decrease in the snow cover. Despite the fact that CO2 effects on global mean warming are five times larger, BC has a disproportionately stronger effect on climate change over the elevated Himalayan/Tibetan region and its impact needs to be properly accounted for in future regional climate projections. The findings also provide practical intervention options for slowing down the dramatic changes over the Third Pole.",

We first characterize the errors in the conventional 1-2 days EOP predictions available through the IERS Bulletin A, and assess the impact of these errors on GPS orbit determination accuracy and on other key performance metrics.

            "abstract": "Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) is a thermally unstable reservoir for NOx that allows NOx to be transported large distances, enabling ozone formation far downwind from the original source. Sources of PAN precursors include anthropogenic combustion, biomass burning, lightning and biogenic emissions. PAN chemistry plays a key role in determining the global ozone distribution. Until now, available measurements have been sparse and generally limited to intensive field campaigns.\nThe Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), flying on the NASA Aura satellite, provides measurements of a range of trace gases that have spectral features in the thermal infrared, including ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and PAN. PAN can be retrieved from TES spectra for cases where the volume mixing ratio is above ~0.2 ppbv [Payne et al., 2014].\nIn this work, we present TES retrievals of PAN and CO in the tropics over the ten-year lifetime of the Aura mission. The TES PAN dataset offers an unprecedented insight into the inter-annual variability of PAN in the tropics. We compare TES retrievals of PAN, CO and O3 in the tropics to simulations from the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model for austral spring (peak burning season) of selected years. In the tropics, GEOS-Chem predicts that the dominant sources of PAN are biomass burning and lightning. The version of GEOS-Chem used in this work has been specifically updated to improve the simulation of PAN [Fischer et al., 2014]. Similarities and differences between the TES measurements and the GEOS-Chem simulations are used to infer causes of inter-annual variability of tropical ozone.\n",

            "abstract": "Observed electron velocity distributions in the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind exhibit a variety of non-thermal features which deviate from thermal equilibrium, for example, in the form of temperature anisotropies, suprathermal tail extensions, and field aligned beams. The state close to thermal equilibrium and its departure from it provides a source for spontaneous emissions of electromagnetic fluctuations, such as the whistler. Here we present a comparative analysis of whistler-cyclotron fluctuations based upon anisotropic plasma modeled with Maxwellian and Tsallis kappa-like particle distributions, to explain the correspondence relationship of the magnetic fluctuations as a function of the electron temperature and thermal anisotropy in the solar wind and magnetosphere plasmas. The analysis presented here considers correlation theory of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and the dispersion relation of transverse fluctuations, with wave vectors parallel to the uniform background magnetic field, in a finite temperature anisotropic thermal bi-Maxwellian and non-thermal Tsallis-kappa-like magnetized electron-proton plasma. Dispersion analysis and stability thresholds are derived for these thermal and non-thermal distributions using plasma and field parameters relevant to the solar wind and magnetosphere environments. Our results indicate that there is an enhancement of the fluctuations level in the case of non-thermal distributions due to the effective higher-temperature and the excess of suprathermal particles. These results suggest that a comparison of the electromagnetic fluctuations due to thermal and non-thermal distributions provides a diagnostic signature by which inferences about the nature of the particle velocity distribution function can be ascertained without in-situ particle measurements.",

            "abstract": "Sea Surface Temperature (SST) measured from satellites has been playing a crucial role in understanding geophysical phenomena. Generating SST Climate Data Records (CDRs) is considered to be the one that imposes the most stringent requirements on data accuracy. For infrared SSTs, sampling uncertainties caused by cloud presence and persistence generate errors. In addition, for sensors with narrow swaths, the swath gap will act as another sampling error source. This study is concerned with quantifying and understanding such sampling errors, which are important for SST CDR generation and for a wide range of satellite SST users. In order to quantify these errors, a reference Level 4 SST field (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution SST) is sampled by using realistic swath and cloud masks of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR). Global and regional SST uncertainties are studied by assessing the sampling error at different temporal and spatial resolutions (7 spatial resolutions from 4 kilometers to 5.0° at the equator and 5 temporal resolutions from daily to monthly). Global annual and seasonal mean sampling errors are large in the high latitude regions, especially the Arctic, and have geographical distributions that are most likely related to stratus clouds occurrence and persistence. The region between 30°N and 30°S has smaller errors compared to higher latitudes, except for the Tropical Instability Wave area, where persistent negative errors are found. Important differences in sampling errors are also found between the broad and narrow swath scan patterns and between day and night fields. This is the first time that realistic magnitudes of the sampling errors are quantified. Future improvement in the accuracy of SST products will benefit from this quantification.",

            "abstract": "In volcanically and seismically active rift systems, pre-existing faults can play a significant role in the development of a volcanic complex, ultimately providing high permeability pathways that magma, hydrothermal fluids and gas can ascend to the surface. The Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) provides an ideal natural laboratory to investigate how pre-existing structures influence active volcanic processes because it hosts a number of young volcanic complexes within an active extensional tectonic setting. In this presentation we bring together observations from new high spatial resolution airborne imagery, field campaigns and CO2 degassing surveys to examine how magma, hydrothermal fluid and gas pathways are coupled to the major structural features on Aluto, a typical young silicic volcanic complex of the MER. Digital mapping of the volcanic complex using new LiDAR DEMs (2-m pixel) reveal that a significant number of lava flow vents and explosion craters on Aluto may be linked to a structural control by either rift-aligned faults that dissect the complex or a volcanic ring fracture. Mapping of surface hydrothermal alteration with aerial photos (<1-m pixel) constrains the location of geothermal fluid upwellings and confirms their links to the main structures. Results of volcanic CO2 degassing surveys also confirm elevated fluxes (>>100 g m-2 d-1) along major faulting and volcanic structures. There are, however, significant variations in CO2 flux along the fault zones, which can be linked to differences in near surface permeability caused by changes in topography and surface lithology. Overall these different observations of how lava, hydrothermal fluids and gas reach the surface are complementary and provide a strong case for the overarching structural controls on volcanic fluid pathways at present and throughout the evolution of the complex.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface biogeochemical cycling at the field-scale is controlled by a complex interplay between hydrological, geochemical and biological parameters. Mesoscale tank experiments can help to bridge the gap in complexity and understanding between well constrained batch and column experiments, and the interpretation of field data. In this contribution we present the results of a tank experiment investigating microbial sulfate reduction and inhibition in a porous media (20-30 mesh Ottawa sand). Microbial sulfate reduction is a process of wide biogeochemical significance, including in the context of oil reservoirs where the generation of sulfide can result in corrosion of steel infrastructure and additional downstream processing. Inhibition of sulfate reduction is therefore a high priority for this industry. Tracer experiments were conducted at the start and end of the experiment to constrain flow pathways and heterogeneities. The tank was inoculated with a San Francisco Bay mud/water enrichment utilizing acetate as the electron donor and continuous flow was initiated using bay-water with 10 mM acetate. Samples were taken from an array of 12 steel boreholes and showed spatiotemporal heterogeneities in the development of sulfidogenesis, reaching a peak of ~5 mM dissolved sulfide 71 days after inoculation. 10 mM perchlorate was then added to the influent to inhibit sulfidogenesis and dissolved sulfide decreased to ~0.03 mM by day 95. Stable isotope analysis of dissolved sulfate showed an increase in δ34S by ~10‰ compared with influent values but δ34S did not return to influent values by day 95, which may be indicative of the mixing between new and residual sulfate in the tank. Ongoing microbial community analyses are being used to help constrain microbial metabolisms. Finally, all the data is being integrated into a reactive transport model to better constrain the observed interplay between hydrology, geochemistry and biology.",

Consequently, these Earth-like simulations conform to the intuition developed over the last 50 years of observational analysis: tropical cyclones preferentially occur in low latitude, warm regions.\nHere, we will present the results of high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model simulations in climatic regimes that are vastly different than Earth's by idealizing the boundary conditions and forcing. When the solar radiation and ocean heat transport are pushed to un-Earthlike distributions to probe a wider range of climatic regimes, the simulated tropical cyclone distribution can have surprising features. In particular, tropical cyclones may be more prevalent in the extratropics and may be more prevalent in the colder hemisphere of the simulated climate. The results of these simulations suggest that an understanding of the environmental parameters controlling tropical cyclones requires a broader perspective than that offered by Earth's current climate.",

            "abstract": "We present new ice-thickness constraints from the Pirrit Hills, a small, far-flung group of nunataks located in the Weddell Sector. At the Pirrit Hills, fresh glacial erratics indicate ice levels ~350-450 m above present during the last ice age. The highest erratics have preliminary 10Be exposure ages of ~16 ka, and the ages generally decrease with decreasing elevation, recording the thinning of the ice in the region. Despite the evidence of thicker ice, weathered bedrock extends down to the present ice level, implying prolonged subaerial weathering prior to the last ice age. These features, and the lack of evidence for wet-based glacial erosion, indicate cold-based and non-erosive ice cover. Over the elevation range in which we found glacial erratics, bedrock 10Be, 26Al, and 21Ne concentrations are consistent with modest ice cover, and have exposure ages ranging from ~0.3-1.5 Myr.\nAround 450 m above the present ice level, bedrock 10Be, 26Al, and 21Ne concentrations increase by a factor of ~4-5 and do not indicate past ice cover. This height coincides with a break in the otherwise steep slopes of the Pirrit Hills, and the bedrock above is more weathered than the bedrock below. This transition marks the height above which ice cover, if it has occurred in the past few million years, has been very rare, brief, and cold-based. This feature may relate to the trimline imprinted on ridges in the Ellsworth Mountains. In both cases, alpine landscapes have been preserved by a polar climate and glacial highstands rising only partway up the mountain flanks.",

            "abstract": "Smectite has been detected as layered material hundreds of meters thick, in intracrater depositional fans, in plains sediments, and deposits at depth on Mars. If early Mars hosted a dense CO2 atmosphere, then extensive carbonate should have formed in the neutral/alkaline conditions expected for smectite formation. However, large carbonate deposits on Mars have not been discovered. Instead of neutral to moderately alkaline conditions, early Mars may have experienced mildly acidic conditions that allowed for Fe/Mg smectite formation but prevented widespread carbonate formation. The objective of this work is to demonstrate that Fe(II)/Mg-saponite and nontronite can form in mildly acidic solutions (e.g., pH 4). Synthetic basaltic glass (< 53 µm) of Adirondack rock class composition was exposed to pH 4 (acetic acid buffer) and N2 purged (anoxic) solutions amended with 0 and 10 mM Mg or Fe(II). Basaltic glass in these solutions was heated to 200ºC in batch reactors for 1, 7, and 14 days. X-ray diffraction analysis of reacted materials detected the presence of phyllosilicates as indicated by a ~15.03-15.23Ǻ (001) peak. Smectite was confirmed as the phyllosilicate after treatments with glycerol and KCl and heating to 550°C. Trioctahedral saponite was confirmed by the presence of a 4.58 to 4.63 Ǻ (02l) and 1.54Ǻ (060) peaks. Saponite concentration was highest, as indicated by XRD peak intensity, in the 10 mM Mg treatment followed by the 0 mM and then 10 mM Fe(II) treatments. This order of sapontite concentration suggests that Fe(II) additions may have a role in slowing the kinetics of saponite formation relative to the other treatments. Nontronite synthesis was attempted by exposing Adirondack basaltic glass to pH 4 oxic solutions (without N2 purge) at 200ºC for 14 days. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that mixtures of trioctahedral (saponite) and dioctahedral (nontronite) may have formed in these experiments based on the 02l and 060 peaks. Mössbauer analysis coupled with future experiments are planned to verify if nontronite can be formed under mildly acidic and oxic conditions. Results of this work demonstrate that acidic conditions could have occurred on an early Mars, which allowed for smectite formation but inhibited carbonate formation. ",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are often represented crudely in global models. We have implemented three new detailed SOA treatments within the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) that allow us to compare the semi-volatile versus non-volatile SOA treatments (based on some of the latest experimental findings) and also investigate the effects of gas-phase fragmentation reactions. For semi-volatile SOA treatments, fragmentation reactions decrease simulated SOA burden from 7.5 Tg to 1.8 Tg. For the non-volatile SOA treatment (with fragmentation), the burden is 3.1 Tg. Larger differences between non-volatile and semi-volatile SOA (upto a factor of 5) correspond to continental outflow over the oceans. Compared to a global dataset of surface Aerosol Mass Spectrometer measurements and the US IMPROVE network measurements, the non-volatile SOA with fragmentation treatment (FragNVSOA) agrees best at rural locations. Urban SOA is under-predicted but this may be due to the coarse model resolution. Our revised treatments show much better agreement with aircraft measurements of organic aerosols (OA) over the N. American Arctic and sub-Arctic in spring and summer, compared to the standard CAM5 formulation. This is due to treating SOA precursor gases from biomass burning, and long-range transport of biomass burning OA at elevated levels (also supported by satellite data), which undergoes less wet removal compared to the surface OA sources in the standard CAM5. Although the total simulated OA from biomass burning agrees better with aircraft measurements, recent field observations typically report lower SOA formation, suggesting that constraining the POA-SOA split from biomass burning should be the focus of future studies. The non-volatile and semi-volatile configurations predict the direct radiative forcing of SOA as -0.5 W m-2 and -0.26 W m-2 respectively, at top of the atmosphere, which are higher than previously estimated by most models, but in reasonable agreement with a recent constrained modeling study.",

            "abstract": "Wind is air in motion and stress is the momentum exchange between ocean and atmosphere. While the strong wind of a tropical cyclone (TC) causes destruction at landfall, it is the surface stress that drags down the TC. The relations that were established to retrieve moderate wind speeds from the normalized radar cross-section, or backscatter power, measured by Ku-band and C-band scatterometers do not apply well to TC-scale winds. It has been difficult to establish new relations at strong winds because credible strong winds coincident with scatterometer measurements are not sufficient. We will give credence to our hypothesis that there is no distinct physics of radar backscatter from ocean surface for weather phenomenon like the TC. The relation between backscatter and surface roughness or stress does not change under TC, and the same retrieval algorithm can be extended to the TC. The need for changes in wind retrieval algorithm is explained through the change of the drag coefficient that relates wind to stress in TC. We aspire to separate the sensor parameters that affect backscatter, such as, incident angle, azimuth angle, polarization and backscatter frequencies, from the secondary factors related to the physics of the air-sea interface and turbulent transport, such as air stability (shear and buoyance), air density, sea states, and sea sprays, so that we can establish a simple approximation of surface stress from the backscatter averaged over the relevant spatial and temporal scales. We established a relation between backscatter and surface stress over a moderate range of wind speed, where wind measurements coincident with satellite observations are abundant, and the drag coefficient is well established to convert wind measurements to stress. This relation is applied to retrieve stress from the scatterometer measurement in the high wind range of TC. The characteristic of the drag coefficient in TC-scale winds will be discussed. The difference between wind and stress in a TC will be demonstrated.",

            "abstract": "The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) has observed the interstellar neutral (ISN) gas flow over the past 6 years during the winter/spring when the Earth’s motion opposes the ISN flow direction. Since IBEX observes near the perihelion of the interstellar atom trajectories, we are able to use an analytical model (Lee et al. 2012) based upon orbital mechanics to determine characteristics of the interstellar flow. The interstellar inflow latitude, velocity, and temperature are coupled to the inflow longitude and are restricted by the IBEX observations to a narrow valley in this parameter space (McComas et al. 2012). In our original analysis we found that the small spacecraft spin axis pointing out of the ecliptic plane had a significant influence on the determination of the ISN inflow vector (Möbius et al. 2012; Bzowski et al. 2012). Introducing the spacecraft spin axis tilt into the analytical model has shown that IBEX observations with various spin axis tilt orientations can help restrict the natural degeneracy of the ISN flow parameters as a function of inflow longitude. The IBEX operations team was able to successfully point the spin axis to be in the ecliptic during the 2012 and 2013 seasons and about 5 degrees below the ecliptic during the 2014 season. With this robust data set we are able to further test and develop the analytical model while producing a more comprehensive analysis of the ISN Flow parameters. We found that in its current implementation the analytical model describes the ISN flow most precisely for the spin axis orientation exactly in the ecliptic. This analysis refines the derived ISN flow parameters with a possible reconciliation between velocity vectors found with IBEX and Ulysses, but at a substantially higher temperature than previously reported.",

However the limited network of PMC measurement sites in Kazakhstan (123 for the total area of 2. 7 million km2) does not allow a spatial assessment of drought conditions across the vast majority of the country. To assess the availability of soil moisture and the likelihood of drought, we calculated spatial structure of soil moisture deficit, using the Selyaninov Hydrothermal Coefficient (HTCs). It was derived for the vegetatively active period from May to August. Figure 1 shows the average structure of soil moisture availability across Kazakhstan, and indicates that most of the country is vulnerable to drought.\nIn response to this vulnerability the Kazakhstan also established the following policies and technologies to mitigate the impact of drought. Those measures include: 1. Introduction of resource-saving (soil-protective and moisture preserving) No-Till technologies. 2. Structural and technological diversification of plant growing. 3. Introduction of efficient irrigation systems for southern Kazakhstan. 4. Adaptation of weather and field reports to optimize the benefits of agrotechnical activities. 5. Re-equipment of agricultural vehicles and machinery. 6. Training and professional development of specialists in agriculture. 7. Improvement of insurance system for plant growing. 8. Improvement of systems and mechanisms of state support for small and medium agricultural producers. 9. Improvement of the system of scientific and technological and innovative support for grain production.\nThese strategies, how they are being implemented, and the targeted goals will be presented. We will provide findings from experimental field stations, and model farms. The goals is to improve efficiency in water resources, effectively communication relevant information to farmers, policy makers and the insurance industry, as well as promote climate resilience in the advent of climate change.",

We first simulated the satellite brightness temperatures using radiosonde profiles and a radiative transfer model then carefully collocated simulated and observed satellite brightness temperatures. We partitioned the data into daytime and nighttime to evaluate the daytime radiation bias then separately evaluated the statistics for each sensor type. The error characteristics among different radiosondes vary significantly, which largely reflects the differences in sensor type. These differences are more evident in the mid-upper troposphere than in the lower troposphere, mainly because some of the sensors stop responding to tropospheric humidity somewhere in the upper or even in the middle troposphere.",

            "abstract": "Couplings between large and small scales in solar wind turbulence are further complicated by the expansion, which acts at all scales and directly influences the particle thermodynamics. We present 2-D hybrid simulations of kinetic turbulence, including the effects of radial expansion by means of the hybrid expanding model (HEB). We investigate properties of the cascade first in standard hybrid simulations and then we analyze the effects of a slow expansion on the turbulent spectrum (spectral break, residual energy, cross-helicity). Incoherent spectra of balanced and inbalanced counter-propagating Alfvén waves are taken as initial conditions and the dependence on the plasma beta and the amplitude of fluctuations is investigated. We focus on the properties of the ion parallel and perpendicular heating driven by the turbulence, and on how this is modulated by the expansion. Turbulence shapes the properties of the plasma, generating local temperature anisotropy in the distribution functions, however the associated perpendicular heating and parallel cooling are not strong enough to counteract the expansion-driven anisotropic cooling. As a consequence, the plasma is driven towards the fire hose instability threshold with increasing heliocentric distance, in agreement with solar wind observations. Once the plasma enters into the fire hose unstable region, electromagnetic fluctuations driven by the ion temperature anisotropy are generated on top of the background turbulence. Despite the configuration of our simulations - out-of-plane mean magnetic field - which allows for the growth of only a subset of fire hose fluctuations, these waves are able to locally scatter the protons and partially reduce their unstable temperature anisotropy. Our findings show that kinetic instabilities driven by anisotropic distributions, like fire hose, can play a role also in turbulent and inhomogeneous plasmas, and suggest that these mechanisms are at work in the solar wind expansion.",

In some cases, local and long-range smoke transported to the Arctic has already increased aerosol concentrations twofold, which previous studies suggest could have a large effect on cloud microphysics, lifetime, albedo, and precipitation. However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly understood, in part due to the confounding influence of varying meteorological and surface conditions. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic (the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites-B campaign (ARCTAS-B), the Indirect and Semi-Direct Aerosol Campaign (ISDAC), and the First ISCCP Regional Experiment Arctic Clouds Experiment (FIRE.ACE)) to compare cloud microphysics in liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds sampled at similar temperature and pressure in the presence and absence of biomass burning smoke. Care is taken to place findings in context of meteorological conditions. Preliminary data from the ARCTAS-B campaign suggest a noticeable impact of smoke on cloud properties in the liquid phase, consistent with the Twomey effect (smaller cloud droplet radius), and greater liquid water path and estimated cloud optical depth. Continuing work involves using the combination of field cases and satellite data from MISR, MODIS, CALIPSO, and other sources to more fully characterize the impact of smoke on Arctic clouds.",

While hillslope and fluvial transport models have been combined with digital topography to develop proxies for erosion rates, debris flow networks, despite their ubiquity, have not been exploited for this purpose. This represents a major gap in our current ability to estimate landscape erosion from digital elevation models. In order to bridge this gap, we apply a previously proposed empirical function (Stock et al., 2003) that describes the variation of valley slope with drainage area in fluvial and debris flow reaches of steepland channel networks. We use high-resolution 1m airborne laser altimetry data for several catchments across the Oregon Coast Range to explore variation in the model parameters, chiefly the rate with which concavity decreases in the upstream direction. Our analysis documents variations in model parameters that result from differences in network geometry, scale, lithology, and the pace of base level lowering. Finally, we propose a function that relates these parameters to erosion rates acquired via cosmogenic nuclides for numerous catchments in the Oregon Coast Range.",

This property of fully saturated mirror modes is often referred to as bi-stability in the literature. We investigated mirror structures of this form observed by Cluster spacecraft focusing on the width and and magnitude of the \"low field\" and \"high field\" areas. In a statistical study it was observed that the plasma in the high field areas is usually stable or marginally stable with respect to mirror instability, but plasma corresponding to the low field level is unstable. The relative width of the low and high field areas is thus proportional to the degree of instability of the plasma. This relationship appears to be a generalization of the previously described association between mirror mode shape and distance to mirror instability threshold, where mirror \"dips\" (localized drops in field magnitude) are favored in stable plasma, and mirror \"peaks\" (localized field increases) occur in unstable plasmas. The spatial scale and geometry of the structures has also been investigated and compared to mirror instability theory. It is shown that the areas of low magnetic field level and unstable plasma are usually comparable or smaller than the mirror mode wavelength, indicating fully saturated state where the mirror instability is no longer efficient.",

            "abstract": "In partially saturated porous media, the spatial distribution of wetting (e.g., water) and non-wetting (e.g., air) phases causes the liquid flow to be focused onto narrow and complex flow paths, leaving large volumes of wetting fluid trapped in between non-wetting phase clusters. The impact of the resulting highly heterogeneous wetting fluid velocity distributions on the dispersion and mixing of a solute in this wetting phase is critical for predicting reactive transport processes that take place in partially saturated porous media. We study the dependence of dispersion and mixing on the saturation degree using a 2D experimental setup consisting of cylindrical grains built using soft lithography. The joint injection of the two phases (wetting and non-wetting) provides a controlled homogeneous saturation in the medium. The simultaneous measurement of the flow velocity field, the spatial distribution of the wetting and non-wetting phases, and the tracer concentration field are used to investigate the relationship between the flow field complexity induced by desaturation and dispersion/mixing properties.\nWe analyze the temporal behavior of the mean concentration gradient and the scalar dissipation rate, which quantify the temporal variation of the concentration variability and the potential for mixing-controlled chemical reactivity. The formation of preferential flowpaths in unsaturated flows is found to have an important impact on the mixing behavior. While the mean concentration gradient decays in time for saturated flow following the classical diffusive smoothing of concentration gradients, the creation of highly channelized finger structures in unsaturated flows induces persistently large concentration gradients which decay slowly in time. The highly resolved concentration field images show that this effect is due to i) a drastic increase of the surface available for creating concentration gradients across the finger boundaries, ii) the existence of dead-ends with a wide range of sizes, and iii) the recursive coalescence of tracer fingers at critical bottle necks formed between air clusters. These results suggest that large concentration gradients may persist over a broad range of times in unsaturated media thus affecting the reactivity of hydrological systems.",

This study is motivated by the results from the CRRES mission, which revealed a local maximum in the electric field developing near Earth during storm times, rather than the expected enhancement at higher L shells that is shielded near Earth. The CRRES observations were limited to the dusk side, while THEMIS provides complete local time coverage. We show strong agreement with the CRRES results on the dusk side, with a local maximum near L = 4 for moderate levels of geomagnetic activity and evidence of strong electric fields inside L = 3 during the most active times. The extensive dataset from THEMIS also confirms the day/night asymmetry on the dusk side, where the enhancement is closest to Earth in the dusk-midnight sector, and is farther away closer to noon. A similar, but smaller in magnitude, local maximum is observed on the dawn side near L = 4. The noon sector shows the smallest average electric fields, and for more active times, the enhancement develops near L = 7 rather than L = 4.",

            "abstract": "The northern San Andreas fault system NW of Clear Lake, CA is comprised of the subparallel San Andreas, Maacama, and Bartlett Springs faults. The dominant geodetic signal across the region is right lateral shear strain largely accommodated by infrequent earthquakes on these three faults and creep on the upper 5 km of the latter two. Here we use a newly densified Global Positioning System (GPS) velocity field (Murray et al., 2014) to assess the existence of regional contraction/extension. If present, the degree to which this deformation contributes to oblique slip in future earthquakes or, conversely, is partitioned into off-fault strain has implications for anticipated ground motions and inferred on-fault and off-fault moment deficit rates used in seismic hazard assessment.\nWe inspect the observed horizontal GPS velocity field in a Sierra Nevada-Great Valley (SNGV) fixed frame. To first order the maximum contractile strain rate axis is well-aligned with the maximum compressive stress orientation (Provost and Houston, 2003). Although observed velocities at coastal sites compared to those on the SNGV block show little net strain perpendicular to the direction of Pacific-SNGV relative motion, velocity profiles transecting the three faults show both contraction and extension perpendicular to relative plate motion within the zone between the Great Valley and the coast.\nTo evaluate this signal in the context of fault slip, we consider the residual fault-perpendicular velocity after removing predicted velocities due to the strike-slip component of estimated creep and interseismic locking (Murray et al., 2014). The slip rate model accounts for the fact that the orientations of the three major faults vary along their lengths, the faults are neither uniformly parallel to each other nor to the relative plate motion direction, and strike-slip creep rates vary along strike. In many locations near-fault residual strain rates are small, suggesting geometry and non-uniform creep rates can account for much of the observed fault normal motion. Localized residual strain near faults and broader patterns in off-fault regions persist. Ongoing work is focused on comparison of geodetic strain rates, focal mechanisms, and topography to better characterize possible partitioning of shear and contraction/extension within the region.",

            "abstract": "The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is a vital ecosystem engineer species, providing a number of ecosystem services that structure and maintain estuarine environments through the construction of large, hard-bottom reef complexes. Through suspension feeding, oysters clear the water column of particulates, leading to decreased suspended material and enhanced benthic pelagic coupling. Past field studies have indicated the potential importance of the physical reef structure in regulating the transfer of particulate material in the seston. In order to directly assess the existence of the physical reef effect, multiple field experiments were performed in a small tidal creek estuary along the south eastern coast of North Carolina. Comparison of clearance rates derived from two different in situ methods, one accounting for the physical structure of the oyster reef in addition to oyster filtration and one looking at oyster filtration alone, indicate that the reef structure may increase the amount of particulate removal performed by the reef by more than 4 times the removal performed by oyster filtration alone. A defaunation experiment was performed by eliminating the live component of the oyster reef and comparing particulate transfer of this defaunated transect to that of an adjacent faunated transect. The defaunated transect had reduced but not significantly lower material removal when compared to the faunated transect prior to defaunation. Results from short and long term sediment collection and flow velocity measurements indicate that the physical effect of oyster reefs is strong over short temporal scales (days) but is much smaller when evaluated over longer time periods (months). Generally, large silt and small sand sized material is permanently removed from the seston due to the interaction of oyster reef structure and tidal flows, however the transfer of small and medium sized silt grains is only slowed down by the presence of large reef complexes. This effect has important ecological implications for downstream water quality and must be accounted for when modeling water quality improvements performed by oysters.",

            "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOC) are oxidized in the atmosphere and their products contribute to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. These particles have been shown to have effects on visibility, climate, and human health. Current models typically under-predict SOA concentrations from field measurements. Underestimation of these concentrations could be a result of how models treat particle growth. It is often assumed that particles grow via instantaneous thermal equilibrium partitioning between liquid particles and gas-phase species.  Recent work has shown that growth may be better represented by irreversible, kinetically limited uptake of gas-phase species onto more viscous, tar-like SOA.  However, uptake coefficients for these processes are not known. The goal of this project is to measure uptake coefficients and solubilities for different gases onto models serving as proxies for SOA and determine how they vary based on the chemical composition of the gas and the condensed phase. Experiments were conducted using two approaches: attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and a flow system coupled to a mass spectrometer. The ATR crystal was coated with the SOA proxy and the gas-phase species introduced via a custom flow system. Uptake of the gas-phase species was characterized by measuring the intensity of characteristic IR bands as a function of time, from which a Henry’s law constant and initial estimate of uptake coefficients could be obtained. Uptake coefficients were also measured in a flow system where the walls of the flow tube were coated with the SOA proxy and gas-phase species introduced via a moveable inlet. Uptake coefficients were derived from the decay in gas-phase species measured by mass spectrometry. The results of this work will establish a structure-interaction relationship for uptake of gases into SOA that can be implemented into regional and global models.",

            "abstract": "To better understand sources of uncertainty in modeled terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks, we present an approach to separate the controls on productivity-driven from turnover-driven equilibrium carbon changes of both vegetation and decomposing carbon pools for a set of models participating in the CMIP5 1%/yr CO2 ESM experiments. We find that changes to the live vegetation pools are primarily explained by productivity-driven changes to equilibrium carbon stocks, with only one model showing large compensating change to vegetation turnover times. The changes in vegetation turnover in response to global change that are projected arise mainly from changes to allocation and fire regimes. For the decomposing carbon pools, the situation is more complex as the production-driven changes are not independent from turnover-driven changes. This dependence arises from the multi-pool representation of decomposition in the models, in which respiration responds more rapidly to perturbations than C stocks, and thus leads to transient but long-lived reductions in turnover times in all models in response to increases in productivity. This mechanism, which we refer to as “tau compression”, masks much of the intrinsic response of turnover to changing climate. These patterns hold across the fully-coupled, biogeochemically-coupled, and radiatively-coupled experiments, demonstrating the importance of production changes in governing turnover changes, particularly for decomposing carbon pools, under global change scenarios.",

The most important atmospheric effect was the precipitation of atoms/molecules/ions, and especially atomic oxygen atoms and O\n+\nions. Although the main gas forming the corona of comets is H\n2\nO, the cometary coronal gas is partially ionized and dissociated by the EUV-XUV solar flux. To understand the atomic and molecular precipitation effects during such an encounter, it is therefore necessary to evaluate the flux of the neutral gas ejected from the comet, and to compute its composition after the dissociation/ionization.\nWe computed the photodissociation of the cometary gas for different solar conditions, and for the conditions of the comet encounter. In addition, using a pickup ion code, we computed the fluxes of the O\n+\nions accelerated by the solar wind at energies greated than a keV. Using the Planetocosmic model, we computed the ionization in the atmosphere of Mars due to these species, and, using the M-GITM model, we computed the associated increase of the ion/electron density.\nFor the first time, an estimate of the flux of energetic O\n+\nions picked up by the solar wind from the cometary coma is shown, with an increase of the O\n+\nflux above 50~keV by two orders of magnitude. While the ionization of Mars' upper atmosphere by precipitating O\n+\nions is expected to be negligible compared to solar EUV-XUV ionization, it is of the same order of magnitude at 110~km altitude during the cometary passage.\nThe present work will show both the theoretical results of the ion interaction with the upper atmosphere of Mars and the results of the observations.",

The effects of wildfire on carbon cycle processes, and particularly surface soil organic matter composition and post fire erosive redistribution is poorly understood. The recent Thompson Ridge wildfire event in 2013 in the Valles Caldera, part of the Jemez-Catalina Critical Zone Observatory, provides the opportunity to track post-fire changes in surface soil organic matter composition over time relative to pre-fire conditions. Here we applied thermal analyses to quantify changes in surface soil organic matter composition, with a focus on charred materials, across a range of hillslope and convergent landscape positions. It was hypothesized that the fraction of charred material would increase post-burn in all surface soils, with a subsequent decline in hillslope positions and a gain in convergent positions as surface material was eroded and deposited in water gathering portions of the landscape. Our results confirmed that charcoal increased directly after the fire in all samples, but a clear signal of erosive redistribution was not observed, suggesting that the movement of charcoal throughout a landscape is more complex than the simple hypothesis put forward here. Future work will expand the spatial distribution of samples in a systematic fashion that better captures variation in topography and erosive versus depositional areas of the landscape.",

A certain amount of iron, the most abundant transition metal element in the Earth’s interior, is expected to be incorporated into the phase D. Here we synthesized high-quality single-crystal Fe,Al-bearing Phase D (Mg0.89Fe0.11Al0.37Si1.55H2.65O6, ~13.3wt% H2O) with grain sizes of ~200 micron using the Kawai multianvil apparatus at 21 GPa and 1200 °C at the Institute for Study of the Earth’s Interior, University of Oakayama, Japan. Conventional Mössbauer results indicate that the sample contains both ferrous and ferric iron that occupy the octahedral sites of the hexagonal structure. In situ high-pressure single crystal XRD and NFS experiments were performed up to megabar pressures at 13IDD beamline (GSECARS) and 16IDD beamline (HPCAT) of the Advanced Photon Source, respectively. Both experimental results clearly show that both Fe2+ and Fe3+ undergo a HS-LS transition at high pressures. High-resolution XRD results further indicate an abnormal compression behavior at approximately 37 GPa that can be linked with the previously proposed hydrogen bond symmetrization. Elasticity of phase D has a marked influence by the two-step spin transitions of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ and the hydrogen bond symmetrization, presenting in the seismic wave model, which is of implication for our understanding of the deep-Earth geophysics and geochemistry especially along the subducted slabs.",

We are utilizing a 3-D finite-difference acoustic simulation code developed at Sandia that can accurately propagate noise in the complex bathymetry in the near-shore to open ocean environment. As part of our efforts to improve computation efficiency in the large, high-resolution domains required in this project, we investigate the effects of using optimized finite-difference coefficients on the accuracy of the simulations. We compare accuracy and runtime of various finite-difference coefficients optimized via criteria such as maximum numerical phase speed error, maximum numerical group speed error, and L-1 and L-2 norms of weighted numerical group and phase speed errors over a given spectral bandwidth. We find that those coefficients optimized for L-1 and L-2 norms are superior in accuracy to those based on maximal error and can produce runtimes of 10% of the baseline case, which uses Taylor Series finite-difference coefficients at the Courant time step limit. We will present comparisons of the results for the various cases evaluated as well as recommendations for utilization of the cases studied.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

Assuming that the ionospheric current systems result in homogeneous surface electromagnetic variations, the uncertainty of the computed surface electromagnetic impedance tensor depends only the duration of the EM observation. However the surface EM field can only be approached by plane waves in certain time periods and besides given uncertainty. The EM impedance may be sensitive to magnetospheric and -indirectly- interplanetary circumstances and solar activity.\nSix years continuous observation of telluric and surface geomagnetic components allowed to perform a representative survey to discover if geomagnetic activity has any effect on observed EM impedance tensor. Geomagnetic indices (Dst, ULF-index, ASY-H, SYM-H) have been used to classify dates according to geomagnetic activity. Processing to estimate the mean surface EM impedance tensor has been performed in each dataset, each class separately. The sensitivity and the characteristics of the answer of the EM impedance tensor to the geomagnetic disturbances seems to be definite.

Surface roughness affects the surface-atmospheric interactions (via the aerodynamic roughness length) and thus influences fluxes of sensible and latent heat at the ice sheet surface. When combined with near-infrared reflectance, surface roughness has been shown to discriminate between glacier zones. We present the first ever annual time series of Greenland ice sheet surface roughness derived from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) for the years 2000-2013. Our cloud-free multi-angular measurements are calibrated using airborne LiDAR data from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). Roughness values range from 10 cm in the dry, snow-covered interior of the ice sheet to over 8 m along the crevassed margins of the ice sheet. Roughness increases from April to July as the surface melts and glaciers become more active. Our roughness maps are restricted to spring and early summer due to limited ATM data. We next employed ISODATA unsupervised clustering with MISR near-infrared reflectance and surface roughness to map glacier zones on the ice sheet for years 2000-2013. The number and locations of the ISODATA-derived glacier zones are consistent from year to year with slight shifts in boundaries depending on the extent of early summer melt. These maps of Greenland ice surface roughness and glacier zones are the result of processing several hundred thousand MISR images and are the first ever full-coverage, annual maps of this kind.",

            "abstract": "Protons and alpha particles in the fast solar wind are only weakly collisional and exhibit a number of non-equilibrium features, including temperature anisotropies and relative drifts along the direction of the background magnetic field. Two mechanisms have been proposed for limiting differential flow between alpha particles and protons: plasma instabilities and the rotational force. Both mechanisms decelerate the alpha particles - for example, the Alfvén/ion-cyclotron and fast-magnetosonic/whistler instabilities limit the drift velocity to a value comparable to the Alfvén speed, which decreases with increasing heliocentric distance r. However, while plasma instabilities transform bulk-flow kinetic energy into heat and plasma waves, the rotational force does not.\nWe present an analytic expression for the rate Qflow at which energy is released when alpha particles are decelerated by instabilities. We find that Qflow becomes zero at a critical radius r=rcrit, where rcrit is between 1.5 AU and 2 AU in the fast solar wind in the ecliptic plane, and rcrit increases with increasing heliographic latitude. We show that instabilities control the deceleration of alpha particles at r<rcrit, and the rotational force controls the deceleration of alpha particles at r>rcrit. We compare the value of Qflow at r<rcrit with the empirical heating rates for protons and alpha particles deduced from in-situ measurements of fast-wind streams from the Helios and Ulysses spacecraft. We find that Qflow exceeds the empirical heating rate for alpha particles at r<1 AU.\nWe conclude that the continuous energy input from alpha-particle deceleration at r<rcrit makes a considerable contribution to the heating of the fast solar wind in addition to other local heating mechanisms such as the dissipation of waves and turbulence. We also discuss the implications of the alpha-particle drift for the azimuthal flow velocities of the ions and for the Parker spiral magnetic field.",

These pressures can be realized through the lens of water science, policy, geopolitics, food security, and even military conflicts. Combined with a boom in global population, these pressures provide wide-reaching problems that need to be addressed presently and in the future across many disciplines including the sciences, engineering, economics, and policy.\nThese issues lead to a complex system of problems that cannot be addressed without a multidisciplinary approach. As we enter a world where regions of water scarcity become the norm, water scientists and engineers need to be at the table - with experts in other fields - shaping solutions in the areas of policy, disaster response, and management.\nI will argue that, as early-career scientists, there are exciting new challenges that are open, or will be opening, to us as experts in our respective fields. I will also provide my insights and opinions as to what we can do to position ourselves to impact these issues. These beliefs form the basis of the \"Renaissance scientist,\" taking its name from the polymaths of the Renaissance and Enlightenment.

            "abstract": "The melt source and ascent mechanisms for crustal-scale silicic magmatism in subduction zones remain a matter of debate. Recent petrological-thermo-mechanical numerical experiments suggest that important physical controls of this process can be of sublithospheric origin. Firstly, deep sources of silicic magma can be related to episodic development of positively buoyant diapiric structures in the mantle wedge originated from deeply subducted rock mélanges (Gerya and Yuen, 2003; Castro and Gerya, 2008). Partial melting of these rapidly ascending lithologically mixed structures can produce silicic magmas with a relatively constant major element composition and variable time-dependent isotopic ratios inherited from the mélange (Vogt et al., 2013). Secondly, episodic injections of subduction-related mantle-derived mafic magmas into a partially molten hot zone of the arc lower crust can drive ascents of pre-existing felsic crustal magmas toward upper crustal levels. The injection of mafic magma induces overpressure in the lower crustal magma reservoir, which increases crustal stresses and triggers development of brittle/plastic fracture zones serving as conduits for the rapid episodic ascent of felsic magmas (Shubert et al., 2013). Our numerical results thus imply that subduction-related sublithospheric magma intrusions into the lower arc crust may both be the prime source for the generation of silicic magmas and the major physical driving mechanism for their episodic ascent toward upper crustal levels.\n",

Vegetated roofs also offer aesthetic benefits and increase the biodiversity of the urban environment, and are increasingly used in sustainable urban development.\nUnderstanding the thermal dynamics of vegetated roofs will make it possible to improve their design and to better assess their impacts on energy efficiency. Here, we evaluate the first vertical high-resolution distributed-temperature-sensing (DTS) system installed in a vegetated roof. This system allows a continuous measurement of the thermal profile within a vegetated roof – going from the interior, upward through the drainage layers and soil substrate of the vegetated roof and ending in the air above the vegetation. Temperatures can be observed as frequently as every 30 s at a spatial resolution on the order of centimeters. This DTS system was installed in the “Laboratory of Vegetal Infrastructure of Buildings” (LIVE – its acronym in Spanish), located in the San Joaquín Campus of the Pontifical Catholic University, Santiago, Chile. The laboratory features 18 experimental modules to investigate different configurations of the vegetated roof layers.\nThe LIVE was designed with the installation of the optical fibers in mind, and the DTS system allows simultaneous monitoring of three or four modules of the LIVE. In this work, we describe the design of this DTS deployment, the calibration metrics obtained using the software provided by the manufacturers, and other calibration algorithms previously developed. We compare the results obtained using single- and double-ended measurements, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of DTS methods. Finally, we present the observations obtained from this biophysical environment highlighting the features that are harder to observe using more traditional methods to measure temperature.",

It is critical to account for inhomogeneities and anisotropy in order to study such phenomena. The hierarchical tree model (Aurell 1994) is a class of dynamical systems that describe inhomogeneous turbulence as locally interacting elements in both wave number and real space using a discrete set of shell variables. The model efficiently calculates the evolution of disparate scales in the system ranging from mesoscale turbulence to large scale coherent structures. We extend the model to incorporate anisotropy and account for the interaction of turbulence with the emergent coherent structures that evolve self-consistently. We then apply the tree model to study the cascade of barotropic turbulence interacting with zonal jets on the beta plane.",

            "abstract": "The unexpected ribbon in the IBEX energetic neutral atom (ENA) maps is still far from understood. According to most models, the interstellar magnetic field (BISM) controls its location and shape, with the direction in agreement with the termination shock (TS) asymmetry found by the Voyagers, the deflection of the interstellar neutral (ISN) flow, and the high energy cosmic ray anisotropy. With direct ISN flow velocity vector VISM and temperature observations, along with secondary neutrals, most likely from the outer heliosheath, IBEX also probes the conditions and interaction outside the heliospheric boundary. Precise knowledge of the ISN flow direction is key, because small differences have substantial leverage on the VISM-BISM plane, which controls the large-scale heliosphere structure.\nFor quantitative tools, the ribbon formation must be understood and the ISN flow parameters must be further refined. IBEX maps show that the latitudinal ribbon structure carries the imprint of fast and slow solar wind (SW). These results support models that involve charge exchange with the SW, currently in two renditions: secondary ENAs from neutral SW reaching into the outer heliosheath and reflection of SW at the TS. In the TS model, the ribbon distance maps the TS, and reactions to changing SW at 1 AU follow within 1 – 2 years. In the secondary ENA model, ribbon ENAs provide an energy-dependent spatio-temporal probe of the outer heliosheath over several years after SW changes at 1 AU. Therefore, observations over a full solar cycle with IBEX, probing the ribbon depth with SW modulation, are key to its understanding. Likewise, expanding the successful variation of the IBEX pointing strategy over times with varying ionization rates will refine the ISN flow vector. The capabilities of the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), which has highest priority in the recent NRC Heliophysics Decadal Survey, are needed to probe the spatio-temporal fine-structure of the ribbon, extend observations to higher energy with better resolution, and provide precision observations of the ISN flow and secondary neutrals from different vantage points. To that end, IMAP will provide a combination of increased collecting power, angular, and energy resolution, the capability to scan the ISN flow, and a dedicated pickup ion instrument.",

The wave propagation has been captured by waveform models, which are effective but lack physical consistency. For the first time, we have implemented tsunami-generated gravity waves into the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) to develop a fully physics-based three-dimensional model describing the upper atmosphere under the influence of tsunamis. The model takes tsunami wave characteristics, including the wave heights, wavelengths and propagation velocities at the ocean surface as input parameters and characterizes the ionosphere-thermosphere between altitudes 100km and 600km. The computational region and grid resolution in the horizontal direction can be specifically adjusted according to applications.\nAs an initial application and test case, we simulate the ionosphere-thermosphere above the US west coastal region where the tsunamis caused by the 2011 Tokohu earthquake arrived and caused disturbances in the ionosphere. To validate our modeling approach, the GITM-simulated TEC disturbances are compared with GPS-derived TEC measurements at multiple geographic locations. We envision that modeled and measured TEC perturbations could play a critical role in detecting and imaging the upper atmospheric signatures of natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions.",

In response, many state agencies and local municipalities have issued draft or final guidelines/regulations for various aspects of shale gas operations. In most cases, these guidelines specify mandatory or voluntary baseline (pre-drill) sampling of proximate water supplies (e.g., residential water wells, springs, seeps, ponds) to establish baseline water quality prior to drilling activities. Currently, 16 state and several national agencies, regional and local organizations in United States have developed regulations or guidelines for baseline sampling. In addition, other countries (e.g., Canada, New Zealand) have developed guidance through provincial and regional authorities. Comparison of recommended practices for baseline sampling shows considerable variation with respect to sampling requirements (e.g., locations, number of samples, timeframe, frequency); sampling methodology, recommended analytical suite, analytical methods, action levels, and reporting requirements. Current baseline sampling guidelines and regulations in the United States and abroad highlights the need for a sound scientific basis for baseline sampling programs.",

            "abstract": "The processes driving high-amplitude climate variability and sustaining global warmth during the Miocene climatic optimum (~17-14.7 Ma) are highly enigmatic. We present high-resolution benthic and bulk carbonate isotope records in an exceptional sedimentary archive (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1337, eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean), which offer a new view of climate evolution over the onset of the climatic optimum. A sharp decline in benthic and bulk carbonate δ18O and δ13C at ~16.9 Ma, contemporaneous with a massive increase in carbonate dissolution, demonstrates that abrupt climate warming was coupled to an intense perturbation of the carbon cycle. We conclude that elevated atmospheric pCO2 acted as an amplifier of climate variability after 16.9 Ma, driving profound changes in the global carbon reservoir. Comparison with a high-resolution δ13C record spanning the onset of the Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (~120 Ma ago) reveals common forcing factors and climatic responses during two unusually warm episodes of Earth’s history with widely differing boundary conditions: the virtually ice-free Cretaceous “Super Greenhouse” and the Miocene “Icehouse” with dominant Southern Hemisphere ice cover. In both periods, rapid CO2 addition to the atmosphere induced abrupt climate warming and drove fundamental changes in the carbon cycle that were only mitigated over long timescales (>100 kyr). Despite obvious differences with the modern ocean/climate system, these results provide a useful perspective to evaluate future climate impacts in response to anthropogenic CO2 rise.",

            "abstract": "While global climate models with horizontal resolutions approaching 10 kilometers are becoming more common, their computational expense is too great to permit routine testing with long simulations. Lower resolution global models with regional refinement are a more affordable modeling framework that is potentially useful for understanding the behavior of a high-resolution global model in the region with refinement. In this work, we test this notion by comparing simulations of the Community Atmosphere Model using the Spectral-Element dynamical core with 1/8° latitude-longitude regional refinement over North America to simulations of globally uniform 1/8° resolution model. The focus is on characteristics of warm season precipitation. Comparison to observations collected at the Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program site in Oklahoma is facilitated by simulations of the regionally-refined model that are nudged to analysis data over the coarse-resolution portion of the grid.

            "abstract": "This research models the cooling of a suite in the Linga Super-unit located at the north end of the Arequipa segment in the Cretaceous Peruvian Coastal Batholith. The monzogabbro to granite Linga suite is approximately 50 km long and 15 km wide, with an estimated vertical extent of about 5 km originally intruded to a depth of 3 km. The emplacement was in andesitic volcanics on the west and the Pampahuasi diorite Super-unit on the east and has incorporated earlier gabbroic bodies. The Linga suite is thought to be the result of a sequence of three pulses: an elongate unit to the west then two elliptical units to the northeast and southeast. The data for modeling comes from field observations on internal and external contacts, some well-defined magma chamber walls and roof, pendant and stoped blocks, magma chamber zoning, the nature and distribution of enclaves and xenoliths, magmatic fabric, evidences of magma mingling, rock porosity, mineralogical associations in metamorphic aureoles, extensive mineralization and brecciated conduits, and the types of hydrothermal alteration varying with distance from contacts. More than forty hand samples, thin sections, and geochemical analyses were used to estimate water content, magma and country rock temperature, liquid density, and viscosity. Further data will come from: zircon U-Pb ages for country rock and magma batch timeframes, fluid inclusions for magma pressure and temperature, and δ18O data for source of hydrothermal fluids. Simple heat conduction calculations using MATLAB and HEAT 3D for a single tabular intrusion estimated a cooling time to solidus of about 300 k.y. More complex modeling includes magma convection and multiple intrusions. Extensive veining and pervasive alteration suggested the use of HYDROTHERM to model possible additional heat flow effects from hydrothermal fluids. Extensive propylitic and significant potassic alteration were observed and, with TerraSpec infrared spectroscopy to identify mineralogical content of altered outcrops, fluid flux and temperatures were estimated. Rough calculations for cooling times are made using the modeling of Hayba and Ingebritsen (1997).",

            "abstract": "The amount of air pollution crossing state lines has great policy implications. Using the ozone source apportionment tool (OSAT) in the Comprehensive Air-Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) version 6.10, we can quantify how much ozone is generated locally versus transported from upwind locations. Initial results show that up to 70% of the surface ozone in Maryland during poor air quality days in the summer of July 2011 can be attributed to pollution from outside of the state’s borders. Modifications to the CB05 gas-phase chemistry mechanism, supported by literature recommendations and improve agreement with NASA’s DISCOVER-AQ Maryland aircraft campaign, can further increase this percentage. Additionally, we show the role of upwind sources and background ozone has become increasingly important as local emissions of ozone precursors continue to drop, starting with the steep reductions imposed in 2002 in response to Maryland’s State Implementation Plan submitted to EPA. This study suggests future efforts to control surface ozone must include a meaningful strategy for dealing with cross-state transport of ozone precursors.",

While it has been argued that these two are causally connected, no previous studies have formally attributed long-term European yield trends to a changing climate. Here we present two statistical tests based on the distinctive spatial pattern of climate change impacts and adaptation, and explore their power under a range of parameter values. We show that statistical power for the identification of climate change impacts is high in many settings, but that power for identifying adaptation is almost always low. Applying these test to European agriculture, we find evidence that long-term temperature and precipitation trends have reduced continent-wide wheat, maize, and barley yields by 2.7%, 1.1%, and 3.9% respectively, and have increased sugarbeet yields by 1.0%. This can account for approximately 10% of the yield stagnation in Europe, with changes in agricultural and environmental policies likely explaining the remainder.",

            "abstract": "Chinook salmon populations have declined significantly after the construction of Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River in 1945 prevented them from spawning in the cold waters upstream. In 1994, the winter-run Chinook were listed under the Endangered Species Act and 3 years later the US Bureau of Reclamation began operating a temperature control device (TCD) on the dam that allows for selective withdrawal for downstream temperature control to promote salmon spawning while also maximizing power generation. However, dam operators are responsible to other interests that depend on the reservoir for water such as agriculture, municipalities, industry, and recreation. An increase in temperatures due to climate change may place additional strain on the ability of dam operations to maintain spawning habitat for salmon downstream of the dam. We examined the capability of Shasta Dam to regulate downstream temperatures under extreme climates and climate change by using stochastically generated streamflow, stream temperature, and weather inputs with a two-dimensional CE-QUAL-W2 model under several operational options. Operation performance was evaluated using degree days and cold pool volume (volume of water below a temperature threshold). Model results indicated that a generalized operations release schedule, in which release elevations varied over the year to match downstream temperature targets, performed best overall in meeting temperature targets while preserving cold pool volume. Releasing all water out the bottom throughout the year tended to meet temperature targets at the expense of depleting the cold pool, and releasing all water out uppermost gates preserved the cold pool, but released water that was too warm during the critical spawning period. With higher air temperatures due to climate change, both degree day and cold pool volume metrics were worse than baseline conditions, which suggests that Chinook salmon may be more negatively affected under climate change.",

            "abstract": "Tree-ring based reconstructions of hydroclimatic variability are useful for water resource management. One of the challenges in generating reconstructions is assessing uncertainties and how they impact use in resource management. This project focuses on recent reconstructions of streamflow for the Upper Klamath River basin. The reconstructions provide several centuries of historical context to drought and hydroclimate variability found in the instrumental record of the past century. The quality of tree-ring reconstructions greatly depends on the quality and the availability of tree-ring data and the instrument records used for reconstruction calibration. This project focuses on the quality and potential uncertainty of instrumental records. A number of hydroclimate instrumental records are available in the Klamath River basin. Unfortunately these records have deficiencies. Complex basin hydrology and a long history of water use have made it difficult to estimate the river’s natural flow. This project develops a methodology to combine uncertainty from the instrumental record with uncertainty from tree-ring reconstructions. The result is a Monte Carlo method which considers complex and potential non-linear interactions. Probability distributions are created for each observation in the instrumental record. An algorithm independently designs, trains, and tests a tree-ring reconstruction for potential outcomes of the instrumental record’s distributions. Preliminary results give probability distributions for past streamflow events. These can be used for commonly applied drought analysis. This includes exceedance probabilities relative to instrumental record drought for single and multiple-year moving averages.",

            "abstract": "Despite its fundamental importance in seismology, accurate estimation of radiated energy remains challenging. The interaction of the elastic field with the near-source structure, especially the free surface, makes the radiation field very complex. Here we address this problem using the normal-mode theory. Radiated energy estimations require a detailed finite source model for the spatial and temporal slip distribution. We use the slip models for recent great earthquakes provided by various investigators. We place a slip model in a spherically symmetric Earth (PREM), and compute the radiated energy by modal summation. For each mode, the volume integral of the energy density over the Earth’s volume can be obtained analytically. The final expression involves a sum over the source patches nested in the modal summation itself. In practice we perform modal summation up to 80 mHz. We explore the effect of several factors such as the focal mechanism, the source depth, the source duration, the source directivity and the seismic moment. Not surprisingly, the source depth plays a key role. The effect can be very significant for events presenting large slip at shallow depths. Deep earthquakes and strike-slip earthquakes are essentially unaffected by the free surface. Similar to the situation in moment tensor determinations, shallow dipping reverse or normal focal mechanisms can be heavily affected. The preliminary estimates of the radiated energy for the frequency ≤ 80 mHz are; the 2004 Sumatra earthquake, 8.3x1016 J (average for 2 rupture models), the 2010 Maule, 1.6x1017 J (2), the 2011 Tohoku-oki, 1.1x1017 J (5), the 2012 Sumatra, 2.4x1017 J (2), the 1994 Bolivia, 4.1x1015 J (1), the 2013 Okhotsk, 2.0x1016 J (1), and the 2010 Mentawai, 2.9x1014 J (1). To obtain the total radiated energy, the radiated energy for frequency ≥ 80 mHz estimated with other methods (e.g., integration of velocity records) needs to be added.",

            "abstract": "Three dimensional electrical resistance tomography (ERT) was used to monitor a pilot CO2 injection experiment at Vrøgum, Denmark. The purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of the ERT method for monitoring the two opposing effects from gas-phase and dissolved CO2 in a shallow unconfined siliciclastic aquifer. Dissolved CO2 increases water electrical conductivity (EC) while gas phase CO2 reduce EC. We injected 45kg of CO2 into a shallow aquifer for 48 hours. ERT data were collected for 50 hours following CO2 injection. Four ERT monitoring boreholes were installed on a 5m by 5m square grid and each borehole had 24 electrodes at 0.5 m electrode spacing at depths from 1.5 m to 13 m. ERT data were inverted using a difference inversion algorithm for bulk EC. 3D ERT successfully detected the CO2 plume distribution and growth in the shallow aquifer. We found that the changes of bulk EC were dominantly positive following CO2 injection, indicating that the effect of dissolved CO2 overwhelmed that of gas phase CO2. The pre-injection baseline resistivity model clearly showed a three-layer structure of the site. The electrically more conductive glacial sand layer in the northeast region are likely more permeable than the overburden and underburden and CO2 plumes were actually confined in this layer. Temporal bulk EC increase from ERT agreed well with water EC and cross-borehole ground penetrating radar data. ERT monitoring offers a competitive advantage over water sampling and GPR methods because it provides 3D high-resolution temporal tomographic images of CO2 distribution and it can also be automated for unattended operation.

            "abstract": "The western United States (WUS) has been experiencing severe drought since 2013. The solid earth response to the accompanying loss of surface and near-surface water mass should be a broad region of uplift. We use seasonally-adjusted time series from continuously operating GPS stations in the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory and several smaller networks to measure this uplift, which reaches 15 mm in the California Coastal Ranges and Sierra Nevada and has a median value of 4 mm over the entire WUS. The pattern of mass loss due to the drought, which we recover from an inversion of uplift observations, ranges up to 50 cm of water equivalent and is consistent with observed decreases in precipitation and streamflow. We estimate the total deficit to be 240 Gt, equivalent to a uniform 10 cm layer of water over the entire region, or the magnitude of the current annual mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet.\nIn the WUS, interannual changes in crustal loading are driven by changes in cool-season precipitation, which cause variations in surface water, snowpack, soil moisture, and groundwater. The results here demonstrate that the existing network of continuous GPS stations can be used to recover loading changes due to both wet and dry climate patterns. This suggests a new role for GPS networks such as that of the Plate Boundary Observatory. The exceptional stability of the GPS monumentation means that this network is also capable of monitoring the long-term effects of regional climate change. Surface displacement observations from GPS have the potential to expand the capabilities of the current hydrological observing network for monitoring current and future hydrological changes, with obvious social and economic benefits.",

            "abstract": "The extent to which degassing of the H2O component affects the oxidation state of hydrous magmas is widely debated. Several researchers have examined how degassing of mixed H-C-O-S-Cl fluids may change the Fe3+/FeT ratio of various magmas, whereas our focus is on the H2O component. There are two ways that degassing of H2O by itself may cause oxidation: (1) the reaction: H2O (melt) + 2FeO (melt) = H2 (fluid) + Fe2O3 (melt), and/or (2) if dissolved water preferentially enhances the activity of ferrous vs. ferric iron in magmatic liquids. In this study, a comparison is made between the pre-eruptive oxidation states of 14 crystal-poor, jet-black obsidian samples (obtained from two Fe-Ti oxides) and their post-eruptive values (analyzed with the Wilson 1960 titration method tested against USGS standards). The obsidians are from Medicine Lake (CA), Long Valley (CA), and the western Mexican arc; all have low FeOT (1.1-2.1 wt%), rendering their Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios highly sensitive to the possible effects of substantial H2O degassing. The Fe-Ti oxide thermometer/oxybarometer of Ghiorso and Evans, (2008) gave temperatures for the 14 samples that range for 720 to 940°C and ∆NNO values of –0.9 to +1.4. With temperature known, the plagioclase-liquid hygrometer was applied and show that ≤ 6.5 wt% H2O was dissolved in the melts prior to eruption. In addition, pre-eruptive Cl and S concentrations were constrained on the basis of apatite analyses (Webster et al., 2009) and sulfur concentrations needed for saturation with pyrrhotite (Clemente et al., 2004), respectively. Maximum pre-eruptive chlorine and sulfur contents are 6000 and 200 ppm, respectively. After eruption, the rhyolites lost nearly all of their volatiles. Our results indicate no detectable change between pre- and post-eruptive Fe2+ concentrations, with an average deviation of ± 0.1 wt % FeO. Although degassing of large concentrations of S and/or Cl may affect the oxidation state of magmas, at the pre-eruptive levels in these 14 rhyolitic magmas, no effect is detected. Therefore, it can be robustly concluded that degassing of substantial amounts of the H2O component (≤ 6.5 wt%), by itself, does not induce oxidation in erupted magmas, particularly those more iron-rich than rhyolites (e.g., arc basalts).",

These schists contain monazite inclusions within Grt, Ky, Crd, Bt, Pl, Qz, and Chl. Compositional maps via EPMA-WDS show overgrowths on each monazite grain, indicating that each grain records multiple metamorphic events. We analyzed monazite in situ using laser-ablation split-stream (LASS) ICPMS to correlate the geochemical and age domains and to reconstruct the polyphase metamorphic history. We used WDS compositional maps of Y and Th, and ICPMS Gd/Yb ratios and U/Pb ages to define the timing of major garnet growth and breakdown processes, and melting and/or fluid-rich metamorphism. For example, decreasing Gd/Yb and high Y concentrations are consistent with garnet breakdown; highly variable Gd/Yb indicate melting and/or fluid-rich metamorphism (e.g., Stearns et al., 2013).\nThe following cumulative histories are interpreted from two samples (B and G). In both samples, decreasing Gd/Yb in monazite suggest garnet breakdown from c. 398 to 387 Ma. Data from sample B (n = 644 analyses) indicate two additional phases of garnet growth: 382 to 377 Ma and 375 to 369 Ma (see figure). Data from sample G (n = 231 analyses) also indicate two additional phases of garnet growth: 387 to 381 Ma and 379 to 369 Ma. The final garnet growth event affecting both samples is marked by the most variable Gd/Yb ratios in monazite from all petrographic contexts and is consistent with melting or a fluid-rich metamorphic event. These data are most consistent with metamorphism during emplacement to crustal levels in the early Acadian, and a substantial overprint during the regional thermal maximum. This complex record can only be unraveled by collecting geochronologic and geochemical data in situ to preserve the petrographic context of each grain, thus underscoring the importance of LASS analysis.",

            "abstract": "The March 16–April 3, 2014 Pisagua earthquake sequence ruptured the middle part of the southern Peru-northern Chile seismic gap in the curved segment of the Andean subduction zone. The sequence began on March 16, with an Mw 6.7 earthquake that struck near the central section of the gap. A few hours after this initial event, intense seismic activity began and persisted for two weeks, showing a progressive northward migration towards the position of the main Mw 8.1 shock of this sequence. Two days after the main shock, a second large Mw 7.7 earthquake ruptured at the southern part of the area.. We relocated 336 events of this sequence by using data from a local network (Integrated Plate boundary Observatory Chile, IPOC). From NonLinLoc, HypoDD and waveform analysis, we relocated the Mw 6.7 in the upper plate at 12-14 km depth. Coulomb stress analysis shows that this initial event was able to trigger seismicity on the megathrust leading finally to the Mw 8.1. The initial Mw 6.7 event and some foreshocks have an unusual focal mechanism in comparison to the strike of the subduction interface. The nodal planes are rotated anticlockwise with respect to the slab surface strike. The shortening axes of the upper plate events plunges ~30° towards 220°, highly oblique to P axes of the foreshocks and main shock on the plate interface. On-shore regional structures are dominated by trench orthogonal reverse faults indicating the prevalence of long-term trench parallel shortening in the area. Upper plate micro seismic events, captured before this sequence, have focal mechanisms with E-W striking nodal planes and trench parallel shortening. Our analysis supports the idea of a causative relationship between upper plate long-term structures and the reactivation of the subduction megathrust. The concave seaward geometry of the margin and the trench orthogonal striking reverse faults observed in northern Chile are also common in the Cascadia margin, therefore we propose that both type of margin are able to trigger great subduction earthquakes by reactivation of upper plate structures.",

            "abstract": "The total post-storm 2012 Bagley fire sediment budget of the Squaw Creek watershed in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest was estimated using many methods. A portion of the budget was quantitatively estimated using LiDAR. Simple workflows were designed to estimate the eroded volume's of debris slides, fill failures, gullies, altered channels and streams. LiDAR was also used to estimate depositional volumes. Thorough manual mapping of large erosional features using the ArcGIS 10.1 Geographic Information System was required as these mapped features determined the eroded volume boundaries in 3D space. The 3D pre-erosional surface for each mapped feature was interpolated based on the boundary elevations. A surface difference calculation was run using the estimated pre-erosional surfaces and LiDAR surfaces to determine volume of sediment potentially delivered into the stream system. In addition, cross sections of altered channels and streams were taken using stratified random selection based on channel gradient and stream order respectively. The original pre-storm surfaces of channel features were estimated using the cross sections and erosion depth criteria. Open source software Inkscape was used to estimate cross sectional areas for randomly selected channel features and then averaged for each channel gradient and stream order classes. The average areas were then multiplied by the length of each class to estimate total eroded altered channel and stream volume. Finally, reservoir and in-channel depositional volumes were estimated by mapping channel forms and generating specific reservoir elevation zones associated with depositional events. The in-channel areas and zones within the reservoir were multiplied by estimated and field observed sediment thicknesses to attain a best guess sediment volume. In channel estimates included re-occupying stream channel cross sections established before the fire. Once volumes were calculated, other erosion processes of the Bagley sedimentation study, such as surface soil erosion were combined to estimate the total fire and storm sediment budget for the Squaw Creek watershed. The LiDAR-based measurement workflows can be easily applied to other sediment budget studies using one high resolution LiDAR dataset.",

            "abstract": "At the GRACE Science Team meeting in October, 2013, the possibility of trying an alternate proceedure for correcting for spurious accelerations and other sources of low frequency noise in the data from GRACE type missions was discussed. The usual proceedure is to apply anti-aliasing corrections and then to fit corrections based on once/rev differential acceleration coefficients and a few other parameters to each one revolution arc of data. However, the uncertainties in the anti-aliasing corrections over land areas and at high latitudes over the oceans can be fairly large. Thus an alternate proceedure called Ocean Calibration is being evaluated. It relies mainly on using the satellite separation results over low latitude ocean areas in determining an empirical correction function. The data arcs used are for periods when the satellites cross the equatorial Pacific on 4 successive revolutions. The data when the satellites are between -30 and +30 deg lat. over the Pacific plus one short arc each over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are fit. In addition, 5 crossings of the S. Pole and 4 crossings of the N. Pole are used. But 2 parameters corresponding to the mean separations at the poles are included in the fitting parameters, so that only the variations in the geopotential between crossings of the poles are assumed to be small.The simulations are based on the energy conservation approximation, where each satellite speeds up and slows down as the geopotential varies. For a bump in the geopotential, this will be seen at slightly different times for the two satellites, so there will be a bump in the separation between the satellites. Initially the simulations have been based on a model for the uncertainties in the geopotential variations over the equatorial Pacific based on the amplitude of the variations in mass in the ECCO-JPL ocean model, and a model for low frequency noise in the satellite separation. With these models and fitting 16 parameters to the satellite separation, the residual contribution to the geopotential height uncertainty is about 3 mm. However, it is hoped that studies based on real GRACE data can be carried out soon.",

We key our investigation on the ascending and descending mode equator crossing times for daytime and nighttime land-surface temperature variations from March 2000 through 2010 (MODIS-Terra) and July 2002 through 2012 (MODIS-Aqua) and assess the diurnal land-surface temperature range changes at those sampling times. Our investigation shows non-stationary changes in the trends of land-surface temperature diurnal range. We identify changes in the diurnal range trends linked to increase of daytime and nighttime land-surface temperatures from March 2000 through 2010 and decrease in daytime and nighttime land-surface temperatures from July 2002 through 2012. The most recent decrease in daytime and nighttime land-surface temperatures and diurnal range will affect Arctic and other associated energy and mass cycles.\n",

In this study, we used the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, derived from AVHRR/MODIS satellite sensors, to quantify the regional vegetation dynamic changes in the TRB and determine the key climatic factors driving these changes in the past 30 years through principal component and correlation analyses. We then developed regression models to predict NDVI changes as a function of the climatic factors. Using Sen's slope trend analysis of the climatic data and the regression models we examined how terrestrial vegetation has responded to regional climate change in the TRB. The regression results showed the average winter base NDVI values of 0.14 and 0.04 in the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the southwestern Loess Plateau, respectively. Primarily driven by increasing temperature, the vegetation growth has generally been enhanced since 1981; the spring NDVI increased by 0.03 every 10 years in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, and 0.02/10 years in the southwestern Loess Plateau. The Sen’s slope trend analyses showed that the vegetation growing season in the eastern Tibetan Plateau shifted to an earlier start and earlier end, but in contrast the southwestern Loess Plateau experienced an earlier start but later end. The precipitation threshold for vegetation germination is a cumulative spring rainfall of 44 mm; less than this precipitation indicates a spring drought and less vegetation growth.",

The >65 km-wide frontal part of the wedge comprises late Cenozoic accreted turbidites and the upper pelagic sequence of the subducting Hikurangi Plateau. Whilst the deeper (10-30 km) part of the subduction interface beneath land is interseismically strongly coupled (with slow slip events reported beneath the adjacent continental shelf), the style of megathrust slip beneath the outer accretionary wedge is unknown. To support numerical forward modelling of interplate rheological and frictional properties, in a related study, we use 2D seismic reflection profiles to define the geometry of the shallow portion of the interplate megathrust, frontal wedge, and a spectacular protothrust zone outboard of the stepped frontal thrust.\nWe reconstruct the evolution of the frontal wedge and the trench-ward propagation of the megathrust fault through progressive restoration, decompaction, and back-stripping of depth-converted seismic sections, in four stages (~0.6, 1.0, 2.0, and ≥3.5 Ma old. Folding in the fault hanging wall sequences is restored by mechanisms of fault-propagation folding and trishear. Whilst protothrusts develop as conjugate arrays with up-dip and down-dip propagation, back-thrusting on major thrust faults is relatively minor. Our preliminary results indicate spatial variations in finite shortening (~15-30%) and timing of megathrust propagation, with occurrence of out-of-sequence thrusting. Megathrust propagation may have occurred earlier than suggested in previous interpretations, with the highest shortening rates in the interval ~ 1-2 Ma. Estimated shortening rate is <10 mm/yr across the outer wedge, representing ~10-30% of total convergence.",

This environmental issue has led to concerted efforts to remediate subsurface systems impacted by NAPL pollution, but unfortunately, few of these remediation techniques have succeeded in lowering target contaminant levels below regulatory thresholds. To overcome these limitations, a novel, in-situ source remediation method was tested in the laboratory using equilibrium batch tests and two-dimensional flow cell experiments. The goal of this remediation method was to reduce the aqueous solubility, mass flux, and mass discharge of the target NAPL by the in-situ creation of a NAPL mixture source zone. Predetermined volumes of insoluble n-hexadecane or vegetable oil (“benign” NAPL) were injected into a trichloroethene or toluene (“toxic” NAPL) source zone through a simulated well within the flow cell to form a NAPL mixture. Initial NAPL-aqueous phase batch tests were conducted prior to the flow cell experiments to evaluate the effects of various NAPL mixture ratios on equilibrium aqueous-phase concentrations, and thus, to design optimal benign NAPL injection volumes for the flow cell experiments. Overall, this study indicated that the delivery of benign NAPL into the target, toxic NAPL source zone was effective in significantly reducing contaminant aqueous-phase concentration, mass flux, and mass discharge at intermediate scales. Variations in remediation performance did occur among the various predetermined injection volumes of benign NAPL and the target, toxic NAPL but were consistent to trends observed in batch tests. This novel remediation method may be feasible at larger scales, such as pilot field-scale studies, and may be a cost-effective solution to efficiently mitigate environmental pollution, attain regulatory compliance, and expedite site closure.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater systems are complex and subject to multiple interpretations and conceptualizations due to a lack of sufficient information. As a result, multiple conceptual models are often developed and their mean predictions are preferably used to avoid biased predictions from using a single conceptual model. Yet considering too many conceptual models may lead to high prediction uncertainty and may lose the purpose of model development. In order to reduce the number of models, an optimal observation network design is proposed based on maximizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information to discriminate competing models. The KL discrimination function derived by Box and Hill [1967] for one additional observation datum at a time is expanded to account for multiple independent spatiotemporal observations. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method is used to incorporate existing data and quantify future observation uncertainty arising from conceptual and parametric uncertainties in the discrimination function. To consider the future observation uncertainty, the Monte Carlo realizations of BMA predicted future observations are used to calculate the mean and variance of posterior model probabilities of the competing models. The goal of the optimal observation network design is to find the number and location of observation wells and sampling rounds such that the highest posterior model probability of a model is larger than a desired probability criterion (e.g., 95%). The optimal observation network design is implemented to a groundwater study in the Baton Rouge area, Louisiana to collect new groundwater heads from USGS wells. The considered sources of uncertainty that create multiple groundwater models are the geological architecture, the boundary condition, and the fault permeability architecture. All possible design solutions are enumerated using high performance computing systems. Results show that total model variance (the sum of within-model variance and between-model variance) varying over time and space should be considered in the design procedure to account for various sources of the future observation uncertainty. After the optimal design is obtained, the variance of head predictions is significantly reduced by eliminating models that have insignificant posterior model probabilities.",

            "abstract": "Because the viscosities of gases are typically two or more orders of magnitude lower than the viscosities of liquids, spatial gas pressure gradients are often considered to be negligible in the study of dynamic unsaturated flow in porous media. However, a wide range of systems exist where gas pressure gradients are not only substantial, but for which they can create the appearance of unexpected, anomalous phenomena. This work used a combination of experimental measurements and simulations to study the effects of gas pressure gradients and pressure drops during liquid drainage in porous media. Results suggest that system permeabilities in the phase boundaries strongly influence trends in gas pressure gradients, causing subtle differences in boundary properties to produce seemingly very different flow behaviors for the same material in different experiments. Methods for predicting the impacts of gas pressure gradients in existing systems are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Central Chile (CC, western South America coasts, 28°S- 38°S) is the heartland of Chile with the highest population and important economic activities. The region is characterized by semiarid Mediterranean climate with a marked precipitation gradient along the coast from north to south, mostly due to the positioning of the South Pacific Subtropical Anticyclone and the midlatitude westerlies belt. Although there are several diagnostic studies that focus on the impact of tropical Pacific SST on CC precipitation variability via atmospheric teleconnections, less attention has been placed on impacts of subtropical southeast (SE) Pacific SST on precipitation. The later region is immediately adjacent to CC and it interferes with the overpassing atmospheric systems. In particular we want to assess the impact of a consistent cooling over the SE Pacific during the last 30 years. This study is being tackled by a combination of observational and reanalysis datasets together with numerical simulations. Observational dataset includes gridded dataset of CRU, TRMM and GPCP. Moreover, Reynolds SST data V2 based on AVHRR infrared satellite SST data is used for analyzing spatial and temporal changes in SST. Current modelling experiment includes a control simulation, used as reference, and sensitivity simulation that involves perturbations to SST over subtropical SE Pacific for a normal year austral winter (2001) season. A number of simulations with different initial conditions have been carried out by employing ICTP-RegCM4. The domain for simulations was centered at 82oW and 32oW with 288x288 grid cells on 20 km spatial resolution. Preliminary results indicate that the response of precipitation in CC to SST anomalies in the subtropical SE Pacific exhibits more or less linear behavior. In the colder SST experiments, drier conditions dominate over CC, which is possibly related with the intensification of South Pacific Subtropical Anticyclone (SPSA) or a reduction in the available moisture. On the other hand, weakening of SPSA results wetter conditions in CC due to an extension of mid- and upper-level trough from south toward CC in the warmer SST experiments. The study will be also extended with long-term climate sensitivity simulations including El-Niño and La-Niña years in a bigger domain that covers tropical Pacific Ocean as well.",

            "abstract": "The coupling of glacial hydrology and sliding is a source of uncertainty for both ice flow modeling and prediction of future sea level rise. As basal sliding is required for a glacier to erode its bed, the spatial pattern of glacier sliding is also important for understanding alpine landscape evolution. We use multi-temporal WorldView satellite imagery (0.5 m pixel) to monitor the seasonal progression of glacier velocity across the terminal ~50 km2of Kennicott Glacier, Alaska. We employ the free image correlation software COSI-Corr to construct multiple velocity maps, using 2013 imagery with repeat times from 15 to 38 days. These short intervals between images allow us to analyze variations in glacier velocity over weekly to monthly timescales associated with hydrologically-induced basal sliding.\nBy assuming that spring (March-April) glacier velocity results solely from viscous deformation, we produce spatially distributed maps of glacier sliding speed by differencing summer and spring ice surface speeds. For a given time, a large portion of our study reach slides with roughly uniform speed, despite significant variation in deformation speed. This suggests that glacier flow models in which basal sliding is taken simply to scale as ice surface velocity are unfounded. The upglacier end of our study reach slides at speeds that vary through the summer, whereas the terminal reach slides at a steady speed. The proportion of glacier motion due to sliding increases dramatically moving downglacier, making basal sliding especially important in the terminal region.\nMany formulations express glacier sliding as a function of effective pressure (ice pressure minus water pressure). If such formulations are correct, effective pressure varies little over large areas or is averaged over lengthscales equivalent to ~10 glacier thicknesses. Also, effective pressure is steady in the terminal region through the summer. We explore existing sliding laws to find which best describes the observed spatiotemporal pattern of sliding.",

In this system, the effects of the latter scale on coastal ocean circulation are particularly important at south of Point Conception. Upwelling and relaxation in the northern Baja California coastal waters are examined using shipboard measurements as well as satellite-derived variables. In this region, synoptic-scale wind (16-3.5 days) is year-round. An upwelling event and a relaxation event that occurred in fall 2009, both spanning approximately 5-day period, are reported here. The quasigeostrophic theory is used to elucidate differences in upwelling and relaxation behavior. There are noticeable differences in the potential vorticity budget on two typical isopycnals of the study area, namely the 24.1 σθ and the 26.0-σθ surfaces. Planetary vorticity is the leading term (10 -9) on the two isopycnals not only during upwelling, but also during relaxation. However, in the upper isopycnal surface, relative vorticity is larger during upwelling than during relaxation, while stretching is of the same order in both processes; on the other hand, in the lower isopycnal surface, relative vorticity is of the same order in both processes, while stretching is larger during upwelling than during relaxation. As consequence of conservation of potential vorticity, two ageostrophic circulation cells are established during upwelling; they are missing during relaxation",

            "abstract": "Macropores and cracks have an integral role in soil hydrology, and the physicochemical factors that induce them have been the subject of much laboratory research. How these processes translate to field soils, however, is often obfuscated by the biological elements present that complicate its formation and dynamics. In this study, we investigated the biological influence of herbivores and vegetation on 3D crack morphology in a dryland swelling soil (black cotton/vertisol). Fieldwork was conducted at and near the Kenya Long-Term Exclosure Experiment (KLEE) plots in Mpala, central Kenya, where three different soil regions were identified: highly vegetated areas, animal trails, and termite mounds. Crack networks were physically characterized by pouring liquid resin into the soil and excavating them when dry, after which they were imaged and quantified using medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cracking intensity of each cast was corrected via soil moisture and bulk density measurements at 5 cm intervals over 30 cm. 3D characterization of the soil system shows that mechanical compaction is a major influence in the formation of extensive and deep cracks in animal trails, with megaherbivores (e.g. elephants) inducing the most extreme cracks. Bioturbation is seen as a major influence in the formation of shallower cracks in termite mounds, as termites loosen and aerate the soil and reduce the soil's cohesive properties. Highly vegetated soils show a large degree of variability: small, disconnected soil patches induced by vegetative cover and a larger root network results in smaller and shallower cracks, but full vegetative cover induces deep and irregular cracks, possibly due to diverted rainfall. Our results highlight the intricate connections between the biology and physics that dictate soil processes in a complex soil system at the field scale.",

            "abstract": "A better understanding of how microbial communities interact with their surroundings in physically and chemically heterogeneous subsurface environments will lead to improved quantification of biogeochemical reactions and associated nutrient cycling. This study develops a methodology to predict elevated rates of biogeochemical activity (microbial “hotspots”) in subsurface environments by correlating microbial community structure with the spatial distribution of geochemical indicators in subsurface sediments. Statistical hierarchical cluster analyses (HCA) of X-ray fluorescence (XRF), simulated precipitation leachate, bioavailable Fe and Mn, total organic carbon (TOC), microbial community structure, grain size, bulk density and moisture content data were used to identify regions of the subsurface characterized by biogeochemical hotspots and sample characteristics indicative of these hotspots within fluvially-derived aquifer sediments. The methodology has been applied to (a) alluvial materials collected at a former uranium mill site near Rifle, Colorado and (b) relatively undisturbed floodplain deposits (soils and sediments) collected along the East River near Crested Butte, Colorado. At Rifle, 33 sediment samples were taken from 8 sediment cores and at the East River 33 soil/sediment samples were collected across and perpendicular to 3 active meanders. The East River watershed exhibits characteristic fluvial progression and serves as a representative example of many headwater catchments with the upper Colorado River basin. Initial clustering revealed that operationally defined hotspots were characterized by high organic carbon, bioavailable iron and dark colors but not necessarily low hydraulic conductivity. Applying the method to identify hotspots in both contaminated and natural floodplain deposits and their associated alluvial aquifers demonstrates the broad applicability of a geochemical indicator based approach.",

The model calculates a surface heat budget and internal heating from solar radiative transfer, and simulates the formation and movement of brine/melt water through the ice/snow system. Initialization for the model is based on observations of snow topography made during the summer melt seasons of 2009, 2010, and 2012 from a location off the coast of Barrow, AK. Experiments are conducted that examine the melting period from the middle of May through June. Key processes simulated by the model are the flooding and drainage of melt water from snow that is commonly observed at the beginning of the melt season. Results indicate that resulting long-term melt pond coverage is sensitive to both the spatial variability of snow cover and the minimum snow depth. For thin snow cover, initial melting results in extensive flooding that limits pond formation after drainage of the melt water. Deeper snow tends to delay flooding of the ice surface, and can lead to more ponds after the surface drains. Simulated pond albedo tends to be too high in comparison with measurements, suggesting that the radiative transfer scheme is not properly calibrated for first year ice or that the role of sediments in the ice is underestimated. Nevertheless, predicted pond fraction time series are in good agreement with observations for each of the study years.",

            "abstract": "The Moon possesses a number of hemispheric asymmetries including crustal thickness and mare basalt volcanism. Lunar mare volcanism, which lasted from about 4.0 to 1.5 Ga and occurred mostly on the nearside, is crucial in understanding the evolutionary history of the Moon. Recently, we analyzed the mare basalt age distribution for major mare basins, based on the latest mare basalt dating results from the crater size-frequency distribution measurements. Our analysis shows that most mare basalt eruptions are peaked at ~3.6 Ga and end at ~2.8 Ga, while mares Oceanus Procellarum, Imbrium, and Insularum in the Procelluram KREEP Terrane (PKT) feature episodic volcanism with reducing activities in the late stage. In this study, we propose that the episodic mare basalt volcanism is caused by oscillatory thermochemical convection, and has a strong correlation with the KREEP-enriched PKT. We formulate 3-D spherical thermochemical mantle convection models to investigate the genesis of episodic mare volcanism in one hemisphere, and the role of PKT in inducing and maintaining mare eruptions within its region. A MIC (mixture of ilmenite-rich cumulates and olivine-pyroxene) layer, which is rich in radiogenic elements and has a larger intrinsic density than the ambient mantle, is proposed to be the mare basalt source material. MIC is heated up due to radiogenic heating to become thermally buoyant and rise to the mare basalt source region, causing melting. When the heat is released to the extent that MIC becomes negatively buoyant, MIC sinks back to depth. Such a process may occur repetitively, causing episodic volcanism. On the other hand, the heating from KREEP materials in the PKT may maintain a high temperature anomaly in the nearside mantle that favors very long wavelength (i.e., degree 1) upwellings in the PKT region. This process may control the long-term evolution of the lunar interior and have implication for the present-day lunar mantle structure and dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Wind energy cost models incur inaccuracies from uncertainty in ambient wind measurements and estimates. This inhibits the best possible investment in wind energy infrastructure and management systems.\nHigh-resolution temporal and spatial wind data needed for wind availability analysis—usually created with regional-scale models—have traditionally been proprietary and costly to obtain. Freely available global model data suffers from either lower spatial or temporal resolution, or both. Low spatial resolution fails to realistically represent wind speeds in complex terrain. Low temporal resolution fails to capture the full diurnal cycle of wind behavior.\nThe NCAR Global Climate Four-Dimensional Data Assimilation (CFDDA) Hourly 40 km Reanalysis was developed in 2009-2010 by the Research Applications Laboratory (RAL) to provide the most accurate boundary layer wind estimates available at that time. CFDDA used 28 sigma levels, with 19 between the surface and 700 hPa, a four-fold improvement over the contemporary NWP models. The dataset spans 21 years, 1985-2005, providing hourly atmospheric parameters, including winds, on 28 vertical levels on a global 40 km grid.\nThis presentation will introduce the modeling and assimilation strategy, highlight the available data content including the parameter set, and review the data access options available from the RDA.\nCFDDA project partners, Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), NCAR RAL and NCAR Mesoscale & Microscale Meteorology (MMM) divisions are offering this dataset to the public for free with minor restrictions.

            "abstract": "The costly interactions between humans and natural fire regimes throughout California demonstrate the need to understand the uncertainties surrounding wildfire, especially in the face of a changing climate and expanding human communities. Although a number of statistical and process-based wildfire models exist for California, there is enormous uncertainty about the location and number of future fires. Models estimate an increase in fire occurrence between nine and fifty-three percent by the end of the century. Our goal is to assess the role of uncertainty in climate and anthropogenic influences on the state’s fire regime from 2000-2050. We develop an empirical model that integrates novel information about the distribution and characteristics of future plant communities without assuming a particular distribution, and improve on previous efforts by integrating dynamic estimates of population density at each forecast time step. Historically, we find that anthropogenic influences account for up to fifty percent of the total fire count, and that further housing development will incite or suppress additional fires according to their intensity. We also find that the total area burned is likely to increase but at a slower than historical rate. Previous findings of substantially increased numbers of fires may be tied to the assumption of static fuel loadings, and the use of proxy variables not relevant to plant community distributions. We also find considerable agreement between GFDL and PCM model A2 runs, with decreasing fire counts expected only in areas of coastal influence below San Francisco and above Los Angeles. Due to potential shifts in rainfall patterns, substantial uncertainty remains for the semiarid deserts of the inland south. The broad shifts of wildfire between California’s climatic regions forecast in this study point to dramatic shifts in the pressures plant and human communities will face by midcentury. The information provided by this study reduces the level of uncertainty surrounding the influence that natural and anthropogenic systems have on wildfire.",

            "abstract": "A warming climate has led to decreases in permafrost extent and water insecurity in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It is speculated that this will cause large-scale changes water resource availability. These speculations bring up questions: At what amount does groundwater storage contribute to stream flow in these headwater watersheds? How does groundwater storage change with increasing temperatures and decreasing permafrost extent? How will changes in permafrost and thus, groundwater storage, change seasonally? To address these questions, we have: (1) Developed a three-dimensional, groundwater flow and energy model for the Hulugou Watershed, the headwaters of the Heihe River located on the northern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; (2) Analyzed seasonal base flow contribution to streamflow for the Hulugou Watershed using the two-parameter Kalinin method; and (3) Compared model results to geochemical data from the Hulugou Watershed.\nWe derive a transient three-dimensional finite element coupled flow and energy transport model to characterize the groundwater and energy systems and quantify groundwater storage under long-term climatic conditions. The coupled hydrogeologic model incorporates the physics of water phase change, allowing for modeling of pore water freeze and thaw and permeability dependence on ice saturation. Major outcomes of the model include: spatial and temporal distributions of subsurface temperature, fluid pressure, groundwater storage, and discharge to the land surface. Model results highlight that groundwater recharges mainly at high elevations and discharges to springs and streams at low elevations. Results from base flow extraction of observed discharge data suggest that within the Hulugou Watershed, stream discharge is primarily from groundwater contributions in the form of base flow (53%). These results corroborate with geochemical data, highlighting temporal changes in groundwater storage.",

This includes the 1995 collapse of the Larsen-A ice shelf, the 2002 collapse of the Larsen-B ice shelf, a large iceberg breaking off of Larsen-B remnant ice shelf in 2006, and the 2008-2009 collapse of the Wilkins ice shelf. We present a series of ice velocity maps of the Larsen-B (remnant) and -C ice shelves and their tributaries spanning from 1997 to 2013. Velocity Measurements are based on spaceborne SAR data from RADARSAT-1 and -2, ALOS PALSAR, ENVISAT ASAR, TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X. These Earth Science Data Records (ESDR) will be made available to the science community as part of a NASA funded MEaSUREs project. Our results show that the adjustment period following the Larsen-B collapse is not yet over. The surface velocity of the Larsen B remnant ice shelf continues to increase following the Larsen-B collapse. The speed at the ice front has more than doubled compared to 2000. Its major tributaries, Flask and Leppard Glacier, show an increase velocity increase in velocity on the trunk over that period. For Crane glacier, which lost ice shelf buttressing entirely following the 2002 collapse, the speed near the 2013 ice front almost tripled between 2000 and 2006. After that the speed started to recede, however, it is still about twice of what it was before the collapse of the shelf. In contrast, the Larsen-C ice shelf appears mostly stable in terms of surface velocity with a small increase over the last 13 years. The ice shelf is well bounded by a number of ice rises and islands. The southern tip of the ice shelf between Hearst Island and Dolleman Island, where ice flow is more or less insulated from the rest of Larsen-C, shows a slowdown for the observable period.

            "abstract": "Since 2009 the IRIS Data Management Center has served the seismology community in a variety of ways by offering higher order data products generated internally or by the research community in addition to raw times series data traditionally managed at the DMC. These products are intended to facilitate research as baseline standards, tools for data visualization or characterization, and teaching & outreach material. We currently serve 25 data products of which 7 are event-based that provide quick looks at many aspects of interest to researchers, often within a few hours of real-time.\nAmong our new offerings is an expansion of the visualization capabilities of the Earth Model Collaboration, a repository of author contributed tomography and other Earth models. Currently EMC tools allow users to make 2D plots slicing through models. New 3D visualization tools being developed will bridge the gap between 2D slices and advanced and sometimes complicated 3D visualization packages with common 3D capabilities that can be set up and learned within minutes. The newly released Global Stacks is a project that stacks up to a million seismograms to illuminate the global seismic wavefield. Seismograms are processed and stacked for three component data across many frequency bands. The resulting stacks lead to high-fidelity wavefield images that clearly highlight characteristics such as dispersion in surface waves and many phases not commonly observed such as P’P’P’P’. Another recent addition is the Automated Surface Wave Phase Velocity Measuring System, which is an automated do-it-yourself surface wave tomography package requiring minimal user input and produces research quality tomography results.\nTo further enhance our effort to support the research community, we invite proposals for collaborative data product development. This is an excellent opportunity for researchers to put forward unique and useful data product ideas and collaborate with the DMC in the development of the product. While we do not offer funding, this is an opportunity to utilize our resources to make a new data product that will be shared with the community. In the near future, DOIs will be provided for products we host, thereby improving contributor recognition. Details on our data products are available at: http://www.iris.edu/ds/products",

            "abstract": "For more than a decade, research groups such as the Geological Survey of Canada built the interest for near-surface reflection seismic by proposing small vibrating sources and three components (3C) landstreamers. Developments in the instrumentation combined with extensive use of shear-wave profiling to image stratigraphy of unconsolidated environments at high resolution got this geophysical method more versatile, more accurate, increased cost effectiveness and allowed to cover greater distance per day. With those major upgrades as a starting point and in a context of regional aquifer characterization in St-Lawrence Lowlands in the province of Quebec, Canada, the present study propose a workflow to further enhance reflection seismic usage for near-surface characterization.\nFirst, as high resolution near surface surveys require small shot intervals and multiple channels on three axis, a lot of the acquisition information is received under a raw form yielding to unproductive quality control (QC). Hence, a tool was developed to process data “on the fly” and allow adequate real-time QC and on-site decision making. The algorithm was constructed in a Python environment and is accessible through a graphical user interface where the user is prompted for geometry parameters inputs and desired processing flow steps. Second, at the scale of seismic wavelengths, fine grain and poorly consolidated sediments such as marine clay of the St-Lawrence Lowlands can be viewed as a homogeneous medium presenting anisotropy. This section of the study showed that such geological settings yield to significant seismic velocity variations with angle of propagation that should not be ignore for normal move-out correction, migration or time to depth conversion. Finally, accurate delineation of stratigraphic horizons is an important task of any environmental or hydrogeological characterization study. A methodology was put forward to help integrate geophysical measurements with geological knowledge in the construction of stratigraphic maps. The approach accounts for reliability and resolution of the measurements, extracts statistical information from reflection seismic interpretations and can further serve as a tool for reinterpretation of the seismic data.",

            "abstract": "The surfzone environment (where waves break) contains several unique and previously unconsidered processes that affect the heat budget. Entering short-wave radiation is a dominant term in both shelf and surfzone heat budgets. In contrast to the shelf, however, depth limited wave breaking in the surfzone generates spray, whitewater and suspended sediments, elevating the surface albedo (ratio of reflected to incident short-wave radiation). Elevated albedo reduces the level of solar short-wave radiation entering the water, potentially resulting in less heating. Additionally, surfzone water quality is often impacted by fecal bacteria contamination. As bacteria mortality is related to short-wave solar radiation, elevated surfzone albedo could reduce pathogen mortality, impacting human health.\nAlbedo in the open ocean has been frequently studied and parameterizations often consider solar zenith angle, wind speed and ocean chlorophyll concentration, producing albedo values typically near 0.06. However, surfzone albedo observations have been extremely sparse, yet show depth limited wave breaking may increase the albedo by nearly a factor of 10 up to 0.5. Here, we present findings from a field study at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier to observe the affect of waves on surfzone albedo. Concurrent measurements were taken with a four-way radiometer (to measure both downwelling and upwelling short-wave and long wave radiation) mounted above the surfzone. A co-located GoPro camera was used to relate visual aspects of the surfzone to measured reflectance, and wave height and period were observed with a bottom mounted pressure sensor in 5 m water depth just outside the surfzone. Wind speed and direction were observed on the pier 10 m above the water surface. Here, we will examine the surfzone albedo dependence on surfzone parameters, such as wave height.",

Data from the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) experiment on Aura provide profiles of ozone and temperature with high vertical and along track resolution that extends down into the upper troposphere. Displaying ozone isopleths in a potential temperature - equivalent latitude coordinate system shows the downward advection by the Brewer-Dobson circulation during fall and winter, but also the existence of barriers to transport around 35° N below 500 K. These are in the locations predicted by Nakamura’s [1996] effective diffusivity formulation, and are not present above 500 K, or during summer. The major component of the total column change is due to the ozone buildup behind the winter barrier below 500 K, which disappears as a result of mixing in summer. The seasonal variation of total ozone is in very good agreement with direct measurements by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), also on Aura. Calculations using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) suggest that in a warming world mid-latitude barriers will be stronger, mid latitude gradients will be steeper and high latitude winter mixing ratios and total column amounts will be noticeably larger.",

            "abstract": "What seem to be the most obvious categories of solar wind, such as fast and slow, often turn out to be difficult to pin down on closer examination. For example, while slow winds tend to be dense and nonAlfvenic, there are significant exceptions, with some slow winds being not only very Alfvenic but also exhibiting many fast wind traits. Here we use \"unsupervised\" data mining to look for \"natural\" solar wind types. We use a set of variables to represent the state of the system and apply what are now standard algorithms to look for natural clustering of these variables. We have done this process for the solar wind density, speed, a carbon charge state ratio (6+ to 5+), the cross-helicity, and the \"residual energy.\" When using the first three of these, we find two groups that tend to be slow and fast, but with the boundary between the groups that is a combination of speed and density. When all five variables are used, the best characterization of the states is as three basic groups in the cross-helicity vs residual energy space, i.e., in terms of \"turbulence\" measures rather than simple parameters. The three-variable case is largely but not completely reproduced in its subspace. We will suggest what the results could mean for the understanding of issues such as solar wind acceleration.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this study is to address the impact of small scale processes on large scale circulation in the North Atlantic with a focus on the Labrador Sea where strong mesoscale and submesoscale activity occurs.\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a key role in the regulation of the earth climate. This large circulation represents a synthetic view of the basin-wide transport with a northward warm and salty flow at the surface and an equatorward cold and fresh flow at depth. The latter is dominated by the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) which exports to the south dense water masses such as the Labrador Sea Water (LSW) formed during winter convective events in the interior Labrador Sea.\nIn a simplified, laminar view of the AMOC, a direct link could exist between dense water formation in the Labrador Sea and the DWBC transport intensity. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that this link may be more complex. Indeed, it seems that the LSW, once formed, may be exported to the surrounding DWBC by lateral density turbulent fluxes. It is also put forward that dense water formation signal may be lagged by several years when reaching the DWBC due to eddies. So the small scale processes may be key in the LSW export process. The exploration of these dynamics requires numerical models of very high resolution due to the small Rossby radius deformation in the Labrador Sea (about 7km).\nWe develop a high resolution primitive equation configuration which relies on a global config- uration at 1/2◦ horizontal resolution including two embedded grids covering respectively the North Atlantic (1/8◦) and the subpolar gyre (1/32◦). At the highest resolution, the mesoscale and submesoscale processes are explicitely resolved by the model and lead for instance to a strong seasonality in the dynamics due to convection. Our objective here is to evaluate their impact on the DWBC by reconstructing the potential vorticity budget in the Labrador Sea.",

            "abstract": "Whether Columbia River Basalts, eastern Snake River Plain and Yellowstone volcanism is related to a mantle plume or plate tectonic processes is a long-standing controversy. There are numerous geological mismatches with the plume model, and logical flaws, including the use of arguments for a deep-mantle origin to support upper-mantle plume models. The sweeping of the USArray seismic network across the continent has recently yielded abundant new seismological results but despite this, the most sophisticated seismic experiment ever staged having targeted the Yellowstone region, seismic analyses have still not resolved the disparity of opinion. This suggests that seismology is fundamentally unable to resolve the plume question for Yellowstone and likely elsewhere. USArray data, have, however, inspired many new models that relate western USA volcanism to shallow mantle convection associated with evolution of the subduction zone to the west. These models assume, however, that all that is required for surface volcanism is melt in the mantle and that the lithosphere is essentially passive. We propose a pure Plate model in which melt is commonplace in the mantle, and its tendency to rise is not the cause of surface eruptions. Instead, it is extension of the lithosphere that permits melt to rise. Eruptions occur where there is extension and not simply where there is melt. The time-progressive chain of rhyolitic calderas in the eastern Snake River Plain-Yellowstone zone formed in response to systematic eastward migration of the axis of most intense Basin Range extension since the province formed at ~ 16 Ma. Rhyolitic volcanism followed migration of the locus of most rapid extension, not vice versa. This model does not depend on seismology to test it, but can be investigated using surface geological observations.",

            "abstract": "Many plants, including grasses and some important human food sources, accumulate and precipitate silica in their cells to form opaline phytoliths. These phytoliths contain small amounts of organic matter (OM) that is trapped during the process of silicification and protected from oxidation. If this OM is derived solely from photosynthesis during the life of the plant, it should preserve an isotopic signature of the atmosphere and the type of photosynthetic pathway [1]. However, radiocarbon dating of this OM gives an older age than expected [2], and studies on modern plants indicate a soil contribution to phytolith OM [3,4]. Thus, a better understanding of the role of phytolith OM and the silica precipitation mechanism is needed. Previous work has suggested that plant silica is associated with compounds such as proteins, lipids, lignin and phenol-carbohydrate complexes [5-7]. It is not known whether these compounds are cellular components passively encapsulated as the cell silicified, polymers actively involved in the precipitation process or random compounds assimilated by the plant and discarded into a \"glass wastebasket\". Here, we used Raman spectroscopy to map individual phytoliths isolated from Sorghum bicolor plants. We showed that OM in phytoliths is heterogeneously distributed and not related to optical features (i.e. dark spots or holes visible in light microscopy) commonly thought to be the repository for phytolith OM (corroborated by nanoSIMS [8]). The Raman spectra showed peaks at 2970-2960, 2945, and 2906 cm-1, indicative of C-H stretching modes, and further peaks at 1600, 1440, 1410, and 1350 cm-1 consistent with lignins and other OM. These peaks exhibited variability of relative intensities both within and between phytoliths. We will discuss these findings in the context of silica biomineralization in plants, mechanistic implications, and isotopic paleo-reconstructions using phytolith OM.\n1. Jones, R.L. and A.

            "abstract": "High-precision Global Positioning System (GPS) data offer an opportunity to investigate active orogenic wedges yet surface velocity fields are available for only a few examples worldwide. More observations are needed to link deformation processes across multiple timescales and to better understand strain accumulation and release in active wedge settings. Here we present a new GPS velocity field for the central Andes and the backarc orogenic wedge comprising the southern Subandes of Bolivia (SSA), a region previously thought to be mostly isolated from the plate boundary earthquake cycle. The time span of our observations (2000 to mid-2014) includes two megathrust earthquakes along the Chile trench that affected the SSA. The 2007 Mw 7.7 Tocopilla, Chile earthquake resulted in a regional postseismic decrease in the eastward component of horizontal surface velocities. Preliminary analysis of the deformation field from the April 01 2014 Mw 8.2 Pisagua, Chile earthquake also indicates a postseismic signal extending into the SSA. We create an interseismic velocity field for the SSA by correcting campaign GPS site velocities for the seasonal cycles estimated from continuous GPS site time series. We remove the effects of both megathrust events by estimating coseismic steps and fitting linear and logarithmic functions to the postseismic GPS site motions. The velocity estimates at most locations increase after correcting for the transients. This finding suggests that forces leading to shortening and earthquakes in the backarc wedge are not as temporally consistent as previously considered.",

            "abstract": "Vertical mixing ratio gradients of isoprene, total monoterpenes (TMt) and total sesquiterpenes (TSt) were quantified, within and above the canopy, in a primary rainforest in central Amazonia , using a Proton Transfer Reaction – Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS). We also estimated the fluxes of these compounds from the canopy into the atmosphere. Measurements were carried out from the dry season (Sept/2010) to the wet season (Jan/2011), continuously. All compound mixing ratios were higher during the dry season than during the wet season; the same behavior was observed for ambient air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Isoprene and TMt mixing ratios were higher within the canopy as compared to near the ground and above the canopy. Daytime TSt mixing ratios were higher near the ground than within and above the canopy. Isoprene and TMt had a diurnal cycle similar to diurnal cycles of air temperature and PAR suggesting that the emission of these compounds are light dependent and stimulated by increasing temperature. However, this same behavior was not observed for TSt. This is probably due to the fact that sesquiterpene emissions are not strongly light dependent; the ozonolysis of sesquiterpenes during daytime could reduce ambient sesquiterpene concentrations; and a less turbulent atmospheric boundary layer during nighttime could make the mixing ratio of sesquiterpenes higher near the surface at nighttime. Daytime flux estimations also presented seasonal variation for the fluxes of all compounds, such that fluxes of: isoprene ranged from 0.4 to 1.5 mg m-2 h-1, TMt ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 mg m-2 h-1, and TSt ranged from 0.1 to 0.25 mg m-2 h-1, being the highest end during the dry season. These flux estimations suggested that the canopy could be the main source of those compounds for the atmosphere for all seasons. Our results provide the first in situ observations of seasonal mixing ratio gradients of isoprenoids in central Amazonia, and suggest that some of the isoprenoid seasonal variations could be driven by changes in light, temperature and leaf phenology.",

            "abstract": "The nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko appears to be formed of two components as revealed by images obtained with the OSIRIS narrow angle camera and the derived 3-D shape model (Jorda et al. 2014). This shape raises questions far beyond the obvious differences with the nuclei visited so far. We will explore the possible scenarios that may explain it. Whereas contact- binaries have been advocated for elongated nuclei (e.g., 19P/Borrelly and 103P/Hartley 2), the only unquestionable case remains that of 8P/Tuttle based on radar imaging (Harmon at al. 2010) and indirectly confirmed by HST observations (Lamy et al. 2008). However 8P originates from the Oort cloud where the collisional activity is essentially non-existent. A contact-binary among the Jupiter family comets (JFC) such as 67P would have profound implications since it must be primordial and the comet must have survived a possible history of collisions in the Kuiper belt. The present cumulative distribution function of size of nuclei of JFC comets indeed suggests a collisionally-relaxed population. Asymmetric erosion of an initially larger more regular body or even of a pre-existing contact binary will be studied in the framework of the past dynamical evolution of 67P (e.g., Groussin et al. 2007). Although unlikely, the scenario of a re-accumulated body following a catastrophic collision will be considered. Forthcoming images at higher spatial resolution with OSIRIS on the orbiter and CIVA and the lander will hopefully help deciphering the origin of the nucleus of 67P and restricting the number of possible scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Recalcitrant carbon (C) stored in soils plays a critical role in regulating climate change because of its huge amount and relatively low turnover rate. Positive priming effect by increased labile C inputs could lead to more recalcitrant C release to the atmosphere. However, the stabilization of the newly added labile C has received much less attention. As a result, the quantitative balance between the stabilization and priming and consequently changes in recalcitrant C are still unclear. In this study, incubation data of different soils (i.e., forest, grassland, cropland, and vertisol) with isotope-labeled labile substrate additions were collected. An alternative version of the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) with stabilization and positive priming effect was used to simulate the C dynamics during the incubation and then run forward for ten years. The results showed that at the end of incubation, an equivalent of 5.45 – 26.1% of added C was primed from the original SOM for the four soils. Meanwhile, 40.9 – 70.7% of added C was stabilized, leading to a net increase in recalcitrant C by an equivalent of 18.0 – 50.0% of added C. After running model for ten years, the recalcitrant C was greater with than without initial labile C addition by an equivalent of 33.0, 2.01, 21.6, and 0.62% of added C for the forest, grassland, cropland and vertisol, respectively. Our results suggest that stabilization overcompensates the C loss induced by positive priming effect, indicating that stimulated labile C input under CO2 enrichment may increase the recalcitrant C storage in soils, and consequently dampen the further increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate change. The results also suggest that both stabilization and positive priming effect may vary among ecosystems and with the type and amount of added substrates. To better quantify the net change in recalcitrant C and thus long-term soil C storage, comprehensive studies on the effects of soil type, added substrate type and amount on stabilization and priming effect are critically needed.",

            "abstract": "During the last deglaciation (20ka -11ka), variations in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) caused centennial-to-millennial abrupt climate change. Because of Ireland’s proximity to North Atlantic deep-water convection sites, changes in climate associated with variations in the AMOC would be particularly pronounced there, and are recorded by fluctuations of the Irish Ice Sheet. Many of Ireland’s mountains also hosted cirque glaciers, which would have been particularly sensitive to abrupt climate changes of the last deglaciation. Dating of cirque glacier moraines with cosmogenic nuclides can provide a millennial-scale reconstruction of variability in these highly sensitive cirque glaciers. We report 29 10Be ages from five cirque basins across western and southern Ireland. Two moraines, one inner and one outer, at Lough Accorymore on Achill Island have ages of 17.04 ± 0.31 ka and 18.43 ± 0.79 ka, respectively, and complement an age of 18.53 ± 0.68 ka from a cirque moraine directly adjacent to Accorymore. All three moraines are Oldest Dryas in age and suggest variability during the millennial-scale Clogher Head Stadial in Ireland. Two moraines in counties Mayo and Donegal suggest deglaciation during the Bølling-Allerød interval with ages of 13.81 ± 0.14 ka and 13.92 ± 0.46 ka, respectively. Two separate moraines in Donegal and Mayo have ages of 11.77 ± 0.44 ka and 11.79 ± 0.47 ka indicating deglaciation following the Younger Dryas stadial in western Ireland. A site located in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in County Kerry returned ages of 26.53 ± 0.62 ka and 20.70 ± 0.18 ka on outer and inner arcuate moraines, respectively.",

At the same time they also\npose a stiff challenge to the study of vertical coupling, mainly because of the very broad range\nof spatial and temporal scales of these waves, and the even broader range of scales of the\nwave impacts, and observations and numerical simulations usually can only cover a limited range of\nspatial and temporal scales. The gravity waves in the global context are generally poorly\nquantified, and they are one of the most important causes of bias and uncertainty\nin middle and upper atmosphere models. However, the recent development of model capability and computing\npower is expanding the horizon of gravity wave research, and affording the opportunity\nto explore increasingly broader scales over the whole atmosphere domain. Recently we have\nperformed Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) simulations at ~0.25 degree horizontal\nand 0.1 scale height vertical resolution.

            "abstract": "Despite advancing techniques in microbiology, an estimated 98% of all microbial species on Earth have yet to be isolated in pure culture. Natural samples, once transferred to the lab, are commonly overgrown by “weed” species whose metabolic advantages enable them to monopolize available resources. Developing new methods for the isolation of thus-far uncultivable microorganisms would allow us to better understand their ecology, physiology and genetic potential. Physically separating target organisms from a mixed community is one approach that may allow enrichment and growth of the desired strain. Here we report on a novel method that uses known physiological variations between taxa, in this case membrane lipids, to segregate the desired organisms while keeping them alive and viable for reproduction. Magnetic antibodies bound to the molecule squalene, which is found in the cell membranes of certain archaea, but not bacteria, enable separation of archaea from bacteria in mixed samples. Viability of cells was tested by growing the separated fractions in batch culture. Efficacy and optimization of the antibody separation technique are being evaluated using qPCR and cell counts. Future work will apply this new separation technique to natural samples.",

Our study of wave propagation effects and ambient noise is focused on the Long Beach Array, with more than 5000 single component geophones in an area of about 100 square kilometers, providing high resolution imaging of shallow crustal features. The method allows for observations of ground properties like site response and attenuation, which can well supplement traditional velocity models and simulations for seismic hazard.\nTraditional ambient noise cross correlations have proven to be an effective means of measuring velocity information about surface waves, but the amplitudes of such signals in traditional processing are often distorted. We discuss a method of signal processing which preserves relative amplitudes of signals within an array, and the subsequent processing to track wave motion across the array. Previous work showed promising correlation to known local structure, but did not represent a thorough application of tomographic methods. Now we extend the methodology to more robustly consider wavefront focusing and defocusing, interference with higher modes, and discuss the differing effects of local site response, attenuation, and scattering. Application of Helmholtz tomography and determination of local site amplification has previously been demonstrated using earthquake data on the continental scale with USArray, but the exploitation of the ambient noise field is required both for the higher frequencies needed by seismic hazard studies and for the short deployment time of a Long Beach scale array. We outline both the successes and shortcomings of the methodology, and show how it can be extended for use on future arrays.",

            "abstract": "The continuous increase of nitrous oxide (N2O) abundance in the atmosphere is a global concern. Soils are both an important source and sink of N2O, which is produced and consumed through biological processes including ammonia oxidation, heterotrophic denitrification, codenitrification, and through abiotic processes such as chemodenitrification. Iron is the most abundant element in the earth and is also the most prevalent redox-active metal in the biosphere. Its role in both chemical and biochemical reactions in N biogeochemistry cycling is well recognized. However, iron’s significance to N2O production is poorly understood, especially under varying O2 concentration. We examined N2O production under different O2 concentrations following amorphous iron (III) oxyhydroxide and ammonical N fertilizer additions in four soil slurries and two static soils (soil moisture was 50% of water holding capacity). Under 21% O2, the addition of iron (III) significantly decreased N2O production in all the soil slurries and static soils, while the opposite phenomenon was observed once the O2 concentration became limited (≤3% in the soil slurry and ≤0.5% in the static soil). Our results show that the influence of iron on soil N2O production depends on O2 availability, which is the dominant controller of N2O production pathways. We hypothesize that under ambient O2 conditions, iron can react with nitrite produced during ammonia oxidation, thus reducing the probability of NO2- being used by nitrifiers as electron acceptor in nitrifier denitrification. In contrast, under anaerobic conditions (O2<0.5%), less nitrite was detected in the presence of the iron addition. Under these conditions, iron may have inhibited N2O reductase, or reduced iron (II) reacted with nitrite, both of which would lead to greater release of N2O.These findings imply that management practices which focus on mitigating N2O emission should avoid the application of iron-rich materials such as biosolids when anaerobic conditions might develop. In contrast, use of such materials could be a beneficial component of strategies to minimize N2O emission in well-aerated systems.",

            "abstract": "The continental shelves of Antarctica produce the ocean's densest water, Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which ventilates over 50% of the sub-surface global ocean. The heat needed to melt marine-terminating Antarctic ice sheets and produce dense water is supplied by Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), a relatively warm, mid-depth water mass found offshore. The onshore transport of CDW is obstructed by the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF), a westward current at the continental shelf break that almost completely encircles the continent. Relatively little is understood about the processes that control the exchange of water masses and shoreward heat transport across the ASF, due to a scarcity of observations and the prohibitive cost of simulating turbulent flows in this region. Using a process model of the ASF that resolves the mesoscale eddies at the shelf break, we show that the ASF is shaped by an interplay between the surface wind forcing, transport by mesoscale eddies, and the geometry of the continental shelf. Consequently the onshore transport of CDW and the properties of the outflowing AABW are strongly sensitive to the wind and buoyancy forcing at the ocean surface, and to the geometry of the continental shelf. The onshore mass transport of CDW occurs through an eddy thickness flux. We develop a scaling for this transport that accurately captures the strong sensitivity to forcing and geometry, which is largely controlled by the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) over the continental slope. We find that the EKE is enhanced in the CDW density classes over the continental slope, but cross-slope mixing is constrained by the strong topographic potential vorticity gradient. Our results offer an explanation for the substantial changes in the structure of the ASF around Antarctica, and provide insight into future rates of dense water production and shoreward heat transport around Antarctica.",

Homoacetogen-based syngas fermentation technology provides an alternative solution to link greenhouse gas emission control and cellulosic solid waste treatment with biofuels production. The objective of our current project is to hunt for homoacetogens with capabilities of highly efficiently converting syngases to chemical solvents. In this study, we evaluated homoacetogens population dynamics during enrichments and pinpointed dominant homoacetogens representing diverse ecosystems enriched by different substrates. We enriched homoacetogens from four different samples including waste activate sludge, freshwater sediment, anaerobic methanogenic sludge, and cow manure using H2/CO2 (4:1) or formate as substrate for homoacetogen enrichment. Along with the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) gene (fhs gene)-specific real time qPCR assay and Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, 16S rRNA based 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing was applied to reveal the population dynamic and community structure during enrichment from different origins. Enrichment of homoacetogenic populations coincided with accumulations of short chain fatty acids such as acetate and butyrate. 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing revealed Firmicutes and Spirochaetes populations became dominant while the overall microbial diversity decreased after enrichment. The most abundant sequences among the four origins belonged to the following phyla: Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, accounting for 62.1%-99.1% of the total reads. The major putative homoacetogenic species enriched on H2/CO2 or formate belonged to Clostridium spp., Acetobacterium spp., Acetoanaerobium spp., Eubacterium spp., Sporomusa spp. This comprehensive molecular ecology study on homoacetogen enrichments provides molecular evidences for shaping homoacetogenic populations and targeting novel homoacetogenic species enriched from diverse ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the time-varying distributions of high-latitude ionospheric ionospheric electric fields and currents is needed for modeling the physics of the ionosphere and thermosphere. The patterns can also be used to investigate magnetospheric processes. The Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure was developed to estimate the distributions of electrodynamic parameters from combinations of observations of ionospheric drifts, ground- and satellite-based magnetic perturbations, and quantities related to ionospheric electrical conductivities, together with prior information about climatology and covariance of the parameters. AMIE uses optimal estimation theory to build on previous statistical studies and on an earlier mapping procedure that used only ground magnetometer data. Many of the improvements made to AMIE have been the addition of new data sets and procedures for semi-automatically processing the data. Theoretical developments have included improvements to the organization of the data in realistic magnetic coordinates, and dynamic estimation of the covariance matrices based on the data available at any given time. More recently, it has been shown that most of the large-scale variability can be represented with a relatively small number of empirical orthogonal basis functions derived from statistical analysis of large data sets. A key remaining limitation of AMIE-type estimations is the limited knowledge of auroral ionospheric conductivities, including limited understanding of nonlinear conductivities when electric fields are very strong. Neutral winds have heretofore been neglected, but they can sometimes have significant effects on the electrodynamics.",

Our study region samples the north Anatolian fault zone (NAFZ) near the epicentres of two large earthquakes that occurred in 1999 at Izmit (M7.5) and Düzce (M7.2) and where estimates of current slip rate are 20-25 mm/yr. We calculated receiver functions from teleseismic earthquakes that were recorded by a rectangular seismometer array spanning the NAFZ with 66 stations at a nominal inter-station spacing of 7 km and 7 additional stations further afield. We use a combination of H-K stacking, common conversion point migration and non-linear inversion of receiver function stacks to constrain the subsurface velocity structure and illuminate major changes in the architecture and properties of the upper crust, lower crust and upper mantle, both across the two NAFZ branches and along the NAFZ, at length scales of less than 20 km. We show that the northern NAFZ branch depth extent varies from the mid-crust to the upper mantle and it is likely to be less than 5 km wide. A high velocity lower crust and a region of crustal underthrusting appear to add strength to a heterogeneous crust and play a role in dictating the variation in faulting style and postseismic deformation. Furthermore, we show a direct relationship between crustal terrane, seismicity rate and seismicity depth, indicating that the brittle-ductile transition is likely to vary over horizontal length scales of less than 10 km.",

The radial and latitudinal components of the perturbation gravitational acceleration, due to density perturbations throughout the interior and to surface deformations, have latitudinally banded structures at Juno's orbital perijove, 1.07 R from Jupiter's center (R = Jupiter's radius). Likewise, the radial and latitudinal components of the magnetic field, generated deep below the surface, have latitudinally banded structures at perijove. However, neither field displays multiple narrow bands at high latitude when the model's convection zone extends down to a core of radius 0.1 R. The banded patterns are effectively gone at and beyond 3 R, leaving a dominantly dipolar pattern in the magnetic field. The longitudinal components of the gravity and magnetic fields at perijove are much smaller in amplitude, much less axisymmetric, and much more time-dependent. Our simulations suggest that, if latitudinally banded patterns in the gravity and magnetic fields are detected by NASA's Juno spacecraft, the strong zonal winds observed on Jupiter likely extend to a significant depth below the surface where the mass density and electrical conductivity are much greater than they are at the surface. On the other hand, no banded structures in these fields detected by Juno would suggest that the zonal winds on Jupiter are likely shallow atmospheric features.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric Δ14CO2 measurements have been made at Wellington, New Zealand, since December 1954. This is the longest 14CO2 record available from anywhere in the world, predating the 14C bomb spike by several years and documenting the movement of the bomb spike into the Southern Hemisphere and other parts of the global carbon cycle. In more recent times, the spatial and temporal changes in Δ14CO2 are thought to be dominated by two main drivers: (i) the addition of 14C-free, fossil-fuel derived CO2, which occurs mainly over Northern Hemisphere continents, and (ii) the net flux of 14C-depleted CO2 into the atmosphere from the oceans, most strongly from the Southern Ocean. Thus Δ14CO2 measurements can provide key information on both the source and fate of fossil fuel CO2 emissions. In particular, Southern Hemisphere Δ14CO2 records have the potential to elucidate the mechanisms that drive Southern Ocean carbon exchange, a key component of the global carbon cycle.\nWe will present an updated Wellington Δ14CO2 record. It is primarily based on ~2 week integrated samples collected by CO2 absorption into NaOH solution. The results have now been thoroughly reviewed, revised where necessary, and extended through to 2014. In addition, we use a series of new measurements on archived “NaOH” samples, archived whole air flask samples and tree rings to span gaps in the main record and to re-measure key periods, thereby producing a record with lower variability and higher precision. We use new modeling tools to examine the causes of the temporal variability in the Wellington 14CO2 record.",

            "abstract": "The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) was an impact ionization dust detector onboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer. Our current noise identification scheme allow us to unambiguously identify individual impacts from grains with radii a>0.7 um. LDEX observed a permanently present dust cloud engulfing the Moon which is non-spherical and asymmetric with respect to the direction of lunar orbital motion about the Sun, showing the highest exospheric dust densities in the 6-8 local time range. These density distributions are consistent with ejecta clouds generated from the continual bombardment of the lunar surface by sporadic interplanetary dust particles. During several of the well characterized annual meteor showers, LDEX also observed local density enhancements, especially during the Geminids. In addition to mapping out the lunar dust exosphere for large grains (a>0.7 um), LDEX was capable of searching for the putative population of 0.1 um dust grains posited to be electrostatically lofted over the lunar terminator. Throughout the mission, LDEX found no evidence for such phenomena to exist above the terminator. In this presentation, we describe the recently measured lunar dust exosphere and compare these observations with model results.",

            "abstract": "The Moon is unique among terrestrial planets for its lack of an atmosphere and global tectonic or volcanic processes. These factors and its position in the inner solar system mean that it is a potential repository of meteoritic material from all of the terrestrial planets. The National Research Council’s 2007 report on the Scientific Context for the Exploration of the Moon highlighted this unique possibility and defined the search for rare materials including those from the early Earth as a key goal for future lunar exploration. Armstrong et al. (2002) estimated that Earth material could be present at the 7 ppm level in surface lunar regolith and emphasized that since a single gram of lunar fines contains over 10 million particles, the search for terran material in lunar soils should begin with the current stock of lunar samples. Joy et al. (2012) demonstrated that mineral and lithologic relics of impactors can survive and be recognized in lunar samples, and recent work by Burchell et al. (2014) suggests that fossil fragments from Earth could survive the extreme shocks associated with transport to the Moon. Following the concept laid out by Armstrong et al. (2002), we are conducting a survey of lunar soil samples using microscopic hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy across visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared wavelengths to conduct a search for rare particles, including those that could be sourced from the early Earth. Our system currently consists of three microscopic imaging spectrometers with ~30 micron spatial resolution, permitting resolved imaging of individual grains. Fields of view of at least 1 cm and scan rates near 1 mm/sec permit rapid processing of relatively large quantities of sample. Existing spectrometers cover the 0.5 to 2.5 micron region, permitting detection and characterization of the common iron-bearing lunar minerals olivine and pyroxene, and the 8-14 micron region, which permits detection of other, rarer minerals of interest such as apatite and zircons. We are developing the capability to measure the 3 micron region to search for hydrated minerals. Our system also incorporates a micromanipulator which will be used for sorting of soils and isolation of grains of interest. We will report on the status of the system and progress towards identifying and isolating rare grains in lunar soils.",

And finally: much research money is wasted because reviewers point out fundamental flaws in experiment setups after the fact.\nIn this talk, I will present a new way of publishing scientific knowledge. A departure of the classic systems, my way aims to keep the thoroughness of the peer reviewed system, increase the effective use of funding and make more scientific knowledge publically available.

The goal is to determine the effect of an upstream turbine on the performance of the downstream turbine. Specifically, this study focuses on the changes in power generation that occur as the stream-wise spacing between devices is varied. Understanding the interaction between laboratory scaled marine hydrokinetic devices is a necessary step prior to field deployment. This study analyzes multiple aspects of the research problem to provide a global overview on the interaction between two devices. Testing was conducted in the hydraulic flume facility (9.8 m long, 1.2 m wide and 0.4 m deep) at Bucknell University. The devices were two-bladed model marine turbines with a rotor diameter of 0.1 m. Tests were performed for a fixed range of separation distances between the two devices. For each separation distance, thrust and generated power of both devices was measured. Moreover, the velocity profile and turbulence intensity incident on the downstream device was determined for each case. Results demonstrated that the performance of a downstream device was affected by the presence of the upstream turbine. The evolution of the wake velocity was strongly related to the power generation levels of the downstream marine hydrokinetic device. Results depicted that an ideal separation distance exists between devices such that the power generation and performance of the downstream marine hydrokinetic device are maximized.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring microseismicity is important for illuminating active faults and for improving our understanding of earthquake physics. This task is difficult in urban areas where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is poor, and the level of background seismicity is low. One example is the Newport-Inglewood fault (NIF), an active fault that traverses the city of Long-Beach (LB). The catalog magnitude of completeness within this area is M=2, about one unit larger than along other, less instrumented faults in southern California. Since earthquakes obey a power-law distribution according to which for each unit drop in magnitude the number of events increases by a factor of ten, reducing the magnitude of completeness in LB should significantly decrease the time needed for effective monitoring. During 2011, over 5000 seismometers were deployed for exploration purposes in a 70 km2 area covering LB, and recorded continuously for a period of six months. This experiment provides a unique opportunity for studying seismicity along the NIF. The recordings are dominated by anthropogenic noise sources such as the local airport, highways, and pumping in the LB oil field. We utilize array processing techniques to enhance the SNR. We downward continue the recorded wave field to a depth of a few kilometers, which allows us to detect signals whose amplitude is a few percent of the average surface noise. The migrated wave field is back-projected onto a volume beneath the city to search for seismic events. A preliminary analysis revealed a seismic swarm that lasted for a few weeks and exhibited complex spatial distribution. During the swarm coherent energy was continuously emitted from segments whose length is a few hundred meters, and that are located at depths of 10-15 kilometers. We developed a calibration scheme based on synthetic waveform modeling to determine the magnitude of the events, and find that it is considerably smaller than the magnitude of completeness of the local catalog.",

The primary goal of this framework is to estimate the degree to which climate change impacts and damages in the United States are avoided or reduced in the 21st century under multiple greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation scenarios. The first phase of the CIRA project is a modeling exercise that included two integrated assessment models and 15 sectoral models encompassing five broad impacts sectors: water resources, electric power, infrastructure, human health, and ecosystems. Three consistent socioeconomic and climate scenarios are used to analyze the benefits of global GHG mitigation targets: a reference scenario and two policy scenarios with total radiative forcing targets in 2100 of 4.5 W/m2 and 3.7 W/m2. In this exercise, the implications of key uncertainties are explored, including climate sensitivity, climate model, natural variability, and model structures and parameters. This presentation describes the motivations and goals of the CIRA project; the design and academic contribution of the first CIRA modeling exercise; and briefly summarizes several papers published in a special issue of Climatic Change. The results across impact sectors show that GHG mitigation provides benefits to the United States that increase over time, the effects of climate change can be strongly influenced by near-term policy choices, adaptation can reduce net damages, and impacts exhibit spatial and temporal patterns that may inform mitigation and adaptation policy discussions.",

            "abstract": "The Boise River Basin in southwest Idaho, USA contains three major reservoirs totaling nearly 1,000,000 acre-feet of storage capacity. The primary goals for water managers are water supply and flood protection. In terms of observed SWE at monitoring sites throughout the basin, water years 2012 and 2014 were similar and near normal. In WY 2014 inflows into the BRB reservoir system followed historic patterns and reservoir releases were ideally controlled for management goals. WY2012 however was warmer than average and the winter snowpack had uncharacteristically high melt susceptibility. Subsequent energy fluxes produced late winter inflows much higher than normally encountered. The uncharacteristic flow patterns and inability of traditional operational modeling tools to handle this situation challenged water managers. Through late March and early April 2012 near flood stage flows were pushed through the city of Boise in order to increase storage and prevent more catastrophic flooding. While in this case a greater catastrophe was narrowly averted, the shortcomings of the traditional modeling approaches taken by operational agencies were exposed. “Uncharacteristic” events such as these are becoming more and more frequent as the effects of climate change are realized. The need for modernized methods – ones based on the physical controlling processes rather than historic patterns – is imperative. This presentation outlines the latest developments in the application of a physically-based, high-resolution spatial snow model to aid operational water management decisions.",

While it is well known that fracturing of granular media strongly depends on the type of media, the pore fluids, and the fracking fluids, the interplay between multiphase flow, wettability and fracture mechanics of shale-like (nano-granular) materials remains poorly understood. Here, we study experimentally the dynamics of multiphase-flow fracking in nano-porous media and its dependence on the wetting properties of the system. The experiments consist in saturating a thin bed of glass beads with a viscous fluid, injecting a less viscous fluid, and imaging the invasion morphology. We investigate three control parameters: the injection rate of the less-viscous invading phase, the confining stress, and the contact angle, which we control by altering the surface chemistry of the beads and the Hele-Shaw cell. We quantify the dynamic fracture pattern by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV), and elucidate the role of wettability on the emerging flow physics at the length scale of the viscous–frictional instability.",

            "abstract": "Stratospheric sulfate aerosol (SSA) plays an important role in the earth climate system by reflecting solar radiation making it an attractive candidate in geoengineering to counter greenhouse warming. However, these planetary scales perturbations demand a priori understanding of SSA over a longer time period to resolve anthropogenic and natural perturbations to the delicate and thin layers- SSA and ozone layers. Here we present a quarter century high resolution seasonal record of SSA and its linkage to the ozone layer. Sulfate was extracted from a (1x1m) and 25m deep snow pit at the South Pole. The combination of cations, anions, O-triple isotopes and S-quadruple isotope measurements allowed us to deconvolve the oxidation history of SSA and tease out natural and anthropogenic components. The period (1980 to 2002) encompasses the largest volcanic eruptions of the century, El-Chichon, Pinatubo, Cerro Hudson and the three largest El-Nino Southern Oscillation events. The highest O-isotope anomaly (∆17O = 3.7‰) in SSA was observed during the super ENSO event (1997-98) and recorded changes in ozone levels of the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (\n1\n). ENSO is another flavor of natural climate variability and is important as it links hydrosphere and the atmosphere in unique ways controlling rainfall and temperature.\nThe highest S-isotope anomaly was observed in 1998-99 and records changes in atmospheric dynamics and transport of sulfur compounds to the stratosphere following intense wild fires as a consequence of the Super ENSO event. The highest S-isotopic anomaly (∆33S = +2.26‰ and ∆36S= +0.51 ‰) is ~ 3 times higher compared to the Pinatubo signal, the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. The pattern of S-isotope anomalies in this period fits within the pre-Cambrian record of S-isotopes in three billion year old rock. The generation of such a large S-isotope anomaly in the present day oxygen rich atmosphere may have implications for the interpretation of Archean sulfate deposits(2). Our high resolution record of S-isotope anomaly in a volcanically quiescent and non ENSO time period (∆36S= −0.6 ± 0.2‰) indicates ~ 12 gigatonne transport of tropospheric S to the stratosphere and may have implications for understanding of global warming hiatus reported to be associated with the ENSO events (3).",

The study is strongly dependent on Cassini’s highly elliptical orbits that restrict useful observations to specific orbits and parts of orbits to avoid weak azimuthal fields associated with the magnetopause or other magnetospheric currents. An example is the selection of thirteen identical orbits near 22 +/- 2 hours Local Time and restriction of the data to 4 to 10 Saturn radii. Inferred IP profiles between 10° and 25° ionospheric co-latitude, θi , when averaged, are similar in shape to model predictions with a peak value of 5 million amperes. However, the individual profiles vary significantly, the result of dynamics associated with large-scale motions of the magnetospheric field. The Cowley-Vasyliunas model also relates IP(θi) to magnetospheric rotation rates, ΩS, equivalent to the SKR period, and the sub-corotation rate, ω, and provides a means of estimating ω / ΩS in the night-side magnetosphere as compared to the dayside rotation rates obtained from azimuthal plasma velocity measurements, VΦ. Other carefully- selected orbits extend these results to different ranges in θi and Local Times and provide further values of important magnetospheric parameters and allow additional testing of the model.",

            "abstract": "The recent, large increase in seismic activity within the central and eastern U.S. may be connected to an increase in fluid injection activity since ~2001. Anomalous seismic sequences can easily be identified in regions with low background seismicity rates. Here, we analyze seismicity in plate boundary regions where tectonically-driven earthquake sequences are common, potentially masking injection-induced events. We show results from a comprehensive analysis of waste water disposal wells in Kern county, the largest oil-producing county in California. We focus on spatial-temporal correlations between seismic and injection activity and seismicity-density changes due to injection. We perform a probabilistic assessment of induced vs. tectonic earthquakes, which can be applied to different regions independent of background rates and may provide insights into the probability of inducing earthquakes as a function of injection parameters and local geological conditions. Our results show that most earthquakes are caused by tectonic forcing, however, waste water injection contributes to seismic activity in four different regions with several events above M4. The seismicity shows different migration characteristics relative to the injection sites, including linear and non-linear trends. The latter is indicative of diffusive processes which take advantage of reservoir properties and fault structures and can induce earthquakes at distances of up to 10 km. Our results suggest that injection-related triggering processes are complex, possibly involving creep, and delayed triggering. Pore-pressure diffusion may be more extensive in the presence of active faults and high-permeability damage zones thus altering the local seismic hazard in a non-linear fashion. As a consequence, generic “best-practices” for fluid injections like a maximum distance from the nearest active fault may not be sufficient to mitigate a potential seismic hazard increase.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that the strength of the ionospheric response to a geomagnetic storm may be a function of Universal Time (UT), with storms that peak in the post-noon UT having the strongest reaction. The strength of the ring current has also been observed to depend on the UT of the storm peak. A recent superposed epoch analysis found that storm intensity is enhanced when the storm peak occurs near 0 UT compared to 12 UT. Ionospheric outflow has been shown to be a significant contributor to magnetospheric dynamics, especially during storm time. It is possible that the changes in the ring current resulting from outflow significantly contribute to the subsequent UT effect. The Polar Wind Outflow Model (PWOM) and the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) are used to investigate this dependence by simulating particular storms shifted both to each of the seasons, and in time during the day. The system response is analyzed and compared for both hemispheres using an unshifted base simulation for each storm. The total electron content, electron and ion temperatures, total ionospheric outflow fluence at different altitudes, as well as the magnitude and spatial distributions of outflow are investigated.

            "abstract": "The impact of changes in the frequency and severity of drought on fresh water sustainability is a great concern for many regions of the world. One such location is the High Plains, where the local economy is primarily driven by fresh water withdrawals from the Ogallala Aquifer, which accounts for approximately 30% of total irrigation withdrawals from all U.S. aquifers combined. Modeling studies that focus on the feedback mechanisms that control the climate and eco-hydrology during times of drought are limited in the sense that they use conventional General Circulation Models (GCMs) with grid length scales ranging from one hundred to several hundred kilometers. Additionally, these models utilize crude statistical parameterizations of cloud processes for estimating sub-grid fluxes of heat and moisture and have a poor representation of land surface heterogeneity. For this research, we focus on the 2012 High Plains drought, and will perform numerical simulations using three single column model versions of the Community Earth System Model (SCM-CESM) at multiple sites overlying the Ogallala Aquifer for the 2010-2012 period. In the first version of SCM-CESM, CESM will be used in standard mode (Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) coupled to a single instance of the Community Land Model (CLM)), secondly, CESM will be used in Super-Parameterized mode (SP-CESM), where a cloud resolving model (CRM consists of 32 atmospheric columns) replaces the standard CAM atmospheric parameterization and is coupled to a single instance of CLM, and thirdly, CESM is used in “Multi Instance” SP-CESM mode, where an instance of CLM is coupled to each CRM column of SP-CESM (32 CRM columns coupled to 32 instances of CLM). To assess the physical realism of the land-atmosphere feedbacks simulated at each site by all versions of SCM-CESM, differences in simulated energy and moisture fluxes will be computed between years for the 2010-2012 period, and will be compared to differences calculated using observational data from the AmeriFlux tower network for the same period. Understanding the large and small-scale land-atmosphere feedbacks is very important for drought, and results from this research will give some insight to the feedbacks GCMs may produce when atmospheric and land surface heterogeneity are included within a single modeling framework.",

            "abstract": "Making unbiased measurements of trends in the surface temperatures, particularly on a gobal scale, is challenging: While the non-frozen oceans temperature measurements are plentiful and accurate, land and polar areas are much less accurately or fairly sampled. Surface temperature deduced from infrared radiometers on polar orbiting satellites (e.g. the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) at 1:30PM, the Interferometer Atmosphere Sounding Interferometer (IASI) at 9:30 AM and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) at 1:30PM), can produce what appear to be well sampled data, but dealing with clouds either by cloud filtering (MODIS, IASI) or cloud-clearing (AIRS) can create sampling bias. We use a novel method: Random Nadir Sampling (RNS) combined with Probability Density Function (PDF) analysis. We analyze the trend in the PDF of st1231, the water vapor absorption corrected brightness temperatures measured in the 1231 cm-1 atmospheric window channel. The advantage of this method is that trends can be directly traced to the known, less than 3 mK/yr trend for AIRS, in st1231. For this study we created PDFs from 22,000 daily RNS from the AIRS and IASI data. We characterized the PDFs by its daily 90%tile value, st1231p90, and analysed the statistical properties of the this time series between 2002 and 2014. The method was validated using the daily NOAA SST (RTGSST) from the non-frozen oceans: The mean, seasonal variability and anomaly trend of st1231p90 agree with the corrsponding values from the RTGSST and the anomaly correlation is larger than 0.9. Preliminary results (August 2014) confirm the global hiatus in the increase of the globally averaged surface temperatures between 2002 and 2014, with a change of less than 10 mK/yr. This uncertainty is dominated by the large interannual variability related to El Niño events. Further insite is gained by analyzing land/ocean, day/night, artic and antarctic trends. We observe a massive warming trend in the Artic between 2002 and 2007, which has since level off, but no significant trend in the Antarctic. The AIRS results since 2002 are confirmed by IASI data since 2007.\nThis work was supported by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

            "abstract": "Coal consumption in China is increasing annually due to constantly rising energy demand. As a result, a massive amount of coal combustion byproducts, particularly in the form of fly ash, are expelled from power plants and distributed through atmospheric transport. The fly ash is eventually deposited on to land, potentially contaminating agricultural soils. Coal fly ash contains high concentration of a suite of toxic trace metals including lead, chromium, and arsenic. In this study, we surveyed the concentration of trace metals in agricultural soils at 131 sites within a 20 km radius of Yangluo Power Plant, a 2400 MW plant within the highly populated Jianghan Plain of Central China. Using X-ray fluorecence (XRF) spectrometry, the total concentration of trace metals in homogenized surface and subsurface soil samples were measured to calculate the corresponding enrichment factor at each site. Our initial findings demonstrate that Pb is enriched in a majority of sites, independent of land use, whereas As and Cr are generally not enriched in this region. Further studies using Pb isotopes as a source-tracing tool will help determine the Pb pollution’s origin. Ultimately, the results of this study may inform whether crops grown within the Jianghan Plain have the potential of being contaminated by metals emitted from coal power plants.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic cyclones exhibiting properties of both tropical and extratropical systems have been categorized as subtropical cyclones (STCs) since the early 1950s. The opportunity to investigate the roles of baroclinic and diabatic processes during the evolution of STCs from a potential vorticity (PV) perspective motivates this study. This study investigates the roles of baroclinic and diabatic processes during the evolution of STCs by calculating three PV metrics from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis 0.5° gridded dataset. The three PV metrics quantify the relative contributions of lower-tropospheric baroclinic processes, midtropospheric diabatic heating, and upper-tropospheric dynamical processes during the evolution of individual cyclones. Quantification of these three contributions reveals the changing PV structure of an individual cyclone, indicates fluctuations in the dominant energy source of the cyclone, and aids in categorizing the cyclone.\nAn evaluation of the relative contributions of lower-tropospheric baroclinic processes, midtropospheric diabatic heating, and upper-tropospheric dynamical processes during the evolution of individual cyclones, in addition to an evaluation of the sign of upper-tropospheric thermal vorticity, will be used to identify North Atlantic STCs and construct a 1979–2010 climatology. North Atlantic STCs included in the climatology are associated with an upper-tropospheric disturbance, positive upper-tropospheric thermal vorticity, and varying degrees of midtropospheric diabatic heating and lower-tropospheric baroclinicity. A cyclone-relative composite analysis performed on subjectively constructed clusters of North Atlantic STCs that represent the most common upper-tropospheric features linked to STC formation will be presented to document the structure, motion, and evolution of these features during STC life cycles. It is hypothesized that STCs forming in association with similar upper-tropospheric features will exhibit characteristic PV evolutions during their life cycles, which will be diagnosed in terms of the three aforementioned PV metrics. Case studies also will be presented to illustrate the characteristic PV evolutions of STCs during their life cycles for each cluster.",

The ability to predict geomagnetic storms, however, is still a big challenge because details on this Bz fields are difficult to be obtained with a lead time of tens of hours to days. If estimates of Bz and solar wind speed at 1AU are available, it is possible to derive the peak Disturbance Storm-Time Dst index using Burton et al. (1975) formula. Previous works have addressed empirical methods to obtain Bz from total magnetic field strength and solar wind velocity inside interplanetary magnetic clouds. Empirical estimates of ICME speeds at 1AU from CME speeds measured in coronagraphs have also been proposed. In this work, an attempt is made to forecast the geomagnetic Dst index using observations of coronal mass ejection (CME) expansion speed observed in coronagraphs. Only those cases in which a CME was associated with a magnetic cloud at 1 AU are addressed.",

Using over 310,000 high-quality radial receiver functions recorded by the USArray and other seismic stations in the contiguous United States, the depths of the d410 and d660 are mapped in over 1000 consecutive overlapping circles with a radius of 1 degree. The average MTZ thickness for both the western and central/eastern US is within 3 km from the global average of 250 km, suggesting an overall normal MTZ temperature beneath both areas. The Pacific Coast Ranges and the southern Basin and Range Province are underlain by a depressed d410, indicating higher-than-normal temperature in the upper MTZ. The proposed Yellowstone and Raton hotspots are not associated with clear undulations of the MTZ discontinuities, but d410 beneath another proposed hotspot, Bermuda, is depressed significantly and d660 has a normal depth. Low-temperature regions are found in the upper MTZ associated with the subducted Juan de Fuca slab beneath the northern Rocky Mountains, and in two circular areas beneath the northern Basin and Range Province and the southern Colorado Plateau. Part of the Great Plains is characterized by a depressed d660. This observation, when combined with results from seismic tomography, suggests the existence of a cold region in the lower MTZ, probably associated with subducted Farallon slab segments.",

            "abstract": "Variations of gas density and composition in Earth’s upper atmosphere create trajectory and orbit control problems for satellites of all sizes and significantly affect interactions between different layers of Earth’s atmosphere. Mass Spectrometers are among an array of instruments used to explore Earth’s upper atmosphere and other space environments. Normally, these instruments are substantial in size and deployed on larger satellites and space probes to perform studies of atmospheric properties while in orbit. Data from these studies generally provides information from a specific point in time at a single location. Studies of atmospheric density and composition with multiple locations for each time point could be performed by CubeSat swarms if proper instrumentation were available to fit CubeSat payload restrictions. The proposed miniaturized time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (MS) will have a mass resolution and range sufficient for measuring the free ion density of Earth’s ionosphere while operating within the power and space constraints of a CubeSat. This capability can potentially dramatically reduce the cost of future missions while simultaneously enhancing the science return. Elements from existing TOF-MS designs, including the use of spatial focusing, an ion mirror and signal processing techniques, will be used to achieve the desired range and resolution. SIMION simulation of charged particle flight through the instrument has been used to evaluate electric field designs for the instrument and explore resolution refinement techniques.",

            "abstract": "The age model for relative paleointensity stack PISO-1500 (Channell et al., 2009) is based on IODP U1308 from North Atlantic. Channell et al. (2008) developed the age model for U1308 by correlating the benthic oxygen isotope curve with LR04 oxygen isotope stack (Lisiecki&Raymo, 2005). LR04 stack is known as oxygen isotope stack for benthic foraminifarra, whose age model is dependent on ice volume model with a certain time lag. On the other hand, Caballero-Gill et al. (2012) developed an absolute age model based on U-Th dating for stalagmites from China and correlated the oxygen isotope curve with that on planctonic foraminiferra for a deep-sea core from South China Sea. The age model based on absolute dating for stalagmite was then transfered to oxygen isotope curve of benthic forraminiferra for the same core. This enables to provide absolute age model on PISO-1500 for the past 350 kyrs. The resulting modified PISO-1500 was applied on paleomagnetic records from Lake Baikal to provide an age model based on relative paleointensity. Finally, this age model was compared with alternative age model based on correlation of biogenic silica record with insolation at the site (Prokopenko et al., 2006) and the reason for the discrepancy will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Breaking waves on the ocean surface result in the entrainment of air bubbles that scavenge organic matter from seawater as they rise to the surface. When injected to the atmosphere, the bubbles burst and yield primary super- and sub-micrometer sea spray aerosol (SSA). Understanding the source, emission, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity, and direct radiative forcing of SSA is required for accurately modeling its impact on tropospheric chemistry, marine boundary layer cloud properties, and Earth’s radiation balance. We report here measurements of the properties of freshly emitted sea spray aerosols produced with an in situ particle generator (Sea Sweep) during two cruises in the North Atlantic. The first cruise was conducted in August of 2012 and the second in May and June of 2014. Particular emphasis was put on the measurement of the composition, number concentration, and CCN activity of sub-180 nm SSA as this is the size range that dominates the marine boundary layer CCN population. During both cruises, ocean regions with a range of surface seawater chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), particulate organic carbon (POC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were targeted. Relationships between these surface seawater parameters and the enrichment of organic carbon in sub-180 nm SSA and the CCN activity of monodisperse aerosol ranging between 40 and 110 nm will be presented.\nDuring the 2014 cruise, sustained periods of wind speeds greater than 15 m/s were encountered which allowed for the measurement of ambient sub-180 nm and submicrometer aerosol under high wind conditions. Properties of SSA generated with Sea Sweep and ambient marine boundary layer aerosol present under high wind conditions will be presented and compared. Measured properties include particle number size distribution and chemical composition, volatility at 230 degrees C, and CCN activity.\nProperties of freshly emitted sea spray aerosol and ambient aerosol measured under high wind conditions from the North Atlantic will be compared to what might be expected over the remote Southern Ocean given differences in surface seawater organic matter and atmospheric wind and transport patterns.",

Traditionally, plasma eruptions and wave phenomena in the solar atmosphere are modeled by prescribing artificial driving mechanisms using magnetic or gas pressure forces that might arise from magnetic field emergence or reconnection instabilities. In contrast, our 'ab initio' simulations provide a realistic description of solar dynamics naturally driven by solar energy flow. By simulating the upper convection zone and the solar atmosphere, we can investigate in detail the physical processes of turbulent magnetoconvection, generation and amplification of magnetic fields, excitation of MHD waves, and plasma eruptions. We present recent simulation results of the multi-scale dynamics of quiet-Sun regions, and energetic effects in the atmosphere and compare with observations.

            "abstract": "Reconstructing the timing and nature of past changes in aquatic productivity in the Gulf of Alaska (GoA) can shed light on the primary processes driving biogeochemical cycling over geologic timescales. Here, we present sedimentologic, physical property, stable isotope, and biogenic opal concentration data from IODP Expedition 341 Sites U1417 and U1419 and identify intervals where diatom ooze lithofacies and geochemical evidence for increased algal productivity are prevalent during the Pleistocene. Sites U1417 and U1419 are located in the center and the margin of the Fe-limited GoA, respectively, and they offer the potential to characterize past changes in biogeochemical cycling during different Pleistocene time intervals.\nSite U1419 cores were collected from a small slope basin at the edge of the continental shelf. Sediment cores reveal two prominent ~6-m-thick intervals of diatomaceous ooze. Between these intervals are numerous 20-cm-thick sections of biogenic-rich sediment, interbedded with gray mud that commonly contains lonestones. Based on preliminary age models, the two diatom ooze intervals likely correspond to the Holocene and MIS 3, while the intervening interbedded glacigenic and biogenic sediment can broadly be ascribed to MIS 2. Diatomaceous ooze and diatom-rich sediments are generally characterized by lower magnetic susceptibility, natural gamma ray, bulk density, and higher b* color reflectance. Initial C & N concentration and stable isotopic data show elevated concentrations and more positive stable isotope values during the Holocene and MIS 3, which approximate the isotopic signature of modern phytoplankton measured in the GoA. Within the glacial period, the biogenic-rich intervals are also characterized by more positive C and N isotopic values. When combined with the shipboard physical property data, the stable isotopic results are indicative of millennial-scale variations in productivity and/or changes in glacial ice extent in the GoA during the last glacial period. We will discuss these results in the context of an improved isotope stratigraphy and ongoing work examining multiple interglacial productivity variations at Site U1417.",

Based on previously collected logging-while-drilling (LWD) borehole data, these gas hydrate study sites are known to include high concentrations of gas hydrate within sand layers.\nAt GC955 our new 2D data reveal at least three features that appear to be fluid-flow pathways (chimneys) responsible for gas migration and thus account for some aspects of the gas hydrate distribution observed in the LWD data. Our new data also show that the main gas hydrate target, a Pleistocene channel/levee complex, has an areal extent of approximately 5.5 square kilometers and that a volume of approximately 3 x 107 cubic meters of this body lies within the gas hydrate stability zone. Based on LWD-inferred values and reasonable assumptions for net sand, sand porosity, and gas hydrate saturation, we estimate a total equivalent gas-in-place volume of approximately 8 x 108 cubic meters for the inferred gas hydrate within the channel/levee deposits. At WR313 we are able to map the thin hydrate-bearing sand layers in considerably greater detail than that provided by previous data. We also can map the evolving and migrating channel feature that persists in this area. Together these data and the emerging results provide valuable new insights into the gas hydrate systems at these two sites.",

Students play the role of mission scientists for a NASA rover mission, tasked with targeting the rover’s scientific instruments to investigate a specific scientific question about the landing site. As with the real mission, the student operators must optimize the efficient use of limited resources and time against the need to make observations to address working hypotheses. The activity uses only real--not artificial or simulated--mission data, and students are guided throughout by a “Mission Manager” who provides hints and advice about the scientific meaning of observations within the broader context of the mission objectives. The MER Opportunity EVFE is a pilot effort, the first of five EVFE modules planned a rate of one per year that will feature different NASA missions and scientific topics. The MER Opportunity EVFE has already been developed and focuses on the investigation of the history of water on Mars at the Meridiani landing site of the Opportunity rover.

            "abstract": "The Alaskan region has historically been a sink of atmospheric CO2, but permafrost currently stores large amounts of carbon that are vulnerable to release to the atmosphere as northern high-latitudes continue to warm faster than the global average. We use aircraft CO2 data with a remote-sensing based model driven by MODIS satellite products and validated by CO2 flux tower data to calculate average daily CO2 fluxes for the region of Alaska during the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013. Atmospheric trace gases were measured during CARVE (Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment) aboard the NASA Sherpa C-23 aircraft. For profiles along the flight track, we couple the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model, and convolve these footprints of surface influence with our remote-sensing based model, the Polar Vegetation Photosynthesis Respiration Model (PolarVPRM). We are able to calculate average regional fluxes for each month by minimizing the difference between the data and model column integrals. Our results provide a snapshot of the current state of regional Alaskan growing season net ecosystem exchange (NEE). We are able to begin characterizing the interannual variation in Alaskan NEE and to inform future refinements in process-based modeling that will produce better estimates of past, present, and future pan-Arctic NEE. Understanding if/when/how the Alaskan region transitions from a sink to a source of CO2 is crucial to predicting the trajectory of future climate change.",

            "abstract": "Forest structure plays a critical role in the exchange of energy, carbon and water between land and atmosphere and nutrient cycle. We can provide detailed forest structure measurements of leaf and woody components with the Dual Wavelength Echidna® Lidar (DWEL), which acquires full-waveform scans at both near-infrared (NIR, 1064 nm) and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1548 nm) wavelengths from simultaneous laser pulses. We collected DWEL scans at a broadleaf forest stand and a conifer forest stand at Harvard Forest in June 2014. Power returned from leaves is much lower than from woody materials such as trunks and branches at the SWIR wavelength due to the liquid water absorption by leaves, whereas returned power at the NIR wavelength is similar from both leaves and woody materials. We threshold a normalized difference index (NDI), defined as the difference between returned power at the two wavelengths divided by their sum, to classify each return pulse as a leaf or trunk/branch hit. We obtain leaf area index (LAI), woody area index (WAI) and vertical profiles of leaf and woody components directly from classified lidar hits without empirical wood-to-total ratios as are commonly used in optical methods of LAI estimation. Tree heights, diameter at breast height (DBH), and stem count density are the other forest structure parameters estimated from our DWEL scans. The separation of leaf and woody components in tandem with fine-scale forest structure measurements will benefit studies on carbon allocation of forest ecosystems and improve our understanding of the effects of forest structure on ecosystem functions.\nThis research is supported by NSF grant, MRI-0923389",

The initial phase of development displays crust layer thicknesses, surface heat flux due to heat-producing elements, uranium, thorium and potassium, and the surface geo-neutrino flux from these elements in the mantle and crust. It permits users to define heat-producing element concentrations in the mantle, including a global constraint on the radiogenic power and the Th/U and K/U ratios of the bulk silicate Earth. Moreover, users have various output visualization options for geo-neutrinos, including flux or detectable signal from relevant heat-producing elements. The mantle signal is available in several forms as a function of the background from the crust and nuclear reactors. Our goal is to implement a tool for education and outreach as well as the research community.",

            "abstract": "The partitioning of incident precipitation by a forest canopy into throughfall and stemflow varies as a function of meteorological conditions, tree species, leaf morphology and surface roughness. Little work quantified the throughfall drop size signature of precipitation events relative to changes in leaf canopy state of deciduous forests. This is the first study to compare throughfall drop size distributions in the presence and absence of foliage. To quantify individual throughfall drops, a laser disdrometer gauge was deployed below an observed drip point under a Liriodendron tulipifera L. (yellow poplar) tree, in northeastern Maryland, USA. More than 750,000 individual throughfall droplets have been counted and measured from precipitation events generating more than 5 mm gross rainfall over a period of 12 months. Throughfall during leafless events had significantly larger maximum drop diameters (6.74mm leafless, 5.55mm leafed) and median volume diameter of drops (5.44mm leafless, 3.31mm leafed) than throughfall generated when leaves were present. Statistical techniques have demonstrated the substantial influence of canopy state over the drop size spectra. Principal component analysis and factor analysis both resulted in canopy state loading positively with increases in maximum drop diameter while loading negatively with air temperature. Boosted regression trees analysis corroborated these findings. Our findings correspond with the physical conditions of a leafless canopy, and illustrated the greater extent of surface adhesion of intercepted water films on woody surfaces as opposed to foliar surfaces, thereby underscoring the importance of canopy state on throughfall inputs.",

In the Southwest Asia (SWA) regional domain, dust forecast products from MEPS are of particular interest. Over the past few years, subject matter experts at AFWA have acquired and implemented datasets and developed a soil moisture algorithm that have improved skill scores of dust forecasts in the AFWA GOddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) module within the Weather Research and Forecast with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model. The aforementioned datasets include, but are not limited to, the Desert Research Institute (DRI) dust source region and a dynamic 8-day Leaf Area Index (LAI) vegetation mask. We then tested these individual datasets as ensemble perturbations in all ten MEPS test members during a three-week “dust offensive” test over SWA in spring 2014. Remote sensing specialists at AFWA meticulously documented the locations, duration, and intensity of numerous dust events over the SWA domain during the three weeks. These data were then used for subjective verification of each individual MEPS member and of the individual perturbations within members. Results from the subjective verification showed that individual MEPS members with the DRI dust source region significantly outperformed members that used the standard Ginoux dust source region. The other individual perturbations tested were determined to have a neutral effect (i.e., neither degrading nor improving skill) on individual members during the three-week period. Thus, the DRI dust source region is now used in the majority of MEPS members in both the 4-km SWA domain and the 20-km hemispheric domain. The other individual perturbations are now utilized in a minority of MEPS members. However, additional testing is still needed over other domains to determine if the improved dust forecasting skill has spatial consistency and to ensure that other pertinent forecast products from MEPS are not being degraded.",

Lack\nof large scale active region creation in the ADAPT model caused ensemble bias when assimilating observations of\nnewly created regions using ensemble Kalman methods.

Coronae are ~200 km wide, and are surrounded by concentric, sub-parrallel lineations, that have been interpreted as extensional tectonic and volcanic landforms.\nHere we test the hypothesis coronae formed as a result of convection in Miranda’s ice mantle during an episode of tidal heating. Using numerical models of spherical convection, we show that if Miranda’s surface is weak, sluggish lid convection can occur, which simultaneously generates the concentric deformation patterns observed in the coronae, the inferred thermal gradient predicted by models of flexure, and the approximate number of plumes necessary to form the coronae.\nWe have tested the influence of core size on convection geometry. For basal Rayleigh numbers between 10^5 and 10^8, and for effective viscosity contrasts less than 10^4, we found that low-order convection patterns only remain stable for core radii less than half the satellite radius. This suggests that low-order convection patterns may be more likely to develop in planets and satellites with small cores, however we find that the distribution of tidal heating within icy satellites also strongly influences convection geometry.",

            "abstract": "Large-domain regional climate models often suffer from biases in their atmospheric circulation, moisture, and temperature fields due, in part, to poor representation of planetary scale waves and stratospheric processes. Spectral nudging – where the largest scales of a finite-area model are incrementally nudged toward a reference dataset – is one method of reducing these biases. A few recent publications have investigated the impact of spectral nudging on atmospheric regional climate simulations, however testing of nudging within a fully coupled system has not been performed. Thus to eliminate atmospheric biases in the Regional Arctic System Model and explore the sensitivity of the coupled system to the degree of data assimilation and thus atmospheric constraint, we perform a series of sensitivity experiments applying spectral nudging to WRF with the WRF Four-dimensional Data Assimilation (FDDA) package. Using FDDA allows us to tightly constrain RASM-WRF by its atmospheric reanalysis boundary conditions (ERA Interim), which already include direct data assimilation of a very large quantity of observations (i.e., satellite radiances, radiosondes, etc).\nWith well-configured nudging in RASM-WRF and standalone WRF, we can virtually eliminate atmospheric biases in highly constrained and well-observed variables (e.g. SLP). However, both coupled and uncoupled simulations still have some large biases compared to atmospheric reanalysis in variables that aren’t directly nudged in WRF or as well-observed (e.g., radiation and cloud cover). Using a series of multi-decade WRF and RASM simulations driven with reanalyses, we examine the sensitivity of large-scale atmospheric climate representation (i.e., SLP biases, etc) and the surface interface (heat fluxes, etc), as well as sea ice diagnostics (e.g., extent and concentration), to nudging in our large-domain, coupled system. We show that with no nudging RASM’s climate moves to a very unrealistic state, but that with over-constrained nudging we get unrealistic interchanges of fluxes at the surface interface (since the reanalysis forcing has different sea surface temperatures and weather than RASM’s ocean), highlighting the importance of nudging configuration in regional climate model simulations.",

            "abstract": "The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) provide an historic opportunity to significantly improve Earth and space science (ESS) education nationally at the K-12 level. The increased emphasis on ESS related topics in the NGSS relative to previous standards provides a real opportunity for ensuring all K-12 students in adopting states learn about the ESS - allowing us to reach many more students than are currently are exposed to our discipline. The new standards are also exciting in that they explicitly couple science and engineering practice, cross-cutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas in such a way that student must actively demonstrate their understanding through actions rather than through mere regurgitation of memorized responses. Achieving mastery of NGSS Performance Expectations will require practice with higher-order learning skills - with students engaging in the practices of scientists and engineers. Preparing students for this mastery will be a challenging task for teachers, since in many states professional development support is limited at best for the current curriculum - let alone the curricula that will be developed to address the NGSS. As adoption of the NGSS expands across the country, states will be at various levels of implementation of the new standards over the next several years - and there is real concern that teachers must have sufficient professional development to be able to be successful in preparing their students - particularly in view of likely coupled assessments and teacher evaluations. NESTA strongly supports implementation of the NGSS, and the rigorous and compelling ESS education it will engender, when coupled with a strong emphasis nationwide on teacher professional development. For the past two years, the National Earth Science Teachers Association (NESTA) has continued our leadership in K-12 ESS education through workshops, web seminars, events and publications that emphasize implementation of the NGSS in ESS-related courses. Our recent survey of K-12 Earth and space science educators confirms widespread enthusiasm about the potential offered by the new standards, as well as concern about the urgent need for professional development to support teacher implementation of the standards.",

Though poorly understood, these changes may have profound effects on local Antarctic ecosystems. This research project aims to identify these changes through the compositional analysis of Antarctic phytoplankton using DNA sequencing supported by fluorescent microscopy. During the 2013 and 2014 blooming seasons, December to March, water samples were obtained from Palmer Station (located on the WAP) and filtered through 3 μm/0.8 μm filters. DNA was extracted from the water samples using the Qiagen Plant Kit, quantified through use of both Nanodrop and Picogreen technology, quality-checked by gel electrophoresis, and sent to be sequenced. Additionally, major phytoplankton species were identified through microscope imaging and preliminary counts were made for four important dates, two located at the peaks of phytoplankton blooms. From these four samples alone, it appeared that cryptomonads dominated the primary bloom whereas diatoms, both centric and pennate, were more abundant during the second bloom. In the future, these results will be tested against sequencing data. Through continued year-by-year analysis of Antarctic phytoplankton abundance levels, it will be possible to identify trends that may be crucial to understanding the dynamic Antarctic ecosystem.",

Environmental conditions and vegetation cover are strong controls on soil carbon storage, respiration, and temperature sensitivity of decomposition. Temperature control of soil organic matter processing is particularly important in permafrost soils, which contain more than two times the carbon in the atmosphere and exist at the freeze-thaw threshold. To investigate sensitivity of decomposition to abiotic controls in a heterogeneous landscape, we conducted a laboratory incubation experiment on mineral soils collected in shrub and graminoid vegetation types near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. We crossed temperature and moisture treatments and measured soil respiration rates over a seven-week incubation period. We measured soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations through elemental analysis and conducted sequential chemical extractions to measure carbon fractions and quantify soil carbon quality. Results show soils overlain by graminoids have higher carbon concentrations at shallow depth and respiration rates than soils overlain by shrub (mean ± 1 s.e. organic carbon concentration, 0-10 cm: graminoid = 68.7 ± 8.1 mg C * g soil-1, shrub = 48.8 ± 2.9 mg C * g soil-1). Temperature sensitivity was higher in graminoid soils, with no effect from soil moisture level. Carbon fractions and quality varied by vegetation type and profile depth. This study informs our understanding of the relationship between carbon quality and the temperature and moisture sensitivity of decomposition in western Greenland and demonstrates the importance of landscape heterogeneity in understanding soil carbon response to environmental drivers.",

EPMA analysis was also completed on three light-toned clasts and a dark-toned clast in the meteorite. The light-toned clasts have Al/Si vs. (Fe+Mg)/Si compositions ranging from felsic to mafic, and the dark-toned clast shows a mafic composition. A Sammon’s map was created to compare LIBS data for NWA 7034 and ChemCam targets Stark, Crestaurum, Link, Portage, Jake_M, Mara, Thor_Lake, Coronation, Pearson, and Prebble. This nonlinear statistical mapping technique is used for clustering assessment of LIBS data in two dimensions. The map shows NWA 7034 clustering in its own location, and the closest similar ChemCam rock targets are La_Reine and Ashuamipi, which are both coarse grained targets that have a mafic component consistent with augite. The most similar ChemCam soil targets are the Crestaurum and Portage. Creation of maps with a greater number of targets will show more of the similarities between NWA 7034 and ChemCam target rocks and soils. Further analysis will compare NWA 7034 LIBS data, data from the paired meteorite NWA 7533, and a variety of ChemCam targets that are similar in morphology and texture.",

            "abstract": "The Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard Suomi-NPP represents a major advancement in night time imaging capabilities. DNB covers almost 7 orders of magnitude in its dynamic range from full sunlight to quarter moon. To achieve this large dynamic range, it uses four charge-coupled device (CCD) arrays in three gain stages. The low gain stage (LGS) gain is calibrated using the solar diffuser. In operations, the medium and high gain stage values are determined by multiplying the gain ratios between the medium gain stage (MGS), and LGS, and high gain stage (HGS) and LGS, respectively. This work focuses on independently verifying the radiometric accuracy and stability of DNB HGS using DNB observation of ground vicarious sites under lunar illumination at night. Dome C in Antarctic and Greenland in northern hemisphere are chosen as the vicarious sites. Nadir observations of these high latitude regions by VIIRS are selected during perpetual night season, i.e. from April to August for Dome C and from Nov. to Jan. for Greenland over the year 2012 to 2013. Additional selection criteria such as lunar phase being more than half moon and no influence of straylight effects are also applied in data selection. Lunar spectral irradiance model, as a function of Sun-Earth-Moon distances and lunar phase, is used to determine the top-of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance at the vicarious site. The vicariously-derived long-term reflectance from DNB observations agrees with the reflectance derived from Hyperion observations. The vicarious trending of DNB radiometric performance using DOME-C and Greenland under moon light shows that the DNB HGS radiometric variability (relative accuracy to lunar irradiance model and Hyperion observation) is within 10%. Residue variability and future work are also discussed.",

In contrast, limited studies have been developed on the stratigraphic and deformational record of magmatic and sedimentary sequences exposed near the suture zones.\nNew field and petrologic data are used to characterize an ophiolite type sequence that outcrops in the western flank from the northwestern segment of the Central Cordillera of Colombia. Stratigraphic analysis indicate the existence of Albian-Aptian deep marine pelitic sequence interbedded with minor chert and thin quartz sandstone beds that apparently change to a volcanic dominate stratigraphy. Deformed ophiolite-like mafic and ultramafic plutonic rocks and isolated pillow lavas are also exposed to the east in fault contact with the pelitic sequence.\nThe pelitic and interlayered volcanic rocks represent the growth of an extensional Early-Cretaceous basin that followed a Late-Jurassic magmatic quiescence in the Northern Andes. The volcano-sedimentary record is probably related to the growth of a fore-arc basin in a new subduction zone that extends until the Late Cretaceous.\nThe deformation and obduction of the ophiolitic association and the fore-arc basin were probably triggered by the Late Cretaceous collision with an allocthonous plateau-arc associated to the migration of the Caribbean plate.",

CIMI considers important cross-energy interactions in the inner magnetosphere and is able to identify the physical processes that are responsible for ring current, radiation belt enhancements and losses, such as, particle injection, adiabatic acceleration, wave-particle interactions and magnetopause shadowing. We demonstrate the capability of CIMI by simulating a magnetic storm on 5-9 April 2010 and a MHD substorm.

            "abstract": "The interannual variations of the Walker Circulation (WC), a divergent east-west overturning circulation, affect the tropical hydroclimate directly and the extratropical hydroclimate indirectly through global teleconnections leading to changes in extratropical extremes. In addition to this crucial role in climate variations, a slowdown in the Pacific branch of the WC (PWC) has been regarded as an important indicator of climate change. Trends in the northern and southern branches of the meridional divergent circulation, e.g., the Hadley Circulation, have also been used as indicators of climate change. Global climate models suggest that water vapor will increase relatively more than precipitation as greenhouse gases (GHG) increase in the atmosphere. Consideration of top of the atmosphere and surface energetics associated with these increases suggests that the global convective mass flux must decrease to compensate. Some researchers have suggested that observations of the PWC spanning the last century provide evidence that the global convective mass flux is decreasing. Global climate models show a decrease in the PWC from the last century extending into the next. The debate surrounding this issue is complicated by different investigators using different indices to define the PWC, with some based on both the rotational and divergent components of the tropical winds to diagnose a divergent circulation. The influence and effect of tropical sea surface temperatures (SST) is also a confounding issue. We find that, in contrast to climate models, most observed aspects of the PWC show no trend or a strengthening over the last 150 years. This suggests that regional circulations cannot be used to infer global balances. We will examine the global divergent circulation, Walker Circulation, and Hadley Circulation in multiple reanalysis datasets spanning the last 150 years and in climate models to further diagnose the predicted weakening of the global overturning circulation.",

            "abstract": "In a landmark paper a quarter of a century ago, Nolet (1990) applied his newly developed method, Partitioned Waveform Inversion (PWI), to data from a new broadband array in Europe, the Network of Autonomously Recording Seismographs (NARS). The deployment of NARS was followed by deployments of numerous other arrays, resulting in an explosive growth in the amount of broadband data worldwide. The PWI method, in turn, has proven to be extremely effective in utilizing the growing data volumes. Over the last 20+ years, it has yielded a steady stream of discoveries on the Earth’s structure and dynamics.\nPWI extracts information on Earth structure from both surface and body waves within full seismic waveforms, putting this information in the form of linear equations with uncorrelated uncertainties. Early on, PWI has been applied successfully at the continental scale for upper-mantle tomography, at the regional scale for Moho-depth mapping, and even at the local scale for imaging shallow marine sediments. Automated multimode inversion developed on the basis of PWI has taken the method to global applications, and today it has been applied to millions of seismograms (all broadband data available from international data centers).\nWaveform tomography stemming from the work of Nolet (1990) now reveals the global structure and anisotropy of the upper mantle in great detail. It provides regional resolution (at the scale of tectonic units) in many regions that are well-sampled by the data. Beneath Tibet, for example, complex subduction of the cold, high-velocity Indian lithosphere is imaged in detail in the upper mantle, while azimuthal anisotropy resolved within the crust shows the flow that accommodates the India-Asia lithospheric convergence. At greater depths, in the mantle transition zone, a belt of high-velocity anomalies reveals subducted lithospheric fragments along the entire Tethys convergence zone. Globally, waveform tomography enables us to examine the heterogeneity of the lithosphere and underlying mantle from different perspectives: multimode surface-wave dispersion, shear-velocity tomography, and tectonic regionalization.\nNolet, G., 1990.

Our goal was to provide measures of the vegetation response to this Minute 319 pulse flood and to document post-flooding changes in the vegetation along the lower Colorado River reaches 1-7, which include ca. 150 narrow miles of riparian habitat until it opens to the Sea of Cortez.\nWe used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite, which provides near-daily coverage at 250 m resolution, while the Landsat 8 satellite provides this data at 16 day intervals at 30 m resolution. We are combining the two sources of satellite data to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution. NDVI and EVI data for each river reach from 2000 to the present were collected, as well as VI for specific target areas. These include restoration sites, vegetation transect sites, and bird observation sites.\nGreen vegetation has decreased steadily in all river reaches since the flood years of 1997-2000. This loss of vegetation vigor has been accompanied by a loss of habitat for riparian dependent birds from 2002 to the present. The loss of vegetation vigor resulted in a lowering of evapotranspiration (ET) in each river reach. ET has decreased approximately from 155 mcm/year in 2000 to 100 mcm/year in 2013. The pulse flood, at 130 mcm, is designed to restore some of the vegetation vigor and to germinate new cohorts of native trees throughout the river reaches. Early positive results are apparent in the zones of inundation. For example, an area of about 600 hectares has shown rapid green-up at the end of the pilot channel in Reach 5 and extending into Reach 7. This is a mixed vegetation zone containing native trees, saltcedar (Tamarix sp.)  and other riparian species. In the longer run, groundwater recharged upstream is expected to restore further productivity in downstream river reaches. We document here that results of a pulse flood plays out over a period of years in terms of enhanced productivity of the groundwater-dependent riparian vegetation.",

            "abstract": "Large, high severity wildfires greatly alter forest structure, water quality, and soil development/erosion. With increased frequency of such wildfires also follows heavy post-wildfire debris flows and flooding which deliver high loads of sediment and pyrogenic black carbon (PyC) to downstream waterways. The accumulation of PyC is a multi-faceted and dynamic issue in the critical zone. Generated by incomplete combustion of organic matter, PyC (in the form of soot and char) impacts turbidity, biological and chemical oxygen demand, and pH. In addition, PyC has the potential to sequester contaminants and can store carbon over short and long timescales.\nThe impacts of two recent wildfires in Northern New Mexico are studied with the goal of understanding the fluxes and residence times of PyC in post-wildfire, mountainous watersheds. Employing burn severity maps and geospatial data, we selected three sites to collect soil and water samples to characterize PyC: a control, an area impacted by a large, severe burn (2011), and an area impacted by a smaller, less severe burn (2013). By collaborating with researchers at the Jemez Critical Zone Observatory, soil samples are being analyzed and will provide pre-wildfire PyC concentrations for the 2013 burn area.\nIn this study, PyC is treated as both a particulate and a solute that is transported throughout the watershed as well as degraded in soils, surface water and groundwater. We used two black carbon quantification methods: the chemo-thermal oxidation (CTO-375) method to distinguish between soil soot and char, and the benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) method to quantify the total concentrations of PyC in soil and water samples. Preliminary soil data from the CTO-375 method show comparable soot concentrations in the control, 2011, and 2013 burn indicating that the soot is more recalcitrant than char and remains in the watershed long after a wildfire. This data also suggests that the fluxes of black carbon over short time scales are composed mainly of char.",

            "abstract": "Several authors have suggested that technologies for modifying the Earth's climate should be developed so that they can be deployed if a climate emergency seems imminent. These technologies are generally called geoengineering, or climate engineering. Solar radiation management is perhaps the most commonly discussed geoengineering technique. It involves lofting reflective particles into the upper atmosphere, in imitation of explosive volcanic eruptions that produce measurable cooling at the Earth's surface. Given that geoengineering is intended to reduce surface air temperatures, some authors suggest that it could be used to prevent sea level rise from ice sheet mass loss. The Greenland Ice Sheet is an obvious target for geoengineering-based efforts to avoid sea level rise, because it is large and vulnerable to surface air temperature increases. To evaluate this possibility, we use a three-dimensional, shallow-ice sheet model (SICOPOLIS; sicopolis.greveweb.net) to examine the ability of geoengineering to reduce sea level contributions from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Although this model is highly simplified, its speed of execution allows us to investigate many different potential geoengineering scenarios, covering tens of thousands of model years (excluding spinup). We examine stylized geoengineering scenarios, including both aggressive, sustained geoengineering and more moderate efforts. We comment on the implications of our model results for the ability of geoengineering to reduce future ice sheet-driven sea level change, and how our results might change if our experiments were repeated with a more sophisticated ice sheet model.",

            "abstract": "This study conducts uncertainty analysis on future region-scale hydrologic projections under the uncertain climate change projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report. The choice of the global climate models (GCMs), the greenhouse gas concentration trajectories and the GCM initial conditions are considered to be three major sources of uncertainty in the projected precipitation and temperature. This study uses the 133 sets of downscaled precipitation and temperature of the 1/8 degree BCCA projections for uncertainty analysis, which are derived from 22 CMIP5 GCMs, four emissions paths (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5), and different number of GCM initial conditions. The downscaled precipitation and temperature are used in the hydrologic model HELP3 to derive high-resolution spatiotemporal distributions of surface runoff, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge from 2010 to 2099. The hierarchical Bayesian model averaging (HBMA) method is adopted to segregate and prioritize the three sources of climate projection uncertainty, obtain the ensemble mean of hydrologic projections, and quantify the hydrologic projection uncertainty. Posterior model probabilities in the BMA are calculated based on a performance criterion and a convergence criterion. The performance criterion is the GCM performance in reproducing the historical climate. The convergence criterion is the closeness of GCM simulation to the ensemble mean of future projections. Different likelihood functions are used to investigate their impacts on the posterior model probabilities. The methodology is applied to the study of hydrologic projections and uncertainty for the area of the Southern Hills aquifer system, southwestern Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana. The study area is divided into more than 2.6 million subdivisions by intersecting various datasets through the ArcGIS. The analysis is computationally intensive. Parallel computation is used to obtain the results. It is found that the HBMA method is able to quantify the contributions of individual sources of uncertainty in the climate projections to the total uncertainty in the hydrologic projections.",

            "abstract": "Point source emissions from power plants and non-erupting active volcanoes are continuous but variable in source strength and resulting plume direction. Power plant emission variations are driven by regular demand/load cycles, while volcanic CO2 emissions follow less regular oscillations. Two polar orbiting sun-synchronous satellites currently measure atmospheric CO2with sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution to detect point sources and their plumes: GOSAT and OCO-2.\nGOSAT, launched in January 2009 by JAXA, provides 260 km spaced single-sounding grid points at a 3-day repeat cycle with a circular field of view of 10km diameter, at ~0.25/s samples. OCO-2 (leading the A-train on the Calipso ground track, repeat cycle 16 days), launched in July 2014 by NASA continuously collects eight <3 km2 cross-track elements at 24/s samples along a ~10 km wide swath either along-track (nadir), or in glint direction. GOSAT has an agile pointing system, permitting a large number of custom targets per orbit, at the expense of spatial context. OCO-2 provides up to 10,000 soundings over a different pre-programmed ~100 km2area each day. Consequently, observation strategies for point sources differ between the two missions. GOSAT can precisely and frequently and repeatedly target at the central emission point, providing a great opportunity for time series observations at its fast repeat cycle. In contrast, OCO-2 is targeting mainly validation sites (maximum 1 per orbit), thus maximizing spatial data continuity. However, close incidental flyby detection of plumes, with some along-swath spatial context, is possible with OCO-2.\nSynergetic opportunities exist to aid in CO2 plume identification, verification and validation. For OCO-2, other A-Train constellation satellites (e.g., OMI, MODIS, Calipso) provide independent parameters such as SO2 and aerosol information. GOSAT TIR data can be used to retrieve SO2values, providing plume validation, together with the GOSAT’s spatial aerosols data. GOSAT and OCO-2 offer synergies between each other through several near-coincident measurements per day, permitting direct cross-validation, as well as making use of the combination of incidental OCO-2 flybys at point sources and their plumes, and target mode time series from GOSAT.\n© 2013 California Institute of Technology",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric methane (CH4) has the second largest radiative forcing of the long-lived greenhouse gasses (GHG) after carbon dioxide. However, methane’s much shorter atmospheric lifetime and much stronger warming potential make its radiative forcing equivalent to that for CO2 over a 20-year time horizon which makes CH4 a particularly attractive target for mitigation strategies. Similar to CH4, water vapor (H2O) is the most dominant of the short-lived GHG in the atmosphere and plays a key role in many atmospheric processes. Atmospheric H2O concentrations span over four orders of magnitude from the planetary boundary layer where high impact weather initiates to lower levels in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) where water vapor has significant and long term impacts on the Earth’s radiation budget. NASA Langley has fostered the technology development with Fibertek, Inc. to develop frequency agile and high power (> 3 W) pulsed lasers using similar architectures in the 1645 nm and 935 nm spectral bands for DIAL measurements of CH4 and H2O, respectively. Both systems utilize high power 1 kHz pulse repetition frequency Nd:YAG lasers to generate high power laser emission at the desired wavelength via optical parametric oscillators (OPO). The CH4 OPO, currently in its final build stage in a SBIR Phase II program has demonstrated >2 W average power with injection seeding from a distributed feedback (DFB) laser during risk reduction experiments. The H2O OPO has demonstrated high power operation (>2 W) during the SBIR Phase I program while being injection seeded with a DFB laser, and is currently funded via an SBIR Phase II to build a robust system for future integration into an airborne water vapor DIAL system capable of profiling from the boundary layer up to the UTLS. Both systems have demonstrated operation with active OPO wavelength control to allow for optimization of the DIAL measurements for operation at different altitudes and geographic regions. An update on the progress of the CH4 and H2O laser development will be presented which will focus on key laser characteristics such as pulse energy, frequency agility and spectral purity. DIAL simulations will also be presented based on the expected and measured laser characteristics and system parameters in anticipation of future system(s) development.",

            "abstract": "The Paleocene to Eocene Goler Formation in California preserves the oldest Cenozoic terrestrial deposition on the paleo-Pacific Coast, and is dominated by fluvial strata, including overbank and paleosol deposits, as well as rare lacustrine limestone. A wide variety of paleotemperature proxy materials are preserved, including paleosols, paleosol carbonate nodules, lacustrine micrites, carbonaceous shales, and lignites. Interbedded early Eocene marine strata suggest a near-sea-level elevation at the time of deposition. Thus, the Goler Formation is a valuable site from which to constrain both paleotemperatures in the early Cenozoic and pre-extensional paleotopography in the western U.S.\nMean annual temperature at the time of Goler Formation deposition was estimated from the whole-rock geochemistry of paleosols and yield paleo-MAAT estimates of 23°C. Clumped isotope measurements of paleosol carbonate nodules yield ∆47 temperatures of 33°C. Based on four recent studies, a new calibration of paleosol carbonate ∆47 temperatures to MAAT indicates that these temperatures equate to a Paleocene MAAT of ~22°C, which is in agreement with the paleosol geochemistry estimates. Preliminary δDn-alkene. values of -166‰ are measured from carbonaceous shales of the Goler Formation; such values are consistent with low-elevation δDn-alkene values from Eocene strata in the northern Sierra Nevada, where MAAT estimates are also estimated to lie between 20 and 25°C.\nThese results contrast with ∆47 temperatures of ~48°C from lacustrine micrites in the Goler Formation, as even with a warm season bias to lacustrine carbonate deposition, these values reflect MAAT >30°C. Vitrinite reflectance data indicate peak burial temperatures for the Goler Formation near 100°C. Thus, the micrite ∆47 temperatures do not appear to reflect re-equilibration to burial depth temperatures. The difference between the micrite ∆47 temperatures and the paleosol nodule ∆47 temperatures, however, suggest alteration of the micrite. This may be due to susceptibility to burial diagenesis or enhanced exposure to hydrothermal fluids during nearby Miocene volcanism. In either case, these results underscore the value of comparing multiple paleotemperature proxies both for paleoclimatic and paleoaltimetric reconstructions.",

However, the utility of εNd as a tracer is predicated upon a full understanding of the processes and sources that define the ocean’s εNd signature. To date, sources of Nd to the ocean have been assumed to be rivers, with a minor contribution from atmospheric deposition. However, recent studies imply that other sources (e.g. pore fluids, groundwater) are important to the oceanic Nd budget and exchange between particles and marine fluids along continental margins could also influence oceanic Nd.\nTo examine the influence of sedimentary processes on the oceanic Nd signature we collected sediment, pore fluid, and ocean water column samples at 4 sites along the Oregon margin. Here we present the εNd and Nd concentrations of a weak sediment leach (labile), a strong sediment leach (refractory), and the total bulk sediment. We find that the εNd of the labile phases (weak leach, εNd = 0.8 to -2.3; strong leach, εNd = 0.4 to -2.2) is indistinguishable from the εNd of the bulk sediment digest (-0.2 to -2.8) with no systematic variation in εNd between the components. These data suggest that the εNd labile component is not fractionated from the primary sediment source. Furthermore, we do not observe any changes in εNd that correspond to concentration variability in the pore fluids. The Nd concentrations of the labile components (weak leach: 0.7 - 3.7 μg g-1; strong leach 2.1 - 8.2 μg g-1) are only an order of magnitude lower than the Nd concentration of the bulk sediment (13 - 22 μg g-1) suggesting a large potential reservoir of reactive Nd in the sediment pool with implications to the oceanic budget of Nd as well as the use of εNd.",

            "abstract": "Fluid flow in the upper crust is controlled by the permeability and interconnection of fractures in the fault zones. The permeability within the fault zone is determined by its activity, architecture and, in particular, by the mineralogy of the core and the damage zone. Whereas the permeability structure of a fault zone can be defined by the volume proportion of the core with respect to the damage zone, the relationship between the mineralogy and permeability along fault zones still remains obscure. This work examines structural and mineralogical data to show the relationship between the mineral composition of the fault zone with its permeability in the Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault System (LOFS) and the Arc-oblique Long-lived Fault Systems (ALFS), Southern Chile. The LOFS is an active ca. 1200 km long strike-slip Cenozoic intra-arc structure that strikes NNE in its master traces and NE in its subsidiary traces, with dextral and dextral-normal movement mostly developed in the last 6 My. Although the LOFS and the ALFS cross-cut each other, the ALFS is an apparently older basement fault system where seismic and field evidences record sinistral, sinistral-normal and sinistral-reverse movements. One 22-m-long NE transect was mapped orthogonal to a segment of the ALFS, where host rocks are Miocene andesitic rocks. Structural and XRD sampling were conducted in the core and damage zone. Structural mapping shows a multiple core, NW-striking fault zone with foliated gouge and an asymmetric damage zone, where the hanging wall has significantly higher mesoscopic fracture density than the footwall. The hanging wall is characterized by NW-striking, steeply dipping veins. Preliminary XRD results indicate the presence of homogenously distributed Ca-rich zeolite (mainly laumontite) in the core and the veins of the damage zone, which could indicate that the core acted as a conduit for low-temperature (ca. 220°C) fluids.",

            "abstract": "International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 349 cored Site U1435 on a structural high along the northern continent/ocean boundary in the East Subbasin of the South China Sea. At this site, thin Neogene and Quaternary sediment cover (~35 m thick) characterized by clays and manganese nodules is underlain by ~40 m of Oligocene deep marine nannofossil-rich clay and claystone. Calcareous nannofossils are abundant and moderately to well preserved throughout much of the Oligocene sequence, although their overall abundance decreases near the base of the unit. The diverse assemblage is characterized by abundant reticulofenestrids, common Cyclicargolithus floridanus, Cyclicargolithus abisectus, and Zygrhablithus bijugatus, with fewer numbers of species belonging to the genera Coccolithus, Discoaster, and Helicosphaera. The presence of well-preserved sphenoliths allows for good biostratigraphic control through the section, which we correlate to nannofossil Zones NP21 to NP25. The base of the sequence in Section 349-U1435A-9R-2 is dated to between 32.92 and 33.43 Ma based on the presence of Coccolithus formosus and absence of abundant Clausicoccus distichus. The Oligocene section at Site U1435 unconformably overlies a unit comprised dominantly of sandstone of unknown age due to a paucity of calcareous and siliceous planktonic marine microfossils. The presence of brackish water benthic foraminifers in some samples suggests a nearshore environment of deposition, substantially different from the deepwater (>2500 m) environment inferred for the Oligocene rocks based on the trace fossil assemblage. We infer that the abrupt transition from shallow to deepwater facies at this site represents the breakup unconformity for the initial opening of the South China Sea, indicating that seafloor spreading began at ~33 Ma.",

            "abstract": "The North American Monsoon (NAM) accounts for approximately 70% of the total annual precipitation in northwest Mexico, and 40-50% of annual precipitation in the Southwestern US. Until recently, the broad consensus about the sources for NAM precipitation was that the Gulf of California and eastern tropical Pacific contributed to moisture at lower levels (below 850mb) and the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea at upper levels. However, using an analytical 2D Lagrangian model (the DRM) we have recently shown that approximately 40% of the moisture that contributes to NAM precipitation is of terrestrial origin. However, the DRM cannot provide information about the vertical structure of moisture as it assumes a well-mixed atmosphere. To alleviate this problem, in this work we use the weather research forecast (WRF) model with the recently added capability of water vapor tracers, to study the moisture sources of NAM precipitation and their vertical structure. We find that the Gulf of California contributes to low-level moisture and the Gulf of Mexico contributes to upper-level moisture, as previously hypothesized. However, we also show the important role of regional moisture recycling from the NAM region at lower levels and upper level moisture from eastern Mexico that has crossed the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain chain. The tracers provide a very detailed picture of the complex moisture transport processes in the NAM region.",

            "abstract": "The uprush and backwash phases in the swash zone, the region of the beach that is alternately covered and uncovered by wave run-up, are fundamentally different events. Backwash is dominated by a growing boundary layer where the turbulence is set by the bed shear stress. In this phase traditional boundary layer turbulence models and Shields-type critical stress pickup functions work well. However, the uprush phase, while often viewed in the context of traditional boundary layer turbulence models, has little in common with the backwash phase. During uprush, the entire water column is turbulent, as it rapidly advects well-stirred highly turbulent flow generated offshore from breaking waves or collapsing bores. Turbulence levels in the uprush are several times higher than turbulent boundary layer theory would predict and hence the use of a boundary layer model to predict turbulence levels during uprush grossly under predicts the turbulence and subsequent sediment suspension in the swash zone.\nTo study the importance of this advected turbulence to sediment suspension we conduct experiments in a water tank designed to generate horizontally homogeneous isotropic turbulence absent mean shear using randomly actuated synthetic jet arrays suspended above both a solid glass plate and a narrowly graded sediment bed. Using jet arrays with different jet spacings allows the generation of high Reynolds number turbulence with variable integral length scales, which we hypothesize control the characteristic length scales in the induced ripple field. Particle image velocimetry and acoustic Doppler velocimetry measurements are used to characterize the near-bed flow and this unique turbulent boundary layer. Metrics include the mean flow and turbulence intensities and stresses, temporal and spatial spectra, dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy, and integral length scales of the turbulence. We leverage our unique dataset to compare the flows over impermeable fixed and permeable mobile sediment beds to explore the source of the ripples, which we were surprised to find in absence of mean shear. By varying the details of the random jet-firing algorithm and using alternate jet spacing configurations, we investigate the relationship between the characteristic metrics of turbulence and the induced ripple dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism for intermediate depth and deep earthquakes is still under debate. The temperatures and pressures are above the point where ordinary fractures ought to occur. Key to constraining this mechanism is the precise determination of hypocentral depth. It is well known that using depth phases allows for significant improvement in event depth determination, however routinely and systematically picking such phases for teleseismic or regional arrivals is problematic due to poor signal-to-noise ratios around the pP and sP phases. To overcome this limitation we have taken advantage of the additional information carried by seismic arrays. We have used beamforming and velocity spectral analysis techniques to precise measure pP-P and sP-P differential travel times. These techniques are further extended to achieve subsample accuracy and to allow for events where the signal-to-noise ratio is close to or even less than 1.0. The individual estimates obtained at different subarrays for a pair of earthquakes can be combined using a double-difference technique in order to precisely map seismicity in regions where it is tightly clustered. We illustrate these methods using data from the recent M 7.9 Alaska earthquake and its aftershocks, as well as data from the Bucaramanga nest in northern South America, arguably the densest and most active intermediate-depth earthquake nest in the world.",

The travel of cosmic rays through the heliosphere is disturbed by the magnetic field of the Sun which is known to vary with a period of 11 years; this induces a solar modulation in the propagation of cosmic rays which affects their fluxes up to few tens of GeV, modifying the shape and the intensity of the local interstellar spectrum (LIS). The monthly fluxes of protons detected by AMS-02 in the first three years of data taking will be shown. Using the framework of the force-field approximation, the solar modulation parameter will be extracted from the time dependent proton fluxes measured by AMS-02 (2011-2014) and PAMELA (2006-2009); the proton flux from Voyager 1 (October-November 2012) will be assumed as the LIS. The results will be compared with the modulation parameter inferred from the neutron monitors. The limitations of the force-field approximation and the differences between the minimum and the maximum of the solar cycle will be discussed. The availability of cosmic ray modulation data directly from space will be very useful to the heliophysics community, to understand in more details the long term solar activity during an entire solar cycle.",

            "abstract": "A new Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey images the fault network of Truckee Meadows region of western Nevada, including the Reno/Sparks metropolitan area in Washoe County. The airborne LiDAR imagery (1485 sq. km) is being used to create high quality bare-earth digital elevation models that were previously unattainable in vegetated, populated or alpine terrain. LiDAR gives us an opportunity to improve fault maps that may be outdated or incomplete in the area. Here we show LiDAR imagery of a large section of Washoe County and highlight areas where this imagery may be useful in revising current fault maps.\nConflicting stress regimes, with strike-slip regions overlapping extensional domains in the Walker Lane Deformation Belt, complicate regional tectonics of Washoe County. In this region east of the Sierra Nevada batholith, approximately 20-25% of Pacific–North American plate motion (mostly right-lateral shear) is accommodated along the Walker Lane. There is ample evidence of Magnitude 6-7 earthquakes in or surrounding the Truckee Meadows region as recently as the late 1800s and it is possible that earthquakes of this size may occur here in the near future. Accurate mapping of faults and associated earthquake hazards in populated areas is critically important for earthquake mitigation and preparedness, and furthers our understanding of regional tectonics. The new LiDAR data confirms the presence of many previously mapped faults, simplifies areas that may be presently over-complicated by current maps, and identifies faults that were previously unmapped. Current and future research will also focus on dating of glacial outwash terraces and alluvial fans, particularly in the Mogul area and Mt. Rose pediment. Coupled with comprehensive fault maps and displacement measurements improved by this new LiDAR dataset, these data may allow researchers to get more accurate slip rate estimates on faults in this region, and may support the hypothesis that some faults in the Washoe County region are more active than previously reported.",

            "abstract": "Fault zones and fault-related permeability structures have long been recognized to play a first-order role on fluid flow migration through the crust. However, the nature of the spatial relationship between fault zones and fluid-flow and the evolution of such permeability structures in terms of paleofluid flow quantification is less well understood. This work presents a microfracture analysis aimed to unravel the nature of the fault plumbing system and estimate paleo permeability parameters within the Jorgillo Fault (JF), a subvertical strike-slip fault exposed in the Atacama Fault System in northern Chile. The JF is a ca. 18 km long, NNW striking strike-slip fault with sinistral horizontal separation of ca. 4 km. The JF juxtaposes orthogranulites to the west (JFW) with gabbros to the east side (JFE) wherea 200 m fault-perpendicular transect was mapped and sampled. The fault core consists of ca. 1 m cataclasite bounded by fault gouge zones of ca. 80 cm to the west and 30 cm to the east. A ca. 50 m wide symmetrical damage zone can be observed at field scale. The damage zone in the JFW is characterized by shear fractures and cataclasites whereas the JFE consists of open fractures and veins. The JFW microfracture analysis reveal mm-wide cataclasitic/ultracataclasitic bands orientated subparallel to the JF, calcite veins in a T-fracture orientation, and minor polydirectional chlorite veins. In the JFE, 1-20 mm wide chlorite, quartz-epidote and quartz-calcite veins, can be observed. Chlorite conjugate veins show syntaxial growth textures suggesting dilatational fracturing. Microfractures distribution show shear fractures distributed only in JFW while open fractures are mainly in the JFE. Using models off paleofluid flow, cumulative permeability (i.e. permeability due to all types of microfractures present in the samples) was estimated to range from 2.761x10-11 to 4.89x10-9 m2 on the JFE, and 8.04x10-12 to 4.39x10-8 m2 on the JFW.",

He found that using earlier cycles, in which solar maximum occurred when Fe XIV emission features associated with the classic \"Rush to the Poles\" reached latitudes 76° ± 2°, the northern hemisphere Fe XIV features predicted a maximum in the north at 2011.6 ± 0.3. This was confirmed by hemispheric sunspot numbers from SIDC (http://www.sidc.be/silso/) and sunspot areas from NASA MSFC (http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/greenwch.shtml). The earlier papers also noted that southern high-latitude Fe XIV emission indicated the possibility of a southern maximum early in 2014. At low latitudes, earlier cycles reached solar maximum when Fe XIV emission features reached latitudes 20° ± 1.7°. In 2013, these features were at 21° and 15° in the north, again indicating that northern maximum had already occurred. In the south, the Fe XIV features were at 24°. Gopalswamy et al. (2012, Ap. J. Let. 750:L42) came to similar conclusions from a study of microwave brightness and prominence eruptions. This paper will extend the previous studies up to 2014 to include the recent extraordinary surge of activity in the southern hemisphere. In particular we will examine in more detail the relationship between hemispheric Fe XIV emission features and both global and hemispheric sunspot numbers to see (i) if the previous studies correctly predicted the times of hemispheric solar maxima and (ii) what we can learn from the inclusion of two more years of data.

            "abstract": "Currently, the indirect effects of atmospheric aerosols remain the most uncertain components in forcing of climate change over the industrial period (IPCC, 2007). This large uncertainty is partially a result of our incomplete understanding of the ability of particles to form cloud droplets under atmospherically relevant supersaturations. One of the objectives of the US Department of Energy (DOE) Green Ocean Amazon Project (GoAmazon) is to understand the influence of the emission from Manaus, a tropical megacity, on aerosol size, concentration, and chemical composition, and their impact on aerosol cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectrum.\nDuring the GoAmazon study, size distributions, CCN spectra and chemical composition of aerosols both under pristine conditions and inside Manaus plume were measured in-situ from the DOE Gulfstream 1 (G-1) research aircraft during two Intensive Operations Periods, one conducted in the wet season (Feb 22- March 24, 2014) and the other in dry season (Sep 1 – Oct 10, 2014). Aerosol size distributions were measured by a Fast Integrated Mobility Spectrometer (FIMS) and compared with the merged size distribution from two other instruments, an Ultra High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer – Airborne (UHSAS-A, DMT), and a Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer Probe (PCASP-200, DMT). Optical measurements of light scattering by nephelometer and absorption by a particle soot absorption photometer (PSAP) were combined with number/size distributions data in a iterative method, which retrieves the effective imaginary refractive index of the particles at a wavelength of 545 nm. Aerosol chemical composition was characterized using a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS, Aerodyne Inc.). CCN number concentration was measured by a DMT dual column CCN counter at two supersaturations 0.25% and 0.5%. Based on the aerosol properties mentioned above, CCN closure is carried out. In addition, the sensitivity of calculated CCN spectrum to organic aerosol hygroscopicity is examined. The differences in aerosol/CCN properties between two seasons will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Stone tools are one of the most enduring forms of ancient human behavior available to anthropologists. The geologic materials that comprise stone tools are a reflection of the rocks that were available locally or through trade, as are the intended use of the tools and the knapping technology needed to produce them. Investigation of the rock magnetic and geochemical characteristics of the artifacts and the geological source materials provides a baseline to explore these past behaviors.\nThis study uses rock magnetic properties to explore the raw material selection criteria involved in the production of obsidian tools in the region around Valles Caldera in northern New Mexico. Obsidian is locally abundant and was traded by tribes across the central United States. Here we compare the rock magnetic properties of a sample of obsidian projectile points (N =25) that have been geochemically sourced to the Cerro Toledo obsidian flow with geological samples collected from four sites within the same flow (N =135). This collection of archaeological artifacts, albeit small, contains representatives of at least 8 different point styles that were used over 6000 years from the Archaic into the Late Prehistoric. Bulk rock hysteresis parameters (Mr, Ms, Bc, and Bcr) and low-field susceptibility (Χ) measurements show that the projectile points generally contain a lower concentration of magnetic minerals than the geologic samples. For example, the artifacts’ median Ms value is 2.9 x 10-3 Am2kg-1, while that of the geological samples is 6.5 x 10-3 Am2kg-1. The concentration of magnetic minerals in obsidian is a proxy for the concentration of microlites in general, and this relationship suggests that although obsidian was locally abundant, toolmakers employed non-random selection criteria resulting in generally lower concentrations of microlites in their obsidian tools.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) removal in watersheds is an important regulating ecosystem service that can help reduce N pollution in the nation’s waterways. However, processes that remove N such as denitrification are generally determined at point locations. Measures that integrate N processing within watersheds and over time would be particularly useful for assessing the degree of this vital service. Because most N removal processes isotopically enrich the N remaining, δ15N from basal food-chain organisms in aquatic ecosystems can provide information on watershed N processing. As part of EPA’s National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS), we measured δ15N of Chironomidae in lakes, rivers and streams because these larval aquatic insects were found in abundance in almost every lake and stream in the U.S. Using information on nitrogen loading to the watershed, and total N concentrations within the water, we assessed when elevated chironomid δ15N would indicate N removal rather than possible enriched sources of N.  Chironomid δ15N values ranged from -4 to +20 ‰, and were higher in rivers and streams than in lakes (median = 7.6 ‰ vs. 4.8 ‰, respectively), indicating that N was processed to a greater degree in lotic chironomids than in lentic ones. For both, δ15N increased with watershed-level agricultural land cover and N loading, and decreased as precipitation increased. In rivers and streams with high synthetic N loading, we found lower N concentrations in streams with higher chironomid δ15N values, suggesting greater N removal. At low levels of synthetic N loading, the pattern reversed, and streams with enriched chironomid δ15N had higher N concentrations, suggesting enriched sources such as manure or sewage. Our results indicate that chironomid δ15N values can provide valuable information about watershed-level N inputs and processing for national water quality monitoring efforts.",

The process of wave breaking, either in deep or shallow waters, is followed by injection of turbulent kinetic energy into the underlying water column. This process modifies momentum eddy viscosity and tracer mixing properties. In this research we employed different two-equation one-dimensional vertical turbulence models to study breaking wave-induced turbulence for white-capping and depth-limited breaking cases. We used recent turbulence dissipation rate measurements using wave-following 'SWIFT' drifters at New River Inlet, North Carolina to verify the models. We improved our fully coupled 3D ocean-wave modelling system with new turbulence parameters and showed how the new turbulence characterizations could affect stratification and other plume properties in New River Inlet application.",

            "abstract": "There are many high-elevation regions that are experiencing greater rates of warming than their lower elevation surroundings. Using a combination of ground-based observations, satellite retrievals, and CMIP5 model simulations, we examine effects of specific humidity (q), snow cover, and cloud cover and optical thickness on surface downward longwave (DLR) and shortwave (SW) radiation, and quantify them using a neural network analysis. The sensitivity of DLR to changes in q is non-linear and larger when the atmosphere is drier, which is more likely at higher elevations during winter and at night. The magnitude of q is the primary determinant of the DLR-q sensitivity, although observations also reveal that finer-scale topography has an impact on the diurnal variation of this sensitivity. Although DLR increases with increasing cloud cover, clouds have limited effect on the sensitivity of DLR to changes in q. The sensitivity of DLR to changes in cloud optical thickness is generally small but does increase as clouds become semi-transparent. The sensitivity of surface SW fluxes to changes in cloud cover depends significantly on cloud optical thickness. This has implications for the prediction of trends in incoming SW fluxes as cloud cover changes are usually the only trend that is measured. The CMIP5 model simulations for the 21st century show that the snow-albedo effect contributes to enhanced warming in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding high-elevation regions. The albedo decreases more at higher elevations than at lower elevations owing to the retreat of the zero-degree isotherm and the associated snow line. The treatment of snow cover, snow melt and the associated snow-albedo feedback may have an impact on the climate sensitivity among models. Elevation dependent warming is found in all but one of the CMIP5 models, and the degree of enhancement is weakly correlated with their global sensitivities.",

            "abstract": "There is a high demand for agro-hydrologic models to use gridded surface air temperature data as the model input for estimating regional and global water budget and cycle. The Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) developed by combining simulation models with observations provides a long-term gridded meteorological dataset at the global coverage. However, the GLDAS air temperature products have not been comprehensively evaluated, although the accuracy of the products was assessed in limited areas. In this study, we compared the daily 0.25° resolution GLDAS air temperature data with two reference datasets: (1) 1-km resolution gridded Daymet data (2002 and 2010) for the Conterminous United States, and (2) global meteorological observations (2000 - 2011) archived from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN). The comparison of the GLDAS datasets with the GHCN datasets including 13,511 weather stations indicates a fairly high accuracy of the GLDAS data for daily maximum temperature [bias is 1.2 C°, root mean square error (RMSE) is 3.9 C°, and R2 is 0.92] and daily minimum temperature (bias is -1.4 C°, RMSE is 5.4 C°, and R2 is 0.82). The quality of the GLDAS air temperature data, however, is not always consistent in different regions of the world; for example, some areas in Africa and South America show relatively low accurate estimates. Spatial and temporal analyses reveal a high agreement between GLDAS and Daymet daily air temperature datasets, although spatial details in high mountainous areas are not sufficiently estimated by the GLDAS data. Our evaluation of the GLDAS data demonstrates that the air temperature estimates are generally accurate, but cautions should be taken when the data are used in mountainous areas or places with sparse weather stations.",

Prior studies have also shown that stratospheric water vapor has a small but non-negligible effect on global radiative forcing; therefore it is key to understand both trends and long-term variations. In this presentation, we will examine both the relationship between tropical tropopause temperatures and stratospheric water for the time period where we have global lower stratosphere water vapor measurements (primarily since the early 1990s), as well as the relationship between tropical tropopause temperatures and assorted atmospheric indices for the longer time period where we only have temperature measurements. We will also present inferences on water vapor stratospheric trends and variability from mid latitude ground based balloon measurements, and results from climate model runs testing the impact of volcanic aerosol loading on UTLS temperatures and stratospheric water vapor.",

Causes of flat-slab formation remain debated, where proposed mechanisms include subduction of buoyancy anomalies such as oceanic plateaus and aseismic ridges, dynamic suction from thickened overriding plate, and enhanced subduction speed and reduced seafloor ages. South America represents an ideal place to test these hypotheses, with ongoing flat subduction as well as possible flat-slab scenarios during the geological past. Here, we use geodynamic models with plate kinematics and seafloor ages as boundary conditions to reproduce the history of South American subduction since the Late Cretaceous, during which we attempt to investigate the dynamic causes and impacts of flat subduction. The modeling results will be compared to present-day upper mantle slab geometry through slab 1.0 [Hayes et al, 2012] and lower mantle structures in several tomography models including GyPSuM [Simmons et al, 2010] and S20RTS [Ritsema et al. 1999].",

            "abstract": "Measuring the draw down of carbonyl sulfide (chemical formula: COS) over ecosystems can provide a new tool for estimating gross primary production (GPP) at important temporal and spatial scales. COS is a gas ubiquitous in the atmosphere that shares many characteristics with CO2: both are taken up by enzymes in plant leaves at a predictable ratio and in proportion to their ambient concentrations. While CO2 is simultaneously respired by soil and plant roots, the dominant flux of COS is foliar absorption. Previously, ecosystem soil fluxes of COS were thought to be negligible in the application of this COS-GPP proxy. Here we present new data describing controls on soil fluxes as a way to anticipate COS soil exchange over heterogeneous landscapes. Using soil samples from two agricultural sites in the Great Plains and one site in the Colorado Desert, we captured data from the extremes of ecosystem GPP in the United States. We then built a model describing COS soil fluxes with inputs of soil temperature and soil water content based on characterized soil behavior. This study provides an essential refinement in applying COS-GPP estimates over the continents.",

            "abstract": "We present results of the CO2 diffuse emission from the surface of two volcanic lakes: El Chichón (EC) in Mexico and Specchio di Venere (SV) on Pantelleria Island, Italy. Both lakes are drainless, have similar sizes (~2x105 m2) and similar input-output dynamics. However, they are drastically different in water chemistry. The SV lake is alkaline (pH >9) and of a high near constant salinity, whereas EC lake is acidic (pH 2.3) and of a low variable salinity. In the vicinity of both lakes there are thermal grounds with steam vents and hot springs and a high CO2 soil flux. The SV lake has high alkalinity (~70 meq/L), whereas the EC lake is characterized by high concentration of dissolved CO2.\nCO2 flux measurements from the surface of both lakes were made with the “floating” accumulation chamber. During the flux measuring, gas samples were taken for carbon isotopic analysis. Soil flux measurements were also made in the crater of El Chichon volcano and on the area adjacent to the SV lake. \nThe preliminary results of CO2 fluxes indicate EC lake has a high CO2 flux with a mean value of 3500 g m-2 d-1, with the highest values alignment across NW-SE and NE-SW faults and a high degassing by bubbling gases, especially near the strongest NE fumarolic field. While SV has a mean value of the CO2 flux ~ 10 g m-2 d-1 and limited bubbling on the lake surface. High CO2 flux was measured from the soil near the lake at the Mofeta place. A net mean diffusion flux (without bubbles) from EC lake is about 350 times higher than that from SV lake (3500 g m-2 d-1  vs 10 g m-2 d-1). SV has the total CO2 flux by diffusion of ~3 ton d-1 from an area of 0.3 km2 and the total flux of 0.44 ton d-1 by bubbling areas at SW and S zones. The EC lake has the total CO2 flux of 840 ton d-1 from an area of 0.24 km2. The total CO2 output from SV is nevertheless about two times higher taking into account the seepage from the lake (~ 8 kg s-1) of highly carbonated water.",

            "abstract": "Compound specific nitrogen isotopic analysis of amino acids (δ15N-AA) is a technique that is widely used in regional ecology and food web studies, with newly expanding applications in organic geochemistry. However, its applicability to marine sediment has been minimally examined. This study is one of the first δ15N-AA applications into the paleorecord of marine sediment. We explore how δ15N-AA measurements provide insights into past changes in water column N cycling and N utilization, and into post-depositional processes that impact sedimentary N. This is possible because δ15N-AA investigates the molecular-level basis of the bulk sedimentary δ15N signal, revealing possible diagenetic alteration of sedimentary organic matter. Our goal was is to investigate the extent of alteration (vs. preservation) of individual sedimentary amino acid δ15N values from surface nitrate δ15N across a wide range of depositional environments. The δ15N of bulk sediment differs from that of the surface nitrate δ15N signal because of water column processes or more often because of alteration of the signal during initial sedimentation. To investigate this alteration we compare δ15N-AA to bulk δ15N measurements in a suite of equatorial Pacific core tops (378–4360 m below sea level) across contrasting oceanographic and sedimentary depositional conditions (e.g. high vs. low productivity, hypoxic vs. oxic bottom waters). To examine down core diagenetic alteration of the sediment record, we present δ15N-AA and bulk δ15N of selected deeper depths to observe 1) if diagenetic shift is coherently resolved by both types of measurements and 2) if select individual δ15N-AA values remain representative of the surface organic δ15N signal. We hypothesize that compound specific analysis (δ15N-AA) will provide a molecular level assessment of mechanism for diagenetic changes in bulk organic δ15N values while also preserving detailed information about planktonic ecosystem structure.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how the substorm current wedge (SCW) is formed is crucial to solving the substorm mystery. One recent idea on the SCW formation is the “wedgelets” picture, which proposes that dipolarizing flux bundles (DFBs) are the building elements of an SCW. (A DFB is a ~1-3 RE wide flux tube with stronger magnetic field than the ambient plasma in the magnetotail; its leading edge is known as a “dipolarization front”, or “reconnection front”, the product of near-Earth reconnection). Although each DFB carries field-aligned currents (FACs) in similar configuration to an SCW, it is unclear how the DFBs combine to become the large-scale (several magnetic local times wide) region-1-sense (towards Earth at the dawn sector of the magnetotail and away from Earth at the dusk sector) FACs of the SCW. To answer this question, we investigate the FACs of DFBs statistically using THEMIS data. Our results suggest that at the dawn (dusk) sector of the magnetotail, a DFB has more FAC towards (away from) Earth than away from (towards) Earth, so that the net FAC is towards (away from) Earth. The combined effect of many DFBs is therefore the same as the large-scale region-1-sense SCW, supporting the idea that “wedgelets” comprise the large scale substorm current wedge.",

            "abstract": "Turbulence and mean velocity distributions are well studied for uniform flows, however fully turbulent non-uniform open channel flows over rough gravel beds are an understudied class of realistic flows with significant geomorphologic importance. The two-fold objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of flow deceleration on multi-layer turbulence and determine velocity scales that produce self-similar profiles using turbulent boundary layer theory. Turbulence statistics were calculated from data collected using a three-dimensional acoustic Doppler velocimeter in backwater region produced by placing cylindrical obstruction downstream of measuring location. Results indicate inner turbulent processes are set according to shear velocity while outer layer of turbulence is not. Mean streamwise velocity profiles of 101 published datasets including 2211 data points from non-uniform decelerating rivers and laboratory flumes are scaled using inner, outer and 2 mixed methods. Theoretical arguments indicate the outer velocity scale determined from the AIP definition of equilibrium provides a more appropriate scaling for the velocity deficit of non-uniform open channel flows than inner scaling determined from Clauser equilibrium. Scaling results of mean profiles show outer scaling collapses data better than inner scaling. Mixed scaling approaches, which account for upstream conditions and the effect of bed roughness felt throughout the flow, provide a better scaling choice for this class of flows than either inner or outer scales alone. Results of this analysis provide insight on the behavior of turbulence in decelerating fully turbulent open channel flow over a rough gravel bed and provides a scaling useful for predicting velocity distributions.",

            "abstract": "A large fraction of organic carbon stored in Arctic permafrost soil is to be decomposed and released to the atmosphere under climate change. Among many drivers that influence decomposition, changes in hydrology play a pivotal role: Shifts in water table depth (WTD) often trigger modifications on soil and vegetation (e.g. soil temperature and vegetation community structure), which in turn alter carbon cycle processes. The presented study is focused on CO2 and CH4 fluxes measured with chambers in a floodplain of the Kolyma River near Cherskii, Northeast Siberia. Our study site is separated into two areas, one that has been drained since 2004, and a nearby reference site. Carbon flux (NEE, ER, methane) was measured for ~16 weeks during summer and early winter of 2013, and summer of 2014. In addition, plant-mediated CH4 transport was measured in 2014 to separate different CH4 emission pathways. Vegetation community structure was investigated in 2013 and 2014. After a decade of drainage history that lowered WTD by about 20cm in the drained area, Eriophorum (cotton grass) that previously dominated have been much replaced by Carex (tussock-forming sedge) and shrub species. ANCOVA analysis revealed that NEE, ER, and methane flux rates were all influenced by vegetation in both summer and winter, leading to different flux patterns between two sites. WTD also influenced NEE and methane, showing little less CO2 uptake and much less CH4 emission in drained site. Plant-mediated CH4 transport through cotton grasses was correlated with diameter and length of green leaves, implying bigger plants transport more CH4 because their roots reach deeper soil layers where methanogenesis occurs. This correlation was strong at the drained site, where CH4 oxidation was dominant in shallow depths. Summarizing all effects of vegetation and WTD, the drainage results in a stronger net sink for carbon (CO2 and CH4 fluxes combined) in the growing season, but a stronger source in early winter.",

We are using data acquired by the Visible and InfraRed mapping Spectrometer (VIR) on the Dawn mission. Nominal spatial resolution of the data set considered in this study is 70m/px.\nThe portion of Rheasilvia basin below 65°S has a howarditic composition, with the higher concentration of diogenitic versus eucritic material in the region between 45° and 225°E-lon. However, there are several locations, such as craters Tarpeia and Severina and Parentatio Rupes, with lithologic characteristics different from the surroundings regions. Tarpeia crater has a eucritic patch in the west side of the crater, the bottom part of the wall and part of the floor. Severina, located in a region of Mg-rich pyroxene, has some diogenitic units on the walls of the crater. Also the Parentatio Rupes has an obvious diogenitic unit. These units extend for 10-20km, and their location, especially in the case of the two craters, suggests they formed before the cratering events and also before the Rheasilvia impact event. The origin of these units is still unclear; however, their characteristics and locations suggests heterogeneity in the composition of the ancient Vestan crust in this particular location of the surface.\nAcknowledgements: The authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the Dawn Instruments and Operations Teams.

            "abstract": "A new field-aligned current system in the high-latitude ionosphere was reported recently by Zhu et al. (2014). The current system develops and evolves along the ionospheric terminator and it is thus termed as the terminator field-aligned currents. The discovery was based on the reconstructions from the Ionospheric Dynamics and Electrodynamics Data Assimilation Model (IDED-DA) with the ingestion of observational measurements. In this presentation, we show the results of a follow-on study using the IDED-DA, in which the solar, seasonal, and geomagnetic dependencies of the terminator field-aligned currents are explored. The new current system is the first field-aligned current system in the high-latitude ionosphere that is not directly driven by the magnetospheric dynamics and has an ionospheric origin. A systematic study of its electrodynamic and plasma dynamics as well as dependencies on various solar-terrestrial conditions will help us to explore the active role of the ionosphere in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and improve the physical understanding of the electrodynamics and plasma dynamics of many small-scale structures in the polar ionosphere.

            "abstract": "All ecosystems will be impacted to some extent by climate change, with forecasts for more frequent and severe drought likely to have the greatest impact on terrestrial ecosystems. Terrestrial ecosystems are known to vary dramatically in their responses to drought. However, the factors that may make some ecosystems respond more or less than others remains unknown, but such understanding is critical for predicting drought impacts at regional and continental scales. To effectively forecast terrestrial ecosystem responses to drought, ecologists must assess responses of a range of different ecosystems to drought, and then improve existing models by incorporating the factors that cause such variation in response. Traditional site-based research cannot provide this knowledge because experiments conducted at individual sites are often not directly comparable due to differences in methodologies employed. Coordinated experimental networks, with identical protocols and comparable measurements, are ideally suited for comparative studies at regional to global scales. The US National Science Foundation-funded Drought-Net Research Coordination Network (\nwww.drought-net.org\n) will advance understanding of the determinants of terrestrial ecosystem responses to drought by bringing together an international group of scientists to conduct two key activities conducted over the next five years: 1) planning and coordinating new research using standardized measurements to leverage the value of existing drought experiments across the globe (Enhancing Existing Experiments, EEE), and 2) finalizing the design and facilitating the establishment of a new international network of coordinated drought experiments (the International Drought Experiment, IDE). The primary goals of these activities are to assess: (1) patterns of differential terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity to drought and (2) potential mechanisms underlying those patterns.",

            "abstract": "The Earth’s deep mantle has been shown to be heterogeneous at a wide spectrum of scales, from fine scale (e.g.,1-10 km) to degree 2 low velocity provinces (1000’s of km lateral scale). Principle structures include large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) beneath the Pacific Ocean and Africa and southern Atlanic Ocean, and a circum-Pacific higher velocity band. At intermediate scales, structures include D” discontinuities and details associated with LLSVPs, such as sharp sides. Shorter scales include ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs) and regions of scattering of high frequency waves.\nIn this study we seek to improve upon our knowledge of global intermediate and small-scale shear wave structure in the lower mantle with an iterative Layer-Stripping Forward Tomography approach. This approach iteratively updates a starting tomographic model by mapping travel time residuals (between observations and predictions) from the surface (using shallow S wave phase) down to lowermost mantle depths (using deep S waves, ScS waves, and Sdiff waves). Modifications to the uppermost mantle are primarily aimed at properly correcting deep phases for shallow heterogeneity. Relatively uniform coverage of the deepest mantle is achieved with Sdiff. The core-reflected ScS contributes most strongly to our knowledge of shorter scale heterogeneity, but coverage is more limited that with Sdiff. Deep mantle S waves provide information on the vertical extent of lowermost mantle heterogeneity (e.g., LLSVPs), but similar to ScS, coverage is limited to source-receiver pairs with the proper distance range. We collected near 1200 global earthquakes global earthquakes from the last two decades, with depths greater than 30 km, and focused on data with clear and impulsive phases. In a semi-automatic scheme, we measured all S, ScS, and Sdiff times and document waveshape stability by constructing a mean shape of each phase for each event. Cross-correlation coefficients between individual records and the mean shape along with signal-to-noise ratios of each phase are used as weights during the iterative modeling approach. We will give attention to the strongest deep mantle heterogeneity, in both scale and amplitude, particularly LLSVPs whose general shapes are fairly well known, but their detailed structure remains enigmatic in many areas.",

            "abstract": "Supereruption deposits demonstrate that giant magma bodies sporadically exist within the Earth’s crust. We rely on study of such deposits to better understand the underlying magma bodies and their eruptions.\nWe are studying several deposits: Bishop Tuff (BT, CA USA), Peach Spring Tuff (PST, SW USA), and Oruanui Tuff (OT, NZ). We combine quantitative textural characterization in 3D via x-ray tomography (XRT), focusing particularly on CSDs of major and accessory minerals; characterization of mineral zoning, particularly of Ti and CL in quartz, including inferences from diffusion chronometry; documentation of glass inclusion textures in 3D via XRT, with implications to crystallization timescales; and phase equilibria modeling (rhyolite-MELTS), including glass (inclusion and matrix) composition geobarometry, to constrain crystallization conditions.\nCSDs ubiquitously record a growth-dominated regime, characterized by limited nucleation, consistent with pre-eruptive crystallization under low supersaturation. Phenocryst interiors are largely unzoned, consistent with phase equilibria predictions of nearly invariant, effectively isothermal crystallization. Glass compositions record storage over a large spread of depths (~125-250 MPa) for early and late-erupted BT, while the OT represents multiple magma batches evacuated from different depths. Diffusion chronometry and melt inclusion faceting suggest pre-eruptive crystallization over centennial timescales.\nCSDs and mineral textures also record syn-eruptive crystallization, which results in huge numbers of small crystals, revealing extensive nucleation prior to eruption. Crystal rims develop on pre-existing phenocrysts, and they can be obvious if compositionally distinct from interiors (BT and PST). In PST, evidence for rim crystallization from hotter magma is very strong. BT contrasts with PST in many ways; evidence for heating is ambiguous, and pumice properties are difficult to reconcile with magma mixing, while the effects of growth rate and decompression are underappreciated. Diffusion chronometry indicates rim crystallization over the final year prior to eruption, under high supersaturation, during eruptive decompression; this reveals the timeframe over which signs of an impending supereruption may be felt at the surface.",

            "abstract": "There is a wealth of biodiversity and environmental data that can provide the basis for addressing global scale questions of societal concern. However, our ability to discover, access and integrate these data for use in broader analyses is hampered by the lack of standardized languages and systems. New tools (e.g. ontologies, data standards, integration tools, unique identifiers) are being developed that enable establishment of a framework for linked and open data. Relative to other domains, these tools are nascent in biodiversity and environmental sciences and will require effort to develop, though work can capitalize on lessons learned from previous efforts. Here we discuss needed next steps to provide consistently described and formatted ecological data for immediate application in ecological analysis, focusing on integrating phenology, trait and environmental data to understand local to continental-scale biophysical processes and inform natural resource management practices. As more sources of data become available at finer spatial and temporal resolution, e.g., from national standardized earth observing systems (e.g., NEON, LTER and LTAR Networks, USA NPN), these challenges will become more acute. Here we provide an overview of the standards and ontology development landscape specifically related to phenological and trait data, and identify requirements to overcome current challenges. Second, we outline a workflow for formatting and integrating existing datasets to address key scientific and resource management questions such as: “What traits determine differential phenological responses to changing environmental conditions?” or “What is the role of granularity of observation, and of spatiotemporal scale, in controlling phenological responses to different driving variables?” Third, we discuss methods to semantically annotate datasets to greatly decrease time needed to assemble heterogeneous data for use in ecological analyses on varying spatial scales. We close by making a call to interested community members for a working group to model phenology, trait and environmental data products from continental-scale efforts (e.g. NEON, USA-NPN and others) focusing on ways to assure discoverability and interoperability.",

            "abstract": "Modeling of low-latitude ionospheric electrodynamics reveals a sensitivity of ExB convection in the evening to E-region conductivity. This sensitivity is explained in terms of two related but distinct effects. First, meridional E-region currents associated with Pedersen conductivity partially balance meridional F-region dynamo currents. Since the F-region current density depends more on the pressure-gradient force driving the wind than on the E-region conductivity, changes in the latter provoke an inversely related change in the electric field and plasma convection velocity, even though the relative contribution of the E region to the field-line-integrated conductivity may be small as compared with the F region contribution. The second way in which night-time E-region conductivity affects the evening plasma convection is through regulation of the zonal electric field and vertical/meridional plasma convection. In this case it is the E-region Cowling conductance, rather than the Pedersen conductance, that comes into play. Vertical convection through the E region in the early evening, associated with the pre-reversal enhancement of the vertical drift, is associated with zonal Cowling current that dissipates a relatively large amount of electromagnetic energy, and therefore exerts a drag on the evening plasma convection. This presentation quantifies the sensitivity of the convection to the night-time E-region conductivity, and shows how the convection distribution tends to obey a minimization principle.",

            "abstract": "The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is a key process for the transport of solar wind plasma across the Earth’s magnetopause. When both magnetic and velocity shears coexists within a boundary as commonly seen at the magnetopause, the resulting KHI leads to generation of vortices and subsequent triggering of magnetic reconnection. Our recent 3D fully kinetic simulations of this process for symmetric boundary layers demonstrated the copious formation of oblique flux ropes, which leads to a rapid mixing of the plasma within the vortex layer. THEMIS observations at the dusk-flank magnetopause indeed show similar features of flux ropes between observed KH vortices. More recently, we performed additional 3D fully kinetic simulations considering the effects of density and temperature asymmetries, which also commonly exist across the magnetopause. Past 2D simulations have shown that such asymmetries can lead to an excitation of secondary instabilities along the edge of the vortex in the absence of a finite magnetic field component (B//) parallel to the k-vector of the KHI. Since B// is expected to be finite at the magnetopause, here we explore the effect of B// on secondary instabilities in 3D. We find that the suppression of the secondary instabilities due to B// is an artifact of the 2D simulations, whereas in 3D the instabilities can grow over a range of oblique angles even when there is a finite B//. These secondary instabilities give rise to turbulence, which transports the solar wind plasma originally stored within the flow vortices deep into the magnetosphere. Simple estimates suggest that the reconnection-induced rapid mixing and the turbulent-induced transport processes may contribute significantly to the formation of the Earth’s low-latitude boundary layer and the cold-dense plasma sheet during prolonged periods of northward IMF.",

The classic high-order statistical signature rapidly transitions to a monoscaling signature as one crosses to sub-ion scales. How this scaling depends upon plasma conditions, and the underlying physical implications have yet to be fully explored. We present a study focusing on 28 intervals of solar wind magnetic field data from the Cluster spacecraft sampling a broad range of plasma parameters. We show how the scaling properties vary between these intervals and more importantly, if there are any correlations between the scaling exponents and the plasma parameter variations. We supplement this observational study with a computational investigation where we study spatial samples from an 1024^3 EMHD simulation -- a model for sub-ion scale magnetic field dynamics consisting solely of the Hall effect. From this, we show that the Hall-term can generate a topological change from current sheets at fluid scales to current filaments at sub-ion scales. We conjecture that this fundamental change in the coherent structures comprising the turbulence is also responsible for the change in the intermittency that we see from our observations; and which could also be responsible for dissipation at these scales.",

Much effort has been expended to understand the effects of temperature on buried organic matter. It is thought that heat may destroy certain organic structures and help to polymerize others into oligomers and polymers with a high preservation potential. The consequences of pressure remain less well understood. The neglect of pressure as a transforming agent is surprising considering the proliferation of high-pressure environments on Earth and beyond.\nWe have performed in situ high pressure synchrotron-source FTIR spectroscopy measurements on standards representing common units found within kerogens. These standards represent the aliphatic, aromatic and polar components of natural organic matter in monomeric and polymeric forms. Samples were taken to 11 GPa at ambient temperature; some were also heated to their melting point at <2 GPa. Heated large volume press experiments have allowed quantitative analysis of natural samples: Type I and II kerogens are inherently unstable under pressure, Type III and IV kerogens are more stable. Our diamond anvil cell measurements open a window onto the effects of pressure on individual classes of organic compounds, with consequences for the transformation and preservation of organic matter in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "Understanding critical processes that contribute to the organization of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) is important for accurate weather forecasts and climate model parameterization development. In this study, we investigate the effects of wind shear at different vertical levels on the organization and properties of cloud systems using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with spectral-bin microphysics. Based on a control run for an MCS with weak wind shear, we find that increasing wind shear at the both lower (0-5 km) and middle vertical levels (5-10 km) reduces accumulated precipitation and occurrence of heavy rain, while increasing wind shear at the upper levels (> 10 km) leads to small changes in precipitation. Although increasing wind shear at the lower-levels is favorable for a more organized quasi-line system, the precipitation is still reduced by 18.6% compared with the control run due to stronger rain evaporation. Strong wind shear in the middle vertical levels produces a strong super-cell over a narrow area, leading to 67.3% reduction of domain mean precipitation. Increasing wind shear at the upper levels only, does not significantly change the organization of the convection, but it increases cloudiness at the upper-levels which in turn leads to stronger surface cooling, which then stabilizes the atmosphere and weakens convection. When strong wind shear exists over the entire vertical profile, a deep dry layer (from 2 to 9 km) is produced and convection is severely suppressed, leading to fewer high and deep clouds, and the precipitation is reduced by up to 90% in comparison to the control run. The changes in cloud microphysical properties further explain the reduction of surface rain by strong wind shear especially at the lower- and middle-levels. The insights obtained from this study help us better understand the cloud system organization and provide a foundation for improved parameterization of the effect of organized MCS on large-scale circulation.",

The moorings, which collect water temperature and light intensity data at high temporal frequency and at multiple depths, are relatively inexpensive, with a total cost of approximately $15 to $30 per student, depending on the configuration. Deployments of multiple months, or even longer, are possible, but in this presentation two ~3-week long deployments are described. Students in an Introduction to Oceanography course at Peninsula College in Port Angeles, Washington (USA) designed and constructed moorings for deployment in an enclosed harbor at depths of ~8 meters. The HOBO pendants integrated into the moorings were set to log observations at one hour intervals.\nAfter mooring recovery students downloaded data, which were both incorporated into class lessons where feasible, but were also utilized in a fully inquiry-based research paper. The exercise was often cited in students’ evaluations as a highlight, and served to both teach and reinforce oceanographic concepts, introduce students to professional options within ocean science and engineering fields, and provide skills training (by requiring students to work in Excel for data manipulation, for example).",

            "abstract": "The isotopic composition of lithium (δ7Li) is recognized to be an excellent proxy of near-surface fluid-rock reactions during weathering. Using Li as a tracer of these processes however requires constraints on the average Li composition of terrestrial reservoirs, in particular that of the upper continental crust. To date, only one value for the average δ7Li value of the upper continental crust, derived from periglacial loess, shales, and granites is available in the literature (7δLi = 0 ± 4 (2σ), Teng et al., 2004). Several values exist for the average [Li] of the upper crust, but they differ by more than 30%. We measured the Li isotopic composition of about 30 desert and periglacial loess (unweathered windblown sediments) from several parts of the world (Europe, Argentina, China and Tajikistan). We demonstrate that desert loess, which is more homogeneous and representative of larger portions of the Earth's surface, provides a better proxy for the average composition of the upper continental crust compared to periglacial loess. The Li isotopic compositions and concentrations of desert loess are controlled by eolian sorting, which can be quantified as a binary isotopic mixing between a weathered fine-grained end-member and an unweathered coarse-grained end-member. Using correlations between Li isotopic compositions, Li concentrations and trace element concentrations in desert loess, we estimate new average values for the upper continental crust: 1 ± 2 (2σ); [Li] = 35.3 ± 4.6 (2σ) ppm. This δ7Li value is slightly higher than that previously published in Teng et al. (2004), but overlaps within uncertainty, whereas the [Li] is identical to that of Teng et al. (2004: 35 ± 11, 2σ); both new estimates have lower uncertainty. Our new estimate of [Li], along with that of Teng et al. (2004), are higher than all previous estimates for the upper continental crust, raising the question as to whether the average concentrations of other mobile alkali metals such as cesium (Cs) and rubidium (Rb) may have also been underestimated in previous studies.",

            "abstract": "GIS and geological modeling software have radically changed the means by which geological mapping is produced, published and visualized. This type of software environment normally requires a spatially aware reference system to position data and interpretation, often referred as georeferenced data (i.e. geographic data referenced on the Earth). However, for this study we coin the term areoreferenced data (i.e. Mars-referenced \"geographic\" data). Thanks to the wealth of areoreferenced data made available by the NASA and the HiRise at University of Arizona it is now possible to carry out 3D areographic and areologic (i.e. related to the topography and geology of Mars, respectively) reconstructions in great detail. The present work benefits from the availability of software and areographic data, and presents the results of an areologic map and 3D model of the fault systems in the Meridiani Planum of Mars. The work has been carried out in Move™ (developed by Midland Valley Exploration), a geological modeling toolkit that allows for easy data loading in a wide range of formats as well as straightforward 2D/3D model building tools of geological bodies. Initial data consisted of Digital Terrain Model and orthoimages (NASA/JPL/University of Arizona/USGS). From these we have interpreted several structural domains: right-lateral strike-slip systems with associated releasing bends, which gave room to an extensional event causing a horizontal-axis rotation of the bedding. Bedding ranges from subhorizontal in the southern domain where strike-slip prevails to nearly 40º in the central and northern domains, where a more complex interaction between strike-slip and extensional faults is described. The stratigraphic sequence is mainly composed by moderately rounded well laminated basaltic sandstones (Squyres et al., 2004) in which a high component of sulfurs (e.g. sulfate anhydrate, hexahydrite, epsomite, gypsum) and salts (e.g. halite) has been described (Squyres et al., 2004; Christensen et al., 2004). This presence of sulfurs and salts do not only evidence the presence of water in Mars in the past, but also makes us consider the presence of deeper layers that may constitute potential décollement levels on which the faults detach, as it has been described in extensional and compressional cordilleras elsewhere in the Earth.",

The study utilizes World-wide GPS Receiver Network Total Electron Content (TEC) data spanning 13 years (2001-2014) and focuses on the changes in the equatorial ionization anomaly the Western hemisphere. TEC is highly variable due to the influences of solar flux, geomagnetic activity, and seasonal variation and these influences are removed by the use of model. This empirical TEC model is a combination of linear dependencies of solar flux (F10.7) and geomagnetic activity (Ap3) with a third degree polynomial dependency for day-of-year (DOY). With such dependencies removed, the remaining TEC variation could be resolved and attributed to an appropriate mechanism. Lunar phase and apside was investigated in particular, especially the new and full moon phases during perigees when tidal forcing would be most powerful. Lunar tidal forcing on planetary waves is also examined as being physically responsible for setting up conditions that may give rise to SSWs and ionospheric anomalies. Preliminary results suggest that such anomalies may be enhanced in intensity during the full or new moon and even more so during perigee by different amounts depending on whether the SSW is a major (40-60%) or minor (20-45%) event.",

            "abstract": "Cross-flow turbines are free-stream kinetic energy converters that operate with an axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of water flow. Because they can be deployed in high-blockage configurations, cross-flow turbine arrays have the potential to exploit both the kinetic and potential energy in moving water and operate, on an array basis, more efficiently than sparse arrays of axial-flow turbines. However, because their unit efficiency is lower, cross-flow turbines have received less commercial attention than axial-flow turbines and parametric studies of experimental performance are limited.\nWe present the results of performance testing for a set of fixed-pitch cross-flow turbines. The aspect ratio of the turbines are held constant while number of blades, preset blade pitch angle, blade helix angle, and blade profile are parametrically adjusted. Turbine performance is characterized using torque control in a laboratory flume at moderate blockage ratio and a diameter-based Reynolds number on the order of 105. In addition to power performance, acoustic Doppler velocimeters on a computer-controlled gantry system are used to characterize the wake structure. Results demonstrate that turbine performance is strongly sensitive to the preset blade pitch angle, with a positive (outward) blade pitch substantially increasing peak efficiency relative to neutral pitch and negative (inward) blade pitch substantially degrading peak efficiency. The relevance of these studies to high-efficiency turbine arrays are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the use of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data to validate the global hydrological cycle as simulated by an atmospheric General Circulation Model (GCM), particularly the transport of water from the ocean to the land and vice-versa. Until GRACE, no other observational data were available for such a robust assessment. Usually, moisture transport is calculated by using the water balance equations (e.g. Precipitation-Evaporation), or by using reanalysis data, which are known to have major issues related to the hydrological cycle. By comparing the decade-long record of Earth’s gravity field variations measured by GRACE with the terrestrial water storage simulated by GCMs, we can compare the amplitude of the variability in water transport at inter-annual to decadal time scales at global and regional scales. This is an innovative approach to assess GCMs and understand the processes underlying changes in the water cycle. It is by improving our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the hydrological cycle that we will be able to build confidence in model simulations of the evolution of the hydrological cycle with climate change.\nWe make use of the UPSCALE (UK on PRACE: weather resolving Simulations of Climate for globAL Environmental risk) campaign, a traceable hierarchy of global atmospheric simulations (based on the Met Office Unified Model, GA3 formulation), with mesh sizes ranging from 130 km to 25 km, for which five-member ensembles of 27-year, atmosphere-only integrations are available, using present-day forcing. We show here the ability of this climate model, at any resolution, to simulate the inter-annual variability of terrestrial water storage, compared to GRACE. We particularly find that the model is able to capture the regional distribution of changes in terrestrial water transport during El Nino Southern Oscillation events, implying its ability to import more or less water over land during a La Nina or an El Nino event.",

            "abstract": "There are few observational constraints on surface emissivity at wavelengths longer than 15 μm, a spectral region commonly referred to as the far-infrared. Nevertheless, where the precipitable water vapor (PWV) is less than 1 mm, which is common at high latitudes and high altitudes, the infrared energy budget is directly impacted by this emissivity. Calculations based on published indices of refraction of ice, water, and common surficial minerals, and observations based on a limited set of spectroscopic measurements, find that non-frozen ocean and desert scenes will exhibit lower far-infrared surface emissivity than frozen scenes by between 0.1 and 0.2.\nThe representation of surface emissivity in climate models is highly simplified, based on ideal black-body emission, and systematically higher than emissivity of real surfaces. Therefore, we performed sensitivity studies using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and found that Arctic surface temperatures warm by 2 °K and frozen surface extent decreases by 5-10% when the model is subjected to realistic values of far-infrared surface emissivity. This finding may help explain the cold-pole bias, and also suggests the potential for a positive feedback whereby the loss of snow or ice leads to the exposure of surfaces that reduce surface infrared cooling, thus warming the surface further.",

(2014) varied the seed aerosol surface area in toluene oxidation and observed a clear increase in the SOA yield with increasing seed surface area. Using a coupled vapor-particle dynamics model, we examine the extent to which this increase is the result of vapor wall deposition versus kinetic limitations arising from imperfect accommodation of organic species into the particle phase. We show that a seed surface area dependence of the SOA yield is present only when condensation of vapors onto particles is kinetically limited. The existence of kinetic limitation can be predicted by comparing the characteristic timescales of gas-phase reaction, vapor wall deposition, and gas-particle equilibration. The gas-particle equilibration timescale depends on the gas-particle accommodation coefficient αp. Regardless of the extent of kinetic limitation, vapor wall deposition depresses the SOA yield from that in its absence since vapor molecules that might otherwise condense on particles deposit on the walls. To accurately extrapolate chamber-derived yields to atmospheric conditions, both vapor wall deposition and kinetic limitations must be taken into account.",

GOM-FVCOM grid features unstructured triangular meshes with horizontal resolution of ~ 0.3-25 km and a hybrid terrain-following vertical coordinate with a total of 45 layers. The Mass coastal FVCOM grid is configured with triangular meshes with horizontal resolution up to ~10 m, and 10 layers in the vertical. Scituate, Hampton River and Mass Bay inundation model grids include both water and land with horizontal resolution up to ~5-10 m and 10 vertical layers. GOM-FVCOM is driven by surface forcing from WRF model output configured for the region (with 9-km resolution), the COARE3 bulk air-sea flux algorithm, local river discharges, and tidal forcing constructed by eight constituents and subtidal forcing on the boundary nested to the Global-FVCOM. SWAVE is driven by the same WRF wind field with wave forcing at the boundary nested to Wave Watch III configured for the northwestern Atlantic region. The Mass coastal FVCOM and three inundation models are connected with GOM-FVCOM through one-way nesting in the common boundary zones. The Mass coastal FVCOM is driven by the same surface forcing as GOM-FVCOM. The nesting boundary conditions for the inundation models include both hydrodynamics and waves provided by GOM-FVCOM and SWAVE. NECOFS was placed in experimental forecast operation in late 2007 and the daily 3-day forecast product can be accessed and viewed on the NECOFS web map server (\nhttp://porpoise1.smast.umassd.edu:8080\n/fvcomwms/).",

The method uses the Bayesian algorithm Low-count Image Reconstruction and Analysis (LIRA) to infer the multi-scale component of the loops which describes deviations from a smooth model. The increase in contrast of features in this multi-scale component is determined using a statistic that estimates the sharpness across the image. Regions with significant substructure are determined using p-value upper bounds. We are able to locate substructure visible in Hi-C (High-Resolution Coronal Imager) data that are not salient features in the corresponding AIA image. Looking at coronal loops at different regions of the Sun (e.g., low-lying structure and loops in the upper corona) we are able to map where detectable substructure exists and thus the influence of the nanoflare heating process.\nWe acknowledge support from AIA under contract SP02H1701R from Lockheed-Martin to SAO.",

            "abstract": "Long term record of satellite-based terrestrial vegetation are important to evaluate terrestrial carbon cycle models. In this study, we demonstrate how multiple satellite observation can be used for evaluating past changes in gross primary productivity (GPP) and detecting robust anomalies in terrestrial carbon cycle in Asia through our model-data synthesis analysis, Asia-MIP. We focused on the two different temporal coverages: long-term (30 years; 1982-2011) and decadal (10 years; 2001-2011; data intensive period) scales. We used a NOAA/AVHRR NDVI record for long-term analysis and multiple satellite data and products (e.g. Terra-MODIS, SPOT-VEGETATION) as historical satellite data, and multiple terrestrial carbon cycle models (e.g. BEAMS, Biome-BGC, ORCHIDEE, SEIB-DGVM, and VISIT).\nAs a results of long-term (30 years) trend analysis, satellite-based time-series data showed that approximately 40% of the area has experienced a significant increase in the NDVI, while only a few areas have experienced a significant decreasing trend over the last 30 years. The increases in the NDVI were dominant in the sub-continental regions of Siberia, East Asia, and India. Simulations using the terrestrial biosphere models also showed significant increases in GPP, similar to the results for the NDVI, in boreal and temperate regions. A modeled sensitivity analysis showed that the increases in GPP are explained by increased temperature and precipitation in Siberia. Precipitation, solar radiation, CO2fertilization and land cover changes are important factors in the tropical regions. However, the relative contributions of each factor to GPP changes are different among the models.\nYear-to-year variations of terrestrial GPP were overall consistently captured by the satellite data and terrestrial carbon cycle models if the anomalies are large (e.g. 2003 summer GPP anomalies in East Asia and 2002 spring GPP anomalies in mid to high latitudes). The behind mechanisms can be consistently explained by the models if the anomalies are caused in the low temperature regions (e.g. spring in Northern Asia). However, water-driven or radiation-driven GPP anomalies lacks consistent explanation among models. Therefore, terrestrial carbon cycle models require improvement of the sensitivity of climate anomalies to carbon cycles.",

Velocity structure from broadband surface wave dispersion measurements can be used to constrain the complicated crustal and upper mantle structure caused by the plume enhanced rifting activity.\nHere I use data from the ICEMELT and HOTSPOT arrays on Iceland to generate phase velocity dispersion maps of both Rayleigh and Love waves from ambient noise cross correlation and teleseismic events. I invert Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion observed from ambient noise for tomographic velocity structure. For teleseismic Rayleigh waves I use the two-plane wave approximation array-based method of Forsyth and Li [2005]. I also develop and adapt this method for teleseismic Love waves. This requires additional preprocessing of the data to estimate the amplitude and phase for teleseismic Love waves. Specifically, for each station, the vertical component phase observation of the fundamental mode Rayleigh is used to predict and remove the horizontal components of Rayleigh waves. Then I invert for the maximum amplitude and apparent back azimuth at each period of interest of the Love wave from the transverse and radial components. The amplitude and phase measurement is then inverted for phase velocity structure using a modified version of the two plane-wave approximation.\nPreliminary results indicate a low velocity region at short periods (8-15 s) in both the Rayleigh and Love wave phase velocity maps beneath the active volcanic centers in the middle of the island. At longer periods (20-125 s) a low velocity region is visible beneath central Iceland. The velocity minimum is located to the north of Iceland in the Rayleigh wave maps. These observations are consistent with previous studies in the region.",

In recent history, the impact of man brought about additional climatic change. Solar activities have had notable effect on palaeoclimatic changes. Contemporary, both solar activities and building-up of green-house gases effect added to the climatic changes.\nThis paper discusses if the global worming caused by the green-house gases effect will be equal or less than the global cooling resulting from the solar activities. In this respect, we refer to the Modern Dalton Minimum (MDM) which stated that starting from year 2005 for the next 40 years; the earth’s surface temperature will become cooler than nowadays. However the degree of cooling, previously mentioned in old Dalton Minimum (c. 210 y ago), will be minimized by building-up of green-house gases effect during MDM period.\nRegarding to the periodicities of solar activities, it is clear that now we have a new solar cycle of around 210 years.\nKeywords: Solar activities; solar cycles; palaeoclimatic changes; Global cooling; Modern Dalton Minimum.",

            "abstract": "The role of dynamic storage in catchment discharge response to earlier snowmelt timing has not been fully quantified. Green Lake 4 (GL4) and Emerald Lake Watershed (ELW) have similar high-elevation settings but GL4 has greater estimated storage capacity relative to ELW due to differences in physical structure. Daily catchment area-normalized input (modelled snowmelt estimates) and output (measured discharge) in conjunction with mineral weathering products (hydrochemical data) for eleven snowmelt seasons from GL4 (more storage) and ELW (less storage) were used to determine the role of dynamic storage at the catchment scale. Daily fluxes generally show snowmelt is greater than discharge initially, changing mid-season to discharge being greater than snowmelt, creating a counter-clockwise hysteresis loop for each snowmelt season. This hysteresis loop can be approximated with a least-squares fitted ellipse. The properties of fitted ellipses were used to quantify catchment response, which were then compared between catchments with different storage capacities (GL4 and ELW). The eccentricity of the fitted ellipses can be used to quantify delay between snowmelt and discharge due to connection to subsurface storage; narrower loops show minimal storage delay whereas wider loops show greater storage delay. Variability of mineral weathering products shows changes in contribution from stored water over the snowmelt season. Both catchments show a moderate linear correlation between fitted ellipse area and total snowmelt volume (GL4 R2=0.516, ELW R2=0.614). Ellipse eccentricity is more consistent among years in ELW (range=0.81-0.94) than in GL4 (range=0.54-0.95), indicating a more consistent hydrologic structure and connectivity to shallow storage at ELW. The linear correlation between seasonal eccentricity versus snowmelt timing is stronger in ELW than GL4 (R2=0.741 and 0.223, respectively). ELW shows hydrochemical response independent of snowmelt timing, whereas GL4 shows more variability. The larger storage capacity of GL4 allows for a greater range of physical and chemical response to input conditions. The limited storage capacity of ELW shows greater vulnerability of physical response to changes in snowmelt conditions, though chemical response remains constant regardless of snowmelt conditions.",

            "abstract": "The NASA OSIRIS-REx mission plans to visit a B-type asteroid and return pristine regolith samples to Earth. These regolith samples, like those returned by the JAXA Hayabusa mission from Itokawa, will likely exhibit some modification by space weathering (SW). Further, these samples may contain up to ~5% organic carbon, mainly in the form of macromolecular carbon (MMC). MMC in meteorites can be studied with Raman spectroscopy; changes in its Raman spectral parameters have been shown to correlate with the petrographic grade of the meteorite. But these petrographic studies are calibrated with internal pieces of meteorite samples, so the MMC seen in meteorites has not experienced SW. Hence, it is important to determine the effects of SW may have on the MMC and its Raman spectrum. Laser pulse heating experiments that simulate the micrometeorite impact component of SW have been carried out in samples of pure graphite, and carbonaceous chondrites Allende (CV3) and Murchison (CM2). Pulse heating was done in vacuum (1×10-6 torr) with a 20 Hz 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser, a 6 ns pulse duration (30 mJ/pulse), and a 200 μm spot size. Raman spectra were collected on the each sample using a WITec alpha300 R confocal Raman microscope, with a 1 mW 532 nm continuous laser and a ~10 μm laser spot size. UVVIS-NIR (0.4-2.5 µm) reflectance was measured using an Analytical Spectral Devices Inc. FieldSpec 4 spectrometer. Based on its Raman spectra, the original pure graphite is modified to nanocrystalline graphite by 10 minutes (12,000 laser pulses), and further modified to glassy carbon (amorphous 3-coordinate carbon) within 20 minutes (24,000 laser pulses). Vapor deposited on the side of the sample holder has a Raman spectrum consistent with amorphous carbon glass (3- and 4-coordinate carbon). Laser SW carried out on a slab of Murchison resulted in the production of glassy carbon inside siliceous melt blobs in the laser craters. Surprisingly, the Raman spectrum for MMC in Allende powder does not change, despite the production of melt glass and changes to its reflectance spectra. To confirm our Raman results, compositional and structural analyses of the carbon bearing SW products in Allende and Murchison will be done using transmission electron microscopy. Future work will expand our samples to other aqueously altered meteorites such as CI1 and CM1 chondrites",

            "abstract": "From sediment subduction rates and C contents at ODP/DSDP sites 765 and 211, we estimate the rate of C subduction along ~2000 km of the East Sunda Arc to be ~0.4 Tg C yr-1, representing a significant source of subducted volatiles [1]. However volatile recycling efficiency and the provenance of recycled volatiles in this region remain poorly understood. With new δ13C measurements of both carbonate and organic carbon from sites 211 and 765, we present the most detailed study yet of the spatial variability of subducted C and recycled CO2 provenance along the strike of the arc. Furthermore we demonstrate the importance of oceanic crustal carbonate as a C source in a subduction zone that is otherwise carbonate starved.\nCarbonate content throughout the sediment column decreases dramatically between site 765, approximately 250 km from the Australian continental margin, and site 211, approximately 300 km southwest of the trench and outboard of the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java. Continental and shelf carbonate input from the Australian margin dominates shallow deposits at site 765, but underlying pelagic sediments are thought to contribute the majority of inorganic C to the arc. The paucity of carbonate in sediments at site 211 suggests that along this segment essentially all carbonate subducted is derived from altered ocean crust, presenting an opportunity to study the effects of crustal carbonate input.\nWhile previous C provenance studies relied on globally-averaged δ13C values for organic and inorganic C in subducted sediments, we present new estimates based on measured δ13CVPDB of carbonate (average of ~2‰ in subducted sediments) and organic carbon (-22.5 to -23‰ average) along with previously published efflux data [2]. These estimates suggest that the arc-averaged ratio of carbonate to organic C subducted along the East Sunda Arc is nearly identical to the inorganic to organic C ratio represented in volcanic and hydrothermal CO2 output, suggesting that differential devolatilization of carbonate and organic C is limited. Our calculated CO2 recycling efficiency of 10 to 20% – which does not include fore-arc outgassing – agrees with geochemical models predicting up to 80% of subducted C may be carried into the deep mantle [3].\n[1] Hilton et al., 2002; [2] Halldórsson et al., 2013; [3] Cook-Kollars et al., 2014",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneity is abundant everywhere across the hydrosphere. It exists in the soil, the vadose zone and the groundwater. In large-scale hydrological models, subsurface heterogeneity is usually not considered. Instead average or representative values are chosen for each of the simulated grid cells, not incorporating any sub-grid variability. This may lead to unreliable predictions when the models are used for assessing future water resources availability, floods or droughts, or when they are used for recommendations for more sustainable water management.\nIn this study we use a novel, large-scale model that takes into account sub-grid heterogeneity for the simulation of groundwater recharge by using statistical distribution functions. We choose all regions over Europe that are comprised by carbonate rock (~35% of the total area) because the well understood dissolvability of carbonate rocks (karstification) allows for assessing the strength of subsurface heterogeneity.\nApplying the model with historic data and future climate projections we show that subsurface heterogeneity lowers the vulnerability of groundwater recharge on hydro-climatic extremes and future changes of climate. Comparing our simulations with the PCR-GLOBWB model we can quantify the deviations of simulations for different sub-regions in Europe.",

Over the past two years we have worked to fill this gap with archaeomagnetic data – directions and palaeointensities – by studying the thermoremanent magnetization of Maori hangi cooking stones. Used as heat retainers, these stones are heated, frequently above the Curie temperatures of constituent magnetic minerals, before being buried in earth ovens. After removal of the food, hangi sites are often abandoned with the stones still in situ, carrying a record of the magnetic field in which they were last cooled.\nWe have sampled a range of archaeological hangi sites throughout New Zealand, dating to early prehistoric times (ca 700 BP). The stones vary in lithology from andesites, originating from the central North Island volcanoes, favoured by Maori for their durability and with NRM intensities up to 30 A/m, to greywackes and schists from the main axial ranges, with NRMs as weak as 10-4A/m.\nIn all cases, we have independently oriented and retrieved several stones, and we have made several specimens from each stone, either by drilling (standard cylindrical specimens) or sawing (pseudo-cubes) in the laboratory. We have calculated site mean palaeomagnetic directions from principal component analysis of thermal demagnetization data, discarding the data of stones that show evidence of disturbance. We have carried out palaeointensity experiments using a Coe/Thellier method with pTRM and tail checks, and with selection criteria modified to the situation. Rock magnetic experiments contribute to our understanding of the mineralogy, domain state and blocking temperature spectra.\nThe palaeodirections fall between declinations of 348o and 24.5o, and inclinations of -46.4o and -72.4o, with palaeointensities between 43.7±1.4 and 81.3±6.1 mT. Most fall within the expected range of secular variation for New Zealand. However the palaeointensity of 81.34±6.08mT, from an archaeological site at Opihi in the south of the South Island, dated at 382±20 BP, is unexpectedly high.\nWe present our data against model records for New Zealand calculated using the ARCH3k model of Korte et al (2009), and suggest that the addition of our new data will improve the model for the most recent period of time.",

            "abstract": "The complex interactions/feedbacks between water vapor fields and deep atmospheric convection remains one of the outstanding problems in Tropical Meteorology. The lack of high spatial/temporal resolution, all-weather observations in the Tropics has hampered progress. Numerical models have difficulties, for example, in representing the shallow-to-deep convective transition and the diurnal cycle of precipitation. GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) meteorology, which provides all-weather, high frequency (5 minutes), precipitable water vapor, can help. From 3.5 years of GNSS meteorological data in Manaus, (Central Amazonia), 320 convective events were analyzed. Results reveal two characteristic time scales of water vapor convergence; an 8 h time scale of weak convergence and 4 h timescale of intense water vapor convergence associated with the shallow-to-deep convection transition. The 4 h shallow-to-deep transition time scale is particularly robust, regardless of convective intensity, seasonality, or nocturnal versus daytime convection. We also present a summary of the Amazon Dense GNSS Meteorological Network experiment, the first ever in the Tropics, was created with the explicit aim of examining the wv/deep convection relationships at the mesoscale. This innovative, international experiment, consisted of two mesoscale (100km x100km) networks: (1) a one-year (April 2011 to April 2012) campaign (20 GNSS meteorological sites) in and around Manaus , and (2) a 6 week (June 2011) intensive campaign (15 GNSS meteorological sites) in and around Belem, this latter in collaboration with the CHUVA GPM in Brazil. Results presented here from both networks focus on the diurnal cycle of precipitable water vapor: for sea breeze convection in Belem and, for assessing the influence seasonal and topographic influences for Manaus. Ultimately, these unique observations may serve to initialize, constrain, or validate precipitable water vapor spatial and temporal evolution in high resolution models.",

            "abstract": "The modification of lumped models to corresponding semi-distributed ones implies the identification of an optimal weighting factor on different grids. The necessity of such hypothetical weighting factor is shown through two successful proposed protocols, inter-models and inter-basins, using both versions either of GR2M model or SimulHyd model, on sixteen watersheds on the Niger River and its tributaries, over eighteen to forty six years. The assumption of the first protocol is that the difference in performance between the lumped and the semi-distributed versions of a model is due to the spatial variance of soil information in entry of semi-distributed model version. The correlation between the variance coefficient of Water Holding Capacity (WHC of soil) and the relative difference of model versions (between their performances in terms of Nash criteria) decreases in absolute value from 0.76 to 0.21 when a proposed weighting factor is applied in semi-distributed modelling; so, through the weighting factor the variance information of WHC is taken into account, and the correlation between relative difference of model versions (in terms of performance) and this information is decreased: more this de-correlation is, more the weighting factor that improve the performance of a semi-distributed model is better. The proposed weighting factor is built based on the variance coefficient of WHC. Behind the inter-basins protocol is an assumption that: imbedded basins would have influences during the calibration process of a model parameters on a large basin that contains them; it aims to test whether the information from upstream discharge stations could be useful during the modelling process in a downstream discharge station. In the same period, the calibration of a model version on each sixteen basin is performed, following by its validation on fifteens basins using the set of calibrated parameters of the model on the largest basin (Koulikoro). On a basin the lowest the difference of performance is, the highest is the considered influence of this basin to the calibration process of the model parameters on the Koulikoro basin. The coefficient of correlation between the series of relative difference of performances (on a basin) and the series of relative difference of mean WHC values (of each basin against Koulikoro Basin) is -0.33.",

To date, ~350,000 km2 of data have been collected, processed and released via NSIDC under the auspices of NASA’s Operation Icebridge. In November 2013, the LVIS was paired with the LVIS-GH sensor (an updated version of the instrument developed for high-altitude operations in the Global Hawk UAV) and used to overfly Spring 2013 Icebridge or Cryosat-2 tracks in Greenland and the Arctic, providing data for seasonal change assessments and validation of Cryosat-2. The precise and accurate, large-area coverage capabilities provided by the LVIS systems are important to supporting and enhancing future space-based lidar missions such as ICESat-2 and GEDI. To maximize such support as well as provide targeted data sets for end users in the cryosphere and other communities, the LVIS Facility capability is currently under development with goals of providing up to 5 times more data than present with 2 month turnaround at much reduced cost to the end user.

            "abstract": "Transverse Aeolian Ridges (TARs) are aeolian bedforms that are morphologically and dimensionally distinct from Large Dark Dune (LDD) fields, being generally brighter than, or of similar albedo to, the surrounding terrain. These features are significantly smaller than the LDDs, appear to form normal to local winds, and tend to have simple, transverse, ripple-like morphologies. Whether these small martian bedforms represent large granule ripples, small transverse dunes, or something else entirely is currently under debate. The spatial distribution of TARs provides important information about where on Mars aeolian sediments are concentrated, and determining their volume can help us constrain the sediment transport regime on Mars. Also, if we can determine if TARs were active only in the past, or whether TARs are mobile under today’s wind conditions, then we can begin to assess when and where TARs are/were active over Mars’ recent geological history. Thus TARs have the potential for being indicators/records of climate change on Mars.\nIn this work we build on previous work [1,2] and focus on the local/regional scale. We have identified six regional study areas, each 5° by 5°, to investigate the behavior of TARs in detail; one in the northern hemisphere, three in the equatorial band, and two in the southern hemisphere. We have systematically mapped TAR and LDD deposits in each study area to constrain sediment transport pathways and identify sediment sources. In general, TAR sediments appear to be tied to local sources such as LDDs or layered terrains. HiRISE DTMs were utilized to measure TAR heights, widths, wavelengths, and lengths to calculate sediment volumes and estimate volumes over entire study areas based on mapping. Crater count analyses on contiguous TAR fields in the equatorial regions, where the bedforms appear more lithified, reveal ages of several million years. Mid-latitude TAR fields do not show any superposed craters, suggesting much younger deposits.\n",

            "abstract": "Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is a promising new tracer to constrain the gross CO2 fluxes of land ecosystems, particularly in tropical forests where CO2 flux partitioning is often problematic due to the absence of turbulent flow at night. Since vegetation COS and CO2 uptake during photosynthesis is closely coupled, the gross fluxes of photosynthesis and respiration can be quantified through the concurrent measurements of COS and CO2. We measured ecosystem COS and CO2 exchange over four months in a tropical rainforest at La Selva, Costa Rica. We observed a strong ecosystem uptake of COS with a diel signal that was similar but not identical to net CO2 fluxes. Soils at the site mostly acted as COS sinks, correlated with soil moisture. The COS and CO2 data were used to calculate canopy photosynthesis (approx. GPP) from net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) based on the empirical relationship of leaf relative uptake of COS and CO2. Mid-day COS-based GPP estimates ranged from -10 to -15 μmol m-2 s-1, compared to NEE of -5 to -10 μmol m-2 s-1. Ecosystem respiration, calculated as the difference of NEE and GPP, ranged from 5 to 10 μmol m-2 s-1, similar to previous estimates of 5 to 9 μmol m-2 s-1 from CO2 flux partitioning and respiration component measurements at the site. Our results support the application of COS as a new tool in ecosystem flux partitioning that may be particularly useful in tropical forests.",

            "abstract": "Optimal estimation (OE) is a commonly used inverse method in the geosciences. In a Bayesian context, a set of measurements (y) is related to the state vector to be retrieved (x) by the forward model F(x). Assuming Gaussian statistics, OE returns an optimal solution and its associated uncertainty by minimizing the cost function that consists of the state vector-a priori state difference weighted by the a priori uncertainty and the measurement-forward model difference weighted by the uncertainties of observation and forward model. OE algorithms are easy to implement and are finding increasing use within communities attempting to derive, for instance, cloud and precipitation microphysical properties from remote sensing data. However, even though OE algorithms are simple to implement, obtaining rigorous uncertainty estimates from them is a significant challenge. Our objective with this work is to illustrate the growth of retrieval uncertainty within the OE framework due to various sources using simple real world examples of non-precipitating liquid clouds.\nWithin the OE retrieval, several sources of uncertainties contribute to the overall retrieval uncertainty (Sx), including the measurement uncertainty (Sy), the uncertainties in a priori information (Sa) and uncertainties in the forward model due to imperfectly known parameters (Sb). In this study, two examples are given to demonstrate how uncertainties in Sy, Sa and Sb affect the ultimate retrieval uncertainty Sx. We apply OE technique to retrieve cloud liquid water content (LWC) and total number from measurements of radar reflectivity and extinction obtained in 2005 Marine Stratus/Stratocumulus Experiment (MASE). In the first example, the forward model is assumed perfect, which means all parameters are certain and Sb is zero. Then we perturb Sy and Sa separately and observe the response of Sx. We find the observation error Sy contributes significantly to the retrieval uncertainty under the assumption of “perfect model”. In our second example, we redo the first example, but assuming one of the gamma particle size distribution parameters, the shape parameter, is uncertain. We find that Sb is a dominant term that impacts the ultimate retrieval uncertainty and the effects of forward model uncertainties typically dominate the uncertainty in measurements.",

            "abstract": "As part of a larger study to investigate potential effects of hydrocarbons on the geotechnical properties of aquifer solids, a series of laboratory experiments were carried out to ascertain the influence of evaporation rate of some common and widespread organic contaminants on the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer sand. Gasoline and its constituent chemicals─benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX), isooctane─ and trichloroethylene (TCE) were used to contaminate sand samples collected from the aquifer and vadose zone, at varying concentrations for extended periods of time. The goal was to study any change in the chemical makeup of the contaminants and its control on hydraulic conductivity of the sand. It was found that: (a) gasoline breaks down into constituent compounds when subjected to evaporation, e.g. during oil spills and leaks; and (b) lighter compounds volatilize faster and in the following order: TCE> benzene > isooctane > toluene > gasoline> ethylbenzene > xylene. In addition, these contaminants also caused a decrease in hydraulic conductivity of sand by up to 60% as compared to the uncontaminated sand. The inherent differences in the chemical structure of contaminating chemicals influenced hydraulic conductivity such that the observed decrease was greater for aliphatic than aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons. The presentation includes details of the experimental set up; evaporation rate, and geotechnical tests; X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope studies; and data analyses and interpretation. Rate of evaporation test indicates that residual LNAPLs will occupy a certain portion of the pores in the soil either as liquid or vapor phase in the vadose zone, and will create a coating on the adjacent solid mineral grains in the aquifer. Replacement of air by the LNAPLs along with grain coatings and the intramolecular forces would impede groundwater movement, thus affecting overall permeability of contaminated aquifers.\nKeywords: aquifer sand, hydraulic conductivity, BTEX, gasoline, LNAPLs, isooctane",

Six different configurations of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model drive otherwise identical simulations with FLEXPART for 49 days over eastern North America.

Spatial and temporal averaging reduces the uncertainty marginally. Tracer age uncertainty due solely to meteorological uncertainty is 15-20%.

            "abstract": "Understanding upper mantle discontinuities and properties of the mantle transition zone gives important insights into mantle composition and dynamics. One approach to study the transition zone is to use triplicated arrivals of seismic data that allow one to infer depths and velocity jumps of the discontinuities. However, this approach has been unpopular compared to other techniques, such as that using underside reflections, converted phases, or seismic tomography, because the triplication pattern is difficult to capture using sparsely distributed stations.\nWe take advantage of dense network of stations and examine triplication data from earthquakes at different depths to unravel the complex wave arrivals and determine the wave speed structure. Deep earthquakes (depth>410 km) do not generate triplication associated with the 410-km discontinuity, and are thus first investigated to constrain the 660-km discontinuity. Using this knowledge of the wave speed structure around 660-km discontinuity, shallower events are analyzed to resolve the seismic structure for the 410-km discontinuity. Therefore, constraints on each discontinuity can be obtained from separate sets of data without interference from the seismic structure around the other discontinuity.\nWe apply this technique to data recorded by the Japanese High-Sensitivity Seismograph Network with more than 700 densely spaced stations. Given the distribution of the stations, earthquakes in the Sea of Okhotsk region are chosen to investigate the seismic structure of the 410- and 660-km discontinuities beneath a region northeast of Japan. Since we focus on the regional one-dimensional seismic structure, the deep and shallow events at similar locations ensure that the data are sampling the same structure. Our results are consistent with previous studies on this region using SS precursors and tomographic imaging. They show significant deviations from global average in depths of the discontinuities due to subducting Pacific Plate, and imply local temperature effects on the depths of mineral phase changes.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) missions have collected more than 11 years of continuous tracking data of spacecraft in orbit around Mars. The radio science data are generally used to determine the static and seasonal gravity field of the central body. However, these two spacecraft are in different sun-synchronous orbits that cover a wide range of altitudes (250-410 km) where investigation of the atmosphere and climate of Mars so far have not been supported by in situ and remote sensing measurements. The drag perturbation acting on the probes provides indirect measurements of the Martian atmospheric density. Therefore, we focused our work on the determination of the long-term periodicity of the atmospheric constituents in the Mars exosphere with Mars Odyssey and MRO radio tracking data.\nWe implemented the Drag Temperature Model (DTM) –Mars model into our Precise Orbit Determination (POD) program GEODYN-II to adequately reproduce variations in temperature and (partial) density along ODY and MRO trajectories. The recovery of Mars' atmospheric dynamics using Doppler tracking data requires the accurate modeling of all forces acting on the spacecraft. The main non-conservative force, apart from drag, is solar radiation pressure. Spacecraft panel reflectivities and the radiation pressure-scaling factor are not estimated, but we adjusted empirical once-per-revolution along-track periodic accelerations (cosine and sine) over each orbital arc to mitigate solar radiation pressure mismodeling.\nAfter converging the orbital data arcs, and editing out all the data during superior conjunctions, we combined the MRO and Mars Odyssey arcs in a global solution where we estimated spacecraft initial states, time-correlated drag scale factors, and annual and semi-annual variability of the major constituents in the Mars upper atmosphere. We will show that the updated DTM-Mars model provides a better prediction of the long-term variability of the dominant species, which are CO2, O, and He at the MRO and ODY orbit altitudes. The indirect measurements of atmospheric density profiles at those altitudes provide additional information to improve general circulation models, which already suitably represent lower altitudes in the atmosphere.",

Compared to ground-based precipitation measurements, satellite-based precipitation estimation products have advantages of temporal resolution and spatial coverage. Also, the massive amount of satellite data contains various measures related to precipitation formation and development. On the other hand, deep learning algorithms were newly developed in the area of machine learning, which was a breakthrough to deal with large and complex dataset, especially to image data.\nHere, we attempts to engage deep learning techniques to provide hourly precipitation estimation from long wave infrared data from operational geostationary weather satellites. The brightness temperature data from infrared data is considered to contain cloud information. Radar stage IV dataset is used as ground measurement for parameter calibration. Denoising stacked auto-encoders (DSAE) is applied here to build a 4-layer neural network with 1000 hidden nodes for each layer. DSAE involves two major steps: (1) greedily pre-training each layer as an auto-encoder using the outputs of previous trained hidden layer output starting from visible layer to initialize parameters; (2) fine-tuning the whole deep neural network with supervised criteria.\nRain/No-rain classification is dealt as the first step of precipitation estimation in this research. Our experiments show that deep neural networks outperform the classic approach originally used in developing the PERSIANN-CCS (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System). In an experiment over a 3-month summer period focusing on the central U.S with hourly data, the proposed approach’s Probability of Detection (POD) increased to 0.433 as compared to PERSIANN-CCS value of 0.403 and decreased the False Alarm Ratio (FAR) to 0.606 as compared to 0.633 for the PERSIANN-CCS.",

Successive episodes of subsequent extension, compression, magmatism, accretion, and rifting have left the sub-continental upper mantle with a complex signature of thermal and chemical heterogeneity. One key interest is the history of melt production, migration, and storage in sub-continental upper mantle as it provides a window into past and present dynamical processes, including the differentiation and formation of continental structure.\nHere we examine seismic discontinuities within the mantle that arise from a wide range of mechanisms, including changes in mineralogy, major element composition, melt content, volatile abundance, anisotropy, or a combination of the above. Using a dataset of broadband seismograms of underside reflected S-waves arriving as precursors to the seismic phase SS, we determine the depth and impedance contrast of discontinuities in the depth range of 80-410 km. Our observations are compared to predictions for the seismic moduli from a mineral physics database using the software MuMaP (Multiphase Material Properties). MuMaP modeling allows us to vary the average regional temperature, mantle composition and account for the effects of melt (if present).\nIn our initial study of the western North American plate, we detect the presence of the 410 km discontinuity, a discontinuity at 300 km depth (X), and a G discontinuity at 60-80 km depth. The X is indicative of the coesite to stishovite phase transition in the upper mantle and suggests substantial mixing of subducted basalt with the mantle. The presence of the G may indicate partial melt in the asthenosphere, melt frozen into the lithosphere, and/or anisotropic fabrics preserved beneath the continent. These hypotheses are evaluated against MuMap predictions for melt content and anisotropic structure in the upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Communities in the Santa Rosa Plain watershed (SRPW), Sonoma County, CA, USA are experiencing increasing demand for limited water resources. Streamflow in the SRPW is runoff dominated; however, groundwater also is an important resource in the basin. The watershed has an area of 262 mi2 that includes natural, agricultural, and urban land uses. To evaluate the hydrologic system, an integrated hydrologic model was developed using the U.S. Geological Survey coupled groundwater and surface-water flow model, GSFLOW. The model uses a daily time step and a grid-based discretization of the SRPW consisting of 16,741 10-acre cells for 8 model layers to simulate all water budget components of the surface and subsurface hydrologic system. Simulation results indicate significant impacts on streamflow and recharge in response to the below average precipitation during the dry periods. The recharge and streamflow distributions simulated for historic dry periods were compared to future dry periods projected from 4 GCM realizations (two different GCMs and two different CO2 forcing scenarios) for the 21st century, with the dry periods defined as 3 consecutive years of below average precipitation. For many of the projected dry periods, the decreases in recharge and streamflow were greater than for the historic dry periods due to a combination of lower precipitation and increases in simulated evapotranspiration for the warmer 21st century projected by the GCM realizations. The greatest impact on streamflow for both historic and projected future dry periods is the diminished baseflow from late spring to early fall, with an increase in the percentage of intermittent and dry stream reaches. The results indicate that the coupled model is a useful tool for water managers to better understand the potential effects of future dry periods on spatially and temporally distributed streamflow and recharge, as well as other components of the water budget.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is projected to have an impact on precipitation patterns across the Mid-Atlantic with the likelihood of an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events. A greater proportion of total annual precipitation could fall in larger events with the potential to impact flooding, storm water infrastructure, and water supply. The watersheds of the coastal plain of New Jersey draining to the Atlantic and Delaware Bay have mild slopes are underlain by very sandy soils. These areas serve as sources of recharge to the Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer, which is an important water supply for the region. The Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) was used to simulate the potential impacts of climate change on stream flow and groundwater recharge in two watersheds located within the New Jersey coastal plain. The Batsto River watershed includes parts of the Pinelands Reserve with relatively little development in some its headwater areas, primarily small towns and agricultural land use. The Maurice River watershed includes several urbanized areas along with some agricultural land, but population is expecting to increase within the next 10-20 years. The Maurice River basin is outside the Pinelands Reserve but has significant area that contains Pine Barrens. Models were calibrated using observed stream flow from USGS gages and gridded meteorological data from 1995-2002 and validated with observed data from 2002-2005. The calibrated models were forced using an ensemble of three bias-corrected downscaled climate projections (CMIP5, NOAA NCEP, and ECHAM) to assess and compare the potential response of these two watersheds. All meteorological data were obtained online from the GeoData Portal. Preliminary results indicate that climate change is likely to have a greater impact on stream flow in the developed Maurice River basin than in the undeveloped Batsto River basin. More detailed analyses of stream flow and the potential impacts on groundwater recharge are ongoing. These models will serve as the basis of further research that will examine the potential impacts of land-use change and climate change on stream flow, stream temperature, and groundwater recharge.",

In this study, we investigate the improvement in positioning accuracy obtainable when comparing multibeam and sidescan surveys repeated along the same track to within 1/10 of the critical baseline and taken at a slow ship speed of 1 knot. We compare two surveys of the Juan de Fuca Ridge axis fitting these criteria with two coincident surveys of the Cocos Ridge, taken at 11 knots. Both pairs of surveys were collected using a Simrad EM120 sonar system aboard the RV Roger Revelle. We find the multibeam surveys of the Juan de Fuca ridge axis sufficient to measure displacements accurate to better than 2 m, a marked improvement over the 50 m accuracy of the Cocos ridge surveys. Likewise, we can measure displacement accurate to 2 m using the sidescan data from the Juan de Fuca surveys. This accuracy is sufficient to observe meter-level horizontal movements on the deep ocean associated with large earthquakes and landslides.",

The purpose of\nthis project is to predict the radiologic exposure rate of geologic materials by creating a model using published\ngeochemical data, geologic data, GIS software, and freely available remote sensing data sets. If K, U, and Th\nabundance values are known for a given geologic unit, the expected radiation exposure rate can be calculated. One\nof the primary challenges surrounding this project is that alluvial units are classified by age rather than rock type. It\nis therefore important to determine sediment sources and estimate their relative contribution to alluvial units.\nASTER data from the Terra satellite can differentiate between surface mineralogies and can aid us in calculating the\nrelative percentage of sediment from each source and by extension the geochemical concentrations of challenging\nsurfaces such as alluvium. An additional problem is that U and Th do not directly contribute to the measured\nradiation exposure rate. Instead, daughter isotopes of these radioelements emit detectable gamma rays and may not\nhave reached equilibrium in younger surfaces. U can take up to 1.5 Ma to come to equilibrium with its daughter\nisotopes while Th takes only about 40 years. Further modeling with software such as Monte Carlo N-Particle\nTransport from Los Alamos National Laboratory, will help us correct for this disequilibrium in our models.\nOnce the predicted exposure rate is calculated for a geologic unit, it can then be assigned to a geographic area based\non geologic and geomorphic trends. This prediction will be subtracted from data collected through aerial surveys,\neffectively ignoring geology, and allowing areas of interest to be narrowed down considerably. The study areas\ninclude the alluvium on the west shore of Lake Mohave and Government Wash north of Lake Mead. In both of these\nareas, strategically located soil and rock samples have been collected and are awaiting geochemical analysis.\nThis work was done by National Security Technologies, LLC, under Contract No. DE-AC52-06NA25946 with the\nU.S. Department of Energy.\nDOE/NV/25946‐‐2117",

This kind of interannual variability is corresponding to the dominating 7-15 yr quasi-decadal oscillation in precipitation and streamflow in California. When using global climate model projections to assess the climate change impact on water resources planning in California, it is natural to ask if global climate models are able to reproduce the observed interannual variability like 7-15 yr quasi-decadal oscillation.\nFurther spectral analysis to tree ring retrieved precipitation and historical precipitation record proves the existence of 7-15 yr quasi-decadal oscillation in California. But while implementing spectral analysis to all the CMIP5 and CMIP3 global climate model historical simulations using wavelet analysis approach, it was found that only two models in CMIP3 , CGCM 2.3.2a of MRI and NCAP PCM1.0, and only two models in CMIP5, MIROC5 and CESM1-WACCM, have statistically significant 7-15 yr quasi-decadal oscillations in California.\nMore interesting, the existence of 7-15 yr quasi-decadal oscillation in the global climate model simulation is also sensitive to initial conditions. 12-13 yr quasi-decadal oscillation occurs in one ensemble run of CGCM 2.3.2a of MRI but does not exist in the other four ensemble runs.",

Development of a lake model for the purpose of integration within a regional climate model is therefore a subject of scientific interest. Of particular importance are the heat flux predictions provided by the lake model since they function as key forcings in a fully coupled atmosphere-land-lake system. The first step towards a coupled model is to validate and characterize the accuracy of the lake model over a range of conditions and to identify limitations. In this work, validation results from offline tests of the Canadian Small Lake Model; a deterministic, computationally efficient, 1D integral model, are presented. Heat fluxes (sensible and latent) and surface water temperatures simulated by the model are compared with in situ observations from two lakes; Landing Lake (NWT, Canada) and L239 (ELA, Canada) for the 2007-2009 period. Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify key parameters important for heat flux predictions. The results demonstrate the ability of the 1-D lake model to reproduce both diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and surface temperatures for the open water period. These results, in context of regional climate modelling are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Recently, it has been suggested that aqueous-phase processing of atmospheric α-dicarbonyl compounds such as methylglyoxal (MG) could constitute an important source of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The uptake of MG to aqueous particles is higher than expected due to the fact that its carbonyl moieties can hydrate to form diols, as well as the fact that MG can undergo aldol condensation reactions to form larger oligomers in solution. MG is known to be surface active but an improved description of its surface behaviour is crucial to understanding MG-SOA formation, in addition to understanding its gas-to-particle partitioning and cloud forming potential. Here, we employ a combined experimental and theoretical approach involving vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy (VSFS), surface tensiometry, molecular dynamics simulations, and density functional theory calculations to study MG’s surface adsorption, in both the presence and absence of salts. We are particularly interested in determining MG’s hydration state at the surface. Our experimental results indicate that MG slowly adsorbs to the air-water interface and strongly perturbs the water structure there. This perturbation is enhanced in the presence of NaCl. Together our experimental and theoretical results suggest that singly-hydrated MG is the dominant form of MG at the surface.",

            "abstract": "Large distant earthquakes sometimes trigger tectonic earthquakes, tectonic and volcanic tremor, and other geological phenomena. Triggering is widely believed to occur in systems close to failure, and many recent studies have shown that ice sheets can be modulated by subtle stress perturbations from distant earthquakes, though, interaction between tectonic and cryospheric events is difficult to document, in part due to the paucity of polar observations. The exceptional existence of multi-year GPS measurements at the Whillans Ice Plain allows us to determine whether the quasi-regular stick-slip events were expedited by passing seismic waves from distant large earthquakes. We find evidence for triggering that is manifested as events that occur shortly after the arrival of surface waves from 4 significant earthquakes, including the 2010 magnitude 8.8 Maule and 2011 magnitude 9.1 Tohoku-Oki earthquakes. Triggering, in our observed cases, occurs during passage of surface waves with a threshold of ~2 kPa dynamic stress and with sensitivity to the time passed since the previous slip event (recharge time). Investigating triggering may lead to better understanding of frictional failure processes on glacial basal interfaces and on other natural faults in general.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of evaporation fluxes in arid soils is an unresolved complex phenomenon that has a major impact on the basin’s water availability. In arid zones, evaporation controls moisture contents near the soil surface and drives liquid water and water vapor fluxes through the vadose zone, playing a critical role in both the hydrological cycle and energy balance. However, determining soil evaporation in arid zones is a difficult undertaking. Thus, it is important to develop new measuring techniques that can determine evaporation fluxes.\nIn the last decade, distributed temperature sensing (DTS) methods have been successfully used to investigate a wide range of hydrologic applications. In particular, DTS methods have been used indirectly to monitor soil moisture. Two methods have been developed: the passive and the active method. In the active mode, the DTS system uses cables with metal elements and a voltage difference is applied at the two ends to of the cable to heat it up for a defined time-period. Then, the cumulative temperature increase along the cable is computed and soil moisture is determined by using an empirical relation. DTS technology has also been used to determine water fluxes in porous media, but so far no efforts have been made to determine evaporation fluxes.\nHere, we investigate the feasibility of using the active DTS method to determine soil evaporation fluxes. To achieve this objective, column experiments were designed to study evaporation from sandy soils with shallow water tables. The soil columns were instrumented with traditional temperature and time-domain-reflectometry probes, and an armored fiber-optic cable that allows using the active method to estimate the soil moisture profile. In the experiments, the water table can be fixed at different depths and soil evaporation can be estimated by measuring the water added to the constant-head reservoir that feeds the column. Thus, allowing the investigation of soil evaporation fluxes from DTS measurements. The experiments consider different water table levels and meteorological conditions similar to those observed in arid zones with shallow groundwater tables. The experimental data will be used to estimate liquid water and water-vapor fluxes in porous media and to assess if DTS methods are suitable for studying soil evaporation fluxes.",

These\ndata have both high spatial (0.6 arcsec pixels) and temporal (12 s) resolution.\nAll of the observed events occurred in quiet or coronal hole regions near the solar\npole. He II 304 Ang spicules and macrospicules are both transient jet-like\nfeatures, with the macrospicules being wider and having taller maximum heights than\nthe spicules. We looked for characteristics of the populations of these two\nphenomena that might indicate whether they have the same initiation mechanisms. We\nexamine the maximum heights, time-averaged rise velocities, and lifetimes of about\n30 spicules and about five macrospicules. For the spicules, these quantities are,\nrespectively, ~10,000----40,000 km, 20---100 km/s, and a few 100--- ~600 sec. For\nthe macrospicules the corresponding properties are >~60,000 km, >~55 km/s, and\nlifetimes of >~1800 sec. Therefore the macrospicules have velocities comparable to\nthose of the fastest spicules and live longer than the spicules. The leading-edge\ntrajectories of both the spicules and the macrospicules match well a second-order\n(``parabolic'') profile, although the acceleration in the fitted profiles is\ngenerally weaker than that of solar gravity.

            "abstract": "Phenology, the seasonal progression of organisms through stages of dormancy, active growth, and senescence is a key regulator of ecosystem processes and is widely used as an indicator of vegetation responses to climate change. This is especially true in temperate forests, where seasonal dynamics in canopy development and senescence are tightly coupled to the climate system. Despite this, understanding of climate-phenology interactions is incomplete. A key impediment to improving this understanding is that available datasets are geographically sparse, and in most cases include relatively short time series. Remote sensing has been widely promoted as a useful tool for studies of large-scale phenology, but long-term studies from remote sensing have been limited to AVHRR data, which suffers from limitations related to its coarse spatial resolution and uncertainties in atmospheric corrections and radiometric adjustments that are used to create AVHRR time series. In this study, we used 30 years of Landsat data to quantify the nature and magnitude of long-term trends and short-term variability in the timing of spring leaf emergence and fall senescence. Our analysis focuses on temperate forest locations in the Northeastern United States that are co-located with surface meteorological observations, where we have estimated the timing of leaf emergence and leaf senescence at annual time steps using atmospherically corrected surface reflectances from Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery. Comparison of results from Landsat against ground observations demonstrates that phenological events can be reliably estimated from Landsat time series. More importantly, results from this analysis suggest two main conclusions related to the nature of climate change impacts on temperate forest phenology. First, there is clear evidence of trends towards longer growing seasons in the Landsat record. Second, interannual variability is large, with average year-to-year variability exceeding the magnitude of total changes to the growing season that have occurred over the last three decades. Based on these results we suggest that year-to-year variability in phenology, rather than long-term trends, provides the best basis for predicting future changes in temperate forest phenology in response to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Coastal planners are seeking ways to prepare for the potential impacts of future climate change, particularly sea level rise though management of future risks is complicated by uncertainty in the timing, distribution and extent of these impacts. Sea level rise impacts will be most evident at the regional level where decisions related to climate change adaptation including those related to land use planning and habitat management typically occur. To aid coastal managers with decision-making we are integrating remote sensing data with the marsh equilibrium model (MEM3) to project coastal marsh habitat response to future sea level rise. MEM3 is a 1-dimentional, calibrated Excel-based model that incorporates both physical and biological feedbacks to changing relative elevations. Modeled future elevations are then distributed at the regional scale with LiDAR DEMs to project changes to coastal habitats and dependent wildlife. Because plant biomass and structure influence both organic and inorganic accretion, MEM3 includes multiple vegetation input variables. Deriving these variables, including maximum and minimum elevations of marsh vegetation, peak aboveground biomass, and elevation at peak biomass from remote sensing will enable the model to have spatially variable inputs across sites. We are evaluating 30m Landsat 8 and 2m World View-2 (WV2) satellite data for mapping peak biomass at Rush Ranch, a highly diverse brackish marsh in the San Francisco Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. The high spatial resolution of WV2 produces greater variability in plant reflectance at the pixel scale than Landsat 8. Initial results show the need for plant community-specific biomass models with WV2 to account for differences in plant structure and canopy architecture. When removing plots dominated by Salicornia pacifica and Lepidium latifolium, peak biomass is best estimated with an NDVI-type vegetation index based on WV2 near infrared bands 7 and 8 (R2 = 0.21, RMSE = 318 g/m2). Biomass values in the top 95 percentile (greater than 1385 g/m2) are estimated with an average absolute error of 705 g/m2. While error rates may decrease with the addition of more seasonal biomass data, these peak biomass values are within a suitable range of model performance based on a sensitivity analysis of the peak biomass variable in MEM3.",

            "abstract": "The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) observes the interstellar neutral gas flow trajectories at their perihelion in Earth’s orbit every year from December through early April, when the Earth’s orbital motion is into the oncoming flow. These observations have defined a narrow region of possible, but very tightly coupled interstellar neutral flow parameters, with inflow speed, latitude, and temperature as well-defined functions of inflow longitude for the local interstellar cloud (LIC) at the location of the Sun. The temperature of each observed neutral gas species is determined from the angular distribution of the incoming flow, which represents a Mach cone that is related to the locally observed bulk flow speed. With the large collecting power of the IBEX-Lo sensor, the statistical uncertainties of the observed angular distributions are very small (typically a few %). For He and the combination of O and Ne, the observed Mach cones scale inversely with the mass of these species, thus indicating isothermal conditions for them in the LIC. After eliminating all potential sensor related contributions, the main source of uncertainty is attributed to a degeneracy along the aforementioned, coupled parameter region This degeneracy is due to the limited observation range along the Earth orbit each year. Making use of variations in the spin axis pointing of IBEX, the possible range of LIC parameters along the coupled parameter region has been refined. One of the key results is a substantially higher temperature than reported previously based on Ulysses GAS observations. Such local temperature measurements provide an independent and likely the most detailed determination of LIC temperatures, which will then be placed into context with astronomical measurements that represent values averaged over long lines-of-sight.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater is an important component of the water supply, especially during droughts, within the Santa Rosa Plain watershed (SRPW), California, USA. The SRPW is 680 km2 and includes a network of natural and engineered stream channels. Streamflow is strongly seasonal, with high winter flows, predominantly intermittent summer flows, and comparatively rapid response time to larger storms. Groundwater flow is influenced primarily by complex geology, spatial and temporal variation in recharge, and pumping for urban, agricultural, and rural demands. Results from an integrated hydrologic model (GSFLOW) for the SRPW were analyzed to assess the effect of droughts on groundwater resources during water years 1976-2010. Model results indicate that, in general, below-average precipitation during historical drought periods reduced groundwater recharge (focused within stream channels and diffuse outside of channels on alluvial plains), groundwater evapotranspiration (ET), and groundwater discharge to streams (baseflow). In addition, recharge during wet periods was not sufficient to replenish groundwater-storage losses caused by drought and groundwater pumping, resulting in an overall 150 gigaliter loss in groundwater storage for water years 1976-2010. During drought periods, lower groundwater levels from reduced recharge broadly increased the number and length of losing-stream reaches, and seepage losses in streams became a higher percentage of recharge relative to the diffuse recharge outside of stream channels (for example, seepage losses in streams were 36% of recharge in 2006 and 57% at the end of the 2007-09 drought). Reductions in groundwater storage during drought periods resulted in decreased groundwater ET (loss of riparian habitat) and baseflow, especially during the warmer and dryer months (May through September) when groundwater is the dominant component of streamflow.",

Rice (Oryza sativa), the staple crop for the largest number of people on earth, is grown under flooded soil conditions has higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than most crops. This is primarily due to high methane emissions. In this talk I will focus on recent work and reviews on efforts to reduce GHG emissions from rice systems while at the same time maintaining or increasing the productivity of these systems. Specifically, the role of water, straw and nutrient management will be discussed. A great deal of research has gone into evaluating alternate-wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation management. AWD has tremendous potential to reduce GHG emissions; however I will examine how it needs to be practiced to achieve these goals, as well as limitations to its use such as where it can be practiced and possible effects on soil C. Straw management is critical as it provides a key carbon source for methanogens. Straw, however, is difficult to manage and has limited alternative uses. Various forms of nutrient management have also been proposed to reduced GHG emissions in rice systems. I will provide an overview of these and discuss their potential.",

            "abstract": "Current climate models still have large uncertainties in estimating biogenic trace gases, which can significantly affect secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and ultimately aerosol radiative forcing. These uncertainties result from many factors, including coupling strategy between biogenic emissions and land-surface schemes and specification of vegetation types, both of which can affect the simulated near-surface fluxes of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this study, sensitivity experiments are conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-Chem) to examine the sensitivity of simulated VOCs and ozone to land surface processes and vegetation distributions in California. The measurements collected during the California Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Experiment (CalNex) and the Carbonaceous Aerosol and Radiative Effects Study (CARES) conducted during May and June of 2010 provide a good opportunity to evaluate the simulations. First, the biogenic VOC emissions in the WRF-Chem simulations with the two land surface schemes, Noah and CLM4, are estimated by the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version one (MEGANv1), which has been publicly released and widely used with WRF-Chem. The impacts of land surface processes on estimating biogenic VOC emissions and simulating VOCs and ozone are investigated. Second, in this study, a newer version of MEGAN (MEGANv2.1) is coupled with CLM4 as part of WRF-Chem to examine the sensitivity of biogenic VOC emissions to the MEGAN schemes used and determine the importance of using a consistent vegetation map between a land surface scheme and the biogenic VOC emission scheme. Specifically, MEGANv2.1 is embedded into the CLM4 scheme and shares a consistent vegetation map for estimating biogenic VOC emissions. This is unlike MEGANv1 in WRF-Chem that uses a standalone vegetation map that differs from what is used in land surface schemes. Furthermore, we examine the impact of vegetation distribution on simulating VOCs and ozone by comparing coupled WRF-Chem-CLM-MEGANv2.1 simulations using multiple vegetation maps.",

            "abstract": "Changes in future surface temperature variability are of great scientific and societal interest. Since the impact of variability on human society depends on not only the magnitude but also the frequency of variations, shifts in the marginal distribution of temperatures do not provide enough information for impacts assessment. Leeds et al (2014) proposed a method to quantify changes in variability of temperature at distinct temporal frequencies by estimating the ratio of the spectral densities of temperature between pre-industrial and equilibrated future climates. This spectral ratio functions well as a metric to quantify temperature variability shifts in climate model output.\nIn this study, we apply the method of Leeds et al (2014) to explore the temperature variability changes under increased radiative forcing. We compare changes in variability in higher-CO2 climates across two different climate models (CCSM3 from the National Center for Atmospheric Research and GISS-E2-R from NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies), and changes driven by two different forcing agents (CO2 and solar radiation) within the same model (CCSM3). In all cases we use only the equilibrium stages of model runs extended several thousand years after an abrupt forcing change is imposed.\nWe find a number of results. First, changes in temperature variability differ by frequency in most regions, confirming the need for spectral methods. Second, changes are similar regardless of forcing agents. In experiments with abruptly increased CO2 and solar forcing designed to produce the same change in global mean temperature, the distributions and magnitudes of spectral ratio changes are nearly identical. Finally, projections of variability changes differ across models. In CCSM3, temperature variability decreases in most regions and at most frequencies. Conversely, in GISS-E2-R, temperature variability tends to increase over land. The discrepancy between CCSM3 and the GISS-E-R highlights the need for further inter-model comparisons of variability projections. This study provides a potential framework for such comparisons.",

Two fundamental differences between eruptions in seawater compared to those on land are that (1) eruptions occur at higher confining pressures, and (2) in a seawater medium, which has a higher heat capacity, density and viscosity than air.\nTogether with JAMSTEC collaborators we have a sample suite of submarine pumice deposits from modern volcanoes of known eruption depths. This sample suite spans a spectrum of eruption intensities, from 1) powerful explosive caldera-forming (Myojin Knoll caldera); to 2) weakly explosive cone building (pre-caldera Myojin Knoll pumice and Kurose-Nishi pumice); to 3) volatile-driven effusive dome spalling (Sumisu knoll A); to 4) passive dome effusion (Sumisu knoll B and C). This sample suite has exceptional potential, not simply because the samples have been taken from well-constrained, sources but because they have similar high silica contents, are unaltered and their phenocrysts contain melt inclusions.\nMicrotextural quantitative analysis has revealed that (i) clast vesicularities remain high (69-90 vol.%) regardless of confining pressure, mass eruption rate or eruption style , (ii) vesicle number densities scale with inferred eruption rate, and (iii) darcian and inertial permeabilities of submarine effusive and explosive pyroclasts overlap with explosively-erupted subaerial pyroclasts.",

            "abstract": "Researchers have confirmed that the continuing global rising of atmospheric CO2 content is caused by anthropogenic CO2 contributions. Most of those contributions are essentially associated with burning of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum and natural gas). However, deforestation, biomass burning, and land use changes, can also play important roles. Researchers have showed that 14C measurements of annual plants, such as corn leaf (Hsueh et al. 2007), annual grasses (Wang and Pataki 2012), and leaves of deciduous trees (Park et al. 2013) can be used to obtain time-integrated information of the fossil fuel ration in the atmosphere. Those regional-scale fossil fuel maps are essential for monitoring CO2 emissions mitigation efforts and/or growth spikes around the globe. However, no current data from anthropogenic contributions from both biogenic and fossil carbon has been reported from the major urban areas of Brazil. Here we make use of carbon isotopes (13C and 14C) to infer sources of CO2 in the highly populated Brazilian Southeastern region (over 80 million in 2010). This region leads the country in population, urban population, population density, vehicles, industries, and many other utilities and major infrastructures. For a starting point, we focus on collecting Ipê leaves (Tabebuia, a popular deciduous tree) from across Rio de Janeiro city and state as well as Sao Paulo city during May/June of 2014 to obtain the regional distribution of 13C and 14C of those urban domes. So far, Δ14C range from -10 to 32‰, when δ13C values are running from -26 to -35‰.

            "abstract": "Natural hazards and solid Earth events, such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions are actual sources that may trigger acoustic and gravity waves resulting in traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) in the upper atmosphere. Trans-ionospheric radio wave measurements sense the total electron content (TEC) along the signal propagation path. In this research, we introduce a novel GPS-based detection and estimation technique for remote sensing of atmospheric wave-induced TIDs including space weather phenomena induced by major natural hazard events, using TEC time series collected from worldwide ground-based dual-frequency GNSS receiver networks.\nWe will demonstrate the ability of using ground-based dual-frequency GPS measures to detect and monitor tsunami wave propagations from previous great earthquake and tsunami events including: 2011 Tohoku and 2010 Chile earthquakes and tsunamis. Two major TIDs with different propagation speeds and wavelengths were identified through analysis of the GPS remote sensing observations. Dominant physical characteristics of atmospheric wave-induced TIDs are found to be associated with specific tsunami propagations and oceanic Rayleigh waves. We compared GPS-based observations, corresponding model simulations and other geophysical measurements. Our results lead to a better understanding of the tsunami-induced ionosphere responses. In addition, we investigate ionospheric signatures caused by the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake and tsunami using the GPS-based method. Based on current distribution of Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) GPS stations, the simulated results indicate that tsunami-induced TIDs may be detected about 60 minutes prior to tsunamis arriving at the US west coast. It is expected that this GPS-based technology becomes an integral part of future early-warning systems.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover's Chemcam instrument has identified manganese in relatively high abundance on several rock surfaces. The manganese abundances are several orders of magnitude greater than has been previously identified on Mars, indicating the presence of a manganese-rich phase. Although the specific phase has yet to be identified, these results suggest that the martian surface may have been much more highly oxidizing than has previously been recognized. The presence of a manganese-rich phase could provide an additional indicator of habitable aqueous environments. Given the importance of manganese for understanding past habitability, and the high abundances identified with Chemcam, we investigate the utility of using Mastcam multispectral imaging surveys to identify areas for subsequent detailed analysis with Chemcam. Vempati et al. showed that Mn3+ affect the reflectance spectra of Mn-bearing minerals. Specifically, relatively weak features due to electronic transitions and crystal field effects are observed in Mn-enriched hematites and geothites at 454, 554, 596 and 700 nm. The Mastcam-34 medium angle camera has filter band-passes at 550, 675 and 750nm, and we will explore the utility of using these bands (or combinations thereof) to determine if there is a contribution of Mn-bearing phases on spectra, specifically those that have been identified as having elevated Mn with Chemcam. The most common Mn-bearing mineral phase in terrestrial varnishes, Birnessite, has charge-transfer features that are similar to Fe-oxides but are centered at slightly longer wavelength band positions. Longer wavelength features are also common for other Mn-oxides, and this could be used to distinguish these phases from other Fe-oxide components. In this study we will present visible to near-infrared (0.4 – 3 µm) reflectance spectra on a suite of Mn-oxide laboratory standards. The set of standards includes Mn-oxide abundances that vary from less than 1 up to ~75 wt.%. Spectra will be downsampled to Mastcam bandpasses to determine if the effects of Mn-bearing phases could be identified from Mastcam multispectral observations in Gale Crater.",

            "abstract": "Particles in the atmosphere can influence visibility, negatively impact human health, and affect climate. The largest uncertainty in determining global radiative forcing is attributed to atmospheric aerosols. While new particle formation in many locations is correlated with sulfuric acid in air, neither the gas-phase binary nucleation of H2SO4-H2O nor the gas-phase ternary nucleation of H2SO4-NH3-H2O alone can fully explain observations. An additional potential particle source, based on previous studies in this laboratory, is methanesulfonic acid (MSA) with amines and water vapor. However, organics are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, with secondary organic aerosol (SOA) being a major component of particles. Organics could be involved in the initial stages of particle formation by enhancing or inhibiting nucleation from sulfuric acid or MSA, in addition to contributing to their growth to form SOA.\nExperiments to measure the effects of a series of organics of varying structure on particle formation and growth from MSA, amines, and water were performed in a custom-built small volume aerosol flow tube reactor. Analytical instruments and techniques include a scanning mobility particle sizer to measure particle size distributions, sampling onto a weak cation exchange resin with analysis by ion chromatography to measure amine concentrations, and filter collection and analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to measure MSA concentrations. Organics were measured by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The impact of these organics on the initial particle formation as well as growth will be reported. The outcome is an improved understanding of fundamental chemistry of nucleation and growth to ultimately be incorporated into climate models to better predict how particles affect the global climate budget.",

Monazite from six samples contains up to 3 % common Pb, despite high U and Th concentrations. These high common-Pb monazites are characterized by high Sr, weak Eu anomalies, and low Y+HREE. The high common-Pb and Sr abundances and the weak Eu/Eu* are interpreted to reflect the absence of feldspar at (U)HP, and the low Y+HREE content is attributed to fractionation of those elements into garnet.\nSr and common Pb in monazite provide a tool for constraining the timing and duration of (U)HP metamorphism. More generally, Sr in monazite is a potential indicator of feldspar instability and may be applicable in other geologic settings, such as igneous systems in which the abundance of feldspar changes due to melting and crystallization. Sr is expected to be more reliable than Eu and Eu/Eu* as a tracer of feldspar stability, because Sr partitioning is less strongly influenced by oxidation state.",

(2006) run-up model is used to estimate the 2% exceedance values of wave run-up maxima, which are then combined with the observed water levels at the representative tide gauge site to obtain total water levels (TWLs). With this information we assess the relative contribution of geocentric sea level rise, vertical land-movement, and long-term changes in the wave parameters to the observed increase in erosion risk. The latter is approximated using the concept of impact hours per year (IHPY; Ruggiero 2013) at dune toe and dune crest elevation thresholds derived from the lidar data.\nWahl et al. (2014) recently discovered a significant increase in the amplitude of the seasonal sea level cycle in the Gulf of Mexico. Here, we explore the potential of these changes, and similar developments in the seasonal cycle of the wave data and corresponding IHPY, to affect coastal erosion. Such intra-annual signals with longer-term variations have not been included in most earlier studies in favour of analysing the effects of annually averaged long-term trends. Finally, scenarios of potential future changes of all relevant parameters are used to explore their relative contribution to further increase in the coastal erosion risk over the next few decades.",

            "abstract": "Valley networks and outflow channels are among the most arresting features of Mars’ surface. Remarkable similarities between the structure and complexity of individual Martian channels with certain fluvial systems on Earth supports a popular picture of a warm wet early Mars. A key assumption in this picture is that \"typical\" Martian examples adequately capture the average character of the majority of all valley networks. However, a full catalog of the distribution of geomorphologic variability of valley networks over Mars’ surface geometry has never been established. Accordingly, we present the first planet-wide map in which we use statistical methods and theoretical arguments to classify Martian channels in terms of the mechanics governing their formation. Using new metrics for the size, shape and complexity of channel networks, which we ground truth against a large suite of terrestrial examples, we distinguish drainage patterns related to glacial, subglacial, fluvial and lava flows. Preliminary results separate lava flows from other flow features and show that these features can be divided into three different groups of increasing complexity. The characteristics of these groups suggest that they represent fluvial, subglacial and glacial features. We show also that the relative proportions of the different groups varies systematically, with higher density of river-like features located in low longitudes and increasing glacial-like features as we move east or west. Our results suggest that the early Martian climate and hydrologic cycle was richer and more diverse than originally thought.",

            "abstract": "The advent of computational rock physics has brought to light the often ignored question: How applicable are controlled-experiment data acquired at one scale to interpreting measurements obtained at a different scale? An answer is not to use a single data point or even a few data points but rather find a trend that links two or more rock properties to each other in a selected rock type. In the physical laboratory, these trends are generated by measuring a significant number of samples. In contrast, in the computational laboratory, these trends are hidden inside a very small digital sample and can be derived by subsampling it. Often, the internal heterogeneity of measurable properties inside a small sample mimics the large-scale heterogeneity, making the tend applicable in a range of scales. Computational rock physics is uniquely tooled for finding such trends: Although it is virtually impossible to subsample a physical sample and consistently conduct the same laboratory experiments on each of the subsamples, it is straightforward to accomplish this task in the computer.",

            "abstract": "Water isotope ratios (δ18O, δD) in precipitation, surface waters, and seawater comprise a majority of paleo-hydroclimate proxies in the tropical Indo-Pacific. The δD and δ18O of precipitation and water vapor are powerful tracers of atmospheric circulation processes, and can help to illuminate fundamental interactions between ENSO and the atmospheric water cycle. Throughout the tropics, past changes in δD and δ18O are often attributed to ENSO-driven changes in rainfall amount (via the tropical \"amount effect\") and related circulation processes. However, recent studies have revealed that ENSO’s impact on rainfall δD in many Indo-Pacific locations deviates substantially from the classic amount effect, with other fractionation and circulation processes becoming more important (e.g. Conroy et al., 2013). In order to accurately reconstruct past changes in Indo-Pacific hydroclimate using water isotopes, an improved understanding is required of the dynamical and microphysical processes controlling δ18Oprecip and δDprecip, and their relationships with ENSO and other climate phenomena.\nIn this study, we examine the controls on δDprecip and δDvapor in the Indo-Pacific and their relationships to ENSO in ground observations, data from the Troposheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) on NASA’s Aura satellite, and a new simulation with the isotope-equipped Community Atmosphere Model v. 5 (iCAM5). In both the model and in observations, we find that the dominant processes driving monthly to interannual δDvapor anomalies differ substantially across the Indo-Pacific. Prominent differences are evident between the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and the Central/Eastern Pacific (CEP), particularly in the relative importance of precipitation efficiency, detrainment, and rain evaporation on water isotope ratios. The dominant influence of the classic amount effect is spatially variable, with other processes playing important roles especially in the CEP. ENSO’s influence on δDprecip and δDvapor reflects the different controls on fractionation in each region. These findings may challenge the interpretation of some proxy records simply in terms of precipitation amount, while also opening up the possibility for novel reconstructions of other key aspects of atmospheric circulation using water isotopes.",

            "abstract": "Underlying topography controls lava flow emplacement by influencing flow paths, lengths, and advance rates. The morphology of the pre-eruptive surface provides input into lava flow models and the design of artificial diversion barriers, although the dynamics of interactions between topographic obstacles and lava flows are not well known. We investigate these factors by combining morphologic analysis of Hawaiian lava flows with scaling derived from analogue and molten basalt experiments. A comparison of pre- and post-eruptive topographic data shows that flows thicken on the upslope side of topographic barriers, a feature that has been employed to calculate flow velocities from simple energy conversion. Observations also document effects of flow branching and confinement on flow advance rate, with confined flows in Hawai‘i traveling further and faster than those that branch. To explain these observations we perform laboratory experiments using Newtonian and Bingham analogue fluids, as well as molten basalt. Conditions of flow splitting and subsequent advance are defined using experiments with both V-shaped and cylindrical obstacles that divide an unconfined flow. Oblique linear obstacles are used to explore flow confinement and diversion. We find that the degree of thickening, which determines the height of an obstacle capable of holding back the flow, is controlled by both initial flow velocity and obstacle geometry. Key is the ability of the flow to pass around the obstacle, such that larger and wider obstacles cause greater thickening than smaller and narrower obstacles. Flow advance rate is largely unaffected by branching in the Newtonian analogue experiments, but decreases after splitting in the molten basalt experiments because of surface cooling. Interestingly, flows into oblique obstacles are diverted but travel faster. Together these data provide the basis for a theoretical description of the interaction dynamics of viscous (and cooling) lava flows with topographic obstacles. These results allow quantification of the effects of flow branching and diversion on subsequent flow advance, which is essential for both predicting and mitigating the effects of future lava flows.",

            "abstract": "Dissolution processes are well-understood in limestone that has had its primary porosity occluded during burial and cementation (telogenetic limestone). Less is known about dissolution in unburied limestone with high primary permeability (eogenetic limestone). In telogenetic limestone, dissolution occurs where surface streams follow fractures that provide preferential flow paths through an impermeable aquifer matrix. Initial chemical undersaturation of surface water drives dissolution; caves form by enlargement of fractures. In contrast, eogenetic limestone’s high permeability precludes surface streams. Recharge is thought to be diffuse and water-rock interaction in porous vadose zones to result in chemical equilibration of recharge prior to reaching the water table. Despite these limitations on dissolution, phreatic conduits >100 km long occur in eogenetic limestone, suggesting active dissolution in the phreatic zone. Models of dissolution and cave formation in eogenetic limestone emphasize mixing, with mixing of fresh and saline water thought to be the primary dissolution mechanism. Mixing dissolution models consider pCO2 to be homogeneously distributed within mixing waters. If this assumption is correct, mixing offers the only plausible dissolution mechanism. Here we report data from San Salvador Island, Bahamas that demonstrates pCO2 is heterogeneously, rather than homogenously, distributed. The pCO2 in wells varied from < log -2.0 to > log -1.0 atm over distances of less than 30 m. We hypothesize spatial variability in pCO2 results from spatial variability in inputs of DOC to the water table; dissolution is focused to form caves where water flows from regions of low DOC inputs to regions of high DOC inputs. Oxidation of DOC to CO2, enables water to dissolve 2.5 to 10 times more calcite than the maximum amount possible by mixing. Heterogeneous inputs of DOC to aquifers may be the dominant dissolution and cave formation mechanism in eogenetic karst aquifers.",

Relevant applications include nuclear waste repositories, geological sequestration of CO2, geothermal systems, and exploitation of shale gas reservoirs. The paper presents a fully coupled thermo-poro-mechanical (TPM) cohesive interface element (CIE) model, which can represent fluid and heat flow along and across the fracture, and shear/normal deformation of the fracture surfaces. The proposed model is then applied to analyze two popular geological engineering problems using the finite element method (FEM) with a small strain formulation. The first application is the fracturing process in organic-rich shale due to heating. In the finite element analysis, multiple horizontal microcracks parallel to the bedding plane are assumed to preexist in the porous source rock, and are represented by coupled TPM cohesive interface elements. The porous bulk rock is assumed to be homogeneous, isotropic (for the time being, with transverse isotropy a natural extension), and linearly elastic. The excess pore fluid pressure, which mainly causes the development of the fractures, is actually induced by the rapid decomposition of organic matter during heating according to the literature. However, the involved complex chemical reaction process is beyond the scope of the paper, and is therefore substituted by a fluid injection process within the cracks under room temperature (25C) and high temperature (400C) in the paper. We investigate the fracture propagation due to pore fluid pressure increase and the development of fracture-induced permeability. The second application is a nuclear waste repository in a partially saturated fractured rock. Multiphase transport of moisture and heat, thermally-induced stress, as well as the change of fracture apertures are investigated due to short-and long-term high temperature effects.",

Histogram plots of δDH2O values estimated from minerals reveal peaks at δD = –60‰ (deep fluid) and ­–110‰ (Early Cenozoic meteoric-hydrothermal fluid); this provides a clear distinction between the two kinds of fluid. Our analysis reveals that syn-extensional meteoric-hydrothermal systems (δDH2O < –80‰) affected the eastern margin of the Coast Ranges Batholith between latitude 49° and 55° and the Omineca Belt between latitude 49° and 52°45’; both regions were affected by detachment faulting during late stages of magmatism in the Early Cenozoic (e.g., Parrish et al., 1988; Crawford et al., 2009). Zones that escaped the effects of meteoric-hydrothermal systems, preserving the D/H signature of deep fluids (δD > –80‰), include the Western Metamorphic Belt, the Western and Central Coast Ranges Batholith, the belt of Jurassic metamorphism that extends from the Cariboo Mountains to the Purcell Mountains, and the deepest structural levels of the Shuswap Metamorphic Core Complex; most of these samples have quartz-feldspar 18O/16O fractionations indicative of magmatic temperatures. High δDH2O values (> –50‰) suggest seawater alteration of the plutons of Vancouver Island (Magaritz and Taylor, 1986). Histogram plots of vein quartz fluid inclusion δD values (Nesbitt and Muehlenbachs, 1995) reveal three peaks that include the two produced by the mineral δD values, but these data are dominated by a large peak at δD = –150, a value similar to modern meteoric waters in the region; this suggests either a young age for these veins or recent resetting of fluid inclusion δD values. This sensitivity to D/H exchange calls into question the reliability of fluid δD values derived from fluid inclusions. These meteoric-hydrothermal systems of the Canadian Cordillera may have been the largest on Earth.",

            "abstract": "Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes may be moderated by physical and biological processes, particularly when soils freeze and then thaw. There is a need to understand how physical processes affect above- canopy fluxes of N2O. There is also a need to understand the magnitude and duration of N2O emission peaks for agricultural fields, particularly the nitrogen-fixing legumes, which can produce and consume N2O in the plant root symbiosome. There are multiple potential sources of N2O, including bacteria and fungi in soil and in root symbiosomes. Further, N2O can be released when trapped in ice or dissolved in solution. These physical and biological processes can contribute to N2O fluxes measured above the canopy. In 2012-2013, we evaluated canopy, surface and belowground N2O data for a field seeded to lucerne (Medicago sativa). We used high-frequency data to determine above-canopy N2O fluxes using an Aerodyne Quantum Cascade Laser integrated with an eddy covariance system, and compared these with low-frequency flux and concentration data collected at the surface and belowground. Belowground moisture, temperature and soil data were used to partition measured N2O and CH4 into gaseous and dissolved phases. Pre and post-freeze data indicated the proportion of post-freeze flux previously trapped in ice. Nitrous oxide fluxes following a thaw event were compared with the amount of N2O trapped during freezing to determine the proportion of the flux resulting from previously trapped gases versus de novo N2O production.",

            "abstract": "Flight operation results and plans of Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) to measure suprathermal particles (a ~few keV up to ~100s of keV) are summarized in this presentation.\nIons and electrons in this energy range play crucial roles in many fundamental processes of space plasmas including particle heating and acceleration, providing source material for the energetic particles accelerated near the Sun, the heliosphere, and in geospace. Characterizing these populations poses serious technical challenges because this energy region lies between the two most commonly used particle detection techniques, i.e., that used by thermal or plasma instruments and by Solid-State Detector (SSD)–based energetic particle telescopes, which are limited by typical SSD threshold energies of >10s keV. Our previous work has already demonstrated that a new type of low-noise, low-threshold Avalanche Photo-Diode (APD) has an intrinsic noise level of 0.9 keV, and can therefore enable high-energy resolution measurements of suprathermal electrons and ions. In addition, APDs provide suitable solutions for space plasma detectors in low-cost missions/platform because of their light-weight, small-size, power-saving features.\nThis study presents two low-cost missions (a sounding rocket and a CubeSat) that implement APDs as particle detectors: (1) The Medium-energy Electron SPectrometer (MESP) sensor aboard a sounding rocket was launched from Poker Flat Research Range on 3 March 2014 as a part of Ground-to-Rocket Electrodynamics-Electrons Correlative Experiment (GREECE) mission. MESP successfully measured the precipitating electrons from 2 to 200 keV in 100-ms time resolution by using 2 APDs and 1 SSD. We show the overall results and the comparison with an MCP-based instrument results. (2) The Miniaturized Electron and pRoton Telescope (MERiT) on the Compact Radiation bElt Explorer (CeREs) to study charged particle dynamics in the Earth’s radiation belts. CeREs will be flown as part of a 3U CubeSat in a high-inclination low-Earth orbit in 2015. MERiT is designed to measure suprathermal to relativistic electrons from ~5 keV up to10 MeV, and 4 APDs will be applied to cover the lower portion of the energy range. Along with the calibration efforts, we will present predicted in-orbit performances of these APD detectors in the CeREs mission.",

            "abstract": "Ongoing climatic change is expected to affect terrestrial carbon budget by altering growing period and photosynthetic and respiratory processes. Indeed, a recent atmospheric study (Graven et al. 2013) shows that seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO2 concentration has bee increased since 1960. Because of the lack of long-term observational data except phenology, it is difficult to confirm such enhancement of vegetation activity through a direct approach. Therefore, we examined the simulated terrestrial CO2 exchange by a process-based model (VISIT) from 1901 to 2010, using the MsTMIP protocol. Several metrics were used to characterize the seasonal amplitude: maximum photosynthetic uptake and respiratory release and cumulative net biome production (NBP). To separate the effects of climatic change and elevated atmospheric increase, two simulation results (climate, climate+CO2) were compared. The results showed that the seasonal amplitude defined as the maximum?minimum cumulative NBP in the Northern Hemisphere increased by 16% from the 1960s to the 2000s. Such increase in seasonal amplitude was more evident in North America and Europe, compared with Siberia and Asia. In the climate-only simulation, northern seasonal amplitude decreased from 1965 to 1980, a climatic cooling period, and then increased since then. These results indicate that the observed increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration amplitude is largely attributable to enhanced terrestrial vegetation activity. We would compare these results with those by other terrestrial ecosystem models and possibly with some observational record.",

To do this, total field aeromagnetic data from the Mexican Geological Survey were processed. Reduction to pole and residual anomaly maps show two main elongated dipolar high-amplitude anomalies, a first NE-SW directed, which is located in the NW portion of the card, and a second corresponding to a belt with NW-SE direction that is located SW of the chart, near the eastern region of the \"El Elegante\" volcano. Above structures have not been mapped in the surface; however, the well-defined magnetic anomalies indicate its existence below Quaternary sediments.\nThe geology of the chart is only partially known. The outcropping units, mostly in the Sierra de Los Tanques, are Paleoproterozoic igneous and metamorphic rocks; Permian-Triassic granitoids; and Jurassic and Tertiary volcanic and volcanosedimentary rocks. About 50% of the card is covered by Quaternary sediments, there the interest of these geophysical studies.\nThe NW-SE oriented deep magnetic anomaly follows the same direction as the Sierra San Francisco (SSF) located south of Los Norteños chart H12A-2. This mountain is composed of Paleoproterozoic metamorphic rocks intruded by Upper Cretaceous granitoids. Numerous mineral manifestations of orogenic gold type occurred in that range. This anomaly can be interpreted in 2 ways: first: as a NW extension of a landform similar to the SSF, which dips to NW or that is more erosionated; or; second: as an extension of the SSF to the NW displaced by a normal fault oriented ~N60E, roughly following the Palo Fierro creek indicated on the map.\nEither of the two possible interpretations, the magnetic anomaly indicates an interesting target in the search of orogenic gold deposits that could be buried in the area.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the spatially-resolved composition of atmospheric particles is essential for differentiating between their surface versus bulk chemistry, understanding particle reactivity and the potential environmental impact. We demonstrate the application of nanometer-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (Cameca NanoSIMS 50 ion probe) for 3D chemical imaging of individual atmospheric particles without any sample pre-treatment, such as the sectioning of particles. Use of NanoSIMS depth profile analysis enables elemental mapping of particles with nanometer spatial resolution over a broad of range of particle sizes. We have used this technique to probe spatially resolved composition of ambient particles collected during a field campaign in Mexico City. Particles collected during this campaign have been extensively characterized in the past using other particle analysis techniques and hence offer a unique opportunity for exploring the utility of depth resolved chemical imaging in ambient particle research. Particles examined in this study include those collected during a pollution episode related to urban waste incineration as well as background particles from the same location prior to the episode. Particles from the pollution episode show substantial intra-particle compositional variability typical of particles resulting from multiple emission sources. In contrast, the background particles have relatively homogeneous compositions with enhanced presence of nitrogen, oxygen and chlorine at the particle surface. The observed surface enhancement of nitrogen and oxygen species is consistent with the presence of surface nitrates resulting from gas-particle heterogeneous interactions and is indicative of atmospheric ageing of the particles. The results presented here illustrate 3D characterization of ambient particles for insights into their chemical history.",

These locations of recurrent flux emergence in or close to a pre-existing active region, last for typically five to seven solar rotations. It is known that emergence of new magnetic flux in pre-existing magnetic region causes an increase in topological complexity of the magnetic field which leads to flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). A quantitative measure of topological complexity of magnetic fields is given by the magnetic helicity which measures twisting and linking of the magnetic field. The current helicity determined from vector magnetograms is the equivalent of the kinetic helicity determined from subsurface flows. The helicity is thus an ideal quantity to investigate the linkage of magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere with flows in the upper solar convection zone. The subsurface flows from the surface to a depth of 16 Mm are determined with a ring-diagram analysis of GONG and SDO/HMI Dopplergrams and the current helicity density is determined from SOLIS vector magnetograms. We will study the kinetic and current helicity as a function of time and Carrington longitude, averaged over a suitable range of latitudes in either hemisphere. We will present the latest results.",

Rigorous uncertainties in ACA event occurrences and climatological observations have not yet been established, however. Using collocated Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aerosol products, Moderate Resolution and Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products, and simultaneous cloud and aerosol observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), we compare and contrast passive versus active methodologies, respectively, for resolving ACA. An inter-comparison of spatial ACA distributions and global ACA trends derived from both methods is described. Regional ACA trends are derived, along with their statistical significance, for nine regions found susceptible to ACA. We find that the use of both techniques is necessary, as each exhibits strengths and weaknesses. For example, the passive-based method is only capable of detecting UV absorbing aerosols However, whereas CALIOP can profile and segregate aerosol and cloud, OMI’s wide swath provides a significant gain in observational volume due to CALIOP’s inability to scan off nadir.",

            "abstract": "Integrated Water Resources Management is an interdisciplinary approach to managing water. Integration often involves linking hydrologic processes with socio-economic development. When implemented through a simulation or optimization model, complexities arise. This complexity is due to the large data requirements, making it difficult to implement by the end users. Not only is computational efficiency at stake, but it becomes cumbersome to future model users. To overcome this issue the model may be simplified through emulation, at the expense of information loss. Herein lies a tradeoff: Complexity involved in an accurate, detailed model versus the transparency and saliency of a simplified model. This presentation examines the role of model emulation towards simplifying a water allocation model. The case study is located in Southern Alberta, Canada. Water here is allocated between agricultural, municipal, environmental and energy sectors. Currently, water allocation is modeled through a detailed optimization model, WRMM. Although WRMM can allocate water on a priority basis, it lacks the simplicity needed by the end user. The proposed System Dynamics-based model, SWAMP 2.0, emulates this optimization model, utilizing two scales of complexity. A regional scale spatially aggregates individual components, reducing the complexity of the original model. A local scale retains the original detail, and is contained within the regional scale. This two tiered emulation presents relevant spatial scales to water managers, who may not be interested in all the details of WRMM. By evaluating the accuracy of SWAMP 2.0 against the original allocation model, the tradeoff of accuracy for simplicity can be further realized.",

Previous work [Rollins et al, in prep.] revealed that GPS timeseries of surface displacement following the earthquake were well fit to a coupled model simulating stress-driven afterslip on the deep extension of the coseismic rupture, Newtonian viscoelastic relaxation in a low-viscosity zone in the lower crust of the Salton Trough aligned with areas of high heat flow, and Newtonian viscoelastic relaxation in a three-dimensional asthenosphere with geometry matching that of the regional lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary inferred from receiver functions. Extending the success of this model to a robust interpretation of the mechanics of deformation at depth requires a better understanding of uncertainties and trade-offs between parameters (depth of the brittle-ductile transition, viscosities of the lower crust and asthenosphere, geometry of viscosity anomalies in the Salton Trough, frictional parameters of the possible downdip extensions of the coseismic rupture, and correlations among these parameters). We will show results from recent work that uses a newly developed method to efficiently explore this model space in a Bayesian sense. The method employs the Neighborhood Algorithm of Sambridge [1999], which makes use of Voronoi cells to optimize the search in the model space, samples regions that contains models of acceptable data fit, and extracts robust information from the ensemble of models obtained. The method is particularly well suited to identify a class of models that fit geodetic data approximately equally well, allowing us to present and discuss a range of possible deformation mechanisms. This method can be applied to any study of postseismic deformation and represents a significant step towards directly inferring best-fit rheological parameters from geodetic data in a way that considers many deformation mechanisms simultaneously.",

            "abstract": "Local acceleration via whistler wave and particle interaction plays an important role in particle dynamics in the radiation belt. In this work we explore wave-particle interaction in different magnetic field configurations related to the 17 March, 2013 storm. We consider the Earth's magnetic dipole field as a reference, and compare the results against non-dipole field configurations corresponding to quiet and stormy conditions. The latter are obtained with RAM-SCB, a code that models the Earth's ring current and provides a realistic modeling of the Earth's magnetic field. By applying quasi-linear theory, the bounce-averaged electron pitch angle, energy and mixed term diffusion coefficients are calculated for each magnetic field configuration. It is shown that the magnetic field can have a significant influence on the diffusion coefficients via the wave-particle resonance condition. In addition, the equatorial pitch angle, wave frequency and spectral distribution of whistler waves also affect the bounce-averaged diffusion coefficients in particle energy range from KeV to MeV. Part of the ongoing work will focus on the phase space density evolution based on the Fokker-Planck equation with the bounce-averaged diffusion coefficients previously calculated.",

            "abstract": "High latitude ecosystems have served as net sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) in a Holocene time perspective. However, the ongoing warming makes it questionable if high latitude landscapes still function as net C sinks. In this study we used multiyear high resolution C flux data to estimate an integrated terrestrial-aquatic C balance of a sub-arctic catchment. The results indicate large inter annual variability in C fluxes and suggest that the C sink function of this landscape is weak, especially when also accounting for the often neglected C losses from aquatic systems. In fact, our results suggest that it is more likely that the studied catchment serves as a net source of C rather than a net sink. Our results highlight the importance of inland waters in the C cycle and that the strength of the C sequestering in the contemporary sub-arctic environment is much weaker than often assumed.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this study is to characterize the registered rainfall originated from the simultaneous incidence of two tropical cyclones in Mexico, during September 2013. Tropical Storm Manuel in the Pacific and Hurricane Ingrid (category 1) in the Gulf of Mexico, made landfall during a 24 hours period on September 15 and 18, 2013. Both systems, affected 77% of Mexican territory with heavy rainfall producing landslides and severe flooding. The unprecedented occurrence of two simultaneous tropical cyclones, along with the large damages registered in the country; make evident the need for a careful examination of the rainfall produced by their simultaneous incidence. For this, we utilize information from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), in combination with data from the rain gauge observations (from 1st to 16th September 2013). The selected remotely sensed products correspond to the TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), 3B42RT and 3B42V7. Additionally, we estimate the performance of the TRMM products through well-known error metrics derived from the comparison of both, registered rainfall by rain gauges and that determined from 607 TMPA cells (0.25° x 0.25° containing at least one rain gauge). Results show that rainfall produced by the incidence of both storms, is similar to that registered as if the events occurred separately, accounting for about 10% of the annual precipitation total of 2013. Moreover, spatially averaged results indicate that the product 3B42V7 is a good estimate of daily precipitation across the country, while the TMPA 3B42RT product underestimates the amount of rainfall due to cyclonic events. Therefore, TMPA products provide acceptable estimates of rainfall for large-scale cyclonic events.",

            "abstract": "A primary objective of IODP Expedition 351 was to evaluate arc initiation processes of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) volcanic arc and its compositional evolution through time. To this end, a single thick section of sediment overlying oceanic crust was cored in the Amami Sankaku Basin where a complete sediment record of arc inception and evolution is preserved. This sediment record includes ash and pyroclasts, deposited in fore-arc, arc, and back-arc settings, likely associated with both the ~49-25 Ma emergent IBM volcanic arc and the evolving Ryukyu-Kyushu volcanic arc. Our goal was to assess the major element evolution of the nascent and evolving IBM system using the temporally constrained record of the early and developing system. In all, more than 100 ash and tuff layers, and pyroclastic fragments were selected from temporally resolved portions of the core, and from representative fractions of the overall core (“core catcher”). The samples were prepared to determine major and minor element compositions via electron microprobe analyses. This ash and pyroclast record will allow us to 1) resolve the Paleogene evolutionary history of the northern IBM arc in greater detail; 2) determine compositional variations of this portion of the IBM arc through time; 3) compare the acquired data to an extensive whole rock and tephra dataset from other segments of the IBM arc; 4) test hypotheses of northern IBM arc evolution and the involvement of different source reservoirs; and 5) mark important stratigraphic markers associated with the Neogene volcanic history of the adjacent evolving Ryukyu-Kyushu arc.",

            "abstract": "Contamination of groundwater aquifers from nonpoint sources is a worldwide problem. Typical agricultural groundwater basins receive contamination from a large array (in the order of ~10^5-6) of spatially and temporally heterogeneous sources such as fields, crops, dairies etc, while the received contaminants emerge at significantly uncertain time lags to a large array of discharge surfaces such as public supply, domestic and irrigation wells and streams. To support decision making in such complex regimes several approaches have been developed, which can be grouped into 3 categories: i) Index methods, ii)regression methods and iii) physically based methods. Among the three, physically based methods are considered more accurate, but at the cost of computational demand. In this work we present a physically based simulation framework which exploits the latest hardware and software developments to simulate large (>>1,000 km2) groundwater basins. First we simulate groundwater flow using a sufficiently detailed mesh to capture the spatial heterogeneity. To achieve optimal mesh quality we combine adaptive mesh refinement with the nonlinear solution for unconfined flow. Starting from a coarse grid the mesh is refined iteratively in the parts of the domain where the flow heterogeneity appears higher resulting in optimal grid. Secondly we simulate the nonpoint source pollution based on the detailed velocity field computed from the previous step. In our approach we use the streamline model where the 3D transport problem is decomposed into multiple 1D transport problems. The proposed framework is applied to simulate nonpoint source pollution in the Central Valley aquifer system, California.",

            "abstract": "Non-volcanic tremor is generally interpreted as the seismic manifestation of slow slip, and tremor locations have been used extensively to infer detailed behaviours of slow slip fronts due to higher spatial and temporal resolution over geodetic observations. Taking advantage of S-wave coherence among stations separated by 10-20 km, Armbruster et al. [2014] and Rubin and Armbruster [2013] obtained high precision tremor locations using “cross-station” cross correlations. However, in principle “cross-station” methods do not perform well when the response to an impulsive tremor source has coda with amplitude comparable to the main arrival. Based on the catalogs of LFE families in northern Washington from Royer and Bostock [2013], we stacked seismograms to obtain LFE templates for stations from the Array of Arrays (AofA) and observed large-amplitude coda in the waveforms. In this study, we attempt to eliminate non-coherent coda and noise by stacking seismograms at stations within individual arrays based on empirical time offsets determined from the templates. We compare 4-s windows of those stacks at 3 arrays, instead of seismograms at 3 single stations, after correcting for shear wave splitting, and rotating into the empirical shear wave polarization directions [Peng et al., AGU 2013]. Only detections within 8 km of the corresponding template are included such that there is little penalty associated with fixing array time offsets, splitting parameters and station rotations within each array. For each template, the 3-array detector obtains 3-10 times more LFE events than a conventional 3-station detector. We find numerous rapid tremor migrations propagating along the main front, one of which continue to propagate back into regions that have already ruptured. These observations are consistent with tremor migration patterns beneath southern Vancouver Island [Peng et al., AGU 2013]. We also observe several unusually fast back-propagating fronts originating from the main front, with propagation speeds of 700-1000 km/day.",

            "abstract": "Field data and microscopic analysis are combined with numerical simulation to investigate the mechanism of wiggly compaction band formation in the high-porosity aeolian Aztec sandstone, Valley of Fire, Nevada. Field data show that the segments of wiggly compaction bands have similar orientations to preexisting shear-enhanced compaction bands, H1 and H2. The wiggly bands are inferred to propagate and periodically switch orientations between H1 and H2. The direction of greatest compression (σ3) is interpreted as perpendicular to the overall strike of wiggly compaction bands, and the band segments that are perpendicular to σ3 are pure compaction bands. Analysis of micropores shows that pure compaction bands have the greatest porosity, and may have a different failure mechanism.\nIn discrete element modelling, a particle is used to represent a pore structure surrounded by several grains. Similar to actual pore structure, the breakable particle is compacted when the resultant force acting on the particle exceeds the yielding cap determined by the failure force (Ff) and aspect ratio of the cap ellipse (k). The discrete element model, built up of many breakable particles, is compressed to simulate the formation of compaction bands. The direction of propagation of compacted zones is determined by the cap aspect ratio (k). When k=0.5, compacted zones tend to propagate perpendicular to σ3, which corresponds to pure compaction bands. When k=2, two 45-degree directions are the predominant directions of compacted zones. The local stress state around a band tip is changed when it propagates, and the segment switches to the other direction when it reaches a critical length. As a result the wiggly compaction band takes on a wiggly pattern.",

            "abstract": "Seismic velocities in the lavas that cap normal oceanic crust are affected by both crack porosity and alteration of the primary mineral phases, chiefly to clays. Porosity accounts for 75-80% of the velocity variation in sonic log velocities in the lava sections of Holes 504B and 1256D, but the effect of alteration on the properties of the basalts has not been assessed. In this analysis, the grain velocities in basalt and diabase samples have been estimated from an empirical linear relationship between grain density and the P-wave modulus. The estimated velocity in fresh, zero-porosity basalt is 6.96±0.07 km/sec. In basalts, alteration reduces the average grain velocity to 6.74±0.02 km/sec; cracks at the sample scale further reduce the velocity to 5.86±0.03 km/sec, and large-scale cracks in the lava pile reduce the average in situ velocity to 5.2±0.3 km/sec. Cracks thus account for nearly 90% of the difference between seismic (in situ) velocities and the intrinsic velocity in the unaltered solid material. Alteration also accounts for a small, but statistically significant increase of velocity with depth in the lavas. Grain velocities in the diabase samples are statistically indistinguishable from the intrinsic velocity, and show no variation with depth; alteration does not significantly affect the velocities in the diabase samples from Hole 504B. This result is consistent with previous analyses, which have demonstrated that velocities in the dikes are controlled by crack porosity. Except in the uppermost part, velocities in diabase samples measured at 20 MPa match sonic log velocities, indicating that velocities in the dike section are controlled by cracks at the scale of lab samples, as opposed to large-scale cracks in the formation.",

Using reverse two-station and two-station methods we obtained frequency dependent Lg attenuation models for a frequency range between 0.5 Hz to 5 Hz with a resolution of about 2°. We solved for the geometric spreading term by fitting the amplitude to the two-station distance ratios and the absolute distances. The best fit yields a spreading coefficient of 0.36 instead of the traditional cylindrical spreading term of 0.50. Lg Q values in NE China and the Korean Peninsula vary from 50 to 1600. Q values increase rapidly in the Songliao Basin (SNB) for higher frequencies (≥ 2Hz), while they stay relatively constant in the Great Xing’an Range (GXR). Low attenuation regions are found in the Great Xing’an, Lesser Xing’an (LXR) and Songen-Zhangguangcai Ranges (SZR). Overall, attenuation is high in the Songliao, Sanjiang (SNB), Bohai (BHB), Erlian (EB) and Hailar (HB) basins. The highest attenuation is found in the vicinity of Wudalicanchi (WVF), Changbaishan (CBV), and Quaternary volcanic regions, the southern Songliao Basin, west of Erlian Basin, Bohai Basin and the Sanjiang Basin. In general regions with low attenuation (Q > 800) have a low heat flow value (<70 mW/m2) and very thin (< 1 km) or no sediments.",

The resulting 3D model therefore cannot explicitly account for strong lateral variations in features such as the mid-lithospheric boundary or the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, when it is sharp, so that trade-offs between smooth volumetric heterogeneity and the topography of such boundaries cannot be resolved.\nWe present the first results of a time domain waveform tomography of the north American (NA) continent obtained using the spectral element method (SEM) for wavefield computations and a 3D starting model that contains upper mantle discontinuities determined in a prior step from receiver function analysis. The model is constructed using a procedure that consists of 5 steps:\n1) We apply k-means cluster analysis to a recent global tomographic model to regionalize NA into three main provinces (Oceanic, transitional, continental).\n2) We calculate 1D Vs and radial anisotropy (Xi) profiles at 26 stations deployed in the NA continent using a trans-dimensional Markov-chain algorithm. Here, we jointly invert three datasets; (i) Rayleigh and Love phase velocity dispersion, (ii) Rayleigh and Love group velocity dispersion, (iii) Averaged seismograms for calculating receiver functions using the cross-convolution method (Bodin et al., 2014).\n3) A 1D model is obtained for Vs and Xi in each of the 3 provinces by averaging the models obtained in 2) for that province and these layered 1D models are connected laterally using smoothing operators based on inter-station distance to generate a layered 3D starting model.\n4) We calculate smooth equivalent models of Vs and Xi using the homogenization procedure of Capdeville et al. (2013)\n5) We perform a SEM based waveform tomographic inversion of our regional distance database obtaining smooth 3D velocity perturbations which are then added to the layered 3D starting model.\nAfter several iterations, the model obtained includes lateral variations in the depth of significant boundaries, constrained by high frequency data, as well as lateral volumetric velocity variations, constrained by the longer period waveforms.",

The global satellite data provide an unprecedented picture of such waves, potentially yielding much information about the ocean interior. Accurate knowledge of these waves is also needed for de-tiding altimetry in certain sensitive applications, including the future SWOT mission. Several approaches have been initiated recently to map these tiny waves, usually with some reliance on hydrographic information (e.g., recent work by Dushaw et al., 2011). Here we explore the feasibility of a purely empirical approach which avoids assumptions about stratification or modal wavelengths. A global elevation map is constructed based on tidal analysis of Topex/Poseidon, Jason, ERS-2, Envisat and GFO data. Small (order 5 mm) residuals, with wavelengths much longer than the baroclinic tide, appear unless now-standard along-track high-pass filters are applied, but filtering is shown to cause serious loss of information for east-west propagating waves (given typical track patterns). The technique is probably infeasible for S2 because of Envisat's and ERS's sun-synchronous orbits. Independent data from Cryosat-2 is used to validate the results. Applying our internal-tide 'correction' to Cryosat-2 data confirms a small reduction in variance in expected locations of significant internal tides.",

            "abstract": "Soil-water evaporation is one of the governing processes responsible for controlling water and energy exchanges between the land and atmosphere. Despite its wide relevance and application in many natural and manmade environments (e.g. soil tillage practices, wheel-track compaction, fire burn environments, textural layering and buried ordinances), there are very few studies of evaporation from disturbed soil profiles. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of soil disturbance and capillary coupling on water distribution and fluxes. We modified a theory previously developed by the authors that allows for coupling single-phase (gas), two-component (air and water vapor) transfer in the atmosphere and two-phase (gas, liquid), two-component (air and water vapor) flow in porous media at the REV scale under non-isothermal, non-equilibrium conditions to better account for the hydraulic and thermal interactions within the media. Modeling results were validated and compared using precision data generated in a two-dimensional soil tank consisting of a loosely packed soil surrounded by a tightly packed soil. The soil tank was outfitted with an array of sensors for the measurement of wind velocity, soil and air temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and weight. Results demonstrated that, by using this coupling approach, it is possible to predict the different stages of the drying process in heterogeneous soils with good accuracy. Evaporation from a heterogeneous soil consisting of a loose and tight packing condition is larger than the homogeneous equivalent systems. Liquid water is supplied from the loosely packed soil region to the tightly packed soil regions, sustaining a longer Stage I evaporation in the tightly packed regions with overall greater evaporation rate than uniform homogeneous packing. In contrast, lower evaporation rates from the loosely packed regions are observed due to a limited liquid water supply resulting from capillary flow to the tightly packed regions and a shorter stage 1 evaporation period.",

However, a remaining problem is computational cost, which leads seismologists to only interpret the long periods in seismic waveforms, and hence to only constrain long wavelength structure. In this way, tomographic images do not represent the true Earth, but rather an effective, apparent or equivalent model that provides a similar long wavelength data fit.\nIn this study, we focus on the problem of artificial radial anisotropy in the upper mantle due to unmapped small scale vertical heterogeneities (e.g. layering). We propose a fully probabilistic approach to sample the ensemble of layered models equivalent to a given smooth tomographic profile. We objectively quantify the trade-off between isotropic heterogeneity and strength of anisotropy. The non-uniqueness of the problem can be addressed by adding high frequency observations such as receiver functions, able to map first order discontinuities. We show that this method enables us to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic (i.e. artificial) anisotropy in 1D models extracted from tomographic results.",

            "abstract": "Heavy flooding associated with the September 2013 storm caused severe disturbance along many rivers draining the Colorado Front Range. In Rocky Mountain National Park, the 2013 flood destabilized steep segments of Roaring River and deposited an unusually large amount of sand- and gravel-sized sediment near the confluence with Fall River. We initiated field studies of these two river systems in May 2014 to investigate the effect of an increase in sediment supply on the geomorphology of Fall River. Measurements of water discharge and bed load were taken from May through August at three different locations to capture spatial and temporal variations in transport rates for a range of flows. Peak transport rates coincided with the peak discharge at the upstream sampling site (FR-1), but lagged behind the peak in discharge at the lower site (FR-2) by about three weeks, which is consistent with diffusive movement of sediment as observed in earlier studies. On average, 2014 transport rates were 0.022 kg/m/s and 0.035 kg/m/s at FR-1 and FR-2, respectively; these rates are 59 and 82 percent lower than rates measured previously at the same locations, but still high in comparison to other streams in the region. Erosion and deposition were also tracked by comparing temporal differences in surveyed river cross sections every ~100m along Fall River. The results of these surveys indicate 1550 m3 of erosion throughout a majority of the upstream portion of Fall River in a 50-day span. Calculations of shear stress from velocity measurements at FR1 and FR2 ranged from less than one to 1.3 times the threshold for motion, with the bed load consisting of mostly sand. The surface median grain size decreases exponentially downstream from 43 to 21mm, while remaining nearly constant for bed load from 1.3 to 0.9mm, consistent with partial transport. The rapid fining and transition to a mostly sand bed reflects the large increase in sediment supply unique to Fall River’s 2014 conditions.",

            "abstract": "We developed and demonstrate use of data tools for identification of sites where managed aquifer recharge (MAR) might be accomplished through capture of stormwater runoff. This study was completed in the Pajaro Valley, central costal California, which relies heavily on groundwater to meet agricultural, municipal, and domestic demand. An earlier study evaluated regional suitability for MAR in the Pajaro Valley based on surface and subsurface conditions, but did not explore the availability of water sources. In the present study, we combine a digital elevation model of basin topography, soil type, land use information, and historical precipitation records to assess where in the Pajaro Valley there may be enough runoff generated by storms to justify establishment of local MAR projects on this basis.\nAttribute screening was used to position 600 hypothetical capture-recharge sites in the study region: 200 one-acre infiltration basins with 50–100-acre drainage areas, 200 two-acre infiltration basins with 100–200-acre drainage areas, and 200 three-acre infiltration basins with 200–300-acre drainage areas. Precipitation scenarios were applied for a period of 20 years, simulating the influence of the number of storms, storm duration, and storm intensity in each year. Results suggest that the large majority of drainage areas 50–100 acres in size would not produce adequate runoff to meet a project goal of ≥100 ac-ft/year/field site. Evaluation of long term (20 year) potentials for 100–200 acre drainage areas show that approximately 10% of hypothetical MAR projects have the potential to produce 100+ ac-ft/year of recharge under normal (median historical) precipitation conditions. Approximately 50% of hypothetical 200–300 acre drainage areas have the potential to meet this goal given the same conditions. This approach advances traditional methods of recharge mapping by incorporating precipitation and runoff analyses for specific sites, and has the potential to aid in the establishment of a distributed system of MAR projects to improve groundwater conditions in this and other basins.",

            "abstract": "In spite of numerous geoscientific studies, the mechanisms responsible for the initiation and development of continental rifts are still poorly understood. The key information required to constrain various geodynamic models on rift initiation can be derived from the crust/mantle structure and anisotropy beneath incipient rifts such as the Southern and Southwestern branches of the East African Rift System. As part of a National Science Foundation funded interdisciplinary project, 50 PASSCAL broadband seismic stations were deployed across the Malawi, Luangwa, and Okavango rift zones from the summer of 2012 to the summer of 2014. Preliminary results from these 50 SAFARI (Seismic Arrays for African Rift Initiation) and adjacent stations are presented utilizing shear-wave splitting (SWS) and P-S receiver function techniques. 1109 pairs of high-quality SWS measurements, consisting of fast polarization orientations and splitting times, have been obtained from a total of 361 seismic events. The results demonstrate dominantly NE-SW fast orientations throughout Botswana as well as along the northwestern flank of the Luangwa rift valley. Meanwhile, fast orientations beneath the eastern Luangwa rift flank rotate from NNW to NNE along the western border of the Malawi rift. Stations located alongside the western Malawi rift border faults yield ENE fast orientations, with stations situated in Mozambique exhibiting more E-W orientations. In the northern extent of the study region, fast orientations parallel the trend of the Rukwa and Usangu rift basins. Receiver function results reveal that, relative to the adjacent Pan-African mobile belts, the Luangwa rift zone has a thin (30 to 35 km) crust. The crustal thickness within the Okavango rift basin is highly variable. Preliminary findings indicate a northeastward thinning along the southeast Okavango border fault system congruent with decreasing extension toward the southwest. The Vp/Vs measurements in the Okavango basin are roughly 1.75 on average, suggesting an unmodified crustal composition, while those of the Luangwa and southern Malawi rift zones are relatively high, probably suggesting ancient or ongoing magmatic emplacement. The Pan-African mobile belts enveloping the rift zones are mostly characterized by more felsic and thicker crust.",

The errors are strongest near the land mass with a broad plume extending west, Also, the equatorial cold tongue is too strong and extends too far to the west. The simulated precipitation field generally shows a persistent double Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Tremendous effort has been made to improve CGCM performance in general and to address these tropical errors in particular.\nThe present paper start by comparing Taylor diagrams of the SST errors in the SEP and SEA by CGCMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 3 and 5 (CMIP3 and CMIP5, respectively). Some improvement is noted in models that perform poorly in CMIP3, but the overall performance is broadly similar in the two intercomparison projects. We explore the hypothesis that an improved representation of atmosphere-ocean interaction involving stratocumulus cloud decks and oceanic upwelling is essential to reduce errors in the SEP and SEA. To estimate the error contribution by clouds and upwelling, we examine the upper ocean surface heat flux budget. The resolution of the oceanic component of the CGCMs in both CMIP3 and CMIP5 is too coarse for a realistic representation of upwelling. Therefore, we also examine simulations by the Nested Regional Climate Model (nRCM) system, which is a CGCM with a very high-resolution regional model embedded in coastal regions. The nRCM consists of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM, run at 1°) coupled to the global Parallel Ocean Program Model (POP, run at 1°) to which the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS6, run at 5-10 km) is nested in selected coastal regions.",

Model uncertainty as a result of parameter values can be as large as that from other sources such as the choice of hydrologic model or the choice of model forcing data. Thus far, parameter estimation has been performed in an inconsistent manner across the model domain, e.g., using patchy calibration or spatially constant parameters. This can produce artifacts in the spatial variability of model outputs, e.g., discontinuity of simulated hydrologic fields, difficulty with spatially consistent parameter adjustments, and so on. We implement a framework that is suitable for use across multiple model physics options to map between geophysical attributes (i.e., soil, vegetation) and model parameters that describe the storage and transmission of water and energy. Specifically, we apply the transfer functions that transform geophysical attributes into model parameters and apply these transfer functions at the native resolution of the geophysical attribute data rather than at the resolution of the model application. The model parameters are then aggregated to the spatial scale of the model simulation with several scaling functions - arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, geometric mean. Model parameter adjustments are made by calibrating the parameters of the transfer function rather than the model parameters themselves.We demonstrate this general parameter estimation approach using a continental scale VIC implementation at a 12km resolution. The VIC soil parameters were generated by a set of transfer functions developed with nation-wide STATSGO soil data. The VIC model with new soil parameters is forced with Maurer et al. 2002 climate dataset (1979-2008) and the simulation results are compared with the previous simulations with parameters used in past studies as well as observed streamflows at selected basins.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic stress changes have been shown to contribute to aftershock triggering, but the physical triggering mechanisms are not fully understood. Some proposed mechanisms are based on dynamic stress loading of the target fault in a direction that encourages earthquake slip (e.g. dynamic Coulomb stress triggering), while other mechanisms are based on fault weakening due to shaking. If dynamic stress loading in the fault slip direction plays a role in aftershock triggering, we would expect to see a relationship between the dynamic stress orientations and the aftershock focal mechanisms. Alternatively, if dynamic stress change triggering functions only through a fault weakening mechanism that is independent of the slip direction of the target fault, no such relationship is expected. I study aftershock sequences of 4 M≥6.7 mainshocks in southern California, and find a small but significant relationship between modeled dynamic stress direction and aftershock focal mechanisms. The mainshock dynamic stress changes have two observed impacts: changing the focal mechanisms in a given location to favor those aligned with the dynamic stress change, and changing the spatial distribution of seismicity to favor locations where the dynamic stress change aligns with the background stress. The aftershock focal mechanisms are significantly more aligned with the dynamic stress changes than the preshock mechanisms for only the first 0.5-1 year following most mainshocks, although for at least 10 years following Hector Mine. Dynamic stress effects on focal mechanisms are best observed at long periods (30-60 sec). Dynamic stress effects are only observed when using metrics based on repeated stress cycling in the same direction, for example considering the dominant stress orientation over the full time series, and not for the peak dynamic stress. These results imply that dynamic aftershock triggering operates at least in part through cyclic loading in the direction of fault slip, although non-directional fault weakening may be important as well. This suggests that the orientation of the dynamic stresses, as well as their amplitude, should be considered in the development of physics-based aftershock forecasting models.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentological and mineralogical observations indicate that sandstones within the Eagle and Endurance crater sections of the Burns Formation of Meridiani Planum, Mars, were derived from sulfate-bearing altered basalt, possibly from a playa lake, and deposited by eolian and locally subaqueous processes in a eolian dune – sand sheet – interdune setting. Abrasion of rocks within the outcrop outlining Endurance Crater by the MER rover Opportunity revealed void spaces later determined to be secondary pore space created from the dissolution of soluble minerals from multiple groundwater movement (recharge) events. Previous investigations into the secondary porosity and permeability of rocks within the Karatepe section showed that the ability for fluid movement through the vertical sedimentary section was greatest between the Upper and Middle units at the Whatanga contact within Endurance Crater, where secondary porosity was measured to be ~40% of the rock. Our investigations into quantifying subsurface habitability involve simulating the paleo-groundwater environments on the micro-to-mesoscale (sub mm-scale to cm-scale) to determine how preservation potential changes with repeated water-rock interaction, varying fluid chemistry (pH, salinity, T, others), and pressure changes under Earth and Mars conditions. In addition to fluids, microbes (extremophiles) will be introduced into our simulation to observe how changing experimental input conditions impact the growth and development of biotic interactions and eventually biosignatures left behind within sedimentary microtextures. Moreover, detection of biosignatures using visual and UV methods will help inform the M2020 rover mission regarding in-situ analysis of abraded rock outcrops. Finally, results of this work will use terrestrial rocks and fluids from a known Mars analogue (the Rio Tinto basin) in order to aid in determining habitability and survivability in acidic and high saline conditions that are similar to Meridiani Planum, Mars.",

            "abstract": "The recently accomplished CINDY/DYNAMO project observed three MJO events in the equatorial Indian Ocean from October to December 2011. Analysis of the moist static energy budget by Sobel et al. (2014) indicates that the moist static energy anomalies in these events grew and were sustained to a significant extent by radiative feedbacks. We present here a study of radiative fluxes and clouds in a set of cloud-resolving simulations of the same DYNAMO MJO events.\nThe simulations are driven by the large scale forcing dataset from the DYNAMO northern sounding array, and carried out in doubly-periodic domains using the WRF model. Simulated cloud properties and radiative fluxes are compared to the observed reflectivity from the SPolka radar and observed radiative fluxes from the CERES and VISST datasets. To accommodate the uncertainty in cloud microphysics, we have tested a number of single-moment (SM) and double-moment (DM) microphysical schemes in the WRF model.\nWe find that in general the SM schemes tend to underestimate radiative flux anomalies in the active phase of the MJOs, while the DM schemes perform better but can instead overestimate radiative fluxes. All the microphysics schemes tested exhibit bias in the shape of the histograms of radiative fluxes and radar reflectivity. Analysis of CRM-simulated radar reflectivity indicates that this microphysics-related radiative flux uncertainty is closely related to how much stratiform clouds the CRM can simulate. SM schemes underestimate stratiform clouds by a factor of 2, while DM schemes simulate much more stratiform cloud, closer to observation, but shows a peak in the histogram at 15-20 dBz that is absent in observations. The double-moment Morrison scheme appears to give the best results in TOA fluxes associated with the MJO convective anomalies despite biases in the histograms of cloud and radiative fluxes.",

            "abstract": "The Deccan Traps are a dominantly mafic large igneous province (LIP) that, prior to erosion, covered ~1 million km2 of west-central India with lava flows. The type sections of the Western Ghats escarpment, where the Deccan lava pile reaches a maximum reconstructed stratigraphic thickness of ~3400 m, are subdivided into eleven formations defined on chemo-stratigraphic grounds. Earlier work recognized that emplacement of Deccan basalt flows primarily occurs following two main modes: as a stack of meter-sized pāhoehoe toes and lobes, termed “compound” flows; or as inflated sheet lobes tens to hundreds of meters in width and meters to tens of meters in height, previously termed “simple” flows. Initially, the distribution of small lobes and sheet lobes in the Deccan was thought to be controlled by distance from source, but later work suggested the distribution to be mainly controlled along stratigraphic, formational boundaries, with six of the lower formations being composed exclusively of compound flows, and the upper 4-5 formations being wholly built of sheet lobes. This simple stratigraphic subdivision of lava flow morphologies has also been documented in the volcanic architecture of other LIPs, e.g., the Etendeka, the Ethiopian Traps, and in the Faeroe Islands (North Atlantic LIP). Upon examination of eight sections carefully logged along the Western Ghats, this traditional view must be challenged. Where the lower Deccan formations crop out, we found that as much as 65% of the exposed thickness (below the Khandala Formation) is made up of sheet lobes, from 40% in the Bhimashankar Formation to 75% in the Thakurvadi Formation. Near the bottom of the sequence, 25% of the Neral Formation is composed of sheet lobes ≥15 m in thickness. This distribution in lava flow morphology does not seem to be noticeably affected by the inferred distance to the source (based on the location of similar-composition dikes for each formation). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of compound flows and inflated sheet lobes, involving one or more of the following factors: underlying slope, varying effusion rate, and source geometry. Analogue experiments are currently under way to test the relative influence of each of these factors in the development of different lava flow morphologies in LIPs.",

            "abstract": "Although several studies have found that the annual mean properties of modeled low clouds has been improved due to more realistic representation of cloud processes in the new generation of climate models, the shorter time scale properties such as the seasonal variability, precipitation, and the diurnal cycle of low clouds still need to be evaluated with observations to reduce the uncertainties in low clouds modeling.\nThe Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) Mobile Facility (AMF) was on Graciosa Island in the Azores from June 2009 to December 2010 as part of the Clouds, Aerosol, and Precipitation in the Marine Boundary Layer (CAP-MBL) field campaign. CAP-MBL obtained 19 months of intensive cloud and radiation observations on Graciosa Island in the Azores, which offered us a good opportunity to evaluate the modeled low clouds with observations.\nTo spot and address issues in the simulation of marine low clouds in CAM5, this study compared the hourly CAM5 output at the grid column (39.1N, 27.5W), which is the nearest grid to Graciosa Island (39.1N, 28.0W), with 19-month cloud and radiation observations in the Azores. The representation of low clouds and their radiative impacts in CAM5 will be evaluated in different cloud regimes (i.e. cumulus vs. stratocumulus) and boundary layer (BL) structures (i.e. well-mixed BL vs. decoupled BL). The origin of the model bias for different cloud regimes will also be analyzed.\nAcknowledgement: This work is supported by the ASR Program for the Office of Science of the U.S. DOE.

            "abstract": "Gravel-sand-clay mixture model is proposed particularly for unconsolidated sediments to predict permeability and velocity from volume fractions of the three components (i.e. gravel, sand, and clay). A well-known sand-clay mixture model or bimodal mixture model treats clay contents as volume fraction of the small particle and the rest of the volume is considered as that of the large particle. This simple approach has been commonly accepted and has validated by many studies before. However, a collection of laboratory measurements of permeability and grain size distribution for unconsolidated samples show an impact of presence of another large particle; i.e. only a few percent of gravel particles increases the permeability of the sample significantly. This observation cannot be explained by the bimodal mixture model and it suggests the necessity of considering the gravel-sand-clay mixture model.\nIn the proposed model, I consider the three volume fractions of each component instead of using only the clay contents. Sand becomes either larger or smaller particles in the three component mixture model, whereas it is always the large particle in the bimodal mixture model. The total porosity of the two cases, one is the case that the sand is smaller particle and the other is the case that the sand is larger particle, can be modeled independently from sand volume fraction by the same fashion in the bimodal model. However, the two cases can co-exist in one sample; thus, the total porosity of the mixed sample is calculated by weighted average of the two cases by the volume fractions of gravel and clay. The effective porosity is distinguished from the total porosity assuming that the porosity associated with clay is zero effective porosity. In addition, effective grain size can be computed from the volume fractions and representative grain sizes for each component. Using the effective porosity and the effective grain size, the permeability is predicted by Kozeny-Carman equation. Furthermore, elastic properties are obtainable by general Hashin-Shtrikman-Walpole bounds. The predicted results by this new mixture model are qualitatively consistent with laboratory measurements and well log obtained for unconsolidated sediments.\nAcknowledgement: A part of this study was accomplished with a subsidy of River Environment Fund of Japan.",

The combination of those two techniques allows to concomitantly act on the two main agents intervening in global warming: solar radiation and carbon dioxide. The earth surface temperature increases due mainly to carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) that keeps the solar radiation and causes the global warming. Two complementary methods to mitigate climate change are overviewed: SRM method, which uses injected aerosols, aims to reduce the amount of the inbound solar radiation in atmosphere; and olivine dissolution in water, a key chemical reaction envisaged in climate engineering , aiming to reduce the amount of the carbon dioxide in extracting it from atmosphere. The SRM method works on scenarios of solar radiation decrease and the olivine dissolution method works as a carbon dioxide sequestration method. Olivine dissolution in water impacts negatively on the pH of rivers but positively in counteracting ocean acidification and in transporting the silica in ocean, which has benefits for diatom shell formation.",

One of the widely used approaches is to compare the observed Tb with a simulated Tb using a forward radiative transfer model (RTM) and input geophysical parameters at the geographic location and time of the observation. In this study we intend to test the sensitivity of the RTM to uncertainties in the input geophysical parameters as well as to the underlying physical assumptions of gaseous absorption and surface emission in the RTM. SAPHIR, a cross track scanner onboard Indo-French Megha-Tropique Satellite, gives us a unique opportunity of studying 6 dual band 183 GHz channels at an inclined orbit over the Tropics for the first time. We will also perform the same sensitivity analysis using the Advance Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) 23 GHz and five 183 GHz channels. Preliminary analysis comparing GDAS and an independent retrieved profile show some sensitivity of the RTM to the input data. An extended analysis of this work using different input geophysical parameters will be presented. Two different absorption models, the Rosenkranz and the MonoRTM will be tested to analyze the sensitivity of the RTM to spectroscopic assumptions in each model. Also for the 23.8 GHz channel, the sensitivity of the RTM to the surface emissivity model will be checked. Finally the impact of these sensitivities on radiometric inter-calibration of radiometers at sounding frequencies will be assessed.",

            "abstract": "Seismic analyses show that slip during large earthquakes evolves in a slip-pulse mode that is characterized by abrupt, intense acceleration followed by moderate deceleration. We experimentally analyze the friction evolution under slip-pulse proxy of a large earthquake, and compare it with the evolution at loading modes of constant-velocity and changing-velocity. We present a series of 42 experiments conducted on granite samples sheared in a high-velocity rotary apparatus. The experiments were conducted on room-dry, solid granite samples at slip-velocities of 0.0006-1 m/s, and normal stress of 1-11.5 MPa. The constitutive relations are presented with respect to mechanical power-density: PD= [shear stress * slip velocity], with units of power per area (MW/m^2).\n\nThe experimental constitutive relations strongly depend on the loading mode. Constant velocity mode displays initial weakening with increasing PD that is followed by strengthening for PD = 0.02-0.5 MW/m^2, and abrupt weakening at PD > 0.5 MW/m^2. Changing-velocity modes display gentle strengthening for PD < 0.2 MW/m^2 that is followed by abrupt weakening as PD reaches 0.7-0.8 MW/m^2. Beyond this level of power-density, the two loading modes diverge: in changing-velocity of quake-mode the experimental fault continues to weaken with friction coefficient approaching 0.2, whereas in changing-velocity of ramp-mode the fault strengthens with friction coefficient approaching 1.0.\nThe analysis demonstrates that (1) the strength evolution and constitutive parameters of the granite fault strongly depend on the loading mode, and (2) the slip-pulse mode is energy efficient relatively to the constant-velocity mode as manifested by faster, more intense weakening and 50-90% lower energy dissipation. The results suggest that the frictional strength determined in slip-pulse experiments, is more relevant to simulations of earthquake rupture than frictional strength determined in constant-velocity experiments.\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "Las Vegas is one of the fastest growing desert cities. Its developed area has doubled in the last 30 years. An accurate prediction of the effect of urbanization on the climate of the city is crucial for resource management and planning. In this study, we use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a land surface and urban canopy model to investigate the effects of urbanization on the regional climate pattern around Las Vegas. High resolution numerical simulations are performed with a 3 km resolution over the metropolitan area. With identical lateral boundary conditions, three land-use land-cover maps, representing 2006, 1992 and hypothetical 1900, are used in multiple simulations. The differences in the simulated climate among those cases are used to quantify the urban effect. The simulated surface air temperature is validated against observational data from the weather station at the McCarran airport. It is found that urbanization affects substantial warming during the night but a minor cooling during the day. Detailed diagnostics of the surface energy budget are performed to help interpret this result. In addition, the emerging urban structures are found to have a mechanical effect of slowing down the climatological wind field over the urban area. The change in wind, in turn, leads to a secondary modification of the temperature structure within the air shed of the city. This finding suggests the need to combine the mechanical and thermodynamic effects to construct a complete picture of the influence of land cover on urban climate. In all cases of the simulations, it is also demonstrated that urbanization influences surface air temperature mainly within the metropolitan area.",

            "abstract": "Each year, droughts cause significant economic and agricultural losses across the world. The early warning and onset detection of drought is of particular importance for effective agriculture and water resource management. Previous studies show that the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), a measure of precipitation deficit, detects drought onset earlier than other indicators. Here we show that satellite-based near surface air relative humidity data can substantially improve drought onset detection and early warning. This paper introduces the Standardized Relative Humidity Index (SRHI) based on the NASA Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) observations. The results indicate that the SRHI typically detects the drought onset earlier than the SPI. While the AIRS mission was not originally designed for drought monitoring, we show that its relative humidity data offers a new and unique avenue for drought monitoring and early warning. We propose that the early drought detection framework could be integrated into current drought warning systems.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, significant advances have been achieved in model representation of atmospheric boundary layers (ABL). However, fundamental understanding of the processes governing the evolution of the Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) is still incomplete. We address this problem by combining available atmosphere and ocean observations with advanced coupled atmosphere-wave models, via state estimation (SE) methodologies. The goal is to improve wind prediction for off-shore wind energy applications through advances in understanding and parameterization of underlying physical processes, with an emphasis on the coupling between the atmosphere and the ocean via momentum and heat fluxes. We systematically investigate the errors in the treatment of the surface layer of the MBL in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and identify structural model inadequacies associated with the MBL parameterization. For this purpose we are using both the single-column model (SCM) and three-dimensional (3D) versions of the WRF model, observations of MBL structure provided by offshore observational platform FINO1, and probabilistic SE. We have also developed an atmosphere-wave coupled modeling system by interfacing WRF with a wave model (WaveWatch III – WWIII). This modeling system is used for evaluating errors in the representation of wave-induced forcing on the energy balance at the interface between atmosphere and ocean. Probabilistic SE is based on the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). DART is the framework for obtaining spatial and temporal statistics of wind-error evolution (and hence the surface-layer fluxes), along with objective tuning of model parameters.\nWe explore one of the potential sources of MBL model errors associated with roughness length parameterized using Charnock’s relation. Charnock’s roughness length parameterization assumes wind-driven waves are in equilibrium. However, it has been shown that swells propagating at different speeds and angles with respect to the wind direction can have a significant effect on winds in the lower boundary layer. Results over a domain centered at the FINO 1 tower covering northern Europe for the months of October, November, and December of 2006 will be presented.",

            "abstract": "In arid and semi-arid regions climate seasonality and times of high evaporative demand have a profound influence on the oxygen isotope composition of soil water. Isotopic evaporative enrichment models are well developed for soil waters and indicate that the shape of soil water oxygen isotope depth profiles (and therefore that of soil carbonate forming in equilibrium) is primarily controlled by the evaporation rate of water out of the soil. A climosequence of four sites was established on Holocene soils in Fish Lake Valley, Nevada (western USA) where MAP ranges from ~80 mm/yr to ~220 mm/yr. Continuous measurements of soil and air temperature and humidity were recorded at 0.5 hr intervals, while daily snow cover at the highest elevation site was assessed via time-lapse photography, revealing that the influence of snow on soil hydrology varies along the climosequence and that a majority of winter snow precipitation is lost to sublimation and does not enter the frozen soil. Precipitation samples for δ18O values and samples of soil atmosphere from 10, 25, 50 and 100cm were collected at various intervals for CO2 concentration, δ13C and δ18O values (which are a proxy for soil water δ18O) and indicate that soil water δ18O values are directly related to precipitation inputs and subsequent soil water evaporation. Soil pit excavations at the beginning of the study yielded detailed depth profiles of soil properties and pedogenic carbonate δ18O and δ13C values, as well as soil water for validation of the soil H2O-CO2 δ18O equilibrium by both vacuum extraction and direct headspace equilibration. Analysis of these data reveals several important features of this semi-arid soil system: 1) precipitation and soil water δ18O values reflect two distinct seasonal atmospheric circulation patterns, of which only one is reflected in the soil carbonate δ18O values, and 2) we show that while soil water conditions are variable through the year at these sites, pedogenic carbonate yields information about year-long evaporation rates. We extend this modern understanding of soil water conditions to the interpretation of pedogenic carbonate profiles from modern soils in the Great Basin and demonstrate how to derive similar information about their evaporative environment.",

            "abstract": "Experimental observations of terrestrial biogeochemistry are often made at the scale of leaves and the rhizosphere or at spatial scales finer than that of the entire ecosystem. Classic examples include measurements of leaf-level photosynthesis and of soil respiration using soil chambers. Field experiments are often designed to test hypotheses at these finer scales or to test larger scale hypotheses linked to those finer-scale processes. In turn, functional representations of processes within a model are themselves scale-dependent hypotheses. They may be hypotheses that are broadly supported by experimental results or they may be more tentative. In either case, there is a need to evaluate the finer-scale hypotheses within the context of the model’s integrated representation of larger-scale higher-level behavior. For example, model results can indicate how a hypothesized process at the scale of fine roots might be expressed at the scale of whole stand evapotranspiration. These results can then inform the design of experiments and observations best suited for capturing that multi-scale behavior and dependency. However, it is often extremely difficult to extract results of finer scale hypotheses (functions) from fully integrated large-scale ecosystem models. Accordingly, we have developed a framework for extracting individual process representations from the Community Land Model (CLM) into modular units for functional testing. These modules encapsulate fine-scale hypotheses about terrestrial biogeochemistry. Results can be generated quickly with these modules and compared directly with the experimental observations at the appropriate scale. Alternative hypotheses can be quickly implemented and evaluated. We illustrate this concept with results from CLM and the Partitioning in Trees and Soils loblolly pine field experiment. Our findings suggest deficits in the model’s hypothesized relationship between photosynthesis and temperature and suggest a focus in subsequent experiments on temperature response functions. We discuss the broader implications of using the functional unit testing in evaluating hypotheses and other ideas about terrestrial biogeochemical processes, including how our approach strengthens mutual feedbacks between model and field experiment.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution seismic images of upper mantle transition zone structures are important for our understanding of the thermal, chemical, and geodynamical evolution of the Earth. In this study, we used precursors of the teleseismic SS phase to image upper mantle transition zones beneath Hawaii. The teleseismic SS phase bounces off the free surface roughly at the middle point between the earthquake epicenter and the recording station, thus providing crucial data coverage of areas where neither natural earthquakes nor passive receivers are available. Its precursors, e.g. S410S and S660S, reflect at deeper interfaces, and therefore arrive before the main SS phase. Differential travel times between the SS phase and its precursors are used for mapping transition zone structures.\nDue to relatively small amplitudes of SS precursors, a large number of seismograms are usually stacked to enhance their signal to noise ratio (SNR). Traditionally seismograms which share a common bouncepoint are stacked, using a technique known as common middle point stacking (CMP). Random noise is suppressed and the small amplitude precursor signals should become visible. However, if there is strong contamination from other seismic phases in the precursor window, e.g. near receiver reflections such as Ss410s and Ss660s, it will be difficult to identify SS precursors. Here, we applied radon transform filtering to remove multiples both before and after stacking. Application of this technique to our new SS precursor dataset shows that not only is the seismic noise level greatly reduced, but also the resolution of upper mantle structures is significantly improved. With the noise-reduced seismic dataset, we also compared seismic imaging results using both CMP stacking method and generalized radon transform (GRT) method. Except for some subtle and tractable differences, these two methods generally give consistent results.\nWe observe strong and laterally continuous upper mantle reflectors near 410 and 660 km. We also detect local splitting of the “520”. Above the transition zone, there are strong reflectors at ~220 km and ~310 km. Thinning of the mantle transition zone is observed to the southeast of the Hawaiian Islands, suggesting a tilted mantle plume in the upper mantle.",

The model is a key component of the RAM-CPL suite in describing the temporal evolution of plasma density in the equatorial plane of the magnetosphere. In addition to considering absolute density values, this study employs a composite definition of the plasmapause boundary as a standard metric for comparison between observations and the model. Because the dynamics of the plasmasphere are governed on different timescales ranging from minutes to days, we consider geomagnetic events for which the RBSP satellites are at conjunction to sample fine-scale density variation as well as large-scale structure. Furthermore, the pre-dawn and post-dusk sectors of the observations provide adequate constraints on the candidate electric field drivers of the plasmasphere. The good agreement attained by the RAM-CPL plasmasphere model can be utilized to predict density conditions in magnetic local time and L-parameter sectors distant from an RBSP orbit of interest. These simulations reproduce plasmapause radial locations to within 0.6 Earth radii (RE) of RBSP observations and we investigate the competing effects of plasmaspheric refilling and erosion on model performance.",

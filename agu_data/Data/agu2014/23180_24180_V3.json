            "abstract": "A rapid transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient society is not only possible, but could also bring many co-benefits for public health, economic wellbeing, social equity, and more. The science supporting an urgent need for such a transition has never been clearer. Yet, social science data are also clear: the public in the US (and many other similar developed economies) does not, on average, share this sense of urgency, nor have policymakers shown a willingness to put scientific evidence above the perceptions of their constituents. The gulf between scientific and public understanding of climate change has spurred research on climate change communication, learning, and decision-making, identifying barriers such as misconceptions and faulty mental models of the climate and energy systems; poor understanding of complex, dynamic systems generally; and affective and social barriers to learning and action. There is also a growing opportunity to address these barriers, through tools that rely on active learning, that are social, engaging (and even fun), and that are grounded in rigorous science. An increasing number of decision-support computer simulations are being developed, intended to make complex technical problems accessible to non-experts in an interactive format. At the same time, the use of scenario planning, role-playing games, and active learning approaches are gaining ground in policy and education spheres. Simulation-based role-playing games bring these approaches together and can provide powerful learning experiences: they offer the potential to compress time and reality; create experiences without requiring the 'real thing;' explore the consequences of our decisions that often unfold over decades; and open affective and social learning pathways. Here, we offer a perspective on the potential of these tools in climate change education, communication, and decision-support, and a brief demonstration of one tool we have developed, World Energy.",

In the course of designing and building the NASA Earthdata Search Client, a \"concept-car\" discovery client for the new Common Metadata Repository (CMR) and NASA Earthdata, we learned important lessons about usability from user studies and our actual use of science metadata. In this talk we challenge the community with the issues we ran into: the critical usability stumbling blocks for even seasoned researchers, \"bug reports\" from users that were ultimately usability problems in metadata, the challenges and questions that arise from incorporating \"visual metadata\", and the state of data access services. We intend to show that high quality metadata and real human usability factors are essential to making critical data accessible.",

            "abstract": "The isotopic compositions (d13C, d18O) of natural carbonates produced by the alteration of basic and ultrabasic rocks on the Oman ophiolite have been measured in order to better understand their formation mechanisms. Fossil carbonates developed on altered peridotitic samples, mostly found in fractures, and contemporary carbonates were studied. The samples bear a large range of d13C. Those collected in veins are magnesian (magnesite, dolomite) and have a carbon signature reflecting mixing of processes and important fractionation (-11‰ to 8‰). Their association with talc and lizardite suggests they are by-products of a serpentinization process, that must have occurred as a carbon-rich fluid was circulating at depth. On the other hand, the carbonates are mostly calcic when formed in alkaline springs, most of which are located in the vicinity of lithological discontinuities such as the peridotite-gabbro contact (Moho). Aragonite forms a few meters below the surface of the ponds in Mg-poor water, and is systematically associated with brucite (Mg(OH)2). This suggests most of the Mg dissolved at depth has reprecipitated during the fluid’s ascension through fractures or faults as carbonates and serpentine. Further up, on the surface waters of the ponds (depleted in Mg and D.I.C.), thin calcite films precipitate and reach extremely negative d13C values (-28‰), which could reflect either a biological carbon source, or kinetic fractionation from pumping atmospheric CO2. Their formation represent an efficient and natural process for carbon dioxide mineral sequestration. The d18O signature from all samples confirm the minerals crystallized from a low-temperature fluid. The hyperalkaline conditions (pH between 11 and 12) allowing for these fast precipitation kinetics are generated by the serpentinization process occurring at depth, as indicated by the measured associated H2-rich gas flows (over 50%) seeping out to the surface.",

            "abstract": "Located at the inside corner high of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), 30°N and the Atlantis Transform Fault (ATF), the Atlantis Massif has been uplifted over the past ~2 my. The Southern Ridge of this massif hosts the Lost City Hydrothermal Field (LCHF), an off-axis hydrothermal vent field with carbonate chimney ages surpassing 120,000 yrs. The fluids discharging at LCHF carry geochemical signals that show a direct interaction with serpentinites. However, mineralogical evidence suggests that peridotite hydration began early in the formation of oceanic core complexes and previous modeling results indicate that serpentinization is unlikely to generate the heat necessary to maintain current levels of discharge at LCHF. This work develops a model for the LCHF venting based on the evidence of tectonic strain, detachment faulting, serpentinization, and convective fluid flow. We constrain fluid flow at the LCHF by vent geochemistry, vent temperature, seismically inferred faulting, and expected geothermal gradient ≈100°C/km.\nPresent understanding of tectonic processes at the intersection of MAR and ATF suggests that unroofing of the footwall and crustal flexing of the massif induced normal faults, which run parallel to the MAR, throughout the Southern Ridge. In the absence of the evidence of magmatism, we test the feasibility of the geothermal gradient to cause fluid circulation in the high-permeability, sub-vertical fault zone. Fluid circulation in the fault zone is complemented by the bulk porous flow driven through the Southern Ridge by the lateral temperature gradient between the cold water on the steep face along the ATF side and the hot interior of the massif. In this scenario, the high pH hydrothermal fluids pass through the serpentinized zone before discharging as both high-temperature focused flow (40°-91°C) and low-temperature (≈15°C) diffuse flow at the LCHF.",

We use simulations of the Mid-Holocene (MH) climate (6K BP) from General Circulation Models participating in CMIP5 to constrain future projections of Arctic climate change by the same models. During the Mid-Holocene, the Arctic received approximately 50 W/m2 more solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere during summer, a similar increase to what is projected from greenhouse gas forcing for the middle of the 21st century. The constraint in our analysis arise from a measure of the ability of GCMs to hindcast MH climate using a suite of both land paleo-records – which are much more abundant for high latitudes than ocean proxy - and ocean paleo-record. Results show that GCMs with skill at simulating the MH climate and today’s climate give more realistic future projections of the sea ice decline in forced climate simulations of the 21st century participating in the IPCC-AR5.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling has made it possible to economically produce natural gas from unconventional shale gas reservoirs. An efficient methodology for evaluating hydraulic fracturing operation parameters, such as fluid and proppant properties, injection rates, and wellhead pressure, is essential for the evaluation and efficient design of these processes. Traditional numerical evaluation and optimization approaches are usually based on simulated fracture properties such as the fracture area. In our opinion, a methodology based on simulated production data is better, because production is the goal of hydraulic fracturing and we can calibrate this approach with production data that is already known. This numerical methodology requires a fully-coupled hydraulic fracture propagation and multi-phase flow model.\nIn this paper, we present a general fully-coupled numerical framework to simulate hydraulic fracturing and post-fracture gas well performance. This three-dimensional, multi-phase simulator focuses on: (1) fracture width increase and fracture propagation that occurs as slurry is injected into the fracture, (2) erosion caused by fracture fluids and leakoff, (3) proppant subsidence and flowback, and (4) multi-phase fluid flow through various-scaled anisotropic natural and man-made fractures. Mathematical and numerical details on how to fully couple the fracture propagation and fluid flow parts are discussed. Hydraulic fracturing and production operation parameters, and properties of the reservoir, fluids, and proppants, are taken into account. The well may be horizontal, vertical, or deviated, as well as open-hole or cemented. The simulator is verified based on benchmarks from the literature and we show its application by simulating fracture network (hydraulic and natural fractures) propagation and production data history matching of a field in China. We also conduct a series of real-data modeling studies with different combinations of hydraulic fracturing parameters and present the methodology to design these operations with feedback of simulated production data. The unified model aids in the optimization of hydraulic fracturing design, operations, and production.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric emissions from agriculture are important to air quality and climate, yet their representation in inventories is incomplete. Increased fertilizer use has lead to increased emissions of nitrogen compounds, which can adversely affect ecosystems and contribute to the formation of fine particulates. Furthermore, extraction and processing of oil and natural gas continues to expand throughout northeastern Colorado; emissions from these operations require ongoing measurement and characterization. This presentation summarizes initial data and analysis from a summer 2014 campaign to study emissions of nitrogen compounds, methane, and other species in northeastern Colorado using a new mobile laboratory. A van was instrumented to measure NH3, N2O, NOx, NOy, CH4, CO, CO2, O3, and bioaerosols with high time resolution. By sampling in close proximity to a variety of emissions sources, the mobile laboratory facilitated accurate source identification and quantification of emissions ratios. Measurements were obtained near agricultural sites, natural gas and oil operations, and other point sources. Additionally, extensive measurements were obtained downwind from urban areas and along roadways. The relationship between ammonia and other trace gases is used to characterize sources and constrain emissions inventories.",

            "abstract": "Cruise 14-02 of the RV/IB N.B. Palmer conducted the first multidisciplinary oceanographic investigation of the continental shelf within the Dalton Iceberg Tongue polynya off the Sabrina Coast, East Antarctica. At >350 m in the northeastern polynya, hydrographic measurements confirmed that relatively warm (>0°C) oceanic thermocline water from near the shelf break has been imported to the shelf but likely within an interior recirculation associated with local mid-shelf bathymetry. CHIRP sub-bottom data revealed ~15 m of acoustically transparent sediment in a 550-m deep basin proximal to this feature. A suite of coring devices was used to recover a complete 13-m sequence of Late Pleistocene glacial diamict and Holocene laminated diatom oozes and muds (NBP14-02 MC 45, KC 27B, JPC 27, and JKC 53) with chronology constrained by 210Pb and foraminifer-based AMS 14C dates.\nUnlike many Antarctic margin sedimentary sequences, biogenic carbonate (CaCO3) is exceptionally well preserved throughout the sedimentary sequence, likely due to non-corrosive bottom waters and/or low sedimentary organic carbon content. Planktic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma(s) is present throughout and abundant in the diatomaceous muds. Bulimina aculeata, which prefers calm, hemipelagic environments and bottom water temperatures >0°C, dominates the living benthic foraminifer assemblage.\nFossil assemblages oscillate between B. aculeata and Trifarina angulosa-dominated assemblages. As T. angulosa is associated with oxygenated bottom waters and strong bottom currents, this assemblage may record past changes in the location of the Polar and Slope Fronts. This interpretation is supported by T. angulosa presence in Thalassiothrix diatom oozes, which are associated with oceanic frontal zones and rapid biosiliceous sedimentation. Preliminary foraminifer oxygen and carbon isotopes, N. pachyderma(s) presence, and the observed T. angulosa Mg/Ca‑temperature (-1.8 to 0°C) relationship highlight the potential for detailed regional foraminifer-based paleoceanographic records, which will provide critical tests for developing proxies, including TEX86 paleothermometry. Future paleoceanographic studies will be supported by data from two long‑term oceanographic and sediment trap moorings deployed near the core site.",

            "abstract": "The martian Curiosity rover has characterized the Yellowknife Bay region as habitable based on the presence of sedimentary rocks, the array of elements essential to supporting life (CHNOPS), and indications of hydrologic activity either as a shallow stream bed or intermittently wet lake bed. However as an ancient site this surface was challenging for sustained habitability due to the radiation environment and unknown persistence of water. In contrast the shallow subsurface was potentially a longer lived environment sheltered from the harsh surface conditions. Yet our knowledge of subsurface environments is limited. Did the ancient subsurface of Mars encompass the full range of factors needed for habitability, what is the evidence for this, and was this preserved in the geologic record? Syntheses of global 0.4-5.0 µm spectroscopic observations from high (19 m/pixel CRISM) to moderate (1 km/pixel OMEGA) resolution VNIR data show diverse assemblages of aqueous minerals. The most common environment observed from orbit is a subsurface hydrothermal-type environment accounting for more than 70% of observed sites with hydrated silicates. The dominant hydrated mineral phase is smectite clay, implying a moderate pH environment and a thermal environmental <350°C. The heat source to drive hydrothermal systems could be crustal cooling following planet formation, conductive heat flow from the mantle, impact generated heat pulses, deuteric alteration and magmatism. Evidence of relatively rapid cooling of the crust after formation perhaps by hydrothermal circulation is provided by ancient topography preserved by a rigid crust. Exhumation of Noachian-aged phyllosilicate-rich terrains reveal abundant linear ridges resistant to erosion interpreted to be mineralized fraction zones in regional hydrothermal systems. The proposed landing site in Northeast Syrtis provides excellent access to both surface (Late Noachian fluvial systems with standing bodies of water) and subsurface (mineralized fracture zones) environments in an energy-rich setting (olivine-serpentine-magnesite mineral assemblages) I will synthesize these and new observations to assess the knowledge of subsurface environments and the relationship to surface environments in the Nili Fossae region and its prospects a landing site for Mars 2020.",

            "abstract": "Dey & Dickman [2010] showed (using a theoretical model) that the oceanic response to atmospheric pressure forcing depends on the frequency and spatial pattern of the forcing. We have developed an observational Green’s function approach to determine the frequency- and spatially dependent sea-level response using satellite altimetric data. We applied it to 12 years of TOPEX sea-surface height (SSH) observations smoothed over a 4° × 8° grid at 3 day intervals and corrected for tides, winds, annual signals and secular trends. Wiener filtering, generalized for complex time series, was used to isolate pressure forced SSH within each gridbox. In most of the gridboxes, that SSH, after accounting for the forcing, showed a spatial and spectral dependence – a significant departure from the “inverted barometer” response.\nThe oceanic currents associated with the response were calculated from a spherical harmonic relation between current velocities and SSH [Dickman 1991]. The rotational effects (polar motion and change in Earth’s spin rate) of the pressure forced SSH & associated currents – with the pressure forcing accounted for, these are essentially Green’s functions – were calculated at specific periods and interpolated to other periods. The rotational effects calculated here are dominated by the pressure-forced SSH and show a strong frequency dependence & significant departures from an inverted barometer excitation. The pressure forced SSH is effective in exciting both prograde & retrograde polar motion at periods of ~ 6 days, and prograde polar motion at periods of 10 – 15 days. Compared to the theoretical approach, our work finds that the prograde component shows higher amplitude and less spatial variability, whereas the other components are ~ similar in amplitude & spatial variability.\nWhen these Green’s functions are combined with any time span of pressure data, they generate the total excitation for that time span. We will discuss the results for various spans of pressure data.",

            "abstract": "During root water uptake from dry soils, the highly nonlinear relation between hydraulic conductivity and water content as well as the radial root geometry result in steep water potential gradients close to the root surface. The hydraulic properties of the rhizosphere – the interface between root and soil – are one of the most important and least understood components in controlling root water uptake.\nPrevious research using young lupine plants revealed that after irrigation it took 1-2 days for the water content of the dry rhizosphere to increase. How can this delay be explained?\nOur hypotheses: a) mucilage – a polymeric plant exudate – alters rhizosphere hydraulic properties, b) its hydrophobic moieties make the rhizosphere water repellent when dry, c) mucilage is a highly viscous, gelatinous material, the dryer it gets the more viscous it becomes, d) mucilage viscosity reduces rhizosphere hydraulic conductivity.\nTo test our hypotheses we used mucilage extracted from chia seed as an analogue for root mucilage. We measured: 1) the contact angle between water and pure dry and wet mucilage, dry soil treated with various concentrations of mucilage, 2) mucilage viscosity as function of concentration and shear rate, 3) saturated hydraulic conductivity as function of mucilage concentration, 4) swelling of dry mucilage in water. Finally, to mimic flow of water across the rhizosphere, we measured the capillary rise in soils treated with different mucilage concentrations.\nThe results showed that: 1) dry mucilage has a contact angle >90° while it loses its water repellency when it gets wet, 2) viscosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity can change several orders of magnitude with a small change in mucilage concentration, 3) 1g of dry mucilage absorbs 300g water in its fully swollen state, 4) the swelling rate of mucilage showed an exponential behavior with half time of 5 hours. Capillary rise became slower in soils with higher mucilage concentration, while the final water holding capacity increased with mucilage concentration.\nWe conclude that the slow rewetting of the rhizosphere is initially caused by the high contact angle. As the mucilage swells it occupies the pore space and controls the water flow due to its high viscosity.

            "abstract": "Vast amounts of physical samples have been collected in the Earth Sciences for studies that address a wide range of scientific questions. Only a fraction of these samples are well curated and preserved long-term in sample repositories and museums. Many samples and collections are stored in the offices and labs of investigators, or in basements and sheds of institutions and investigators’ homes. These ‘uncurated’ collections often contain samples that have been well studied, or are unique and irreplaceable. They may also include samples that could reveal new insights if re-analyzed using new techniques, or specimens that could have unanticipated relevance to research being conducted in fields other than the one for which they were collected. Currently, these samples cannot be accessed or discovered online by the broader science community. Investigators and departments often lack the resources to properly catalog and curate the samples and respond to requests for splits. Long-term preservation of and access to these samples is usually not provided for.\niSamplES, a recently-funded EarthCube Research Coordination Network (RCN), seeks to integrate scientific samples, including ‘uncurated’ samples, into digital data and information infrastructure in the Earth Sciences and to facilitate their curation, discovery, access, sharing, and analysis. The RCN seeks to develop and implement best practices that increase digital access to samples with the goal of establishing a comprehensive infrastructure not only for the digital, but also physical curation of samples. The RCN will engage a broad group of individuals from domain scientists to curators to publishers to computer scientists to define, articulate, and address the needs and challenges of digital sample management and recommend community-endorsed best practices and standards for registering, describing, identifying, and citing physical specimens, drawing upon other initiatives and existing or emerging software tools for digital sample and collection management. Community engagement will include surveys, in-person workshops and outreach events, the creation of the iSamplES knowledge hub (semantic wiki) and a registry of collections. iSamplES will specifically engage early career scientists to encourage that no samples go uncurated.",

            "abstract": "Published reconstructions of radiocarbon in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean indicate that there is a mid-depth maximum in radiocarbon age during the last glacial maximum (LGM). This is in contrast to the modern ocean where intense mixing between water masses along shared density surfaces (isopycnals) results in a relatively homogenous radiocarbon profile. A recent study (Ferrari et al. 2014) suggested that the extended Antarctic sea ice cover during the LGM necessitated a shallower boundary between the upper and lower branches of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC). This shoaled boundary lay above major topographic features and their associated strong diapycnal mixing, which isolated dense southern-sourced water in the lower branch of the overturning circulation. This isolation would have allowed radiocarbon to decay, and thus provides a possible explanation for the mid-depth radiocarbon age bulge. We test this hypothesis using an idealized, 2D, residual-mean dynamical model of the global overturning circulation. Concentration distributions of a decaying tracer that is advected by the simulated overturning are compared to published radiocarbon data. We test the sensitivity of the mid-depth radiocarbon age to changes in sea ice extent, wind strength, and isopycnal and diapycnal diffusion. The mid-depth radiocarbon age bulge is most likely caused by the different circulation geometry, associated with increased sea ice extent. In particular, with an LGM-like sea ice extent the upper and lower branches of the MOC no longer share isopycnals, so radiocarbon-rich northern-sourced water is no longer mixed rapidly into the southern-sourced water. However, this process alone cannot explain the magnitude of the glacial radiocarbon anomalies; additional isolation (e.g. from reduced air-sea gas exchange associated with the increased sea ice) is required.\nFerrari, R., M.

Imaging of the gamma ray direction is made possible by the fine spatial resolution of the LAT instrument, which is intended to make maps of the high-energy gamma ray astrophysical sky. A more realistic Monte Carlo simulation and improved direction reconstruction algorithm allowed us to geolocate very bright TGFs in favorable geometries with accuracies of several tens of km. Recent work by Cummer et al. (2011), Connaughton et al. (2013), and Dwyer and Cummer (2013) strongly suggests that the broadband radio signal is produced by large electric currents (generated by ionization of relativistic electrons) that create the gamma ray signal through bremsstrahlung interactions in the atmosphere. Our analysis confirms this picture by establishing that the radio and gamma ray signals are both temporally and spatially coincident.

            "abstract": "Formation scenarios of the protosolar nebula invoke two main reservoirs of ices that took part in the production of icy planetesimals. The first reservoir, located within the inner region of the protosolar nebula, contains ices (dominated by H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, N2 and NH3) originating from the ISM, which, due to their near solar vicinity, were initially vaporized. With time, the decrease of temperature and pressure allowed the water in this reservoir to condense at ~150 K in the form of crystalline ice. It is postulated that a substantial fraction of the volatile species were trapped as clathrates during this condensation phase as long as free water ice was available and there was enough time to overcome the slow kinetics of clathration. On the other hand, the remaining volatiles that were not enclathrated (due to the lack of available water ice or a low kinetics of clathration) probably formed pure condensates at lower temperatures in this part of the nebula. The second reservoir, located at larger heliocentric distances, is composed of ices originating from the ISM that did not vaporize when entering into the disk. In this reservoir, water ice was essentially in the amorphous form and the other volatiles remained trapped in the amorphous matrix. The location of the boundary between these two reservoirs is loosely constrained and may vary between 5 and 30 AU from the Sun, depending on the postulated nebula’s thermodynamic conditions. The uncertainty in the distance of the boundary implies that comets may have formed from amorphous ice as well as from crystalline ices and/or clathrates. Here we review the key in situ measurements that are within the capabilities of the ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) instrument aboard the Rosetta spacecraft during its approach of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. These key measurements may allow disentangling between the different formation scenarios.",

Specifically, there are landscape features (e.g. the prairies and Canadian shield regions of North America) that are ephemeral in nature and have a significant influence on convective storm generation and local weather patterns through turbulent exchanges of sensible and latent heat between land and the atmosphere. In this study we perform a series of numerical experiments with the GEM (Global Environmental Multiscale model) model at 2.5 km resolution to examine the sensitivity of the atmospheric boundary layer to the presence of open water bodies. At present the land-water fraction in the GEM model is specified by means of static geophysical databases which do not change annually. Uncertainty is introduced into this land-water fraction and the sensitivity of the resulting soil moisture and precipitation is quantified for a series of convective precipitation events over Alberta for the summer 2014 period.",

            "abstract": "Dynamical changes in the tropical Pacific are hypothesized to have exerted an important influence on climate of the past millennium. However, direct proxy evidence in support of this hypothesis from the Eastern Tropical Pacific remains sparse. Here we present a unique 1000+ year continuous record of oceanic mixed layer temperature and its variability from a sediment multi-core collected in 2009 near the Galápagos Islands. The study location sits in the center of action of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a major driver of tropical and global climate variability. We analyzed Mg/Ca ratios of multiple specimens of the mixed-layer dwelling foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber to reconstruct mean sea surface temperature (SST) over the past 1000 years. We also analyzed δ18O from individual specimens of G. ruber from the same samples to assess mixed layer temperature variability during the same period. Both the multi-shell Mg/Ca and single-shell δ18O reveal statistically significant and systematic changes during the past millennium. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, ~1100-1400 CE) features a sustained period of ~1°C cooler mean surface temperatures and reduced variability (by up to 35%) compared to the late 20th century. Little Ice Age (LIA) mean mixed layer temperatures were comparatively warmer and much more variable than the MCA. Intervals with greater variability than modern, as well as intervals with lower than modern variability are both present in the LIA. The most recent sediment interval corresponding to the period 1985-2009 CE has the highest mean SST of the past 1000 years, although it is within error of temperatures from ~1000 CE. An estimate of the zonal SST gradient of the tropical Pacific based on this Mg/Ca data and similar data from the western Pacific supports a pattern of enhanced zonal gradient during the MCA and reduced gradient during the LIA. We explore the implications of these results for tropical Pacific dynamics in the context of external forcing from volcanic and solar variability.",

Since the first GPS field projects were conducted over thirty years ago, these science investigations and the UNAVCO constituency as a whole have been international and collaborative in scope and participation. Collaborations were driven by the nature of the scientific problems being addressed, the capability of the technology to make precise measurements over global scales, and inherent technical necessity for sharing of GPS tracking data across national boundaries. The International GNSS Service (IGS) was formed twenty years ago as a voluntary federation to share GPS data from now hundreds of locations around the globe to facilitate realization of global reference frames, ties to regional surveys, precise orbits, and to establish and improve best practices in analysis and infrastructure. Recently, however, numbers of regional stations have grown to the tens of thousands, typically with data that are difficult to access. UNAVCO has been working to help remove technical barriers by providing open source tools such as the Geodetic Seamless Archive Centers software to facilitate data sharing and discovery and by developing DataWorks software to manage network data. Data web services also provide the framework for UNAVCO contributions to multi-technique, inter-disciplinary, and integrative activities such as CooPEUS, GEO Supersites, EarthScope, and EarthCube. We will discuss some of UNAVCO’s experiences with building and maintaining international collaborations, processes for defining and evolving best practices, technological approaches for sharing and attribution of geodetic data, and challenges to open data access.",

The use of inter-satellite Ka-band range-rate (KBRR) observations enables data aquisition even when the spacecraft are not tracked from the Earth. The data allows for a highly accurate estimation of the lunar gravity field on both sides of the Moon, which is crucial to improve the understanding of its internal structure and thermal evolution. In this presentation we discuss GRAIL-based lunar gravity fields generated with the Celestial Mechanics Approach using the Bernese Software. Currently KBRR observations and position data (GNI1B products) are used to solve for the lunar gravity field parameters in a generalized orbit determination problem. Apart from normalized spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree n = 200, also arc-specific parameters like initial state vectors and empirical parameters (pseudo-stochastic pulses or piecewise constant accelerations) are set up as common parameters for all measurement types. The latter shall compensate for imperfect models of non-gravitational accelerations, e.g., caused by solar radiation pressure. We compare our results from the nominal and from the extended mission phase with the official level 4 gravity field models released in April 2014. As a further extension of our processing the GNI1B positions are replaced by the original Doppler observations of the Deep Space Network (DSN) to allow for a completely independent determination of the lunar gravity field using the Celestial Mechanics Approach and we present the currently achieved status of the DSN data modeling in the Bernese Software.",

            "abstract": "Terminal lakes are heavily impacted by regional changes in climate. Devils Lake (DL) is a terminal lake located in the northeastern North Dakota of the US. Since 1990, following a shift in regional precipitation pattern, DL has encountered a 10 m water level rise, with over 400% increase in surface area and 600% increase in water volume, costing over $1.5 billion in mitigation. Currently, the lake is <1.5 m from spillover level to the nearby Sheyenne River with potential negative consequences for downstream water quality and flooding. Recently, the artificial outlets have been constructed and operated to divert DL water to the Sheyenne River amid legal and political pressure. Outlet construction however did not take into consideration possible changes in local climate. We modeled the DL basin (~9,800 km2) hydrology using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and estimated future water levels of DL for different outlet scenarios under three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SRES scenarios (A1B, B1 & A2) for 2020s and 2050s. We evaluated model performance by comparing SWAT simulated daily streamflow outputs against the observed streamflow data recorded at 6 USGS water gauge locations within the basin. Future climate conditions in the region were estimated by combining historical weather data (1981-2010), 15 CMIP3 General Circulation Model projections from the IPCC data center, and stochastic downscaling methodology (LARS-WG). Our results indicate significant likelihood (7.3% ̶ 20.0%) of uncontrolled DL water overspill in the next few decades in the absence of outlets, with some members of GCM integration ensemble carrying over 85.0% and 95.0% overspill probability for 2020s and 2050s respectively. However, full-capacity outlets show radical reduction in overspill probability to partially mitigate the flooding problem by decreasing the average lake level by approximately 1.9 m and 1.5 m in 2020s and 2050s. Moreover, had there been outlet operation from the beginning of the flood episode since 1990s, not only the future overspill risks but also the current flooding extent would have been reduced significantly (Fig. 1).",

            "abstract": "Weather events that are located in the tails of a weather distribution are called weather extremes. Weather extremes, including severe drought, flooding, heat and cold waves, usually can cause greatest damage to human lives and properties, and have profound implication on ecosystem productivity and carbon cycles. There is mounting evidence suggests that the frequency of temperature and hydrological weather extremes have steadily increased over the last decades, largely due to the ongoing climate change. On the other hand, the distribution and trend of weather extremes can be regionally heterogeneous, which have not been well understood. Here we investigate the spatial distribution and temporal trend of weather extremes in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) over the past half century (1961-2010), with emphasis on the intercontinental comparisons. Our results suggest that warming extremes have increased significantly in East Asia and West Europe; while coldness extremes have decreased globally. Heavy precipitation extremes significantly increased in eastern Northern America, boreal Eurasia, and some parts of China; while drought events showed an increasing trend in northern China-southern Mongolia and some parts of western United States. Our results highlight the regional difference in the trend of weather extremes, which need to be incorporated in the mitigation measures.",

            "abstract": "Decades of extensive palaeomagnetic research have resulted in an abundance of late-Pleistocene and Holocene palaeomagnetic secular variation (PSV) datasets. The accuracy of these datasets is dependent not only upon the quality of the PSV data, but also on the geochronological methods used for age determination of the PSV data. We showcase our recently published work (Lougheed et al., 2014), whereby we demonstrate the potential of using existing datasets that have been published in the past 35 years, whereby we evaluate the datasets and update the geochronologies to reflect improved knowledge of dating techniques. Specifically, we have developed a Fennoscandia region PSV master curve for the 14-11 ka period, to extend the existing “Fennostack” Holocene PSV master curve (Snowball et al., 2007). The 14-11 ka period in Fennoscandia was dominated by the retreat of the Fennoscandian ice sheet, and it was necessary for us to use fragmented datasets from a handful of locations that were ice-free early during the deglacial period. We updated the geochronologies of the datasets to reflect the latest understanding regarding 14C dating and pollen chronozones. We selected the updated datasets with the most robust geochronology and high-quality PSV data to construct our deglacial PSV master curve. The datasets in the resulting deglacial master curve display similar PSV trends, suggesting a regional PSV signal in Fennoscandia.\nIt can be concluded that, when reconstructing temporal PSV trends for large regions, consideration of the quality of both the geochronological control and the PSV data is very important. This conclusion is especially relevant for modellers who gather published PSV datasets for inclusion in their data-driven geomagnetic field models. Finally, we briefly speculate that a cyclicity seen in inclination data for Fennoscandia for the past 14 ka may be related to cyclicities previously seen in some data-driven Holocene geomagnetic field models, possibly representing an inherent feature of the geodynamo.",

            "abstract": "The 1886 Charleston, SC earthquake (M6.8-7.3) is the largest recorded earthquake to strike the U.S. east of the Appalachian Mountains. It occurred along the U.S. passive margin within an area of extensive Mesozoic rifting and beneath the ~800-m thick, subhorizontal Atlantic Coastal Plain (ACP) strata. The fault(s) that caused the 1886 earthquake remain the subject of debate. We examine reprocessed seismic reflection data in the epicentral area to discern faults cutting the Cretaceous and Cenozoic ACP strata, and relate them to deeper structures revealed by the seismic profiles and filtered aeromagnetic data. Faults are identified on the seismic profiles by sharp vertical displacements of strata, abrupt but small changes in dip, and folding of the ACP strata. Some of these faults dip steeply and locally displace deeper reflectors within the underlying South Georgia rift basin with minor displacement; in places they bound uplifted blocks of ACP strata. These observations and the lack of surface scarps during the 1886 earthquake suggest a component of strike-slip for the Cretaceous and Cenozoic displacements, whereas some modern focal mechanisms show thrust motion. A prominent magnetic anomaly high shows a NE-trending west edge in the epicentral area, and short-wavelength magnetic anomalies show disruptions aligned along NE trends. These latter disruptions appear to be related to the seismically imaged faults that offset ACP strata. One of the faults, previously interpreted by Chapman and Beale (2010), shows folding and perhaps faulting of ACP strata with ~50 m vertical displacement and is aligned along the NW edge of the magnetic high. The vertical uplift is nearly equal through the ACP section with little or no upward decrease across the fault, indicating the motion is primarily Cenozoic. The fault lies near Summerville about 35 km NW of Charleston, where 1886 ground deformation was focused. Another NE-trending fault, crossing beneath the Ashley River ~15 km NW of Charleston, is interpreted based on disruptions of magnetic anomalies to align with the greatest earthquake deformation observed along 3 railroad lines, including lateral offsets of the tracks and NE-trending surface fissures. These observations are consistent with two NE-trending faults rupturing during the 1886 earthquake.",

Organic acid measurements were made with a Chemical Ionization High Resolution Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (HRToF-CIMS) with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO) and acetate (CH3COO-) as the reagent ion. We investigate both individual species and bulk organic acids and partitioning to organic and water phases in the aerosol. Measured partitioning is compared to data from three other instruments that can also quantify gas-particle partitioning with high time resolution: another HRToF-CIMS using iodide (I-) as the reagent ion to ionize acids and other highly oxidized compounds, a Semivolatile Thermal Desorption Aerosol GC/MS (SV-TAG), and a Thermal Desorption Proton Transfer Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (TD-PTRMS The partitioning measurements for three of the instruments are generally consistent, with results in the same range for most species and following similar temporal trends and diurnal cycles. The TD-PTRMS measures on average ½ the partitioning to the particle phase of the acetate CIMS. Both the measurements and the model of partitioning to the organic phase respond quickly to temperature, and the model agrees with the measured partitioning within the error of the measurement for multiple compounds, although many compounds do not match the modeled partitioning, especially at lower m/z. This discrepancy may be due to thermal decomposition of larger molecules into smaller ones when heated.",

            "abstract": "The enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS) scanning imager was flown on the ER-2 during the SEAC4RS field campaign. The imager provides measurements in 38 spectral channels from the visible into the 13µm CO2 absorption bands at approximately 25 m nadir spatial resolution at cirrus altitudes, and with a swath width of about 18 km, provided substantial context and synergy for other ER-2 cirrus observations. The eMAS is an update to the original MAS scanner, having new midwave and IR spectrometers coupled with the previous VNIR/SWIR spectrometers.\nIn addition to the standard MODIS-like cloud retrieval algorithm (MOD06/MYD06 for MODIS Terra/Aqua, respectively) that provides cirrus optical thickness (COT) and effective particle radius (CER) from several channel combinations, three new algorithms were developed to take advantage of unique aspects of eMAS and/or other ER-2 observations. The first uses a combination of two solar reflectance channels within the 1.88 µm water vapor absorption band, each with significantly different single scattering albedo, allowing for simultaneous COT and CER retrievals. The advantage of this algorithm is that the strong water vapor absorption can significantly reduce the sensitivity to lower level clouds and ocean/land surface properties thus better isolating cirrus properties. A second algorithm uses a suite of infrared channels in an optimal estimation algorithm to simultaneously retrieve COT, CER, and cloud-top pressure/temperature. Finally, a window IR algorithm is used to retrieve COT in synergy with the ER-2 Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) cloud top/base boundary measurements. Using a variety of quantifiable error sources, uncertainties for all eMAS retrievals will be shown along with comparisons with CPL COT retrievals.",

            "abstract": "Northern high latitudes are thought to have been especially warm during the late Pliocene (e.g. Dowsett et al., 2013). However, the mechanisms sustaining these warm high latitude conditions are debated, especially because warm high latitudes are not necessarily depending on a stronger AMOC (Zhang et al., 2013). On the global scale, several authors reported CO2 level variability during the Pliocene ranging from 280 ppm to 450 ppm (e.g. Badger et al., 2013), which could be linked with orbital variability. More regionally, an aridification of the Mediterranean region is thought to have increased the Mediterranean outflow during the same period (e.g. Khélifi et al., 2009). These different forcings must have impacted on salinity and temperature profiles in the North Atlantic/Arctic oceans, which are then recorded at the local scale in the proxies derived from sediment cores. In order to carefully interpret these proxies, it is necessary to understand the large scale dynamics of the region during that period and its potential maximum variability with CO2 and orbital changes as well as Mediterranean outflow increase. Using the NorESM-L coupled atmosphere ocean model, which has a refined oceanic grid in the Nordic Seas region, we investigate the roles of extreme CO2and orbital variability on the Atlantic and Arctic oceanic circulation. An additional test to higher salinity in the Mediterranean is carried out. This study is part of a larger project which aims at characterising the state of the Nordic Seas during the Pliocene, and includes multi-proxy reconstructions and sensitivity model studies.\n",

This study focuses on the observed deformation – simultaneous contraction of seven baselines recorded by an electronic distance meter (EDM) network. To determine the cause of this deformation we model the system using Finite Element analysis with COMSOL Multiphysics. Our models incorporate subsurface heterogeneity, real topography and represent the source as a spheroidal cavity. This set up allows the EDM baselines to be modelled in three dimensions and account for the steep relief of the iconic stratovolcano, as opposed to analytical models that are either restricted to two dimensional EDM calculations and/or a flat Earth surface. To further assess the importance of topography, subsurface mechanics, and the 2-or-3D approach, we conduct a sensitivity analysis using both Finite Element and analytical techniques. We solve the Finite Element inverse problem with a least-squares approach, searching for the optimum location (longitude, latitude, depth) and over-pressure of the source to fit the EDM deformation data within its error. This optimization procedure was repeated for each source shape, orientation, size and aspect ratio using a series of nested parameter constraint grids. All source shapes converge on a location beneath the south to south-west of the edifice at a central depth of 0.5 – 2.0 km above sea level (summit at 5897 m). High-eccentricity oblate spheroids generally provide the best-fit to the observed data and may be interpreted as a sill-like intrusion as the cause of the deformation. Finally, additional forward Finite Element models are used to assess the implications of inelastic rheology, failure locations and gravity anomalies associated with the intrusion.",

Over subtropical eastern ocean basins, particularly next to California, Peru, and Southwest Africa, low marine stratocumulus clouds (MSC) help to reduce the amount of solar radiation that reaches the surface by reflecting incident sunlight. The climate feedback associated with these clouds is thought to be positive. This project looks at CMIP5 models and compares them to observational data from CERES and ERA-Interim to try and find observational evidence and model agreement for low, marine stratocumulus cloud feedback. Although current evidence suggests that the low cloud feedback is positive (IPCC, 2014), an analysis of the simulated relationship between July lower tropospheric stability (LTS) and shortwave cloud forcing in MSC regions suggests that this feedback is not due to changes in LTS. \n\nIPCC, 2013: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.

            "abstract": "Coastal wetlands provide many important ecosystem services, which include carbon and nitrogen sequestration and transformations, the provision of habitats, and the reduction of erosion by the vegetation. Coastal wetlands will be affected by projected climate change and sea level rise and may fail to provide such services, prompting a need to understand the environmental controls on marsh and vegetation distribution. Therefore, as part of the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long Term Ecological Research project, an integrated modeling approach is being developed to simulate how changes in salinity and inundation may change marsh ecosystem services, by coupling a hydrodynamic with a soil and a plant model.\nIn coastal marsh ecosystems, porewater salinity strongly determines vegetation distribution and productivity. We will present the development of the soil model, which is based on mass conservation for water and salt and links physical, hydrological, and biological processes that determine porewater salinity, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, salt exchange between surface and subsurface, drainage, groundwater exchange, tidal inundation, and surface runoff, with the lateral exchange controlled by marsh topography.\nThe model is applied to the Duplin River marsh, Sapelo Island, Georgia. Model validation is performed by comparing model-estimated salinities to porewater salinity measurements taken in different vegetation classes and over a range of marsh elevations. Modeled variability in porewater salinities will be presented over spring-neap, seasonal, and annual time scales. To discuss potential impacts of climate change and sea level rise, a sensitivity analysis will be presented that demonstrates the effect precipitation intensity, evapotranspiration, permeability, and marsh elevation have on porewater salinities.",

            "abstract": "Surface elevation measurements derived from Swath Mode processing of CryoSat data are examined to determine their utility for measuring ice sheet grounding line locations. Ice sheet grounding lines are the boundary between floating ice in hydrostatic equilibrium with the ocean, and grounded glacial ice. In reality grounding lines are a transitory feature with a location that can fluctuate on short, sub-daily timescales due to the effect of ocean tides, and long, decadal timescales due to the effect of ice mass loss. Grounding line retreat is a key indicator of change in mass balance and internal instability in marine terminating ice masses therefore it is important to develop new techniques to measure change in this important geophysical parameter. As part of the ESA STSE CryoTop project, Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometer (SARIn) mode CryoSat data was processed in ‘Swath Mode’, which uses the full altimeter waveform to retrieve surface elevation measurements at a fine spatial resolution across the CryoSat ground track. This results in a narrow digital elevation model for each CryoSat ground track with a high density of points relative to traditional pulse limited altimetry. As part of the ESA STSE GLITter project, Swath Mode CryoSat data was differenced from tracks acquired at different times. The resulting surface elevation difference is caused by variation in the ocean tide amplitude which we use here to determine the ice sheet grounding line location. Our CryoSat grounding line location result is inter-compared with a cotemporaneous grounding line location derived from the established technique of differential interferometry (DInSAR).",

In this area, Cretaceous crustal shortening displaced and folded strata from Cambrian to Cretaceous in age. Using geologic map data as a primary input to a 3-D model presents a number of challenges, especially representing fault geometries at depth and maintaining strata thicknesses. The highly variable attitudes measured at the surface are also difficult to represent in a subsurface model because they require extensive extrapolation to depth. To overcome these challenges we EarthVision software, which has tools for model construction with minimal data inputs and uses a minimum tension algorithm to create geologically realistic surfaces. We also constructed two primary cross-sections to constrain strata and fault geometries according to structural principles, and used these to guide construction of fault and horizon surfaces. We then designated horizons with the best control as reference horizons to constrain strata geometries, and built the remaining horizons using isochores to add or subtract from those surfaces. The model shows classic flat-ramp thrust geometries as seen farther southeast in the Wyoming section of the thrust belt. The model also shows uniform southwestward tilting of faults and strata in the north end above younger thrusts, but strong effects from a duplex on a younger thrust fault encountered in the southern well, which rotated the strata and older faults above it.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) houses a suite of satellite-derived GIS data including high spatiotemporal resolution precipitation, air quality, and modeled land surface parameter data. The data are extremely useful to various GIS research and applications at regional, continental, and global scales, as evidenced by the growing GIS user requests to the data. On the other hand, we also found that some GIS users, especially those from the ArcGIS community, having difficulties in obtaining, importing, and using our data, primarily due to the unfamiliarity of the users with our products and GIS software’s lack of capabilities in dealing with the predominately raster form data in various sometimes very complicated formats. In this presentation, we introduce a set of open source ArcGIS data connectors that significantly simplify the access and use of our data in ArcGIS. With the connectors, users do not need to know the data access URLs, the access protocols or syntaxes, and data formats. Nor do they need to browse through a long list of variables that are often embedded into one single science data file and whose names may sometimes be confusing to those not familiar with the file (such as variable CH4_VMR_D for “CH4 Volume mixing ratio from the descending orbit” and variable EVPsfc for “Total Evapotranspiration”). The connectors will expose most GIS-related variables to the users with easy to understand names. User can simply define the spatiotemporal range of their study, select interested parameter(s), and have the needed data be downloaded, imported, and displayed in ArcGIS. The connectors are python text files and there is no installation process. They can be placed at any user directory and be started by simply clicking on it. In the presentation, we’ll also demonstrate how to use the tools to load GES DISC time series air quality data with a few clicks and how such data depict the spatial and temporal patterns of air quality in different parts of the world during the past decade.",

            "abstract": "River temperature, critical for understanding aquatic biological, physical, and chemical processes, is a function of various heat transfer mechanisms that occur between water and its surrounding environment. The influences of these heat fluxes vary over both time and space, creating thermal heterogeneity critical in establishing hot spots and hot moments for solutes. To better understand how climate change may affect this heterogeneity in arctic river temperatures, we developed an arctic specific process based river temperature model that accounts for spatial and temporal variability in lateral inflows as well as atmospheric and bed conduction fluxes. Preliminary calibration results show that dominant heat fluxes vary with time and location within the model domain, but is primarily driven by the highly variable flow regimes common in the arctic. Based on 2 years of observations and a calibrated model for the Kuparuk River, Alaska, we more specifically found surface heat fluxes dominate the spatial temperature responses for lower flows within the lower order portion of the system while lateral inflows dictate the variability in the temporal response. In the higher order portion of the basin, we have found that lateral inflows are important for understanding volumes of water spatially throughout the study reach; however, surface fluxes dominate temperature responses over time.",

ECL evolves through the following sequential stages, culminating in fast isotropic heating of electrons and ions: (i) Electrostatic current-driven instability (CDI) soon after its formation, (ii) current disruption in the central part of the ECL by trapping electrons and generation of anomalous resistivity, (iii) electron tearing instability (ETI) with growth rates larger than that predicted by theories, (iv) the ETI growth rate maximizes at a wave number kw ~ 0.5 where k is the wave number parallel to the ECL magnetic field B and w is its half width, (v) the ECL width and current are modulated by the ETI, (vi) interactions between the induced electric fields of the ETI and the density cavities created by the CDI cause further current disruption and fine-grained modulation of the ECL current associated with highly spiked electric field structures like in double layers and (vii) the spiky electric fields very effectively heat both electrons and ions. The developing ETI generates in-plane currents that support out-of-plane magnetic fields around the X-lines. The ETI and the spiky electrostatic structures are accompanied by fluctuations in the magnetic fields near and above the lower hybrid (ion plasma) frequency, including the whistler frequency range. Fluctuations in the magnetic field are also enhanced above the electron plasma frequency. We will compare our results with satellite observations [1] and laboratory experiments [2].\n[1] F. S.

In this study, the hydrological effects of climate change are modeled over three sequential years using SRM with both typical and recommended (parameter shift) methodology. We predict the impacts of climate change on water resources of the five most productive watersheds tributary to the Rio Grande. These basins collectively supply more than 75% of the total river volume. Surface temperature and precipitation from atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCM) from the coupled model intercomparison project CMIP3 and CMIP5 multi-model data set are downscaled to weather stations used to force the SRM. Period change analysis (1990-2000) vs. (2090-2100) is used to derive temperature and precipitation changes for 55 GCM simulations. However, for each basin we subsample the range of uncertainty characterized by these 55 GCMs into only four extreme mean states representing warmer/wetter, warmer/drier, hotter/wetter, and hotter/drier mean future projections. Results indicate an increase in temperature between 3.0-6.2 °C and an 18% decrease to 26% increase in precipitation. Following parameterization of SRM, the difference between measured and computed volume is 10% and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency is 0.87. Without modifications to the snow runoff coefficient (Cs), results range from a reduction in total volume of 21% to an increase in total volume of 4% ((hotter/drier (-21%); warmer/drier (-18%); hotter/wetter (3%); warmer/wetter (4%)). Despite an increase in precipitation in the hotter/wetter scenario, total volume decreased in three of five simulated basins. Modifications to Cs resulted in a 0 to 16% difference in simulated annual volume. Results indicate future application of SRM should include a parameter shift representing the changed climate.",

Bulk and size fractionated aerosol samples were collected over seventeen 72-hour periods on cellulose filters using Tisch high volume samplers. The bulk samples were collected on 47mm W41 filters and the size fractionated samples on slotted impactor filters. The Sierra-style slotted cascade impactor cutoffs are >7µm, >3µm, >1.5µm, >0.95µm and >0.49µm. Particles <0.49µm were collected on a 20 x 25cm W41 backing filter. The soluble bulk aerosol fraction was extracted aboard ship by passing 100mL of ultrapure water (>18.2MΩ cm) through the sample filter under vacuum. The extract was acidified for storage and later analyzed by ICP-MS to quantify the soluble aerosol fraction. Replicate bulk filters collected simultaneously were digested and analyzed by ICP-MS to provide the total aerosol concentration. Our data will provide insight into the nature of aerosols transported across the South Pacific and describe their potential as a source for trace elements to the surface ocean. The results will aid in the interpretation of surface water trace element concentrations. We will also characterize the alteration of aerosol fractional solubility with transport in the atmosphere as well as investigate the relationship between aerosol concentration and aerosol fractional solubility. All of our observations will be discussed in the context of the larger global dataset of aerosol solubility data and compared with assumptions currently applied in global models of atmospheric deposition.",

            "abstract": "Tsunami earthquakes generate a disproportionally large tsunami for their seismic moment. For a tsunami warning center, they are especially difficult to detect in real-time since magnitude alone is insufficient to issue an alert. Recently, several methods have been developed to identify tsunami earthquakes, including: various energy magnitude estimates (e.g., MED, Lomax et al, 2007), the theta discriminant (Newman & Okal, 1998), RTerg (Newman & Convers, 2010), TACER (Convers & Newman, 2013), mHFER (Hara, 2007), and rupture duration, TR (Lomax & Michelini, 2009 & 2010).\nEach method makes particular assumptions about the rupture process and subsequent tsunami generation that lead to the use of different algorithms to estimate the radiated seismic energy and/or rupture duration. However, the various methods are essentially comparing these estimates to the long period seismic moment, in order to identify the unusually long durations, slow ruptures, and small stress drops that characterize tsunami earthquakes.\nWe test the tsunami earthquake discriminants on a dataset of subduction zone earthquakes containing several tsunami earthquakes with the goal of determining which methods (or combination of methods) are well-suited to real-time implementation at the U.S. tsunami warning centers in Hawaii and Alaska. Of particular interest is the ability of each method to correctly identify known tsunami earthquakes with a minimum of false positives and with a minimum of apriori assumptions about any individual event that might bias a real-time detection system.",

            "abstract": "Ensuring safe and permanent storage of sequestered CO2in naturally fractured geological media is vital for the success of geologic storage projects. Critical needs exist to develop advanced techniques to characterize and model fluid transport in naturally fractured reservoirs and seals.\nWe have developed a scale-independent 3-D stochastic fracture permeability characterization workflow that employs multiple discrete fracture network (DFN) realizations. The workflow deploys a multidirectional flux-based upwind weighting scheme that is capable of modeling multiphase flow in highly heterogeneous fractured media. The techniques employed herein show great promise for increasing the accuracy of capacity determinations and the prediction of pressure footprints associated with injected CO2 plumes.\nThe proposed workflow has been conducted in a simulation study of flow transport and risk assessment of CO2 injection into a deep fractured saline formation using geological parameters from Knox Group carbonate and Red Mountain shale rocks in central Alabama. A 3-D fracture permeability map was generated from multiple realizations of DFN models. A multiphase flow model composed of supercritical CO2 and saline water was applied to simulate CO2 plume evolution during and after injection. Injection simulation reveals significant permeability anisotropy that favors development of northeast-elongate CO2 plumes. The spreading front of the CO2 plume shows strong viscous fingering effects. Post-injection simulation indicates significant lateral spreading of CO2 near the top of the fractured formations because of the buoyancy of injectate in rock matrix and strata-bound vertical fractures. Risk assessment shows that although pressure drops faster in the fractured formations than in those lacking fractures, lateral movement of CO2 along natural fractures necessitates that the injectate be confined by widespread seals with high integrity.",

Measurements are made through four 10 nm wide filters in the visible and near infrared. The radiometer has the dynamic range and signal to noise to measure both the sun and sky radiance in the same scans. An onboard processor can compensate for a tilting platform in real time as the telescope rotates. With enough altitude range the radiometer can be calibrated from the top of the profile.

We have been quantifying the emission rates for both CO2 and CH4 from the city of Indianapolis, using an aircraft-based mass balance approach, since 2008. Here we discuss a summary of measurements to date, focusing on improvements to the mass balance experiment design, and recent efforts to improve and assess the method precision. To determine the method precision, we designed a new flight experiment based on multiple-downwind transects. We fly at two 5km-apart downwind distances from the city, each distance comprising multiple transects at different altitudes spanning the depth of the boundary layer, and then calculate the difference in the two flux determinations as a measure of precision. We will also discuss the results of multiple experiments for assumed constant total emission rate conditions, as a means to obtain an improved standard deviation of the mean determination. Finally, we will discuss efforts to conduct a rigorous error propagation for the aircraft mass balance experiment, and compare the results to the observed experimental precision. Our goal is to dramatically improve the method overall uncertainty from the previous estimate of 50%.",

            "abstract": "The varying distribution of snow depth in avalanche starting zones exerts a strong influence on avalanche potential and character. Extreme depth changes over short distances are common, especially in wind-affected, above-treeline environments. Snow depth also affects the ease of avalanche triggering. Experience shows that avalanche reduction efforts are often more successful when targeting shallow trigger point areas near deeper slabs with explosives or ski cutting. Our pilot study explores the use of high resolution snow depth and depth change maps from differential LiDAR scans to quantify loading patterns for use in both pre-control planning and in post-control assessment.\nWe present results from our initial work at the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area in Colorado, USA. A-Basin has a large number avalanche starting zones above treeline at elevations up to 4,000 m. The three study areas represent a range of institutional avalanche management history – the East Wall has been operated since 1970, Montezuma Bowl since 2008, and the Steep Gullies are under study for area expansion. Summer mapping produced a zero depth surface. Mapping multiple times during the snow season allowed us to produce time series maps of snow depth and snow depth change at high resolution to explore depth and slab thickness variations due to wind redistribution. We conducted surveys before and after loading events and control work, allowing the exploration of loading patterns, slab thickness, shot and ski cut locations, bed surfaces, entrainment, and avalanche characteristics. We also evaluate the state of terrestrial laser scanning for use in operational settings.",

            "abstract": "The formation of new aerosol particles from precursor vapours (nucleation) is an important source of global cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Simulations using global aerosol models suggest that 40-70% of global CCN originate from nucleation. However, because of the challenges inherent in measuring particles with diameters of only a few nanometres, and in maintaining controlled, well-defined conditions throughout experiments, the exact mechanisms which determine nucleation rates throughout the atmosphere are not yet fully understood.\nThe CERN CLOUD experiment uses state-of-the-art equipment to measure nucleation rates under conditions which cover the full atmospheric range. We have used this unique set of measurements to formulate a semi-empirical parametrisation of inorganic nucleation, which we have then implemented in the global aerosol microphysics model GLOMAP. The parametrisation depends on temperature, and on the concentrations of sulphuric acid, ammonia, and ions.\nFigure 1 shows the change over a solar cycle in cloud condensation nuclei at 0.2% supersaturation at one kilometre altitude, equivalent to low cloud level. The change in the average value over the whole globe is small, just -0.46 %. We will also present the changes due to a reduction of 80% in ammonia concentrations (roughly equivalent to pre-industrial conditions), and a uniform global temperature increase of 2.2 K (which is a realistic estimate of the mean increase in global temperatures in the coming decades).",

            "abstract": "Winter seasonality with extensive frost, snow cover and low incoming radiation characterise large areas at mid- and high latitudes, especially in mountain ranges and in the arctic. Given these adverse conditions, it is often assumed that ecosystem processes, such as plant photosynthesis, nutrient uptake and microbial activities, cease, or at best diminish to marginal rates compared to summer. However, snow is a good thermal insulator and a sufficiently thick snow cover might enable temperature-limited processes to continue in winter, especially belowground. Changes in winter precipitation may alter these conditions, yet, relative to the growing season, winter ecosystem processes remain poorly understood.\nWe performed a snow-removal experiment on an ombrotrophic bog in the Swiss Jura mountains (1036 m.a.s.l.) to compare above- and belowground ecosystem processes with and without snow cover during mid- and late-winter (February and April) with the subsequent spring (June) and summer (July). The presence of 1m snow in mid-winter and 0.4m snow in late-winter strongly reduced the photosynthetic capacity (Amax) of Eriophorum vaginatum as well as the total microbial biomass compared to spring and summer values. Amax of Sphagnum magellanicum and uptake of 15N-labelled ammonium-nitrate by vascular plants were, however, almost as high or higher in mid- and late-winter as in summer.\nSnow removal increased the number of freeze-thaw cycles in mid-winter but also increased the minimum soil temperature in late-winter before ambient snow-melt. This strongly reduced all measured ecosystem processes in mid-winter compared to control and to spring and summer values. Plant 15N-uptake, Amax of Eriophorum and total microbial biomass returned to, or exceeded, control values soon before or after snowmelt. However, Sphagnum Amax and its length growth, as well as the structure of the microbial community showed clear carry-over effects of the reduced winter snow cover into next summer.\nAltogether, our data indicate that peatlands are active in winter. However, a continuous snow cover is crucial for ecosystem processes both in winter and in the subsequent summer and a reduction of snow thickness or duration due to climate change may impact on peatland ecosystem functioning at various levels.",

            "abstract": "Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), and methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) are strong ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). Their production and consumption have been controlled by the Montreal Protocol since 1989 in developed countries and 1999 in developing countries. Although global atmospheric burdens of some of these gases have been declining for the last decade, their emissions continue due to releases from their existing reservoirs. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are transitional substitutes for CFCs; because they also deplete stratospheric ozone, they are also controlled by the Montreal Protocol. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are replacements for CFCs and HCFCs. Due to incomplete understanding of the reservoir size and emission rates for ODSs and their substitutes, uncertainty of their national emissions from inventory-based “bottom-up” estimates is undetermined.\nIn this study, we use our atmospheric observations from multiple surface sites and aircraft profiles across the continental US from 2008 to 2012, along with data from remote sites over the Pacific basin, to derive national emissions of ODSs and their substitutes using inverse modeling. The performance of our modeling framework and the sensitivity of derived emissions to prior fluxes and model-data mismatch errors were investigated by conducting a suite of synthetic-data experiments. Sensitivity of derived fluxes to boundary values and transport was explored in real-data inversions. Our preliminary results suggest that (1) US emissions of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b are currently declining at faster rates than those reported by US EPA; (2) our emission estimate of HFC-134a, the most abundant HFCs in the atmosphere, is consistent with the estimate reported by US EPA, whereas our estimates for some currently minor HFCs (i.e. HFC-125 and HFC-143a) show no significant emission trends during 2008 - 2012, which is inconsistent with a 70 – 120 % increase over this period reported by US EPA; and (3) gases that are mainly used in refrigeration and air conditioning (i.e. HCFC-22 and HFC-134a) have significant seasonal variation in their national emissions whereas emissions of gases whose main applications are foam blowing and aerosol sprays (i.e. HCFC-142b, HFC-152a) do not vary seasonally.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the prevailing notion of Precambrian continental lithosphere as a thick boundary layer (200-300 km), defined by a depleted composition and a steady-state conductively cooled temperature structure, has been challenged by several lines of seismological evidence. One, profiles of shear velocity with depth beneath cratons exhibit lower wave speed at shallow depths and higher wave speed at greater depths than can be explained by temperature alone. These profiles are also characterized by positive or flat velocity gradients with depth and anomalously high attenuation in the uppermost mantle, both of which are difficult to reconcile with the low temperatures and large thermal gradient expected with a thermal boundary layer. Two, body-wave receiver-function studies have detected a mid-lithospheric discontinuity that requires a large and abrupt velocity decrease with depth in cratonic regions that cannot be achieved by thermal gradients alone. Here, we used forward-modeling to identify the suite of shear-velocity profiles that are consistent with phase-velocity observations made for Rayleigh waves that primarily traversed cratons in North America, South America, Africa, and Australia. We considered two approaches; with the first, depth profiles of shear velocity were predicted from thermal models of the cratonic upper mantle that correspond to a range of assumed values of mantle potential temperature, surface heat flow, and radiogenic heat production in the crust and upper mantle. With the second approach, depth profiles of shear velocity were randomly generated. In both cases, Rayleigh wave phase velocity was calculated from the Earth models and compared to the observed values. We show that it is very difficult to match the observations with an Earth model containing a low-velocity zone in the upper mantle; instead, the best-fit models contain a flat or positive velocity gradient with depth. We explore the implications of this result for the thermal and compositional properties and long-term stability of the cratonic upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "The River Wharfe, UK, is an aggrading gravel bed river, with frequent gravel bars. Management of the river system requires information about the rate and processes of change occurring to the gravel storage within the bars. From a scientific perspective, there are questions about how bar morphology changes as bars are deposited and eroded in this single thread system, about the extent to which flow conditions drive morphological change, and about the extent to which morphological changes can be predicted.\nMorphological changes of ten bars along the River Wharfe are reported between early 2012 and late 2014. The bars span a 6 km long length of river, downstream of the point where the river emerges from a confined valley. The bars range in length from 25 to 135 m. Bar grain size decreases downstream as a consequence of strong downstream fining. Bar morphology was surveyed using Terrestrial Laser Scanning at four time periods between early 2012 and late 2014. Each bar was surveyed from at least two scan positions, and georeferenced using a network of permanent survey markers. After initial processing to register the point clouds and remove vegetation, the change detection algorithm M3C2 was used to identify areas of significant volumetric change.\nThe measured morphological changes between 2012 and 2013 indicate predominantly depositional changes on the bars, with an overall downstream decrease in the volume of change. However, there are local variations superimposed on this pattern. The mechanisms by which the bars change vary between bars, and include downstream progression of an avalanche face and gravel sheet infilling of local hollows. The measured changes are compared to flow data over the study period to identify the extent to which they are driven by flow.",

            "abstract": "China is a major emitter of harmful air pollutants, including the short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) and their precursors. Implementation of pollution control technologies provides a mechanism for simultaneously protecting human and ecosystem health and achieving near-term climate co-benefits; however, predicting the outcomes of technical and policy interventions is challenging because the SLCPs participate in both climate warming and cooling and share many common emission sources. Here, we present the results of a combined regional integrated assessment and global climate modeling study aimed at quantifying the near-term climate and air quality co-benefits of selective control of Chinese air pollution emissions. Results from IIASA’s Greenhouse Gas – Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) integrated assessment model indicate that methane emission reductions make up > 75% of possible CO2-equivalent emission reductions of the SLCPs and their precursors in China in 2030. A multi-pollutant emission reduction scenario incorporating the 2030 Chinese pollution control measures with the highest potential for future climate impact is applied to the NASA ModelE2 – Yale Interactive Terrestrial Biosphere (NASA ModelE2-YIBs) global carbon – chemistry – climate model to assess the regional and long-range impacts of Chinese SLCP mitigation measures. Using model simulations that incorporate dynamic methane emissions and photosynthesis-dependent isoprene emissions, we quantify the impacts of Chinese reductions of the short-lived air pollutants on radiative forcing and on surface ozone and particulate air pollution. Present-day modeled methane mole fractions are evaluated against SCIAMACHY methane columns and NOAA ESRL/GMD surface flask measurements.",

            "abstract": "Event discrimination research has largely focused on regional distances over the last couple of decades. Most regional discriminants have not been thoroughly tested at local distances, and a recent investigation of P/S ratios from the Source Physics Experiment (SPE) found that they were less effective locally. As discrimination thresholds are reduced, local methods will need to be validated and the physical bases for their performance will need to be understood. We are assessing new and existing methods of source discrimination at 10 to 200 km distance.\nWe use data from a temporary array deployed around the Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming and from nearby US Array stations. Small magnitude local earthquakes, coal mine explosions, and controlled borehole shots were recorded at over 200 broadband and short-period seismometers spaced at 5-35 km intervals across the tectonically complex area.\nWe assess the local discrimination performance of the P/S amplitude ratio, the presence of the fundamental Rayleigh wave Rg, and the signature of scattered Rg in the coda. P/S amplitudes are used because earthquakes typically have higher S-wave energy relative to P than shallow explosions, but the separation of populations is not always effective at local distances. Site effects have a significant impact that may need to be accounted for, along with propagation effects. Specifically, relative P and S site amplifications at basin and mountain stations vary in such a way that they limit separation of the event populations.\nThe Rg phase is only excited by near-surface events, so its presence indicates the likelihood of a man-made source since most earthquakes occur at too great a depth to excite Rg. We implement two methods for detecting Rg: one that uses the cross-correlation of the Hilbert transformed vertical and the radial seismograms, and one that scans a time-frequency representation for the signature of scattered Rg in the coda. These methods are effective in low signal-to-noise seismograms.",

            "abstract": "The effects of aerosol particles on cloud microphysical properties, cloud cover, precipitation, and regional climate are significant. The Amazon region is particularly susceptible to changes in number-diameter distributions of the atmospheric particle population because of the low background concentrations and high water vapor levels, indicating a regime of cloud properties that is highly sensitive to aerosol microphysics. A particle-limited regime means that for modest to vigorous updrafts the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) is dominated by CCN number instead of updraft velocity. This natural regime, different from most other continental areas worldwide, is expected to be disrupted by the interaction of Manaus urban plume with the natural aerosol population. Studying the effects of this interaction on the cloud and aerosol life cycle is the main objective of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon) campaign taking place around Manaus-Brazil from January 2014 to December 2015. In this paper we compare the particle hygroscopicity calculated from measurements of size-resolved cloud condensation nuclei performed at three ground sites during the first and second intensive operational periods. Site T3 is about 70km downwind from Manaus experiencing urban polluted and background conditions; site T2 is just across the Negro river from Manaus and operated only for the second IOP; and T0, at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO), is a pristine site about 200km upwind from Manaus. Our results indicate a lower hygroscopicity under polluted conditions, with mean value around 0.14 to 0.16, than under clean conditions, with a mean value around 0.2 to 0.3. At the clean site, it was possible to identify peaks of large sea salt particles with organic coating, while small particles seems to be pure organic. The activation fraction and hygroscopicity will be compared and discussed as a function of particle size.",

            "abstract": "The vertical transport of heat and constituent by gravity waves and tides plays a fundamental role in establishing the thermal and constituent structures of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), but has not been thoroughly investigated by observations. In particular, direct measurements of vertical heat flux and metal constituent flux caused by dissipating waves are extremely rare, which demand precise measurements with high spatial and temporal resolutions over a long period. Such requirements are necessary to overcome various uncertainties to reveal the small quantities of the heat and constituent fluxes induced by dissipating waves. So far such direct observations have only been reported for vertical heat and Na fluxes using a Na Doppler lidar at Starfire Optical Range (SOR) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Furthermore, estimate of eddy heat and constituent fluxes from the turbulent mixing generated by breaking waves is even more challenging due to the even smaller temporal and spatial scales of the eddy. Consequently, the associated coefficients of thermal (kH) and constituent (kzz) diffusion have not been well characterized and remain as large uncertainties in models. We attempt to address these issues with direct measurements by a Na Doppler lidar with exceptional high-resolution measurement capabilities.\nSince summer 2010, we have been operating a Na Doppler lidar at Boulder, Colorado. The efficiency of the lidar has been greatly improved in summer of 2011 and achieved generally over 1000 counts of Na signal per lidar pulse in winter. In 2013, we made extensive Na lidar observations in 98 nights. These data covering each month of a full year will be used to characterize the seasonal variations of heat and Na fluxes and to be compared with the pioneering observations at SOR. In November 2013, we further upgraded the lidar with two new frequency shifters and a new data acquisition scheme, which are optimized for estimating eddy fluxes and reducing the measurement bias. Since then, we have been making observations in order to directly measure the eddy heat and Na fluxes for the first time. Such lidar observations at Boulder will certainly help advance the understanding on the vertical transport in the MLT region and provide crucial observational references to the models.",

            "abstract": "The onset and distribution of melting and serpentinisation during rifting determine the continent-ocean transition width and composition and have been shown to depend on extension velocity. Conductive cooling during slow rifting favors serpentinisation and inhibits melting (Perez-Gussinye et al., 2006). Here we use numerical modeling to show that, additionally, lower crustal rheology, which also controls margin symmetry and width (Brune et al. 2014), strongly influences the onset and distribution of melting and serpentinisation. We find that strong lower crust rheologies effectively couple deformation in upper crust and mantle and lead to rapid crustal break-up through crust-cutting faults (see Brune et al., 2014), allowing serpentinisation to start relatively early and producing narrow, symmetric margins. Coupling of lithospheric layers leads to rapid asthenospheric uplift and the onset of melting at a relatively early stage during extension. For slow velocities, serpentinisation starts before melting, and the little magma produced probably ponds under the serpentinite layer exhumed after crustal break-up, generating a wide continent-ocean transition. For the same extension velocities, relatively weak lower crust shows a long initial phase of distributed faulting, with moderate lithospheric thinning, followed by a long phase of sequential, oceanward younging faults, producing wider, asymmetric margins. Serpentinisation is insignificant because lower crustal flow towards the tip of the active fault inhibits the formation of crust cutting faults. Asthenospheric upwelling is less pronounced, and the onset and amount of melting is delayed with respect to the stronger lower crust case. When crustal break-up occurs magma rises to form oceanic crust and hence a narrow continent-ocean transition. Along Brazil and Africa the margin’s symmetry, width and continent-ocean transition type change as the onshore terranes in which they developed go from cratons to mobile belts. We explore how this variability, through its influence in lower crust rheology, affects the 3D architecture of this margin.",

            "abstract": "The history of oxygen and the fluxes and feedbacks that lead to its evolution through time remain poorly constrained. It is not clear whether oxygen has had discrete steady state levels at different times in Earth’s history, or whether oxygen evolution is more progressive, with trigger points that lead to discrete changes in markers such as mass independent sulfur isotopes. Whatever this history may have been, ocean ridges play an important and poorly recognized part in the overall mass balance of oxidants and reductants that contribute to electron mass balance and the oxygen budget. One example is the current steady state O2 in the atmosphere. The carbon isotope data suggest that the fraction of carbon has increased in the Phanerozoic, and CO2 outgassing followed by organic matter burial should continually supply more O2 to the surface reservoirs. Why is O2 not then increasing? A traditional answer to this question would relate to variations in the fraction of burial of organic matter, but this fraction appears to have been relatively high throughout the Phanerozoic. Furthermore, subduction of carbon in the 1/5 organic/carbonate proportions would contribute further to an increasingly oxidized surface. What is needed is a flux of oxidized material out of the system. One solution would be a modern oxidized flux to the mantle. The current outgassing flux of CO2 is ~3.4*1012 moles per year. If 20% of that becomes stored organic carbon, that is a flux of .68*1012 moles per year of reduced carbon. The current flux of oxidized iron in subducting ocean crust is ~2*1012 moles per year of O2 equivalents, based on the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios in old ocean crust compared to fresh basalts at the ridge axis. This flux more than accounts for the incremental oxidizing power produced by modern life. It also suggests a possible feedback through oxygenation of the ocean. A reduced deep ocean would inhibit oxidation of ocean crust, in which case there would be no subduction flux of oxidized material, and oxygen could rise. Once the ocean becomes fully oxidized, a substantial subduction flux operates as a negative feedback. Plate tectonic geochemical cycles may have played a very significant role in the oxygen balance in both the ancient and modern Earth.",

            "abstract": "The hazard of blowing dust to highway safety represents one of the significant impacts of aeolian processes on human welfare. In the Southern Plains of the US, dust related chain-reaction traffic accidents occurred every year, however, no known studies have specifically investigated this issue in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The lack of this critical information hinders highway authorities to make informed and timely management decisions when wind events strike. Projected global changes, including changes in climate, land use, and land cover, will likely bring more frequent and extreme dust emissions to the southwestern US, including a majority of the Southern Plains, posing a serious threat to transportation safety in this region in the coming decades. In this study, we use remotely sensed and in situ measurements of land cover, soil, and vegetation data to quantitatively assess the spatial and temporal patterns of wind erosion hot spots that contribute blowing dust to the highways of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. We focus on interstate highways where investment in surveillance and warning devices is greatest, and where high traffic volumes and speeds make the threat of blowing dust most hazardous. Our preliminary investigation in west Texas indicated that a majority of the sources that contribute dust to the highways are located on sandy surface within a few kilometers of the highways and more than half of them are from cultivated cropland.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture comprises about 80 percent of the total water consumption in the US. Under conditions of water shortage and fully committed water rights, market-based water allocations could be promising instruments for agricultural water redistribution from marginally profitable areas to more profitable ones.\nPrevious studies on water market have mainly focused on theoretical or statistical analysis. However, how water users’ heterogeneous physical attributes and decision rules about water use and water right trading will affect water market efficiency has been less addressed. In this study, we developed an agent-based model to evaluate the benefits of an agricultural water market in the Guadalupe River Basin during drought events. Agricultural agents with different attributes (i.e., soil type for crops, annual water diversion permit and precipitation) are defined to simulate the dynamic feedback between water availability, irrigation demand and water trading activity. Diversified crop irrigation rules and water bidding rules are tested in terms of crop yield, agricultural profit, and water-use efficiency.\nThe model was coupled with a real-time hydrologic model and run under different water scarcity scenarios. Preliminary results indicate that an agricultural water market is capable of increasing crop yield, agricultural profit, and water-use efficiency. This capability is more significant under moderate drought scenarios than in mild and severe drought scenarios. The water market mechanism also increases agricultural resilience to climate uncertainty by reducing crop yield variance in drought events. The challenges of implementing an agricultural water market under climate uncertainty are also discussed.",

Ground based measurement sites are of great value in the validation process, however there are only a few stations in tropical latitudes. We present measurements of solar-absorption infrared spectra recorded on two locations over Central Mexico: the High-Altitude Station Altzomoni (19.12 N, 98.65 W), located in the Izta-Popo National Park outside of Mexico City; and the UNAM's Atmospheric Observatory (19.32 N, 99.17 W) in Mexico City. These measurements were performed using a high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrometer FTIR (Bruker, HR 120/5) at Altzomoni and a moderate resolution FTIR (Bruker, Vertex 80) within the city. In this work, we present the first results for total vertical columns of CO2 derived from near-infrared spectra recorded at both locations using the retrieval code PROFFIT. We present the seasonal cycle and variability from the measurements, as well as the full diagnostics of the retrieval in order assess its quality and discuss the differences of both instruments and locations (altitudes, urban vs remote).

            "abstract": "It has been a long-time goal of palynologists to obtain additionally palaeoenvironmental information by the study of Quaternary non-pollen-palynomorphs (NPPs) in pollen slides. As a group of NPPs, subfossil remains of green algae of the genus Pediastrum (fam. Hydrodictyaceae) are frequently found in lake sediments and withstand the palynological standard preparation methods. Determination of Pediastrum taxa to subspecies level is relatively easy with a standard light microscope. Very few studies, however, have used them as palaeolimnological indicators and the knowledge on recent distribution and ecology of many taxa is limited. Introducing new data from Northwestern Europe and the Tibetan Plateau, we show that analysis of subfossil Pediastrum assemblages can reveal valuable information on limnological and climate parameters. Shifts in taxonomic composition of Pediastrum assemblages from lake sediments in northern Germany are shown to strongly reflect the Northern Atlantic Late Glacial climate oscillations. In contrast to previous studies that recognized trophic state as the main driver of change in Pediastrum species composition, we identify climate shifts and related factors as the major drivers of community change. Water depth and trophic state probably acted as secondary factors only. Ongoing research compares the composition of Pediastrum assemblages in surface sediments of Tibetan lakes to environmental variables. While Pediastrum algae are shown to be a part of phytoplankton communities in freshwater to mesosaline lakes, shifts in species composition along the salinity gradient indicate the possible use of the algae group as palaeobioindicator for past humidity changes on the Tibetan Plateau. Additionally, investigations on the relation between water depth and the Pediastrum species composition in lake Taro Co (4575 m asl.) are presented. Our results suggest this algae group has great potential for enabling environmental inferences.",

            "abstract": "The GOCE gravity field is globally homogeneous at the resolution of about 50km or better allowing for the first time to analyze tectonic structures on the continental scale. Geologic correlation studies propose to continue the tectonic lineaments across continents to the pre-breakup position. Tectonic events that induce density changes, as metamorphic events and magmatic events, should then show up in the gravity field. Applying geodynamic plate reconstructions to the GOCE gravity field places today’s observed field at the pre-breakup position (Braitenberg, 2014). The same reconstruction can be applied to the seismic velocity models, to allow a joint gravity-velocity analysis. The geophysical fields bear information to control the likeliness of the hypothesized continuation of lineations. Total absence of a signal, makes the cross-continental continuation of the lineament unprobable, as continental-wide lineaments are controlled by rheologic and compositional differences of crust and upper mantle. Special attention is given to Greenstone belts, which are associated to a class of important mineralizations. The outcrops are limited in extent, but are associated with a much broader gravity signature, which cannot be explained by the outcropping masses alone. The gravity requires a mass source residing at lower crustal level, giving evidence of the mantle-crust melting processes influencing the tectonic characteristic at surface. The study is carried out over the African and South American continents.\n",

            "abstract": "During the past 20 years, altimetric satellites have revealed the turbulent ocean dynamics at the mesoscale. Additionally, high resolution sensors of tracers such as the Sea Surface Temperature or the Ocean Color reveal even smaller structures at the submesoscale, which are not detected by altimetry. Therefore, the two types of complementary observations are expected to refine the estimation of the ocean circulation.\nThe goal of this study is to explore the feasibility of inverting tracer information to possibly control ocean dynamics emerging from altimeter data analysis. To do so, we choose an image data assimilation strategy in which a cost-function is built that aims at minimizing the misfits between some image of submesoscale flow structure and tracer images. In the present work, we have explored the extent to which the Finite-Size Lyapunov Exponents (FSLE) can be considered as a proxy characterizing the submesoscale flow structure.\nA prerequisite to the study is the investigation of the sensitivity of FSLE horizontal patterns to velocity errors. Indeed, the misfit between a FSLE derived from a velocity with errors, and the FSLE derived from an error free velocity is successfully minimized. The next step is the inversion of sub-mesoscale tracer information to correct a mesoscale altimetric field using real observation (from AVISO for the velocity and from MODIS sensor for the tracer). The ocean dynamical variable to be corrected is the mesoscale altimetric velocity field using a high resolution tracer image. The strategy is similar to the one used to invert FSLE. The cost function measures the misfit between the FSLE derived from the altimetric velocity and the high resolution tracer image. Then, the corrected velocity field is compared with along track altimetric data to confirm the improvement of the estimation of the dynamics. Several test cases have been studied and demonstrating the success of the inversion of sub-mesoscale tracer information to correct a mesoscale altimetric velocity field.\nThese results show the feasibility of assimilating tracer submesoscales into ocean models for the control of mesoscale dynamics and larger scales as deduced from altimetry and therefore the benefit of the joint use of tracer image and altimetric data for the control of ocean circulations.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost represents an impermeable barrier to moisture, resulting in a saturated or near-saturated surface layer during the warm season in many continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones. These surface conditions could lead to enhanced convection and precipitation during the warm season, and significant local recycling of moisture. In areas underlain by sporadic or isolated permafrost, or in seasonally frozen areas, the moisture can drain away more readily, resulting in much drier soil conditions. As climate change causes frozen ground degradation, this will thus also alter the patterns of atmospheric convection, moisture recycling, and the hydrologic cycle in high-latitude land areas. In this study, we analyze evaporative fraction (EF) as a proxy for evapotranspiration, and precipitation from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-land) reanalysis dataset. We focus on 1979-2012 and document patterns and changes in EF over the Eurasian high latitudes. We find strong, positive April EF trends over the study period, particularly in the Lena River Basin, 80% of which is underlain by continuous permafrost. In fact, these significant positive trends in spring EF are strongest over continuous permafrost across the Eurasian high latitudes, but negative for sporadic and isolated permafrost. In addition, we find a strong, statistically significant relationship between EF anomalies and the probability of subsequent precipitation over the Lena Basin during April. This association therefore suggests a potential land-atmosphere coupling between frozen ground and precipitation. As the permafrost and seasonally frozen ground distribution changes in the future, this will likely have repercussions for the Arctic hydrologic cycle.",

The graduate fellows prepare lessons for the students incorporating different facets of their research. The lessons vary in degree of difficulty according to the content covered in the classroom and the grade level of the students. The focus of each lesson is directed toward the individual research of the STEM graduate student using inquiry based designed activities. Scientific instruments that are used in STEM research (e.g. SkyMaster weather stations, GPS, portable SEM, Inclinometer, Soil Moisture Probe, Google Earth, ArcGIS Explorer) are also utilized by K-12 students in the activities developed by the graduate students. Creativity and problem solving skills are sparked by curiosity which leads to the discovery of new information. The graduate students work to enhance their ability to effectively communicate their research to members of society through the creation of research linked classroom activities, enabling the 7-12th grade students to connect basic processes used in STEM research with the required state and national science standards. The graduate students become respected role models for the high school students because of their STEM knowledge base and their passion for their research. Sharing enthusiasm for their chosen STEM field, as well as the application techniques to discover new ideas, the graduate students stimulate the interests of the classroom students and model authentic science process skills while highlighting the relevance of STEM research to K-12 student lives. The measurement of the student attitudes about science is gathered from pre and post interest surveys for the past four years. This partnership allows students, teachers, graduate students, and the public to participate in interactive real-world science scenarios. Success of this partnership is measured by the enhancement of student interest in STEM sciences and learning skills for each child.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have been increasing since the industrial revolution, leading to the warming of the Earth through an increase in downwelling infrared radiation. Warming of the atmosphere increases its water holding capacity and could intensify the hydrological cycle. Several methods have been developed for evaluating changes in climatic variables. On the other hand, numerous indices have been developed for monitoring changes in climatic variables. Most change detection methods, indices, and trend studies focus on changes in one variable at the time. However, hydrologic variables are dependent, and a change in one variable can alter extreme and non-extreme values of other variables. In this study, a new approach for modeling multivariate extreme values through a conditional distribution framework using the empirical Bayes approach is proposed. This study highlights the value of empirical Bayes conditional extreme value analysis as a tool for simulating and assessing conditional extremes (e.g., changes in the distribution of precipitation conditioned on extreme temperature). The model has been applied to several locations across the world. This presentation will summarize the findings on changes in the hydrological cycle over the United States and Australia.",

Such damages to water quality can negatively affect recreation, property values, and human health. While the relationship between agricultural production and nitrogen export is well-studied, the economic costs of nitrogen loss are less well understood. We present a comprehensive assessment of the full costs associated with nitrate pollution from agricultural sources in Minnesota. We found that the most significant economic costs are likely from groundwater contamination of nitrate in public and private wells. For example, we estimated that loss of grassland to corn cultivation in Minnesota between 2007 and 2012 is expected to increase the future number of domestic wells exceeding nitrate concentrations of 10 ppm by 31%. This increase in contamination is estimated to cost well owners $1.4 to 19 million (present values over a 20 year horizon) through remediation, avoidance, and replacement. Our findings demonstrate linkages between changes in land use, water quality, and human well-being.",

            "abstract": "Each year during winter season (December-January), dense fog engulfs the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) in southern Asia, for more than a month, disrupting daily life of millions of people inhabiting the IGP. The widespread nature of the fog is frequently visible in satellite imagery, extending over a stretch of ~1500 km; that covers parts of Pakistan, northern India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Both, haze and fog are a tightly-coupled system over the IGP, during winter months, and have been a major environmental/climatic issue since the past several decades. Trends in poor visibility suggest a significant increase in worsening air quality and foggy days over the IGP. The persistent and widespread nature of the winter haze and fog is strongly influenced by the regional meteorology during wintertime, i.e. a stable boundary layer, low temperatures, high relative humidity and light winds. The valley-type topography of the IGP, adjacent to the towering Himalaya, and high concentrations of pollution aerosols, further favors the persistence of hazy/foggy conditions. A satellite-based observational portrayal will be presented, using various cloud, aerosol and radiation datasets, to characterize the widespread nature of winter haze and fog, based on a multi-sensor assessment from MODIS, CERES, AVHRR and CALIPSO datasets. More specifically, based on these observations, we will present results on: long-term trends/variability of winter haze and fog, vertical characterization of aerosol/fog/low-clouds, as well as assessment of the direct radiative effect of the region-wide haze/fog system. Results from this work are anticipated to shed light on the overall interactions within the highly persistent and tightly-coupled haze-fog phenomena. Additionally, against the backdrop of a changing climate scenario, possible linkages between the winter-time fog cover, regional meteorology and aerosol loading will also be discussed over the IGP.",

The increase of urban flood could be attributed to many factors, such as the increase of impervious land surface and extreme precipitation, the decrease of surface storage capacity, poor maintenance of drainage utilities, and so on. In order to provide accurate and leading prediction on urban flooding, this study acquires precise urban topographic data via air-borne Lidar system, collects detailed underground drainage pipes, and installs in-situ monitoring networks on precipitation, water level, video record and traffic speed in the downtown area of Panyu District, Guangzhou, China. Based on the above data acquired, a urban flood model with EPA SWMM5 is established to simulate the flooding and inundation processes in the study area of 20 km2. The model is driven by the real-time precipitation data and calibrated by the water level data, which are converted to flooding volume with precise topographic data. After calibration, the model could be employed to conduct sensitivity analysis for investigating primary factors of urban flooding, and to simulate the flooding processes in different scenarios, which are beneficial to assessment of flooding risk and drainage capacity. This model is expected to provide real-time forecasting in emergency management.",

            "abstract": "Transit time distributions (TTD) are used to understand in-stream transport and exchange with the hyporheic zone by quantifying the probability of water (and of dissolved material) taking time T to traverse the stream reach control volume. However, many studies using this method assume a TTD that is time-invariant, despite the time-variability of the streamflow. Others assume that storage is ‘randomly sampled’ or ‘well-mixed’ with a fixed volume or fixed exchange rate. Here we present a formulation for a time-variable TTD that relaxes both the time-invariant and ‘randomly sampled’ assumptions and only requires a few parameters. The framework is applied to transient storage, representing some combination of in-stream and hyporheic storage, along a stream reach. This approach does not assume that hyporheic and dead-zone storage is fixed or temporally-invariant, and allows for these stores to be sampled in more physically representative ways determined by the system itself. Instead of using probability distributions of age, probability distributions of storage (ranked by age) called Ω functions are used to describe how the off-stream storage is sampled in the outflow. Here the Ω function approach is used to describe hyporheic exchange during diurnal fluctuations in streamflow in a gaining reach of the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest. The breakthrough curves of salt slugs injected four hours apart over a 28-hour period show a systematic variation in transit time distribution. This new approach allows us to relate these salt slug TTDs to a corresponding time-variation in the Ω function, which can then be related to changes in in-stream storage and hyporheic zone mobilization under varying flow conditions. Thus, we can gain insights into how channel storage and hyporheic exchange are changing through time without having to specify difficult to measure or unmeasurable quantities of our system, such as total storage.",

            "abstract": "In the arc-continent collision environment in Taiwan, triggered tremor (Peng and Chao, GJI, 2008; Tang, et al., GRL, 2010; Chao et al., GJI, 2012) and ambient tremor (Chao et al., BSSA, 2013; Chuang et al., GRL, 2014) have been reported under the southern Central Range. Tang et al. (2010) demonstrated that triggered tremor here is composed of low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs), which were originally identified manually and later were used as templates to detect more triggered LFEs (Tang et al., EPSL, 2013). In this study, we create LFE templates within triggered and ambient tremor in the southern Central Range with a few years of continuous seismic waveforms. We apply the PageRank algorithm used in Aguiar and Beroza (2014) that exploits the repetitive nature of the LFEs within tremor without a priori knowledge of the template signature and have found repeating LFEs in both ambient and triggered tremor. We use these repeaters to create a stacked LFE template for each station as described in Aguiar and Beroza (2014). The LFE templates created from triggered tremor are very similar to those created from ambient tremor. To test the similarity of the templates, we use both interchangeably, that is, we use the template created from triggered tremor to detect LFEs within ambient tremor and use the template of ambient tremor to detect LFEs within triggered tremor. We find that most of the ambient tremor can be detected by the LFE templates created from either data set, as well as that most triggered tremor bursts are explained by both templates. This similarity between both LFE templates suggests that the LFEs for both events (triggered and ambient) are generally coming from similar sources, but the triggered LFEs show much larger amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio than ambient LFEs. We will create a general LFE template composed from both triggered and ambient tremor and locate accurate LFE sources for all templates. Our goal is to create a complete and reliable LFE catalog under the southern Central Range of Taiwan. Our study can provide a comprehensive picture of tremor activity and help to explain the ambiguous tectonic environment in this region.",

The impact of these updates on the odd nitrogen abundances, fluxes, and neutral temperature are assessed by inclusion into the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) and comparison with data from the Student Nitric Oxide Explorer (SNOE) and Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) experiments. Regarding chemistry, electronically and vibrationally excited molecular nitrogen (N2(A)) has been found to be an important source of nitric oxide (NO) and electronically excited atomic nitrogen (N(2D)) [Campbell et al, 2007] while many key branching ratios and temperature dependences have been revised [Hellberg et al, 2003; Galvao et al, 2013]. The yields of vibrationally excited NO(v) from the N(2D)+O2 and N(4S)+O2 reactions have been determined [Miquel et al, 2003; Sultanov et al, 2006]; radiative cascade from NO(v) results in enhanced cooling near 5.3 μm which contributes roughly 20% of that due to collisions with hot atomic oxygen. Collision integrals for the He-NO and He-N(4S) interactions are known [Partridge et al, 2001; Haghighi et al, 2003] and the resulting transport coefficients are calculated and input to TIE-GCM v2.0, wherein He is treated as a major species.",

The MOD15A2 LAI/FPAR product is one of the standard products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. However, only the PAR absorbed by chlorophyll of the canopy, not the PAR absorbed by the foliage or by the entire canopy, is used for photosynthesis. Therefore, we use a canopy-leaf radiative transfer model PROSAIL2 with MAIAC retrieved surface reflectance to derive the fraction of PAR absorbed by the foliage (fAPARfoliage), the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll of the canopy (fAPARchl), LAI, and the photosynthetic section of LAI (LAIchl=LAI*fAPARchl/fAPARfoliage). We compare six years(2001-2006) of Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) simulations of GPP in selected AmeriFlux tower sites across croplands and forests. Three LAI data sets of each site have been implemented into CLM to simulate GPP: (1) default LAI with CLM, (2) MOD15A2 LAI, and (3) MODIS LAIchl from fAPARchl. Differences among measured GPP and simulated GPP derived from CLM default LAI, MOD15A2 LAI and LAIchl have been analyzed. The results show that during the growing season, spring estimates of MODIS LAIchl/fAPARchl GPP are much closer to tower data than CLM default GPP and MOD15A2 GPP, with R-squared values of 0.71, -0.06 and -0.09, respectively. Thus, while continued efforts are needed in more sites and vegetation types, the new MODIS LAIchl/fAPARchl product will likely be able to increase accuracy of GPP simulations and improve vegetation phenology dynamics response to climate variability.",

            "abstract": "While glacier responses to climate are understood in general terms and in their main trends, model based projections are affected by the type of model used and uncertainties in the meteorological input data, among others. Recent works have attempted at improving glacio-hydrological models by including neglected processes and investigating uncertainties in their outputs.\nIn this work, we select two knowledge gaps in current modelling practices and illustrate their importance through modelling with a fully distributed mass balance model that includes some of the state of the art approaches for calculations of glacier ablation, accumulation and glacier geometry changes.\nWe use an advanced mass balance model applied to glaciers in the Andes of Chile, Swiss Alps and Nepalese Himalaya to investigate two issues that seem of importance for a sound assessment of glacier changes: 1) the use of physically-based models of glacier ablation (energy balance) versus more empirical models (enhanced temperature index approaches); 2) the importance of the correct extrapolation of air temperature forcing on glaciers and the large uncertainty in model outputs associated with it. The ablation models are calibrated with a large amount of data from in-situ campaigns, and distributed observations of air temperature used to calculate lapse rates and calibrate a thermodynamic model of temperature distribution.\nWe show that no final assessment can be made of what type of melt model is more appropriate or accurate for simulation of glacier ablation at the glacier scale, not even for relatively well studied glaciers. Both models perform in a similar manner at low elevations, but important differences are evident at high elevations, where lack of data prevents a final statement on which model better represent the actual ablation amounts.\nAccurate characterization of air temperature is important for correct simulations of glacier mass balance and volume changes. Substantial differences are obtained if we use the common approach of constant in time LRs (even if properly calibrated) or more sophisticated approaches accounting for the different thermal regime off and on-glacier, as distinct thermal conditions exist on and off glacier associated with the presence of the glacier boundary layer where katabatic flow is important.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the factors influencing sediment fluxes is a key issue to interpret the evolution of coastal sedimentation under natural and human impact and relevant for the natural resources management. Despite river plumes represent one of the major gain in sedimentary budget of littoral cells, knowledge of factors influencing complex behavior of coastal plumes, like river discharge characteristics, wind stress and hydro-climatic variables, has not been yet fully investigated. Use of Earth Observation data allows the identification of spatial and temporal variations of suspended sediments related to river runoff, seafloor erosion, sediment transport and deposition processes.\nObjective of the study is to investigate sediment fluxes in northern Adriatic Sea by linking suspended sediment patterns of coastal plumes to hydrologic and climatic forcing regulating the sedimentary cell budget and geomorphological evolution in coastal systems and continental shelf waters.\nAnalysis of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) product, derived from 2002-2012 MERIS time series, was done to map changes in spatial and temporal dimension of suspended sediments, focusing on turbid plume waters and intense wind stress conditions. From the generated multi temporal TSM maps, dispersal patterns of major freshwater runoff plumes in northern Adriatic Sea were evaluated through spatial variability of coastal plumes shape and extent. Additionally, sediment supply from river distributary mouths was estimated from TSM and correlated with river discharge rates, wind field and wave field through time. Spatial based methodology has been developed to identify events of wave-generated resuspension of sediments, which cause variation in water column turbidity, occurring during intense wind stress and extreme metocean conditions, especially in the winter period. The identified resuspension events were qualitatively described and compared with to hydro-climatic variables.\nThe identification of spatial and temporal pattern variability highlighted the presence of seasonal sediment dynamics linked to the seasonal cycle in river discharge and wind stress. Results suggest that sediment fluxes generate geomorphological variations in northern Adriatic Sea, which are mainly controlled by river discharge rates and modulated by the winds.",

            "abstract": "The UK’s DECC (Deriving Emissions linked to Climate Change) network consists of four greenhouse gas measurement stations that are situated to constrain emissions from the UK and Northwest Europe. These four stations are located in Mace Head (West Coast of Ireland), and on telecommunication towers at Ridge Hill (Western England), Tacolneston (Eastern England) and Angus (Eastern Scotland). With the exception of Angus, which currently only measures carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), the remaining sites are additionally equipped to monitor nitrous oxide (N2O). We present an analysis of the network’s CH4 and N2O observations from 2011-2013 and compare derived top-down regional emissions with bottom-up inventories, including a recently produced high-resolution inventory (UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory). As countries are moving toward national-level emissions estimation, we also address some of the considerations that need to be made when designing these national networks.\nOne of the novel aspects of this work is that we use a hierarchical Bayesian inversion framework. This methodology, which has newly been applied to greenhouse gas emissions estimation, is designed to estimate temporally and spatially varying model-measurement uncertainties and correlation scales, in addition to fluxes. Through this analysis, we demonstrate the importance of characterizing these covariance parameters in order to properly use data from high-density monitoring networks. This UK case study highlights the ways in which this new inverse framework can be used to address some of the limitations of traditional Bayesian inverse methods.",

            "abstract": "Residential communities are being increasingly impacted by emissions from oil and gas development and this has driven the need for simple, effective, and low-cost methods for air quality monitoring. Primary emissions from oil and gas production consist of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) ranging from the short chain alkanes and alkenes to aromatic and semi-volatile species; many of these are a concern from both an air quality and public health viewpoint, as they can lead to local ozone pollution and increased risk of cancer or respiratory illness. The fate of hydrocarbons once in the atmosphere is ultimately oxidation through to CO2 and water, adding to the greenhouse gas burden. Measurement techniques that are capable of identifying and quantifying the full range of primary emissions of concern are required to assess community exposure to air toxics and to better inform residents, as well as local and state legislators. Here, we present evaluation of a low-cost air monitoring technique using stainless steel diffusion cartridges containing multiple solid adsorbents. Over the course of a three-month period in summer of 2014, cartridges were deployed at five monitoring sites located around Boulder County in the Northern Colorado Front Range, and exposed to ambient air for periods of up to four days along with concurrent sampling using stainless steel SUMMA canisters. Samples collected with both methods were subsequently analyzed for VOCs by GC-FID and the results were compared to determine the accuracy and precision of the diffusion cartridge method. Results of this evaluation show that the diffusion cartridge method has the potential to be a simple and low-cost solution for widespread exposure monitoring in communities near oil and gas development regions. Such measurements may also provide supporting evidence on wider effects on greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas development operations.",

            "abstract": "Death Valley, a half-graben within the Eastern California Shear Zone at the western edge of the Basin and Range structural province, is being simultaneously extended east-west by normal faults seen in outcrop at its eastern edge, and sheared by strike-slip along the North and South Death Valley fault zones. Controversy surrounds the extent, mechanism, and activity of fault slip on the low-angle detachment fault that dips west beneath the valley. While geological evidence points to possibly active detachment faulting, no evidence of seismicity associated with a seismically active detachment fault has been reported. The valley lies between two regional seismic networks, and the precision of locations of the relatively few earthquakes cataloged by the networks is insufficient to address these details. To characterize microseismicity that accompanies active deformation, we deployed 12 portable seismographs for over a year, testing the hypothesis that the detachment fault is microseismically active, albeit at a level too low to have been usefully detected by the regional networks. Of the couple of thousand events recorded on our array, 313 with magnitudes between 0 and 2.5 are located within the central portion of Death Valley. We relocated these earthquakes using a velocity model and individual station delays derived using the VELEST program. Initial results reveal a westward-dipping pattern of hypocenters consistent with the geometry of the westward-dipping detachment fault, however with considerable scatter. The earthquakes were highly clustered; if they occurred on the detachment fault, large parts of it were silent during the experiment. First-motion focal mechanisms indicate normal fault slip on a mixture of low-angle and high-angle planes as well as some strike-slip earthquakes. We will also present an analysis of high-precision relative relocations. The field experiment was brought to an early end due to monsoon flooding in July of 2013.",

These depletions have numerous practical impacts on radio propagation, including amplitude scintillation, field-aligned irregularity scatter, HF blackouts, and long-distance transequatorial propagation at frequencies above the MUF. Practical impacts notwithstanding, the pathways and conditions under which depletions form remain a topic of vigorous inquiry some 80 years after their first report. Structuring of the pre-sunset ionosphere---morphology of the equatorial anomalies and long-wavelength undulations of the isodensity contours on the bottomside---are likely to hold some clues to conditions that are conducive to depletion formation. The Conjugate Depletion Experiment is an upcoming transequatorial forward-scatter HF/VHF experiment to investigate pre-sunset undulations and their connection with depletion formation. We will present initial results from the Conjugate Depletion Experiment, as well as a companion analysis of a massive HF propagation data set.",

            "abstract": "Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forests in northern Colorado and southeast Wyoming have been undergoing a major mortality event owing to mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestation since 2007. We studied biotic and abiotic drivers of growing season soil respiration in four mature stands experiencing different levels of mortality between 2008 and 2012 in the Medicine Bow Mountains, southeastern Wyoming, USA. For five years, beetle infestation significantly altered forest structure. Stand mortality was 30% and more than 80% in stands with the lowest and highest mortality, respectively. Understory vegetation cover increased by 50% for five years following beetle infestation. Needlefall was increased by more than 50% during first two years of beetle infestation compared to the pre-disturbance period. We did not observe an immediate increase in soil respiration following beetle infestation as suggested by some researchers. Soil respiration rates in midsummer ranged from 1.4 ± 0.1 µmol m-2 s-1 in stands with highest mortality to 3.1 ± 0.2 µmol m-2s-1 in uninfested stand. Live tree basal area was the dominant factor controlling soil respiration, explaining more than 60% of the interannual and spatial variations in response to the disturbance. In addition, soil respiration was significantly correlated with fine root biomass, which explained 55% of variations, providing strong evidence that autotrophic respiration dominated the forest soil respiration flux. Furthermore, the seasonality of soil respiration was controlled mainly by mean monthly precipitation and mid-day photosynthetically active radiation. Each factor predicted from 30% to 50% of seasonal soil respiration variability with the highest correlation coefficients in stand with the lowest mortality. Our results clearly indicate that the reduction of photosynthesis in trees over the infestation period significantly reduced soil respiration. The remaining activity in dead stands may be attributed to heterotrophic activity and surviving vegetation. Complex changes in stand structure following beetle infestation are lacking in ecosystem modeling, but these dynamic processes should be included to predict disturbance effects on C cycling.",

            "abstract": "River networks are the main conduits that transport water, sediment, and nutrients from continental interiors to the oceans. They also shape topography as they erode through bedrock. These hierarchical networks are dynamic: there are numerous examples of apparent changes in the topology of river networks through geologic time. But these examples are geographically scattered, the evidence can be ambiguous, and the mechanisms that drive changes in river networks are poorly understood. This makes it difficult to assess how pervasive river network reorganization is, how it operates, and how the interlocking river basins that compose a given landscape are changing through time. Recent progress has improved the situation. We describe three developments that have dramatically advanced our understanding of dynamic river networks. First, new topographic, geophysical and geochronological measurement techniques are revealing the rate and extent of river network adjustment. Second, laboratory experiments and computational models are clarifying how river networks respond to tectonic and climatic perturbations at scales ranging from local to continental. Third, spatial analysis of genetic data is exposing links between landscape evolution, biological evolution, and the development of biodiversity. We highlight key problems that remain unsolved, and suggest ways to build on recent advances that will bring dynamic river networks into even sharper focus.",

As a result of these ramifications, the ability to detect and measure falling snow at the surface is of great importance. Currently, accurate global surface snowfall measurements are not possible due to the limitations of ground-based instrumentation coupled with the uncertainty in spaceborne retrievals. The recently launched NASA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission core observatory opens up the potential for near-global real-time, accurate satellite retrievals of snowfall, however additional research is necessary to fully understand snowfall properties and allow for the ability to produce the algorithms for such retrievals.\nThis study seeks to investigate the microphysical properties of snowfall from a ground-based perspective using data collected during the NASA GPM Cold-season Precipitation Experiment (GCPEx) that took place in southern Ontario, Canada during January and February of 2012. Data collected from the two-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD) and Particle Size Velocity (PARSIVEL-2) disdrometer are analyzed to determine how the microphysical properties of snowfall including particle size distributions as well as mass-diameter relationships, effective bulk density, and fall speed vary in differing precipitation conditions including light, moderate, and heavy snow as well as multiple storm types including synoptic, lake enhanced, and lake effect events. Relationships between observed microphysical parameters and coincident multi-wavelength radar observations will be examined.",

            "abstract": "Climate science and sea level models constantly evolve. In this context, maps and analyses of exposure to sea level rise -- or coastal flooding aggravated by rise -- quickly fall out of date when based upon a specific model projection or projection set. At the same time, policy makers and planners prefer simple and stable risk assessments for their future planning. Here, using Climate Central’s Surging Seas Risk Finder, we describe and illustrate a decision tool framework that separates the spatial and temporal dimensions of coastal exposure in order to help alleviate this tension. The Risk Finder presents local maps and exposure analyses simply as functions of a discrete set of local water levels. In turn, each water level may be achieved at different times, with different probabilities, according to different combinations of sea level change, storm surge and tide. This temporal dimension is expressed in a separate module of the Risk Finder, so that users may explore the probabilities and time frames of different water levels, as a function of different sea level models and emissions scenarios. With such an approach, decision-makers can quickly get a sense of the range of risks for each water level given current understanding. At the same time, the models and scenarios can easily be updated over time as the science evolves, while avoiding the labor of regenerating maps and exposure analyses.\nIn this talk, we will also use the tool to highlight key findings from a new U.S. national assessment of sea level and coastal flood risk. For example, more than 2.5 million people and $500 billion dollars of property value sit on land less than 2 meters above the high tide line in Florida alone.",

            "abstract": "The National Research Council (2012) has expressed a need for participatory science experiences for students. Opportunities are needed for students which 1) allow them to understand how scientific knowledge develops and 2) can heighten their curiosity, capture their interest, and motivate their continued study of science. Studies (e.g., Aydeniz et al., 2011) have also recommend educators provide students with opportunities to do science through extracurricular work with scientists. In addition to being given the opportunity to fully participate in the scientific enterprise, students must also be explicitly guided in their attempts to develop a more appropriate understanding of the nature of the scientific enterprise (McDonald, 2010; Rudge & Howe, 2010; Yacoubian & BouJaoude, 2010). Exploration of the Moon and Asteroids by Secondary Students, or ExMASS, provides such an opportunity for students. The ExMASS program is an education effort managed by the LPI/NASA JSC-led Center for Lunar Science and Exploration (CLSE), one of nine teams comprising NASA’s Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI). Over the course of one academic year, teams of high school students conduct their own scientific investigations of either Earth’s Moon or asteroids, with guidance from a scientist mentor. The program includes two elements: 1) a guided inquiry introductory research activity that builds student knowledge of current lunar/asteroid science and lunar/asteroid data, and 2) an open inquiry research project in which the students apply their knowledge to a self-defined project. Evaluation data collected during the predecessor program to ExMASS revealed many successes, but also room for improvement. In response, an Advisory Group consisting of past teachers and mentors was formed to address the gaps revealed in the evaluation data. The ExMASS program will continue to collect similar evaluation data including assessment of changes in students’ lunar/asteroid content knowledge, student attitudes toward science and science careers, and views of the nature of science and scientific inquiry. Exit surveys for teachers, students, and mentors will also be used to gather general feedback about the program and its impact.",

            "abstract": "The production of organic nitrates has significant atmospheric importance due to the impact on regional air quality by influencing NOx lifetimes and ozone formation. Additionally, these low volatility compounds readily partition into the particle phase and are important contributors to secondary organic aerosol. Once in the aerosol phase, organic nitrates undergo further chemical reactions that govern their fate in the atmosphere and, consequently, their impact on air quality. Recent research indicates that the presence of water on aerosol particles has a major impact on the reactivity of organic nitrates and that condensed phase hydrolysis leads to the destruction of organic nitrate species, depending on structure. Despite this knowledge, the chemical mechanisms, products, product reactivity and volatility are still uncertain, negatively impacting our understanding of aerosol phase processing and the contribution to air quality. To further understand the atmospheric impact of aerosol phase hydrolysis, we analyzed both condensed phase hydrolysis reactions involving alpha-pinene-derived standards and alpha-pinene photochemical chamber reaction filter samples, using a suite of spectroscopic and mass spectrometric techniques. We were able to measure the pH-dependent hydrolysis rate constants for several types of organic nitrates and identify specific reaction products. The chemistry involved exhibits a strong dependence on pH, providing important mechanistic clues. The results of this study will significantly contribute to our knowledge of aerosol phase chemistry and the impact on regional air quality with respect to the fate of organic nitrate species.",

            "abstract": "Trace metal ratios are widely used as paleoclimate proxies for past ocean conditions. In particular Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios in biogenic carbonates have been used as paleothermometers. Of course the use of these trace metal ratios as reliable climate proxies does not come without complications. As well as biologically mediated “vital effects”, there have also been other secondary controls on trace metal incorporation reported, including salinity, carbonate ion concentration and growth rate. Within this study a range of trace metal ratios and their isotopes have been measured for modern ooid samples forming under a range of environmental conditions. Since ooids are thought to form through inorganic precipitation (although microbial mediation may play a role), the “vital effects” seen in biogenic carbonates should be minimised or absent. Therefore, ooids should be expected to incorporate trace metals similarly to carbonate precipitated in experimental studies. Through studying modern ooids we can test this hypothesis, as well as looking at the factors that affect the incorporation of trace metals into calcium carbonates without the control of typical “vital effects”.The sample set includes both pure aragonite and pure calcite ooids, as well as samples with intermediate mineralogy as determined by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The distribution coefficients for purely aragonite or calcite ooids are offset from the reported inorganic precipitate values, with DSr being larger, while DMg has been found to be lower. The incorporation of Mg and Sr across the sample set is inversely correlated and does not seem to be explained by mineralogy alone. Here we explore alternative secondary factors contributing to the incorporation of these trace elements into oolitic carbonate. This will be accomplished by utilising stable Sr isotope fractionation during incorporation and using kinetic models and distribution coefficients to investigate the controls on Mg and Sr partitioning into calcium carbonate.",

            "abstract": "Magma formation in subduction zones is interpreted to be caused by flux melting of the mantle wedge by fluids derived from dehydration of the downgoing oceanic lithosphere. In the Cascade Arc and other hot-slab subduction zones, however, most dehydration reactions occur beneath the forearc, necessitating a closer investigation of magma generation processes in this setting. Recent work combining 2-D steady state thermal models and the hydrogen isotope composition of olivine-hosted melt inclusions from the Lassen segment of the Cascades (Walowski et al., 2014; in review) has shown that partial melting of the subducted basaltic crust may be a key part of the subduction component in hot arcs. In this model, fluids from the slab interior (hydrated upper mantle) rise through the slab and cause flux-melting of the already dehydrated MORB volcanics in the upper oceanic crust. In the Shasta and Lassen segments of the southern Cascades, support for this interpretation comes from primitive magmas that have MORB-like Sr isotope compositions that correlate with subduction component tracers (H2O/Ce, Sr/P) (Grove et al. 2002, Borg et al. 2002). In addition, mass balance calculations of the composition of subduction components show ratios of trace elements to H2O that are at the high end of the global arc array (Ruscitto et al. 2012), consistent with the role of a slab-derived melt. Melting of the subducted basaltic crust should contribute a hydrous dacitic or rhyolitic melt (e.g. Jego and Dasgupta, 2013) to the mantle wedge rather than an H2O-rich aqueous fluid. We are using pHMELTS and pMELTS to model the reaction of hydrous slab melts with mantle peridotite as the melts rise through the inverted thermal gradient in the mantle wedge. The results of the modeling will be useful for understanding magma generation processes in arcs that are associated with subduction of relatively young oceanic lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "On May 24, 2013, the largest deep earthquake ever recorded in history occurred on the southern tip of the Kamchatka Island, where the Pacific Plate subducts underneath the Okhotsk Plate. Previous 2D beamforming back projection (BP) of P- coda waves suggests the mainshock ruptured bilaterally along a horizontal fault plane determined by the global centroid moment tensor solution. On the other hand, the multiple point source inversion of P and SH waveforms argued that the earthquake comprises a sequence of 6 subevents not located on a single plane but actually distributed in a zone that extends 64 km horizontally and 35 km in depth. We then apply a three-dimensional MUSIC BP approach to resolve the rupture processes of the manishock and two large aftershocks (M6.7) with no a priori setup of preferential orientations of the planar rupture. The maximum pseudo-spectrum of high-frequency P wave in a sequence of time windows recorded by the densely-distributed stations from US and EU Array are used to image 3-D temporal and spatial rupture distribution. The resulting image confirms that the nearly N-S striking but two antiparallel rupture stages. The first subhorizontal rupture initially propagates toward the NNE direction, while at 18 s later it directs reversely to the SSW and concurrently shifts downward to 35 km deeper lasting for about 20 s. The rupture lengths in the first NNE-ward and second SSW-ward stage are about 30 km and 85 km; the estimated rupture velocities are 3 km/s and 4.25 km/s, respectively. Synthetic experiments are undertaken to assess the capability of the 3D MUSIC BP for the recovery of spatio-temporal rupture processes. Besides, high frequency BP images based on the EU-Array data show two M6.7 aftershocks are more likely to rupture on the vertical fault planes.",

            "abstract": "In order to support its mission of monitoring compliance with the treaty banning nuclear explosions, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) operates four global networks of seismic, infrasound, hydroacoustic, referred to as waveform, sensors and air samplers accompanied with radionuclide detectors. The role of the International Data Centre (IDC) of CTBTO is to associate the signals detected in the monitoring networks with the physical phenomena which emitted these signals, by forming events.\nWhile the process of event building for the waveform technologies is well-established, the task of event building using the radionuclide detections remains a challenge. One of the reasons is the complexity of the process of atmospheric transport of airborne radionuclides from their sources to the detecting stations and subsequent difficulties in representing this process in models. An atmospheric transport model is driven by meteorological fields generated by numerical models coupled to observations. In addition, it is equipped with parameterisations of sub-grid scale processes to account for incompleteness of the representation of meteorological processes in the meteorological fields.\nIn this presentation we will discuss possibilities of improving the accuracy of the atmospheric transport modelling simulations in support of radionuclide detections at CTBTO. Some of these improvements can be implemented operationally, while others, due to their computational cost, could only be performed on request. We will present the influence an increase of resolution of global meteorological fields, provided by the EMCWF (European Centre of Medium-Range Weather Forecasts), has on the quality of the simulations. We will address possible benefits of using high resolution regional meteorological fields generated with the mesoscale model WRF (Weather research and Forecasting). We will illustrate the impact of parameterisations, namely those linked to the atmospheric boundary layer physics. In order to focus full attention on atmospheric processes we will present analyses of case studies based on a trustworthy source of radionuclides which can be connected to detections in the CTBTO network. Finally, we will discuss modelling limitations due to the turbulent nature of the atmospheric processes.",

However, the observational and synthetic limitations that exist due to the station distribution and frequency content of signals that can be modeled imply that various simplifications to the source representation need to be made in order to stabilize the inversions. These simplifications inevitably affect the final results, though it is largely unknown how serious the regularization can be. Here, we explore the effects caused by a pre-assumed slip rate function using synthetic data from the Source Inversion Validation (SIV) produced by a crack-like spontaneous dynamic rupture embedded in a layered, elastic medium. Thus we have exact Green’s functions, which allow us to consider only the effects of varying the slip rate function. We study the effect of three different inverted slip rate functions: i) asymmetric cosine functions; ii) modified Yoffe functions and iii) no negative functions within given time windows. The first approach has been used routinely in finite fault inversions and the second one is characteristic of dynamic simulations. We perform the inversions using the first two cases with a simulated annealing algorithm and attempt to answer whether the ideal synthetic data can differentiate between them. The last one has the inverted slip rate function with the least a priori constraints but uses many more free parameters. It is inverted using the newly developed Projected Landweber (PL) method and we will explore its dependence on the choice of the initial model and the bandwidth of signals.",

            "abstract": "Macro-scale spatially distributed hydrologic models require extensive parameterization of both soil and vegetal properties. Proper parameterization of vegetation is critical for understanding vegetal response to hydro-climatic variability, as vegetation provides a key feedback to climate. A common practice for Dynamic Global Vegetation Models is to use plant functional types (PFTs), which limit vegetation to discrete classes. We present a physically based long-term macro-scale coupled vegetation and hydrology model capable of responding dynamically to climate variability, and parameterize it assuming vegetal optimality hypotheses. We hypothesize that canopy scale vegetation will adopt a strategy that maximizes the expected net assimilation, minus photosynthetic system construction and maintenance costs, over an annual basis. We perform stochastic multi-decadal simulations to estimate the expected fitness for a unique vegetal parameterization and water use strategy. As a result, optimal parameter sets are defined, which can be used instead of a PFT characterization of land cover. Estimates of evaporation, transpiration and gross primary production obtained using the optimal parameter sets over a range of climates are then compared against FLUXNET data.",

            "abstract": "Increased development of unconventional oil and gas resources in North America has given rise to attempts to monitor and quantify fugitive emissions of methane from the industry. Emission estimates of methane from oil and gas basins can vary significantly from one study to another as well as from EPA or State estimates. New efforts are aimed at reconciling bottom-up, or inventory-based, emission estimates of methane with top-down estimates based on atmospheric measurements from aircraft, towers, mobile ground-based vehicles, and atmospheric models. Attributing airborne measurements of regional methane fluxes to specific sources is informed by ground-based measurements of methane. Stable isotopic measurements (δ13C) of methane help distinguish between emissions from the O&G industry, Confined Animal Feed Operations (CAFO), and landfills, but analytical challenges typically limit meaningful isotopic measurements to individual point sampling. We are developing a toolbox to use δ13CH4 measurements to assess the partitioning of methane emissions for regions with multiple methane sources. The method was applied to the Denver-Julesberg Basin. Here we present data from continuous isotopic measurements obtained over a wide geographic area by using MegaCore, a 1500 ft. tube that is constantly filled with sample air while driving, then subsequently analyzed at slower rates using cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS). Pressure, flow and calibration are tightly controlled allowing precise attribution of methane enhancements to their point of collection. Comparisons with point measurements are needed to confirm regional values and further constrain flux estimates and models. This effort was made in conjunction with several major field campaigns in the Colorado Front Range in July-August 2014, including FRAPPÉ (Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment), DISCOVER-AQ, and the Air Water Gas NSF Sustainability Research Network at the University of Colorado.",

            "abstract": "Formed mainly by anvil outflow and the remaining part of deep convective clouds after rainfall or in situ in the upper troposphere by synoptic events, high clouds are constantly found in the tropical region. The global cirrus cover has been estimated to be about 20-25% and their occurrence can be more than 70% over the tropics. These clouds have lifetime that can go from hours to a few days, large coverage area and have been recognized as important agents of the climate system as they can signiﬁcantly alter the radiation balance of the atmosphere. Despite being relatively transparent to solar radiation (optical depth < 3.0), they trap the infrared radiation that would be lost to space, and thus may have a positive radiative forcing. In this paper, we report on tropical cirrus clouds characteristics as measured by a Lidar station operational in the central Amazon (2.89° S 59.97° W) since 2011. An automated algorithm for the detection of cirrus clouds was developed to determine the clouds geometrical properties. The transmittance of the lidar signal was used to derive the cirrus optical depth. The Klett method was used to derive the backscattering coeﬃcient and to estimate the lidar ratio of the cirrus clouds. Precipitation information by TRMM satellite and wind field by ERA Interim reanalysis from ECMWF were used. As the results from the ﬁrst two years of measurements (2011-2012), we found that the occurrence of high clouds with base altitude higher than 8 km (temperatures below -20°C) was approximately 71.0% of the total time of observation, varying between about 50% in the dry season (JJA) and about 80% in the wet season (DJF). These all cirrus clouds were classifies as subvisual (τ<0.03) approximately 24.2% of times, 40.7% were thin cirrus (0.03<τ<0.3) and 35.1% were cirrus stratus (τ>0.3). The average values of the cirrus base and top altitudes were 12.4±2.4km and 14.3±2.2km, respectively. They were found at temperatures down to −90°C they reside most frequently near the tropopause. The mean diurnal cycle of the frequency and altitude, during both summer and winter, indicate anvil outflow to be the most important generation mechanism. The mean lidar ratio was 20.0±6.8sr, indicating a mixed composition of thick plate and long column ice crystals. The behavior of these quantities with respect to temperature was analyzed.",

            "abstract": "The Avon Valley and adjacent mountains in west-central Montana lie within the Lewis and Clark Line, a major system of WNW-striking faults and folds that transect the more northerly structural grain of the northern Rockies and represent alternating episodes of transtensional and transpressional deformation. The northwest-trending valley has been previously interpreted as an extensional half graben filled with Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic deposits; however, little-to-no geophysical constraints on basin architecture or the thickness of Tertiary fill have been reported. A major northwest-striking fault with significant normal displacement clearly bounds the valley to the northeast, juxtaposing Tertiary sedimentary deposits against Proterozoic-Mesozoic units deformed by shortening structures and crosscut by Cretaceous granitic intrusions. Tertiary volcanic deposits unconformably overlying faulted and folded Phanerozoic-Proterozoic sequences in the eastern Garnet Range bound the valley to the southwest, but in the past no faults had been mapped along this margin. New mapping by the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology (MBMG) has identified a system of high-angle, northwest- and northeast-striking, oblique-slip faults along the southwest border of the Avon calling into question if the valley is a half, full, or asymmetrical graben. Geophysical data has recently been acquired by Montana Tech to help define the structural architecture of the Avon Valley and the thickness of its Tertiary fill. Gravity data and a short seismic reflection profile have been collected and a preliminary interpretation of these data indicates a half graben with a series of normal faults bounding the western side of the valley. Ongoing gravity data collection throughout 2014 should refine this interpretation by better defining the bedrock-Tertiary interface at depth.",

            "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) speciation in filtered water and suspended particulate matter was measured during the 2013 U.S. GEOTRACES zonal section of the tropical South Pacific Ocean. Filtered and gaseous Hg species were determined in high vertical and horizontal resolution across a narrow continental margin and trench, large gradients in biological productivity and N*, a hydrothermal vent field on the East Pacific Rise (EPR), and an expansive suboxic oxygen minimum zone. Total Hg upwelled from depth near Peru, and in deep water, concentrations were significantly greater east of the EPR in Pacific Deep Water compared to Lower Circumpolar Deep Water west of the EPR. Elemental Hg (Hg0) was correlated negatively with N*, suggesting that Hg reduction may be linked to denitrification; however, the highest concentrations of Hg0 were found along the Peru margin and within the Peru trench. Concentrations of filtered and particulate monomethyl-Hg (MMHg) and gaseous dimethyl-Hg (DMHg) were increased in oxygen minimum/deficit zones across the section. DMHg:MMHg and DMHg:total Hg ratios were significantly greater in sub-oxic (<2 μmol/kg O2) waters near the coast of Peru compared to more oxygenated waters (2-275 μmol/kg O2) at similar depths. Within the hydrothermal plume extending west from the EPR, total Hg concentrations were not elevated compared to surrounding bottom waters, however, MMHg increased and DMHg decreased near the plume, similar to the behavior of methylated-Hg near the TAG hydrothermal vent measured during U.S. GA03.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, the use of geomagnetic data in space weather operations has been limited to specific geographic coordinates (i.e., magnetic observatories), or to global indices that average magnetic measurements into latitudinal bands of relatively general space weather interest (e.g., Dst, Kp, AE). However, modern technological systems (e.g., power grids, directional drilling platforms) are beginning to require and request information about ground magnetic variations that is more tailored to a specific locale. One solution is to simply install magnetic observatories near every newly built technological system, but this is both economically and operationally impractical. We have chosen instead to adopt an optimal interpolation scheme that inverts for spherical elementary current systems (SECS, Amm-1997), which in turn are used to fill gaps between magnetic observatories. The SECS technique has undergone extensive scientific vetting over the last decade-and-a-half, and will soon be implemented operationally over the continental U.S. as a joint NASA-NOAA-USGS space weather data product, disseminated by the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). Because it will employ a relatively sparse array of high-quality geomagnetic observatories as input, it is important to characterize its ability to reproduce spatial variations in geomagnetic field at sub-continental scales, so the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global geospace model is used to generate realistic synthetic observations. These include virtual magnetic observatories as input, and a regular geographic grid to serve as a proxy for “ground truth”. We look specifically at LFM output for the Whole Heliosphere Interval (WHI) in order to obtain statistically valid performance measures for a variety of quiet-to-moderate space weather conditions.",

The Puerto Rico Seismic Network (PRSN) is participating in an effort with local and federal agencies, to developing tsunami hazard risk reduction strategies under the National Tsunami Hazards and Mitigation Program (NTHMP). This grant supports the TsunamiReady program which is the base of the tsunami preparedness and mitigation in PR.\nThe Caribbean region has a documented history of damaging tsunamis that have affected coastal areas. The seismic water waves originating in the prominent fault systems around PR are considered to be a near-field hazard for Puerto Rico and the Virgin islands (PR/VI) because they can reach coastal areas within a few minutes after the earthquake. Sources for local, regional and tele tsunamis have been identified and modeled and tsunami evacuation maps were prepared for PR. These maps were generated in three phases: First, hypothetical tsunami scenarios on the basis of the parameters of potential underwater earthquakes were developed. Secondly, each of these scenarios was simulated. The third step was to determine the worst case scenario (MOM). The run-ups were drawn on GIS referenced maps and aerial photographs. These products are being used by emergency managers to educate the public and develop mitigation strategies. Online maps and related evacuation products are available to the public via the PR-TDST (PR Tsunami Decision Support Tool). Currently all the 44 coastal municipalities were recognized as TsunamiReady by the US NWS. The main goal of the program is to declare Puerto Rico as TsunamiReady, including two cities that are not coastal but could be affected by tsunamis. Based on these evacuation maps, tsunami signs were installed, vulnerability profiles were created, communication systems to receive and disseminate tsunami messages were installed in each TWFP, and tsunami response plans were approved. Also, the existing tsunami protocol and criteria in the PR/VI was updated. This paper describes the PR-NTHMP project, including the real time earthquake and tsunami monitoring as well as the specific protocols used to broadcast tsunami messages. The paper highlights tsunami hazards assessment, detection, warning, education and outreach in Puerto Rico.",

            "abstract": "More than 2000 mm rainfall occurred over southern Taiwan when a category 1 Typhoon Morakot pass through Taiwan in early August 2009. Entire village and hundred of people were buried by massive mudslides induced by record-breaking precipitation. Whether the past anthropogenic warming played a significant role in such extreme event remained very controversial. On one hand, people argue it’s nearly impossible to attribute an individual extreme event to global warming. On the other hand, the increase of heavy rainfall is consistent with the expected effects of climate change on tropical cyclone. To diagnose possible anthropogenic contributions to the odds of such heavy rainfall associated with Typhoon Morakot, we adapt an existing event attribution framework of modeling a ‘world that was’ and comparing it to a modeled ‘world that might have been’ for that same time but for the absence of historical anthropogenic drivers of climate. One limitation for applying such approach to high-impact weather system is that it will require models capable of capturing the essential processes lead to the studied extremes. Using a cloud system resolving model that can properly simulate the complicated interactions between tropical cyclone, large-scale background, topography, we first perform the ensemble ‘world that was’ simulations using high resolution ECMWF YOTC analysis. We then re-simulate, having adjusted the analysis to ‘world that might have been conditions’ by removing the regional atmospheric and oceanic forcing due to human influences estimated from the CMIP5 model ensemble mean conditions between all forcing and natural forcing only historical runs. Thus our findings are highly conditional on the driving analysis and adjustments therein, but the setup allows us to elucidate possible contribution of anthropogenic forcing to changes in the likelihood of heavy rainfall associated Typhoon Morakot in early August 2009.",

            "abstract": "One of the major challenges in more detailed Earth system models (ESMs) is the treatment of the biophysical and biogeochemical processes and feedbacks and their impact on soil organic carbon in the Northern high latitudes (NHL). We use a land surface model, the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM) to investigate the effects of feedbacks between the biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes on the model estimated soil organic carbon (SOC) for the NHL permafrost region. We not only focus on recent model improvements in the biogeophysical processes that are deemed important for the high latitude soils/snow; such as deep soil column, modulation of soil thermal and hydrological properties, wind compaction of snow, and depth hoar formation; on permafrost SOC; but also biogeochemical processes; such as dynamic phenology and root distribution, litter carbon decomposition rates and nitrogen amount remaining; on soil biogeochemistry. We select multiple sites to evaluate the model. We then carried out several model simulations to study the effects of feedbacks between biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes on SOC. Our model analysis shows that including the biogeophysical processes alone could increase modeled NHL permafrost carbon by about 30% compared to measurements. Accounting for the biogeochmical processes further improve the NHL soil carbon.",

            "abstract": "The Pleistocene to Pliocene Fort Rock Volcanic Field (FRVF), situated in a back-arc extensional setting ~65 km east of the Central Oregon High Cascades has erupted a diverse array of basaltic magmas, including some primitive compositions with an Mg#>60. Major and trace element concentrations have been determined for 80 mafic bulk lava samples by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and selected minerals by electron microprobe. Petrological and geochemical data suggest three primitive basalt end-members similar to basalts in the nearby Oregon Cascade arc and High Lava Plains: high-alumina olivine tholeiite or low-K tholeiites (LKT), calc-alkaline basalts (CAB), ocean island basalts (OIB). Primitive Mg# (61-68) HAOTs are aphyric to phenocryst-poor (~2-5 %) olivine and plagioclase bearing and diktytaxitic. HAOTs are distinguished by low K2O (0.22-0.44 wt%), high Al2O3 (17.19-18.67 wt%) and CaO contents. CABs are the most dominant basalt type in the area with higher large ion lithophile element (LILE) concentrations (e.g., 170-426 ppm Ba) relative to high field strength elements (HFSE; 4.6-10.4 ppm Nb) and lower Mg#s (60-64) than HAOTs. CABs have more abundant (~5-15 %) and larger phenocrysts (~2-4 mm) of olivine and plagioclase than in HAOTs. OIBs contain higher Nb contents ranging from 11.7-18.6 ppm (vs. 3.0-7.2 ppm in HAOTs). OIBs are similar to both HAOTs and CABs, ranging from aphyric to porphyritic and diktytaxitic and may include amphibole phenocrysts. Tectonic extension associated with the Basin and Range in this area likely facilitated eruptions of primitive magmas. A comparison of the most primitive magmas (HAOTs with Mg#>65) found in eastern and western FRVF indicates that the western HAOTs contain higher incompatible element concentrations relative to eastern HAOT (Ba, Sc, Sr, Zr, Nb), which may reflect lower degrees of melting of a more enriched mantle source to the west.",

            "abstract": "Mineral dust aerosol is the largest global source of ice nuclei, but the identity of the active sites for nucleation is unknown. During atmospheric transport, mineral dust aerosol can encounter and react with sulfuric acid, which affects the ice nucleation activity either due to changes to reactive surface sites or product formation. In this study, we reacted two types of clays found in mineral dust, kaolinite and montmorillonite, with sulfuric acid. Variation in the mineral due to acid treatment was separated from product formation through rinsing techniques. The samples were subsequently reacted with a probe molecule, (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)dimethylchlorosilane, that selectively binds to edge hydroxyl groups that are bonded to a silicon atom with three bridging oxygens. Hydroxyl groups are considered potential active sites, because they can hydrogen bond with water and facilitate ice nucleation. Attachment to these sites was quantified by 19F magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) of the 19F atoms on the probe molecule, which provided a direct correlation of the number of hydroxyl groups. Our results indicate that the number of edge-site hydroxyl groups increases with exposure to acid. Ice nucleation measurements indicate that the sulfuric acid-treated mineral is less ice active than the untreated mineral. Surprisingly, no difference between the nucleation activity of the untreated mineral and acid-treated, rinsed mineral is observed. As a result, we hypothesize that once a critical density of active sites is reached for ice nucleation, there is no further change in nucleation activity despite a continued increase in active sites. We additionally propose that the reduced activity of the acid-treated mineral is due to product formation that blocks active sites on the mineral, rather than changes to active sites.",

It is found that fluctuations with the wavelength of 70-50km and less become pronounced during the earthquake period.  Results demonstrate that the radio occultation is suitable to probe vertical fluctuation structures in the ionosphere.  On the other hand, the Fourier Transform analysis displays that the TEC fluctuations derived from GPS receiving stations in Japan yields prominent fluctuations of 2-3 and 5-6 mHz around epicenter right after the earthquake occurrence.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor classification and environmental assessment in shallow marine waters are crucial to habitat mapping, coastal management policies and maintaining navigational waterways. Unfortunately, many current assessment techniques using remote acoustic methods have had limited success in shallow waters, often leading to sparse quantifiable data to support marine policy decisions. This problem is exacerbated by the highly variable bottom composition of typical coastal and estuarine environments. In this work, field observations from an Odom Echotrac vertical-incidence echosounder with a dual-frequency (24 and 200 khz) transducer were used to estimate seafloor sediment characteristics in regions with variable bottom types. Observations were obtained in water depths ranging 0.5-24 m of the Little Bay, NH, during February and March, 2013. Comparison between backscatter waveform properties and sediment grain size distributions show varied degrees of predictive capability. In an effort to better capture the collective effects of seafloor sediment's composition on acoustic returns, empirical orthogonal functions (EOF’s) were computed from waveform properties and compared with observed mud-sand fractions and bulk density measurements. Results from this analysis will be presented and discussed. This empirical analysis provides an objective means to interpret acoustic backscatter, an important step towards a widespread quantitative assessment of shallow water seafloor sediments.

            "abstract": "Recent theoretical studies have shown that convective recycling of atmospheric water vapor gives rise to the isotope “amount effect” in which d values are lower than predicted by simple Rayleigh distillation processes (i.e. (DdD = dDvapor ­- dDRayleigh < 0‰). Several studies have linked isotopes in precipitation [e.g. Vimeux et al., 2009] and atmospheric water vapor [e.g. Samuels-Crow et al., 2014] in the tropical Andes to upwind convection associated with the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM). The vertical structure of this convective influence, however, remains unknown. Understanding the vertical structure of the amount effect over South America is essential for improving theoretical constraints and developing better models of the influence of the SASM on southern hemisphere humidity. Additionally, evaluating the vertical and lateral extent of the SASM’s convective influence can provide important constraints for interpreting paleoclimate proxies in the region. We use data from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) to examine the vertical structure of the amount effect associated with the SASM and relate these results to regional convective precipitation and local subcloud equivalent potential temperature. Preliminary results show that DdD is below 0‰ from the boundary layer through the mid-troposphere over tropical South America during austral summer, and meridional averages show that convective precipitation is highest over these areas where DdD < 0‰ extends higher in the atmosphere. We hypothesize that the depth of convection in the monsoon region controls the vertical structure of DdD, which should also be coherently linked to local equivalent potential temperature.\n",

            "abstract": "The Columbia River Gorge separating Oregon and Washington provides an ideal setting to investigate how atmospheric circulation patterns determine types of emission sources contributing to atmospheric deposition. Up-gorge and down-gorge atmospheric circulation patterns each provide a different suite of emission sources. Up-gorge airflow originates in the Portland-Vancouver metro area dominated by urban and industrial sources. Down-gorge patterns originate in the Columbia River basin, which is dominated by agricultural production. We tested the dependence of emission sources contributing to atmospheric deposition on circulation patterns by measuring the isotopic composition of nitrate (NO3−) in 2003–2004 precipitation samples from the WA98-Columbia River Gorge NADP & USNIP site. Circulation patterns were determined using back-trajectory analysis with the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model using the archived EDAS meteorological dataset.\nWe observed a significant difference (P=0.01) between up-gorge and down-gorge patterns with mean δ15N-NO3− of +1.8 and −2.1‰ for up- and down-gorge, respectively. The differences observed between these two patterns is likely tied to the different emission sources of N found in these different geographic areas. The lower δ15N of down-gorge sources is due to the large amount of agricultural production in the Columbia River basin. Observed values for the up-gorge patterns likely result from industrial and fossil fuel emissions of NOx, the precursor of deposited NO3−, in the Portland-Vancouver area. The significantly greater amount of NO3− in precipitation from up-gorge patterns (0.72 mg/L) compared to down-gorge patterns (0.36 mg/L, P=0.01) supports the influence of urban sources rather than relatively clean marine air which characteristically has low amounts of NO3−. No significant differences are found in δ18Onitrate or Δ17Onitrate between the two patterns, suggesting that atmospheric chemistry between the two patterns is not greatly different. Differences in emission sources between geographic areas seem to drive the differences observed in the isotopic composition of N deposition between the different atmospheric circulation patterns in the Columbia River Gorge.",

Their general formula is T(A1-i)M(AiB2-i)X4 (A and B are cations, X are anions, T and M indicate tetrahedrally- and octahedrally-coordinated sites and i is the inversion degree). They are ideal materials to study the interplay between chemical substitutions, structure and the physical properties of solids. As spinel-structured ringwoodite (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 is the most abundant mineral in the lower transition zone, understanding the effect of chemical substitution on the elastic properties of spinels is of crucial for geophysics.\nWe have experimentally studied the variation of the elastic properties along the join MgAl2O4 – MnAl2O4. Crystals of 4 compositions along the join were synthesized at the very same experimental conditions and their crystal chemistry was fully characterized. Single-crystal elastic constants Cij of all the samples were measured by Brillouin spectroscopy at ambient conditions. For compositions with Mn/Mg < 0.5 C11 remains constant, then it decreases of ~4% for higher Mn contents. From MgAl2O4 to MnAl2O4 C12 lineraly increases ~ 5% and C44 decreases ~ 20% . The bulk modulus KS is almost constant, whereas the shear modulus G decreases ~ 18% across the join. The elastic constants of MnAl2O4 are C11 = 271.3 (± 1.3) GPa, C12 = 164.8 (± 1.3) GPa and C44 = 124.9 (5) GPa.\nUsing the empirical polyhedral approach [1] we have inferred the effectve polyhedral bulk moduli of Mg, Mn and Al in T and M sites. We observe that KMnM < KMgM < KMgT  ≈ KMnT < KAlM << KAlT. The relationship between polyhedral moduli and ionic potential IP [2] can be expressed as Ki j (GPa) = 20 ( ± 2) × IP + 108 (± 10), where i is the cation, j is the site and IP is in units of (e/Å). Using our correlation and atomic radii from [3] we successfully reproduced the bulk modulus of different oxide spinels with bi- and tri-valent cations. Our preliminary results confirm that empirical correlations based on experimental data and simple models of interatomic interactions can successfully reproduce the relationship between chemical composition and elastic properties of oxide spinels.\n",

Due to the well-known Red River fault zone play an important role in the evolution of the escape of the Indochina block, the southern part of this fault zone also exist another boundary fault zone, which is called Ma river fault. This area still exists many unknowns in the tectonic evolution. Therefore, this study analyzes teleseismic receiver functions to determine the crustal structure along the Ma river fault, northern Vietnam. We have selected teleseismic events with Mw≥5, and epicenter distance is between 30° and 90° and a Multiple-Taper Correlation (MTC) method is adapted to calculate receiver functions (RFs) for each station. The converted phase, such as P-to-S obtained from RFs, allows us to have insights on the characteristics of crustal structures including the dip of discontinuous interface and anisotropy as well. The above properties have significant effects on amplitudes and arrival time of RFs. Thus, we use Neighborhood Algorithm applied to receiver functions computed from 5 stations has yielded optimum crustal models that include anisotropy and has minimum misfit between the observed RFs and synthetic ones. Our preliminary results indicate that the depth of the Moho discontinuity in the Ma river fault zone is between 25 km and 35 km, the range of S-wave velocity is from 3.6 km/s to 4.5 km/s, and the orientations of crustal anisotropy are related with the local stress status as well. In addition, the low-velocity zone in the lower crust is observed beneath our study area. We hypothesize that the low-velocity zone in the lower crust might be caused by rising of upper mantle, or an extension of the low-velocity zone in the lower crust which is observed beneath the southeastern Tibet and the South China block.",

Recently, scientists from Taiwan and Germany are collaborating on a project to use a portable 3D seismic system, called P-Cable, to study gas hydrates offshore southwest Taiwan. We have collected 3 cubes, covering the active and passive margins. At these three sites, there is a wide-spread bottom-simulating reflector (BSR). We use the BSR to study the shallow thermal structures of these prospect sites, and use the temperature field information to study fluid migration patterns. We have also done in-situ heat flow measurements, and found similar results, showing focused fluid flow migrations in some pathways. Some of the high temperature fields also correlate with gas chimneys found through seismic attribute analyses. Preliminary results show that there might be active fluid migration above the BSR in the gas hydrate stability zone. In September and October of 2014, we will collect additional P-Cable datasets to be incorporated into this study. Such results will be used to evaluate some proposed sites for future drilling programs.",

            "abstract": "Catchment transit times (TT) and their transit time distributions (TTD) are a physical measure integrating all catchment processes, flow path variability, and the combined effects of water storage and water fluxes. TT and TTD are dynamic catchment descriptors that vary with flow paths, storage dynamics, and with the hydro-meteorological forcing. Here we present a new non-parametric framework that allows modeling of time-varying TT and the irregular-shape time-variant TTD based on measured tracer input and output and the hydrological fluxes from a catchment. We combine inverse modeling of the mixing state of the catchment with flux tracking. The objectives for this presentation are to (1) demonstrate the conceptual background and the validation of the approach in a proof of concept with artificial data (2) and apply it to an actual dataset from the well-characterized WS10 in the HJA Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. Applied to a virtual data set the model reproduces known isotope values and transit times with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of over 0.9, while it reproduces the observed 18oxygen signatures in WS10 with a NSE of 0.86. Transit time in WS 10 varies between approximately 250 and 550 days. The transit time distributions are highly irregular in shape; these distributions do not follow a predetermined distribution such as the gamma or exponential distributions. After 329 days, 50% of the water had left WS10 the catchment. This is in contrast with the mean transit time of 415 days. After 1049 days 90% of the water had left the system, while 10% of water left the catchment within 28 days.",

            "abstract": "Interior evolution models of Ceres suggest that the dwarf planet likely differentiated due radiogenic heating in its early history. These models suggest that Ceres now consists of a rocky silicate core overlain by a H2O ice mantle between 50 and 125 kilometers in thickness (McCord and Sotin, 2005, JGR, 100, EO5009). At depth, this water layer may exist in the form of a subsurface liquid ocean. While upcoming gravity measurements made by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft will be extremely useful in determining the depth and state of Ceres’ ice mantle, large impact basins on Ceres provide an independent means by which to estimate the thickness of Ceres’ icy shell. The crater size frequency distribution observed on Vesta implies that approximately 8 bodies larger than 40 km diameter have struck Ceres over the past 4.5 billion years, with the largest expected impactor being ~70 km in diameter (Rivkin and Asphaug, 2013, Proc. LPSC XLV, 1649). Numerical simulations suggest that the transient craters formed by such large collisions are deep enough to probe below Ceres’ icy mantle and deform the silicate core. Because of material differences between H2O and silicate, the presence of the core suppresses the downward flow of material during the crater excavation process. This results in shallower, wider transient cavities, and should cause an increase in the crater size frequency distribution at large sizes. This widening effect may be enhanced by the presence of a strength-less liquid H2O ocean above Ceres’ core mantle boundary. While large basins in H2O ice will likely relax viscously over relatively short timescales, Ceres’ largest impactors produce more permanent depressions at the crust mantle boundary, which may be detected as negative Bouguer anomalies in the Dawn recovered gravity field.",

Semi-volatile constituents of organic ambient aerosol are of particular interest as their partitioning between the vapor and aerosol phases is not well constrained by current atmospheric models and appears to play an important role in the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) as suggested by recent research.\nAn experimental setup consisting of a DMT CCN counter and SMPS downstream of a custom-built thermodenuder assembly was deployed during the summer 2014 DISCOVER-AQ field campaign to retrieve simultaneous, size-resolved volatility and hygroscopicity – through the use of scanning mobility CCN analysis (SMCA). Housed in the NASA Langley mobile laboratory, a suite of complimentary measurements were made available onboard including submicron aerosol composition and oxidation state provided by an HR-ToF-AMS, and aerosol optical properties provided by a range of other instruments including an SP2.\nAir masses sampled from locations across the Central Colorado region include influences from regional aerosol nucleation/growth events, long-range transport of Canadian biomass burning aerosols, cattle feedlot emissions and influences of the Denver urban plume – amidst a backdrop of widespread oil and gas exploration. The analysis focuses on the reconciliation of the retrieved aerosol volatility distributions and corresponding hygroscopicity and oxidation state observations, including the use of AMS factor analysis.",

            "abstract": "The new year started out with a bang in 2014 when a series of westerly wind bursts occurred west of the date line between January and April. These wind bursts generated a series of powerful downwelling Kelvin waves that led to anomalous warming in the equatorial cold tongue of the eastern Pacific, apparently signaling the onset of an El Niño. The Kelvin waves observed in February through April 2014 were as large as those seen at the onset of the 1997-98 El Niño, the strongest on record, leading to speculation that a major event was underway. Moreover, there was broad consensus among forecast models for development of an El Niño during the second half of 2014. Thus, the scientific community and the popular press were abuzz with the prospect of climate fireworks reminiscent of 1997-98. However, the atmosphere did not respond to the initial oceanic warming and the positive ocean-atmosphere feedbacks that characterize El Niño evolution did not materialize. At the time of this abstract submission in early August, the El Niño of 2014 appears to be moribund, if not dead. This presentation will describe what happened in the tropical Pacific this past year and address the question of why nature continues to surprise us.",

In 2013, Hansen et al. published a scientific paper in Science. They mapped global tree cover extent, loss and gain for the period from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30m, with loss allocated annually. They found a total of 2.3 million km2 of forest loss and 0.8 million km 2 of new forest established.\nConcerning loss, all stand-replacement disturbances were mapped, including mechanical removal (logging), fire and other factors such as storms and disease. The implications on carbon cycle dynamics are very different for these various causes of forest loss. For example, emissions from the various change dynamics vary greatly, and labeling forest loss by change factor will improve carbon cycle and carbon accounting efforts.\nIn this study, we will try to distinguish forest loss caused by fire and logging from other causes. We take Canada and the continental US as the study area, which were estimated to have lost 52.8 MHa forest from 2000 to 2012. Our preliminary results show that fire and logging are the dominant factors (>90%) of North American forest loss. We employ annual minimum NDVI band, annual ETM+ composites for band 3, band 4, band 5, band 7 from 1999 to 2012, and three derived bands from ETM+ composites (dataset A), together with the annual 30m global forest loss map (2001- 2012) (dataset B). The method can be divided into four parts: 1. Generate patches from dataset B. 2. Extract shape, spectral, texture and contextual features from dataset A, with a total of 445 features for each patch; 3. Classify the patches with those features using a bagged regression tree model; 4. Validate and evaluate the results. Mapping results and analysis will be presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Observations from natural vein systems suggest that preexisting veins can strongly influence orientation, continuity and connectivity of fractures in a rock even in cases where the orientation of the veins is incompatible with the orientation of the stress field.\nWe present a numerical method to model cycles of fracturing and sealing in a rotating stress field to simulate such systems, for different strength ratios of host rock and vein.\nWe study a layered model under vertical stress and uniaxial horizontal extension. This represents common conditions in sedimentary basins with layers of varying composition. The model with fractures that form during the first deformation phase is sealed and deformed again in a different direction to model the effect of a changing horizontal stress field. We find different types of fracture interaction with veins, depending on the strength contrast between veins and host rock and amount of rotation. The crack-seal and crack-jump mechanisms ensue naturally from the models as a result of the strength of the vein material relative to the host rock. Weak veins localize fracturing and reactivate, even in high misorientation to the extension direction. Connecting fractures between reactivated veins form at a higher angle to the veins than expected. In these systems, the connectivity of the fracture network is dramatically increased.\nVeins stronger than the host rock have less influence on the new fractures. Most fractures crosscut the veins by the step-over mechanism. Deflection occurs for favorable vein orientations but the deflection length is very short.\nThe results are in good agreement with natural crack seal vein networks found in carbonate rocks of the Oman Mountains.\nWe find that preexisting veins can change the fracture behavior of a rock in a way that new fractures do not necessarily align with the principle extension direction and form a highly connected network with reactivated veins that dramatically enhances lateral hydraulic conductivity of the rock.\nThe results allow formulating constitutive rules for the fracture behavior of rocks with veins that can be used to make predictions on the orientation and connectivity of fracture networks on a reservoir scale to use in THMC models.\nFurthermore they have implications for paleostress analysis based on crack seal vein networks.",

It plays a large role in mixing and contamination of magmas, double-diffusive convection of magmas, and growth or dissolution of minerals in magma. The often-observed uphill diffusion profiles in natural systems and experiments require multicomponent diffusion treatment, but that has not been done. Instead, effective binary diffusion approximation has been widely used to treat chemical diffusion of components without uphill diffusion, even though it doesn’t offer a consistent model for diffusion in a multicomponent system. In this report, we follow a long series of efforts in studying multicomponent diffusion in various melt systems (including SiO2-Al2O3-CaO, SiO2-Al2O3-MgO, SiO2-Al2O3-MgO-CaO, SiO2-Al2O3-Na2O-K2O-H2O and a basaltic melt).\nChemical diffusion experiments in a haplobasaltic melt SiO2-TiO2-Al2O3-MgO-CaO-Na2O-K2O (50% SiO2, 1.5% TiO2, 15% Al2O3, 10% MgO, 19% CaO, 3% Na2O, 1.5% K2O) were conducted at 1500°C and 1 GPa. Nine successful experiments were carried out, of which 8 had initial compositions differing in only one independent component by 3 wt% (and compensated by SiO2). The concentration profiles in all 9 experiments were simultaneously fit using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to obtain the 6 × 6 diffusion matrix. All features in the 7 concentration profiles of 9 experiments are well reproduced by the obtained diffusion matrix. More experiments will be carried out to further understand multicomponent diffusion, and we will use the diffusion matrix to simulate diffusion in natural systems.",

A number of questions about the sign and magnitude of post-Snowball sea-level change arise from stratigraphic studies of Neoproterozoic glaciations. For instance, can a local geological inference of the magnitude of transgression provide a robust estimate of the eustatic (globally averaged) sea-level rise associated with the deglaciation? If not, what is the range of geographic variability in regional sea-level change driven by deglaciation? Is this variability a strong function of the duration of the deglaciation? What circumstances could lead to a regional regression interrupting a glacioeustatic transgression?\nIn this talk, we explore the spatial and temporal variability of post-Marinoan Snowball sea-level change using a gravitationally self-consistent theory that accounts for the gravitational, deformational, and rotational perturbations to sea level on a viscoelastic Earth model. We apply the theory to model a Marinoan Snowball deglaciation across a generalized Ediacaran paleogeography with a synthetic ice sheet distribution. We demonstrate that the sea-level change following a synchronous and rapid (2 kyr) collapse of Snowball ice cover would exhibit significant geographic variability, producing local sea-level records characterized by syn-deglacial sea-level rise, fall and stillstand. Both asynchronous melting and longer-duration deglaciation scenarios (5 – 200 kyr) introduce additional complexity into the predicted timing and geometry of the computed post-glacial sea-level change; these complexities include zones of syn-deglacial regression followed by transgression and the possibility of major transgression (and, thus, deposition) that is not limited to the deglaciation phase. These results suggest that sea-level change recorded by strata capping Snowball glaciogenic units could record a far more complicated trajectory than simple transgression.",

The ionic charge state composition of ejecta material is determined by the temperature and density evolution of plasma during eruptive flares. We will investigate the flare contribution to CME heating by examining the relationship between observed profiles of flare emission and the corresponding in situ ionic charge state observations.

            "abstract": "The high power HAARP HF transmitter is employed to generate and study strong Langmuir turbulence (SLT) in the interaction region of overdense ionospheric plasma. Diagnostics included the Modular UHF Ionospheric Radar (MUIR) sited at HAARP, the SuperDARN-Kodiak HF radar, and HF receivers to record stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE). Dependence of diagnostic signals on HAARP HF parameters, including pulselength, duty-cycle, aspect angle, and frequency were recorded. Short pulse, low duty cycle experiments demonstrate control of artificial field-aligned irregularities (AFAI) and isolation of ponderomotive effects. For the first time, simultaneous multi-angle radar measurements of plasma line spectra are recorded demonstrating marked dependence on aspect angle with the strongest interaction region observed displaced southward of the HF zenith pointing angle. For a narrow range of HF pointing between Spitze and magnetic zenith, a reduced threshold for AFAI is observed. High time resolution studies of the temporal evolution of the plasma line reveal the appearance of an overshoot effect on ponderomotive timescales. Numerous measurements of the outshifted plasma line are observed. Experimental results are compared to previous high latitude experiments and predictions from recent modeling efforts",

            "abstract": "In 2014, the R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP1402) sailed to a virtually unexplored continental shelf along the Sabrina Coast, East Antarctica. The shelf contains the sedimentary record of environmental and ice volume changes within the Aurora Subglacial Basin (ASB), which is presently occupied by ~7 m sea level-rise equivalent of ice. We acquired 750 km of high-resolution seismic data proximal to the Reynolds Trough and Moscow University Ice Shelf glacial systems west of the Dalton Ice Tongue using dual 45/45 cu. in. G.I. guns and a 24 ch. streamer with 3.125 m groups providing a vertical resolution of ~3 m simultaneously with CHIRP data. These are the first images of this margin acquired and show a remarkable set of sequence stratigraphic transitions. Crystalline basement is at the seafloor landward and buried seaward with a transition to smoother reflection interface. Reflective sedimentary strata overlie the basement, dip seaward, and are capped by a landward-dipping regional angular unconformity. Above this are a series of transparent seismic facies that, along with the middle to outer shelf seafloor, dip landward towards a shelf-oblique glacial trough. The older, seaward-dipping strata include a deeper series of units that display at least three stratal architectures interpreted to be shelf deltas implying a pre-glacial, fluvial environment within the drainage basin. Above these sequences, the seismic facies transition to surfaces exhibiting significant erosion, small u-shaped valleys, and channel fill sequences, all of which are reminiscent of temperate glacial features. We interpret these sequences as including sub-ice tunnel valleys and grounding zone wedges with interspersed non-glacial to pro-glacial deposits. Increasing glaciogenic facies upsection suggests a gradual fluvial to glacial transition and increasing glacial extent with time. The subsequent transition to ice sheets is marked by erosion to basement landward and the angular unconformity seaward. The unconformity is overlain by glacial diamict, representing an incomplete record of cold-based glaciations after the ASB became ice-filled. Correlations with cores collected above and below the unconformity and deltaic unit should allow us to determine the ages of these transitions from fluvial to polythermal to ice sheets in East Antarctica.",

In this study, all weather canopy sky temperatures were retrieved using the passive microwave remote sensing data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) over the Amazon and Congo rainforests. The remote sensing data used were collected from 1996 to 2012 using two separate satellites—F13 (1996-2009) and F17 (2007-2012). An inter-sensor calibration between the brightness temperatures collected by the two satellites was conducted in order to ensure consistency amongst the instruments. The interannual changes of LST associated with the dry and wet anomalies were investigated in both regions. The dominant spatial and temporal patterns for inter-seasonal variations of the LST over the tropical rainforest were analyzed, and the impacts of droughts and El Niños (on LST) were also investigated. The remote sensing results suggest that the morning LST is mainly controlled by atmospheric humidity (which controls longwave radiation) whereas the late afternoon LST is controlled by solar radiation.",

            "abstract": "Although we were not involved in the 2013 US GEOTRACES zonal transect in the eastern tropical south Pacific, our results in the central tropical Pacific are complementary in that they shed light on the extensive hydrothermal plume emanating from the East Pacific Rise (EPR). Specifically, we have analyzed dissolved 230Th concentrations at high-resolution within the water column at two locations (ML1208-12CTD; 8° 19.989’ N, 159° 18.000’ W, and ML1208-03CTD; 00° 13.166’ S, 155° 57.668’ W) sampled as part of a cruise to the Line Islands. The pattern of the dissolved 230Th concentration profile at 8°N is essentially linear from the surface to 2000 m and generally follows a reversible scavenging model. However, from 2000 m to 3000 m, the dissolved 230Th concentrations are constant, before linearly increasing again from 3000 m to the bottom. At this site dissolved 230Th concentrations range from 1.06 fg/kg at 100 m to 55.15 fg/kg at 4600 m. At the equator, dissolved 230Th concentrations are slightly lower, and range from undetectable at 25 m to 19.07 fg/kg at 3038 m. A nearly indistinguishable pattern in dissolved 230Th concentrations occurs in the profile at the equator compared to that from 8°N. The deep-water deviation from linearity between 2 and 3 km in the 230Th profiles (lower concentrations than expected) at both sites coincides well with the interval of the water column which has the highest concentrations of 3He. This 3He-rich signal has been traced to hydrothermal plumes from the EPR, thousands of km away (Lupton et al., 1998). We hypothesize that the lower concentrations of 230Th in deep waters of the central equatorial Pacific are a result of: 1) scavenging of water-column 230Th by Fe-Mn particulates contained within the EPR hydrothermal plume, and 2) lateral export of these 230Th-deficient deep waters approximately 7000 km westward. We will discuss the implications that the transport of this signature across vast distances has on water residence and transport times.\n",

The hydrodynamic component of the model has been previously validated against analytical and 3D numerical modeling results and has been shown to accurately reproduce flow field features critical to delta dynamics at the level of channel processes such as backwater profile, flow around a mouth bar, flow through a single bifurcation, and flow partitioning at the network scale.\nHere we focus on the morphodynamic component of DeltaRCM to: (1) identify a set of robust metrics to be used for validating morphodynamic models; (2) validate DeltaRCM results against a set of experimental and field data; and (3) investigate delta morphodynamics, especially the evolution of the channel network over time and the distribution of sand and mud in the stratigraphic record. The metrics analyzed span surface (e.g., channel density and wet fraction) and subsurface properties (e.g., sedimentograph and index of compensational stacking), as well as the system’s dynamic behavior (e.g., avulsion time scale and shoreline trajectory). These metrics are used to compare the model’s behavior to field and experimental data representing a range of boundary conditions, such as varying basin geometry, base-level cycles, and sediment input. The validation results show the range of applicability of our reduced complexity approach to modeling morphodynamics. DeltaRCM is then applied to investigate the deposition of sand and mud as a function of time and location for varying basin depth.",

Examining local time variations in the magnetosphere has shown some interesting phenomena. One of the primary expressions of the dynamics we observe in Saturn’s magnetosphere are plasma interchange fingers. These fingers carry hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere to the inner magnetosphere to balance magnetic flux lost due to outward radial transport of cold dense plasma sourced from the neutral cloud. This process leads to a mixing of hot and cold plasma throughout the magnetosphere. Understanding how mass interchange fingers form and quantifying how the plasma they contain is heated and transported will be important for understanding other dynamic processes occurring in the magnetosphere.\nIn this study, we will be using our existing multifluid simulation of Saturn’s magnetosphere in combination with data from the Cassini mission in order to investigate the formation of plasma interchange fingers and their dynamics. Our results will be compared with observations as well as previous modeling studies of Saturn’s interchange fingers.",

            "abstract": "The Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor Estuary (BB-LEH) is a shallow, poorly flushed system bordered by a highly developed watershed. It is therefore very susceptible to nutrient enrichment. The Estuary is classified as a highly eutrophic system with episodic recurrences of brown tides and other microalgal blooms, loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, and decline of hard clam stock and harvest. A recent USGS report showed that TN and TP loading from surface runoff increased nearly 90% from 1995 to 2010 in BB-LEH, with the northern most developed embayment accounting for more than 60% of annual load. Understanding the relationships between the ongoing nutrient input and phytoplankton community change is essential for water quality assessment and management in the BB-LEH Estuary. We investigated the phytoplankton community in BB-LEH from September 2011 to August 2013. Monthly and biweekly samples were collected by the NJDEP Water Quality Monitoring program from 9 sites in the first year, and 6 of those same sites in the second year. Analysis of phytoplankton included species identification and enumeration, and calculation of cell density and biovolume. Notable seasonal and spatial variation in species composition and succession were observed in both years. Picoplankton was dominant during summer in both years and appeared more persistent in northern Barnegat Bay (June to October) compared to southern sites (June-August). Brown tide alga, Aureococcus anophagefferens, was detected from southern Barnegat Bay and Little Egg Harbor at cell densities of 105 to 106 L-1, relatively low compared to other picoplankton. Species similarity analysis using 2011-2012 data identified three segments from north to south: northern Barnegat Bay, southern Barnegat Bay and Little Egg Harbor. Noticeable year-to-year differences in phytoplankton assemblages and species succession were observed in all segments. The particular year to year change in phytoplankton in this study may have been affected by the strong impact of Hurricane Sandy. Multivariate analyses are underway to assess the patterns in the phytoplankton community, including spatial-temporal variations and the extent to which measured environmental variables can explain the observed phytoplankton assemblage changes.",

            "abstract": "The increasing use of mobile phones equipped with digital cameras and the ability to post images and information to the Internet in real-time has significantly improved the ability to report events almost instantaneously. In the context of severe weather reports, a representative digital image conveys significantly more information than a simple text or phone relayed report to a weather forecaster issuing severe weather warnings. It also allows the forecaster to reasonably discern the validity and quality of a storm report. Posting geo-located, time stamped storm report photographs utilizing a mobile phone application to NWS social media weather forecast office pages has generated recent positive feedback from forecasters. Building upon this feedback, this discussion advances the concept, development, and implementation of a formalized Photo Storm Report (PSR) mobile application, processing and distribution system and Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System II (AWIPS-II) plug-in display software.\nThe PSR system would be composed of three core components: i) a mobile phone application, ii) a processing and distribution software and hardware system, and iii) AWIPS-II data, exchange and visualization plug-in software. i) The mobile phone application would allow web-registered users to send geo-location, view direction, and time stamped PSRs along with severe weather type and comments to the processing and distribution servers. ii) The servers would receive PSRs, convert images and information to NWS network bandwidth manageable sizes in an AWIPS-II data format, distribute them on the NWS data communications network, and archive the original PSRs for possible future research datasets. iii) The AWIPS-II data and exchange plug-ins would archive PSRs, and the visualization plug-in would display PSR locations, times and directions by hour, similar to surface observations. Hovering on individual PSRs would reveal photo thumbnails and clicking on them would display the full resolution photograph.\nHere, we present initial NWS forecaster feedback received from social media posted PSRs, motivating the possible advantages of PSRs within AWIPS-II, the details of developing and implementing a PSR system, and possible future applications beyond severe weather reports and AWIPS-II.",

            "abstract": "As part of the Alaska Earthquake Center’s effort to create customized and relevant products to diverse Alaskan communities, we have embarked on a process to take results from ShakeMap and tailor them to state needs. We have created customized ShakeMaps, produced shaking estimates for small communities that may not be obvious on large-scale maps, and greatly expanded a suite of earthquake scenarios throughout the state for use in hazard assessment and disaster preparation. These efforts have the combined goal helping Alaskans better prepare for the possibility of a damaging earthquake in their community. ShakeMap is a well-regarded system created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to produce maps of measured and predicted ground-motions for real and scenario earthquakes; many seismic networks throughout the world use it operationally. The Earthquake Center routinely uses ShakeMap to provide general information about recent earthquakes to stakeholders and the public. Customized ShakeMaps are produced for notable earthquakes near the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and made available to Alyeska, the pipeline operator. These ShakeMaps are part of a larger system to alert Alyeska of any strong motions that could cause damage to the pipeline infrastructure to help minimize economic and environmental issues. However, despite being the most seismically active state in the United States, limited work has been done to assess possible earthquake scenarios in much of the state and even fewer of the end products are known to residents, many of whom live in small towns and villages, isolated both in distance and in infrastructure from the rest of the population. ShakeMap scenarios are visual representations of earthquake data that have tremendous outreach value as a stand-alone product. For many of the scenarios, we have used earthquake parameters pulled from the numerous notable earthquakes in the history of the state, from the well-known (2004 M7.9 Denali Fault, 1964 M9.2 Good Friday), to the unexpected (M5.7 near the village of Noatak in 2014). Many of these earthquakes occurred before a true seismic network existed in the state, limiting what data products are available. Working with partner local, state, and federal agencies, these scenarios form the initial framework for assessing hazards and loss modeling throughout the state.",

Characterizing the conditions that control phase changes and the microphysical properties of mixed-phase clouds is important for improving understanding of physical processes that influence cloud phase. We characterize the aerosol and cloud microphysical properties in relation to the atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic conditions observed in mixed-phase clouds during several aircraft-based field experiments. The Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program’s Gulfstream-1 aircraft was used to sample aerosol and cloud properties in warm and cold clouds during several recent field experiments. We analyze in-situ observations from the CalWater and TCAP field campaigns to examine the variability of cloud properties (phase, hydrometeor size, ice and liquid water content, particle habit) with changes in aerosol, vertical velocity, and temperature. These measurements indicate that in addition to aerosol concentration, vertical velocity strength has important influence on cloud phase in mixed-phase cloud regimes.",

            "abstract": "External climatic or geologic controls on landscape topography such as tectonics or glacial drainage might impose constraints on the landscape resulting in a spatial organization of rivers and valleys which does not obey the typical self-similar or self-affine relationships found in most landscapes. The goal of this study is to quantify the multi-scale landscape organization, extract the range of scales at which self-similarity breaks down, and provide insight into how such an analysis can be used as a diagnostic tool for understanding landscape evolution and external controls that might have shaped the landscape dissection. The Headwaters and Methow River Basins (located in North-West Minnesota and North-Central Washington, respectively) are selected as our case studies as they have completely different geologies, river network topology, and surface topography. A two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform with its powerful localization property is applied both as a multi-scale decomposition and reconstruction tool and its superiority over the Fourier decomposition is demonstrated. The wavelet spectrum of the Headwaters topography reveals the emergence of a spectral gap at certain range of scales, which is the first signature of dissimilarity for this landscape. The characteristic scales attached to the spectral gap were found to correspond to the distance between the quasi-periodic ridges and valleys forming regularity in the landscape topography, as forced by larger-scale geologic controls. Furthermore, by applying entropy-based metrics on the multi-scale reconstructed landscapes, we identify the scales at which the organization is “very tight” documenting once again the influence of external controls on such a preferential organization.",

            "abstract": "Plate rigidity is one of the main paradigms of plate tectonics and a fundamental assumption in the definition of a global reference frame as ITRF.\nAlthough still far for optimal, the increased GPS instrumentation of the African region can allow us to understand how rigid one of the major plate can be. The presence of diffused band of seismicity, the Cameroon volcanic line, Pan African Kalahari orogenic belt and East Africa Rift suggest the possibility of relative motion among the different regions within the Nubia. The study focuses on the rigidity of Nubia plate. We divide the plate into three regions: Western (West Africa craton plus Nigeria), Central (approximately the region of the Congo craton) and Southern (Kalahari craton plus South Africa) and we utilize Euler Vector formulation to study internal rigidity and eventual relative motion.\nDeveloping five different reference frames with different combinations of the 3 regions, we try to understand the presence of the relative motion between the 3 cratons thus the stability of the Nubia plate as a whole. All available GPS stations from the regions are used separately or combined in creation of the reference frames. We utilize continuous stations with at least 2.5 years of data between 1994 and 2014.\nGiven the small relative velocity, it is important to eliminate eventual biases in the analysis and to have a good estimation in the uncertainties of the observed velocities. For this reason we perform our analysis using both Bernese and Gipsy-oasis codes to generate time series for each station. Velocities and relative uncertainties are analyzed using the Allan variance of rate technique, taking in account for colored noise. An analysis of the color of the noise as function of latitude and climatic region is also performed to each time series.\nPreliminary results indicate a slight counter clockwise motion of West Africa craton with respect to South Africa Kalahari, and South Africa Kalahari-Congo Cratons. In addition, a possible counter clockwise rotation of the South African Kalahari craton with respect to the Nubian plate caused by southward propagation of the East Africa Rift is compatible with the observations. However, the results are at the limit of the statistical significance and within the current velocity uncertainties the Nubia plate appears as single- rigid plate.",

            "abstract": "The thick ice sheets that cover over 97% of the Antarctic continent make it difficult to study its geology. Seismic and other geophysical methods are the most effective ways to obtain information in this remote location. Using the classic receiver function technique, the P-to-S (Ps) conversion from the crust-mantle boundary is often masked by the ice multiples. Although removing these multiples by computational methods has been done, S-wave receiver functions (SRF) are a viable alternative and complementary method to estimate the crustal structure using S-to-P (Sp) conversions, which do not interfere with the ice multiples. In this project, we analyzed the data from the TAMSEIS, GAMSEIS and POLENET/ANET temporary seismic deployments. Sp arrival times are observed at ~5-6s in the Transantarctic Mountains and Wilkes Basin region, ~6-8s in the Gamburtsev Mountains and Vostok Higlands, and ~3-4s in the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS) and Marie Byrd Land Dome area. We used a grid search approach, combining the Sp time with Rayleigh wave phase velocities for 18 to 30 seconds, to estimate the Moho depth at each of the ice stations in the networks. The Moho depths obtained using these Sp times ranged from 28-45km, 37-59km and 16-35km respectively for the three general areas. We stacked the SRFs for several stations regionally in an attempt to obtain a qualitative view of the upper mantle structure. Most of the regional stacks do not show clear signs of seismic velocity discontinuities in the upper mantle.",

In addition, data from satellite-based laser altimetry (e.g. ICESat’s GLAS instrument) have been used to estimate vegetation heights, aboveground carbon, and topography in forested areas. With the upcoming ICESAT-2 satellite scheduled to launch in 2017, we have the potential to map vegetation characteristics and dynamics in other ecosystems, including semiarid and low-height ecosystems, at global and regional scales. The ICESat-2 satellite will include the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) with a configuration of 6 laser beams with 532 nm wavelength and photon counting detectors. We will demonstrate the potential of ICESat-2 to provide estimates of vegetation structure and topography in a dryland ecosystem by simulating the configuration of the ATLAS mission. We will also examine how airborne LiDAR can be used together with ICESat-2 and other satellite data to achieve estimates of aboveground carbon. We will explore how these data may be used for future monitoring and quantification of spatial and temporal changes in aboveground carbon and topography.",

            "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important precursors of ozone and secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere, some of which are carcinogenic, teratogenic, or mutagenic. VOCs in ambient air originate from many sources, including vehicle exhausts, gasoline evaporation, solvent use, natural gas emissions, and industrial processes, and undergo intricate chemical reactions in the atmosphere. To develop efficient air pollution remediation strategies, it is important to clearly identify the emission sources and elucidate the reaction mechanisms in the atmosphere.\nRecently, stable carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) of VOCs in some sources and ambient air have been measured by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS). In this study, we measured δ13C and stable hydrogen isotope ratios (δD) of atmospheric VOCs by using the gas chromatography/thermal conversion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry coupled with a thermal desorption instrument (TD-GC/TC/IRMS).\nThe wider δD differences between sources were found in comparison with the δ13C studies. Therefore, determining δD values of VOCs in ambient air is potentially useful in identifying VOC sources and their reactive behavior in the atmosphere. However, to elucidate the sources and behavior of atmospheric VOCs more accurately, isotopic fractionation during atmospheric reaction must be considered.\nIn this study, we determined isotopic fractionation of the δ13C and δD values for the atmospheric some VOCs under irradiation conditions.　As the results, δ13C for target all VOCs and δD for most VOCs were increasing after irradiation. But, the δD values for both benzene and toluene tended to decrease as irradiation time increased. We also estimated the fractionation factors for benzene and toluene, 1.27 and 1.05, respectively, which differed from values determined in previous studies. In summary, we were able to identify an inverse isotope effect for the δD values of benzene and toluene under ultraviolet irradiation, which might provide a new approach for studying photochemical reactions of volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Xigaze ophiolite is located at the central Yarlung Zangbo Suture Zone, southern Tibet representing the remnants of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere. It displays well preserved sections from mantle to crustal rocks, together with overlying marine sediments. The Xigaze peridotites have low CaO and Al2O3 contents and U-shaped REE patterns, suggesting that they are residues after moderate to high degrees of partial melting and were modified by infiltration of LREE-enriched boninitic melts. Two of five massifs from the Xigaze pillow lavas display tholeiitic affinity, while other three massifs show calcalkalic characteristics. The latter lavas show more HFSE-depleted and LILE-enriched compositions than those of the former. The latest diabase dikes possess high SiO2 and low TiO2 contents and show flat to LREE enrichment patterns, indicating they are analogue with boninitic rocks. Tholeiitic lavas were formed via decompression melting of a fertile lherzolitic source, whereas calcalkalic lavas and latest stage dikes were generated by melting of residual harzburgite and were influenced by slab-derived fluids. Both mantle and crustal rocks were invaded by plagiogranite dikes. The first plagiogranite group invaded into the crustal rocks lies on a continuation of the chemical trends defined by the mafic rocks and show similar REE patterns with the lavas, indicating they were generated by shallow fractional crystallisation. The second plagiogranite group invaded into the mantle displays different trends on Harker and REE patterns with diabase dike and enclave, but show uniform LREE depletion similar with mafic rocks, suggesting that they might be the product of subducted mafic slabs melting. LA-ICPMS zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf analyses from the second plagiogranites reveal that they were generated between 125-122 Ma, indistinguishable from those of mafic rocks. The zircons possess positive εHf(t) values ranging from +12.3 to +16.4, suggesting they were derived from depleted source. Taking into account the geological and geochronological characteristics of the Xigaze ophiolite, we propose they were formed in a forearc setting through rapid slab rollback during subduction initiation between 127-122 Ma.",

One sector of the U.S. National Emission Inventory (NEI), crop residue burning, has been difficult to characterize. Previous “bottom up” efforts have resulted in omissions in some regions and unrealistic gradients of emissions across state boundaries. This work integrates daily fire locations from NOAA’s Hazard Mapping System (HMS), burn scar products from NASA satellite imagery, and updated emission factors to build an improved characterization of temporally and spatially resolved emission datasets for regional air quality modeling. Comparisons with earlier estimates show significant changes in the temporal and spatial distribution of crop residue burning emissions. Results from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system exercised at a 12 km resolution across the continental U.S. show relatively small but appreciable changes in fine particulate (PM2.5) concentrations over parts of the modeling domain.",

            "abstract": "Columnar joints are spectacular features of volcanic rocks, which form by cracking during cooling-induced contraction of lava. The process, and resultant geometry, manifests a complex interplay between heat dissipation, contraction and tensile strength, yet the formation temperature of such joints remains elusive. Here, we present results from a combination of field survey, thermo-analytical characterisation and mechanical investigation to constrain conditions favourable for columnar jointing.\nColumnar joints at Seljavellir, a basaltic lava flow at the base of Eyjafjallajökull volcano (Iceland) produce quadratic to heptagonal cross sectional patterns with column widths ranging from 20 to 70 cm in size. The fracture surfaces are characterised by striae with spacing (between 1 to 6 cm) that shares a positive linear relationship to the joint spacing. The striae exhibit both a rough and smooth portion, interpreted to express a change in deformation regime from a ductile response as stress builds up to a fully brittle, mode-I fracture propagation at high stress accumulation.\nTo test the thermo-mechanics of columnar joints we developed an experimental setup to investigate the stress, strain-to-failure and temperature at which basalts undergo tensile failure during cooling from the solidus temperature of 980 °C. We find that fractures initiate at ~800 °C, revealed by a change in stress accumulation (i.e., Young modulus), and complete failure completes after some 0.4% strain at ~670 °C. We interpret the two-stage fracture dynamics as the cause for the change in fracture surface roughness observed in nature.\nWe coupled this dataset with Brazil tensile tests at 30, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 °C. We note that the strain to failure decrease from 1% (>800 °C) to 0.4% (<800 °C). Complementary dilatometric measurements (at 3mN of normal stress and a rate of 2 C/min) constrain the expansion coefficient to be linear and equal to 10-5/°C below the solid temperature. Simple ratio between strain-to-failure and expansion coefficient suggests that 400 °C of cooling (from the solidus) is require to achieve tensile failure by thermal contraction, supporting the first suite of experiments. We conclude that columnar jointing is not a phenomenon that takes place in molten lava, but rather occurs well within the solid state of volcanic rocks.",

            "abstract": "Rapid urbanisation results in increased water consumption in cities, requiring improved tools for understanding adaptive measures for water resources management under climate change. The energy sector is facing the same challenges and requires equally comprehensive solutions. More frequent water shortages due to climate and land use changes and potential limits on CO2 emissions from fossil fuels that science demands indicate clearly that the next step in the sustainable city development will be to look for the most efficient use of these highly interdependent resources. One of the concepts that could be used for quantifying fundamental flows in an urban environment such as water and energy is the urban metabolism framework. This paper will examine the concept of urban metabolism by quantifying amounts and trends of water and energy consumed in London by four main sectors: residential, industrial, commercial and public. Key data requirements at the sector level will be identified and initial mapping of critical factors for urban sustainability will be provided. Finally, the work will examine the potential of urban metabolism framework to provide data and information for implementing water, energy and greenhouse emissions trade-off ‘fit-for-purpose’ strategy for water supply security.\nThe paper is a part of the Panta Rhei Research Initiative of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) under the working group of Energy and Food Impacts on Water.",

            "abstract": "Although Holocene diatom records from southern California lakes have been difficult to obtain, diatoms have been found in Lower Bear Lake (LBL) sediments, providing a 9200-year hydroclimatological record for the San Bernardino Mountains. Based on several physical and chemical properties as well as gastropod and ostracod assemblages. Kirby et al. (2012, QSR,46:57-65) inferred nine decadal to multi-centennial pluvial episodes (five major (PE-V to PE-I), four minor (PE-IIIa-c, PE-IIa) in sediment core BBLVC05-1 (34o15’20” N, 116o55’20” W; 4.5 m long). Here, we consider the implications of this new diatom data. The diatom record shows a gradual increase in salinity during the Holocene, corroborating the inference of decreasing lake size made by Kirby et al. (2012). The longest pluvial (PE-V; 9170?-8250 cal yr BP), is dominated by small fragilaroid taxa, indicating fresh, slightly alkaline waters. An increase in halophilic taxa at ~8700 cal yr BP suggests a several-decades-long drier interval within the pluvial. PE-IV (7000-6400 cal yr BP) is dominated by benthic taxa, including relatively high numbers of epiphytic taxa, indicating an increase in aquatic macrophytes. The abundance of Aulacoseira in PE-IV and PE-III (3350-3000 cal yr BP) suggests increased turbulence due to increased storminess. PE-III and PE-II (850-700 cal yr BP) contain greater abundances of benthic (epiphytic) and halophilic species, although the latter never dominate the assemblage. PE-I (500-476 cal yr BP) was not sampled. Aerophilic taxa comprise up to 3% of the assemblage during pluvial events suggesting increased erosion during those periods and the presence of symbiotic species throughout the record indicates nitrogen-depleted waters. The diatom data generally support the occurrence of multiple pluvials over the Holocene with the most sustained occurring in the early Holocene. Furthermore, the diatom data suggest LBL likely diminished in size through the Holocene becoming more saline in the late Holocene. This decrease in size may have been a response to an insolation-forced decrease in winter season precipitation with a negligible contribution from the North American Monsoon.",

            "abstract": "The maximum level that water reaches during a storm depends on changes of mean sea level and storminess. Increase of mean sea level can be caused by mass addition, steric effects and land subsidence. Changes of storminess will change the height of ocean waves and storm surges. This study proposes a methodology for estimating the change of maximum water level at the coast as it results from the superposition of these different factors, and applies it to climate change scenario simulations in the Mediterranean Sea. The analysis is based on a 7-member ensemble of regional climate model simulations covering the period 1951-2050 under the A1B emission scenario. Models that include a high resolution Mediterranean Sea circulation component have been used for diagnosing the steric sea level change. Model sea level pressure and wind fields are used for forcing a hydro-dynamical shallow water model (HYPSE), wind fields are used for forcing a wave model (WAM), obtaining estimates of storm surges and ocean waves, respectively. The climate change signal is computed as the difference between water level maxima in the 1971-2000 and 2021-2050 period. Results show that in the next decades storm surge level and wave height will decrease and partially compensate for the increase of maximum water level produced by the positive steric effect.",

            "abstract": "Plant traits determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services, and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Plant traits thus are a key to understand and predict the adaptation of ecosystems to environmental changes. At the same time ground based measurements of plant trait data are dispersed over a wide range of databases, many of these not publicly available. To overcome this deficiency IGBP and DIVERSITAS have initiated the development of a joint database, called TRY, aiming at constructing a standard resource of ground based plant trait observations for the ecological community and for the development of global vegetation models.\nSo far the TRY initiative has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: about 250 trait databases have been contributed and the data repository currently contains about 5.6 million trait entries for 90,000 out of the world's 350,000 plant species. The database includes data for 1100 traits, characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence.\nBased on advanced methods for gap-filling and spatial extrapolation currently being developed in applied statistics and machine learning and in combination with environmental information and species distribution ranges, the unprecedented availability of ground based trait measurements is expected to allow for up-scaling of trait observations from plant to ecosystem level and from point measurements to regional and global scales. These up-scaled data products are expected to provide a link from ground based trait measurements to remote sensing of vegetation function and traits with global coverage.",

            "abstract": "Invasive species can have a profound impact on the ecosystems to which they are introduced. Beginning in 2003, the Platte River, Nebraska, USA, was invaded by an aggressive species of wetland grass, Phragmites australis. The invasion by Phragmites, in combination with river flow reductions due to agricultural irrigation, has drastically altered the character and morphology of the river. Once a braided and largely unvegetated river, the Platte had become densely colonized with vegetation by 2010. We measured some physical and biochemical characteristics of Platte River sediments to infer how that vegetation has changed the system. Specifically, we measured particle size, which is an indicator of flow velocity, and biogenic silica (BSi), which is a critical source of silicon for some aquatic organisms. Sediment was collected from areas of the riverbed that are unvegetated, and from areas that are occupied by Phragmites or native vegetation. Particle size was measured using a laser diffractometer to determine how much fine particle deposition was occurring. Biogenic silica (BSi) concentrations were measured using timed NaOH digestions and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Our results indicate that stands of Phragmites in the Platte River cause more deposition of finer silt-sized particles than other parts of the river that are unvegetated or are occupied by native vegetation. Also, Phragmites increased the sequestration of BSi in the river sediments. These changes to the Platte reverberate beyond the river itself; by sequestering silica in sediments, Phragmites could be diminishing the supply of silica to estuaries and coastal oceans. Hypothesizing that the silica content of the Platte’s water had been reduced by the arrival of Phragmites, we measured dissolved (DSi) and biogenic silica (BSi) concentrations of Platte water using ICP-MS to compare to existing data from the 1990s.",

            "abstract": "Spatial visualization is an essential skill in the STEM disciplines, including the geosciences. Undergraduate students, including geoscience majors in upper-level courses, bring a wide range of spatial skill levels to the classroom. Students with weak spatial skills may be unable to understand fundamental concepts and to solve geological problems with a spatial component. However, spatial thinking skills are malleable. As a group of geoscience faculty members and cognitive psychologists, we have developed a set of curricular materials for Mineralogy, Sedimentology & Stratigraphy, and Structural Geology courses. These materials are designed to improve students’ spatial skills, and in particular to improve students’ abilities to reason about spatially complex 3D geological concepts and problems. Teaching spatial thinking in the context of discipline-based exercises has the potential to transform undergraduate STEM education by removing one significant barrier to success in the STEM disciplines.\nThe curricular materials we have developed are based on several promising teaching strategies that have emerged from cognitive science research on spatial thinking. These strategies include predictive sketching, making visual comparisons, gesturing, and the use of analogy. We have conducted a three-year study of the efficacy of these materials in strengthening the spatial skills of students in upper-level geoscience courses at three universities. Our methodology relies on a pre- and post-test study design, with several tests of spatial thinking skills administered at the beginning and end of each semester. In 2011-2012, we used a “business as usual” approach to gather baseline data, measuring how much students’ spatial thinking skills improved in response to the existing curricula. In the two subsequent years we have incorporated our new curricular materials, which can be found on the project website: http://serc.carleton.edu/spatialworkbook/activities.html\nStructural Geology students exposed to the new curricular materials are better able to solve some spatially challenging structural geological problems than students from the baseline year. We are continuing to analyze data from the Mineralogy and Sedimentology/Stratigraphy courses and will have completed the analysis by AGU.",

The 56 amu/e singly-charged Fe+ ions are rare in both magnetospheres and easily identified in long-term averages. At Earth, the long-term averages also reveal N+, O+, N2+, and NO+ ions, which, to our knowledge, likely only originate in Earth's lower ionosphere and escape primarily during disturbed geomagnetic intervals. At Saturn, the Fe+ displays a distinct spatial variation and may originate from either of two possible sources - ionospheric escape as at Earth and/or meteoric materials embedded in Saturn's main rings.

            "abstract": "In stratigraphy, stratal surfaces (e.g. bedding planes) are generally considered as discrete time lines. However, expression of time in stratigraphic record can be quite complex. Unlike flat stratal surfaces, time surfaces are mostly undulating. Moreover, time was not only elapsed vertically across stratal surfaces, it was also elapsed horizontally along such surfaces. These complexities can generate contentions when it comes to dividing stratigraphic packages into chronostratigraphic or genetic units. Since many stratal surfaces are composite in nature, they represent a diachronous interval of time. This is particularly true for active depositional systems where undulating geomorphic units migrate in time and space to fill a basin. At each level of hierarchy from ripple- to basin-scale clinoformal packages, composite stratal surfaces can develop, where deposits above such a stratal surface are NOT everywhere younger than deposits below the same stratal surface. This may violate the Law of Superposition, which states that, in an undisturbed stratigraphic record, each layer is always younger than the layer beneath it. In fact, this Law holds true in one location moving strictly vertically through an undisturbed succession. While moving vertically, if an observer also moves laterally along a stratal surface for some distance, this Law may break down. These observations have critical implications in interpreting stratigraphic record, particularly in testing sequence stratigraphic concepts.",

            "abstract": "The oxygenic photosynthesis might have well evolved about 3 billion years ago, but there seems no great increase of atmospheric oxygen until the great oxygenation event (GOE) at about 2.4 Ga. One possibility for the suppressing of atmospheric oxygen level before the GOE is through consumption of oxygen by reduced volcanic gasses. The amount of atmospheric oxygen that could be consumed by volcanic gases depends on the absolute amount of volcanic gases as well as the redox state of the upper mantle. Evidence from the redox sensitive V/Sc ratio have shown that the redox state of the upper mantle have remained constant for the last 3.5 billion years (e.g., Li and Lee, 2004). If so, abrupt changes in thermal state of Earth’s upper mantle could explain the rapid changes of degassing rate at the time of GOE.\nThe Earth’s lowermost mantle has been shown to be compositionally heterogeneous, which could be caused by the presence of dense, primordial material resulting from early differentiation processes. An important question is how do chemical heterogeneities in the lowermost mantle influence the secular cooling of the upper mantle. Here, we performed numerical calculations to explore the effects of themochemical convection on the thermal evolution of Earth’s upper mantle. A large parameter space is explored, with varying Rayleigh number, viscosity, internal heating and density of chemical heterogeneities. We start with an initially hot mantle with a layer of dense material in the lowermost mantle. We found that when the mantle is hot, the dense material remains layered and covers the entire CMB, leading to low CMB heat flux. In this stage, the upper mantle cools down rapidly. However, as the mantle cools, the dense material is swept into discrete thermochemical piles by cold downwellings, leading to increasing CMB heat flux. The cooling rate of the mantle is temporarily reduced as this transition occurs. This occurs at a time consistent with the GOE event.\nLi, Z. X. A. and C. T. A.

            "abstract": "Understanding temporal variability and environmental drivers of harmful algal blooms (HABs) is important for guiding HABs impact mitigation plans in Lake Erie. The objective of this study is to characterize temporal variability and explore environmental driving factors of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and phycocyanin (PC), which are determinants of HABs, in western Lake Erie. Ten years’ (2002 to 2012) biweekly estimates of Chl-a and PC over western Lake Erie were retrieved from remote sensing-based measurements of water color with Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer ( MERIS). Nine environmental factors, including water quality and hydrometeorological variables, for the same period were also collected. While Chl-a and PC showed different predictabilities and differences in importance of environmental drivers at different locations and seasons using the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) with the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) method, hydrometeorological variables consistently showed great influences on Chl-a and PC in all four seasons. For Chl-a, the most significant environmental drivers are solar radiation and wind speed (spring); water temperature, solar radiation, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentration (summer); wind speed (fall); and water temperature and streamflow (winter). For PC, the most important environmental drivers are solar radiation and wind speed (spring); precipitation, water temperature, wind speed, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentration (summer); wind speed (fall); precipitation, water temperature, and streamflow ( winter). Wavelet analysis suggested that Chl-a and PC showed strong seasonal and inter-annual pattern – the 0.5- and 1-year periods are the dominant modes for both Chl-a and PC series. These findings offer insights into possible mechanisms underlying the dynamics of the HABs. ",

            "abstract": "Phenological transitions have large impacts on ecosystem processes, species interactions, and climate. However, phenology is a critical source of uncertainty in projections of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and the current generation of ecosystem models are highly variable and biased in their phenology predictions.\nMost phenological modeling has focused on diagnosing phenological variability and predicting long term responses to climate scenarios. Phenological predictions for the current season, on the other hand, are being made based on long-term means or expert opinion rather than real data.\nTo our knowledge previous research has not applied operational data assimilation approaches to produce operational, real-time forecasts of phenology. We present a phenology forecast data product that is automatically updated every day using current observations and weather forecasts. Specifically we fuse MODIS NDVI and PhenoCam based GCC with a threshold logistic process model at five sites across eastern forests, from North Carolina to New Hampshire. Prior to application, models were calibrated (2000-2012) using a Bayesian state space model. Forecasts for fall 2013, spring 2014, and fall 2014 were then generated on a daily basis using a particle filter.\nThe system successfully tracked seasonal phenology but forecasts showed high uncertainty and sensitivity to alternative model structures. Furthermore, we found that current phenological models in the literature are not formulated in a way that allows for dynamic forecasts. Work remains to be done to extend this work to a fully spatial context. In particular there is a need to determine the spatial range of influence of the tower PhenoCam data and to account for both land cover and random effects. More broadly, this work demonstrates the possibilities for the development of real-time ecological forecasting in other areas.",

            "abstract": "Glacial earthquakes are very-long-period seismic events originating from fast moving marine-terminating glaciers, primarily in Greenland. They consist in large surface waves with dominant periods between 35 and 150 s that are detectable teleseismically. Several studies report a clear temporal and spatial correlation between major glacial earthquakes and the capsize of large, newly calved icebergs. The teleseismic waveform modeling shows that the seismic data are well-explained by a landslide-type source. Long-period seismic waves would result from the force exerted by the iceberg on the glacier and the underlying earth during its collapse. We propose here a method of waveform inversion to retrieve the source-time function of glacial earthquakes. The inversion is carried out in the frequency domain. Taking the inverse Fourier transform of the frequency components determined by the inversion we then obtain time series of forces in the East, North and vertical directions. The recent installation of high-quality seismic networks in Greenland provides valuable data to improve the analysis of the dynamic of such events. We use broadband data from the GLISN experiment to investigate the source process of major glacial earthquakes in the 20-100 s period band. We test the robustness of the method by showing the stability of the inverted source when different stations with varying epicentral distances are used in the inversion. Since observed waveforms used in the inversion are limited in a particular frequency band, the estimated source-time functions are bandpassed. Though their comparison to filtered classical centroid single force models used in other studies shows that the seismogenic process is more complex. We repeated the inversion for several events around Greenland to obtain statistics on different sources. We give a first order interpretation of the dynamic of the inverted sources when applicable.",

Three-dimensional time-dependent images of ionospheric state variables (Ne, Te, Ti, Vi) are produced using multi-beam measurements by the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR). The resulting parameter maps are registered with all-sky images of 630-nm and 557-nm emissions acquired by the collocated OMTI imager. The combined analysis allows us to disambiguate spatial and temporal effects, revealing the formation of a deep density depletion between the arc and the plasma patch, formed by the combined action of electrodynamic evacuation and enhanced chemical recombination in the auroral downward current region. This mechanism results in a steep density gradient (gradient scale length <5-km) extending for at least 800-km in a direction tangential to the arc. This region should be highly unstable to gradient drift instability, and a likely source of enhanced HF scatter. Interpretations are supported through three-dimensional transport modeling.",

            "abstract": "Sediment load in estuarine waters is generally composed of a mixture of sand, clay and biological matter and it is recognised that there is strong mediation of the physical behaviour of flocs by biological components of the system.\nExtracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by benthic and pelagic bacteria and algae are a key variable influencing flocculation processes. Variation in the nature and concentration of polymers can alter sediment stability and transport in mixed sediment beds but these substances can also significantly enhance inter-particle cohesion in the water column and therefore deposition and transport.\nThis study examined the variation in naturally occurring EPS concentration and its influence on several physical variables of flocs within the Eden Estuary, Scotland. Samples were collected for total suspended sediment and colormetric analysis of polymer concentration. Subsamples were transferred to the settling column of the LabSFLOC-2 – Laboratory Spectral Flocculation Characteristics –high resolution video floc camera system (Manning, 2006) where settling flocs were viewed (resolution~10mm) to determine floc size (D) and settling velocity (Ws) characteristics.\nPreliminary results indicate a wide range of microfloc (D< 160mm) and Macrofloc (D>160mm) fractions present, with the latter approaching 1 mm during flocculation conducive conditions. Correspondingly, when considering all floc samples, floc settling velocities generally spanned three orders of magnitude with floc size and settling velocities correlating with polymer concentrations. These typically ranged from slow settling (Ws of 0.01-0.05 mm.s-1) predominantly organically based microflocs to faster settling, significantly larger and more porous Macroflocs settling at ~10-15 mm.s-1. The temporal distributions of D and Ws, sediment and polymer concentrations, are examined in the paper with variation also related to physical and microbiological factors in the bed and the phase of the tidal flow. The relationship between the forcing factors, the bed condition and the source and sinks of EPS material are discussed. The results demonstrate the importance of understanding biological variation in the assessment of sediment transport pathways in estuaries.",

            "abstract": "Satellite information plays a key role in tropical wetland monitoring and management. It is used to shed light on inundation dynamics of floodplains, to improve the understanding about eco-hydrological characteristics of floodplain ecosystems, and to quantify a wetland’s water balance. Seasonal wetlands in the tropics are very sensitive to changes in hydrological processes. Upstream land use alterations such as the installation of hydroelectric infrastructure or agricultural water withdrawal directly influence the ecosystem by changing the inundation dynamics. Large uncertainties due to missing in-situ measurements caused by remoteness complicate the quantification of a wetland’s water balance, where evaporation is considered to be its major water flux. We developed a spatially explicit approach to quantify daily evaporation considering the impact of inundation dynamics as the dominant controls and assessed the vulnerability of the Brazilian Pantanal wetland against the background of human induced impacts on the inundation process. In a first step a widely used water index (mNDWI) was calculated from MODIS surface reflectance products (MOD09A1) to differentiate between land and water for dry and wet years comparing and validating it with two years of continual in-situ water level measurements at different locations in our study area in the Northern Pantanal. Later on, we used the mNDWI to determine the water available for evaporation based on a recently developed approach (Schwerdtfeger et al., 2014, HESSD) to simulate evaporation fluxes on a large spatial scale. To set our evaporation results in the context of ecosystem vulnerability we defined the range of wet and dry years in the Pantanal for the last twelve years by means of local precipitation data and calculated yearly evaporation with our new approach. Considering now alterations of the inundation extent determined by the mNDWI in our model input parameters, our approach allowed us to make propositions about future ecosystem state in terms of alternated inundation dynamics and their impact on evaporation flux putting our results in context with the twelve observed years.",

            "abstract": "Present day ground deformation in and near the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) is an important factor in our understanding of central U.S. seismic hazard. Here I analyze Global Positioning System data over the period from 2000 to 2013 to assess several potentially active deformation mechanisms including: (1) regional shear; (2) creep on finite dislocations; and (3) post-seismic processes from the 1811–1812 and 1450 NMSZ earthquakes.\nA model of regional shear provides virtually no fit to the data and limits right-lateral regional shearing to less than 0.2±0.4 mm/yr. On the other hand, a 40-km long dislocation along the downdip extension of the Reelfoot fault creeping at about 6 mm/yr between 12 and 20 km depth fits the data well, with a 98% chance of being better able to predict the observed ground deformation, having rates of a fraction of a mm/yr, than does a hypothesis where ground deformation has a normalized random distribution. This is consistent with the results of previous authors (Frankel et al., 2012) and can be well explained by a model of afterslip from M7.5 1450 and February 1812 Reelfoot fault events. To successfully model afterslip, the ratio of reference slip rate to fault constitutive parameter is found to be about 10 times smaller than that for the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas fault (Barbot et al., 2009). Creep and afterslip on the downdip extension of the Cottonwood Grove fault and models of viscoelastic relaxation following the December 1811 and February 1812 earthquakes provide a poor fit to the data, in part due to the configuration of the observational network. The fit degrades further for values of lower crustal viscosity less than 1021 Pa-s.\nOne implication of this modeling is that if much of the present-day surface deformation results from afterslip, it is likely that many of the earthquakes we see today in the New Madrid seismic zone are aftershocks from the 1811­–1812 New Madrid earthquakes. Despite this fact, the afterslip modeling is consistent with models of intraplate earthquake clustering, and when considered with observations of earthquake clustering and the recent paleoseismic history of the region suggests that the NMSZ is in an active period and seismic hazard from 1811–1812-type events is likely to remain significant into the near future.",

The choice of control volume influences the processes that dominate budgets of ocean properties. In this study we analyze the salinity budget of the North Atlantic subtropical salinity maximum region for control volumes bounded by isohaline surfaces. We provide closed budgets based on output from a high-resolution numerical simulation, and partial budgets based on climatological analyses of observations. With this choice of control volume, advection is eliminated from the instantaneous volume integrated salt budget, and time mean advection eliminated from the budget evaluated from time-averaged data. In this way, the role of irreversible mixing processes in the maintenance and variability of the salinity maximum are more readily revealed. By carrying out the analysis with near instantaneous and time-filtered model output, the role of mesoscale eddies in stirring and mixing for this region is determined. We find that the small-scale mixing acting on enhanced gradients generated by the mesoscale eddies is approximately equal to that acting on the large-scale gradients estimated from climatological mean conditions. The isohaline salinity budgets can be related to water mass transformation rates associated with surface forcing and mixing processes in a straightforward manner. We find that the surface net evaporation in the North Atlantic salinity maximum region accounts for a transformation of 7 Sv of water into the salinity maximum in the simulation, whereas the estimate based on climatological observations is 10 Sv.",

The major part of the external plate boundaries of Africa is well defined by oceanic ridge systems with the exception of the Nubia-Eurasia complex convergence-collision tectonic zone. In addition, the number and distribution of the tectonic blocks along the EARS region is a major scientific issue that has not been completely answered so far. Nevertheless, the increased number of cGNSS (continuous Global Navigation Satellite Systems) stations in Africa with sufficient long data span is helping to better understand and constrain the complex sub-plate distribution in the EARS as well as in the other plate boundaries of Africa.\nThis work is the geodetic contribution for the IGCP-Project 601 – “Seismotectonics and Seismic Hazards in Africa”. It presents the current tectonic relative motions of the African continent based on the analysis of the estimated velocity field derived from the existing network of cGNSS stations in Africa and bordering plate tectonics. For the majority of the plate pairs, we present the most recent estimation of their relative velocity using a dedicated processing. The velocity solutions are computed using HECTOR, a software that takes into account the existing temporal correlations between the daily solutions of the stations. It allows to properly estimate the velocity uncertainties and to detect any artifacts in the time-series. For some of the plate pairs, we compare our solutions of the angular velocities with other geodetic and geophysical models. In addition, we also study the sensitivity of the derived angular velocity to changes in the data (longer data-span for some stations) for tectonic units with few stations, and in particular for the Victoria and Rovuma blocks of the EARS. Finally, we compute estimates of velocity fields for several sub-regions correlated with the seismotectonic provinces and discuss the level of interplate and intraplate deformations in Africa.",

The magnitude and direction of these alterations depends heavily on the type of urbanization that occurs. We investigated energy balance variation in a local network of agricultural and urban ecosystems using the eddy covariance method to better understand how vegetation fraction and degree of urbanization affects energy exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere. We deployed eddy flux systems within a well-irrigated, agricultural citrus orchard, a moderately developed urban zone with a substantial amount of local vegetative cover, and an intensely developed urban zone with minimal vegetative cover and increased impervious surfaces relative to the other two sites. Latent energy (LE) fluxes in the agricultural area ranged from 7.9 ± 1.4 W m-2 (nighttime) to 168.7 ± 6.2 W m-2 (daytime) compared to 10.2 ± 3.5 W m-2 and 40.6 ± 4.1 W m-2, respectively, for the moderately developed urban area. Sensible energy (H) fluxes ranged from -9.1 ± 1.0 W m-2 (nighttime) to 119 ± 7.0 W m-2 (daytime) in the agricultural area compared to 9.6 ± 2.6 W m-2  and 134 ± 6.0 W m-2, respectively, for the moderately developed urban zone. Daytime LE is reduced with increasing urbanization; however, daily cycles of LE are less recognizable in urban areas compared to distinct daily cycles obtained above a mature citrus crop. In contrast, both daytime and nighttime H increases with increasing degree of urbanization. Reduction in vegetation and increases in impervious surfaces along an urbanization gradient leads to alterations in energy balance, which are associated with microclimate and water use changes.",

            "abstract": "Deep-sea bamboo corals have been proposed as deep-ocean paleoceanographic archives because of their longevity and radial growth bands. Previous work has shown that bamboo coral Ba/Ca is a promising proxy for seawater barium, however, validation of Ba/Ca reproducibility is required. In addition, the growth band formation mechanism is uncertain, with some proposing that crystal orientation causes banding visible under light microscopy. The objective of this study was to evaluate Ba/Ca reproducibility and characterize growth band crystal orientation. Visible bands measured with a petrographic microscope were used to align LA-ICP-MS data collected along three replicate radii of the calcitic internodes of two well-dated corals from the Gulf of Alaska (collected live at 720m and 643m; 48°3’N, 132°44’W). Ba/Ca signals smoothed to ~annual resolution were reproducible within each coral (r=0.6-0.7; p<0.0001; n=3 radii/coral), suggesting that Ba/Ca varies in response to the external environment on annual timescales. Ba/Ca in the 720m coral increased from 1977 to 1998, a warm Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) regime, possibly due to increased export production. The shallower coral (634m) revealed the inverse trend, suggesting variability in seawater barium dynamics with depth. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis of visible growth bands showed a preferred crystal orientation that does not correspond to location of visible bands or elemental composition, suggesting that crystal orientation does not cause bamboo coral banding. Overall, results show that regional oceanic signals are recorded as reproducible Ba/Ca variability in these corals. Comparison of these data to other well-dated records from the northeast Pacific would determine whether the relationship between Ba/Ca and PDO is regional. Additional archives of trace element variability will strengthen our understanding of how rapid climate change impacts intermediate ocean biogeochemistry.",

            "abstract": "MgSiO3 post-perovskite (pPv) is believed to be a major mineral component in the lowermost mantle. However MgSiO3 pPv is only stable above ~125 GPa making deformation experiments on this phase particularly challenging. Thus it is of interest to determine suitable analogs for MgSiO3 pPv. NaMgF3 is isostructural with MgSiO3 perovskite (Pv) at ambient conditions and transforms to the pPv structure at ~30 GPa, making this system a potentially useful analog. Here we report on deformation and texture development in the NaMgF3Pv-pPv system.\nDuring room temperature compression in the diamond anvil cell, NaMgF3 Pv rapidly develops a 100 texture. Simulations using the visco plastic self-consistent code (VPSC) indicate that a 100 texture in Pv is due to (100) slip or twinning on {110}<1-10>. After inducing the transformation to pPv by laser heating at ~ 30 GPa, NaMgF3 pPv exhibits a texture maximum near {110} indicating that {100}Pv → {110}pPv. This is consistent with transformation mechanisms proposed by theoretical work (Tsuchiya et al 2004; Oganov et al 2005) and with experimental work on MgGeO3 (Miyagi et al 2011) and NaNiF3(Dobson et al 2013).\nUpon further compression to 66 GPa the 110 textures disperses and develops a maximum toward 001 with a minimum near 100. VPSC modeling was performed using the 110 transformation texture as a starting texture for the simulations. (010)<101> slip generates a strong maximum at 010 and a minimum at 001. Slip on (001)<100> results in a maxima near 110 with a shoulder close to 001, similar to the experimental deformation texture. Thus it is most likely that at room temperature, NaMgF3 pPv slips predominantly on the (001) plane, consistent with MgSiO3 pPv (Miyagi et al 2010) and MgGeO3 (Miyagi et al 2011).\nDobson, D.

            "abstract": "In this study we consider how commercial natural gas production could affect sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in coal-bearing sediments of the Cherokee Basin, Kansas, USA. Controls on the activity of these two groups of microbes are important to understand because their activity and interactions may influence methane formation and retention in unconventional reservoirs.\nDuring November 2013, we collected water and gas samples from 16 commercial gas wells for geochemical and microbiological analysis. Results indicate that methane in the coalbeds formed biologically and that both methanogens and sulfate reducers are present. Gas samples consisted almost entirely of methane (C1/(C2+C3) = 2638 on avg.) and the δD and δ13C of methane averaged -222‰ VSMOW and -61‰ VPDB, respectively. Archaeal sequences in our samples were nearly all classified within groups of methanogens (avg. 91%) and cultivable methanogens were present in all water samples. On average, 6% of the bacterial sequences from our samples were classified in groups of sulfate reducers and sulfate available to support their activity ranged up to 110 µM in concentration.\nAny interaction that occurs between these groups may be influenced by the energetics of their metabolic reactions. Thermodynamic calculations show that methanogens hold an energy advantage over sulfate reducers if dissolved methane concentrations are low. Under current conditions, methanogens see between 12 and 16 kJ mol-1 more usable free energy than sulfate reducers, if we assume a minimal methane concentration (1 µM). However, usable energy for methanogens would equal that available to sulfate reducers at methane concentrations ranging between 144 and 831 µM, well below saturation levels. Production activities that hold methane concentration below these levels, therefore, would help maintain an energy advantage for methanogens. In contrast, if production activities cause sulfate concentrations to increase, sulfate reducers would gain an energy advantage at lower methane concentrations.",

FGCM deposits were created in a laboratory setting meant to simulate the South River environment using a recirculating flume (15m long by 0.6m wide) with a fixed gravel bed and adjustable slope (set to 0.0067) to determine how fine sediment is transported and deposited behind LWD. Two model LWD structures were placed 3.7 m apart on opposite sides of the flume. A wire mesh screen with attached wooden dowels simulated LWD with an upstream facing rootwad. Six experiments with three different discharge rates, each with low and high sediment concentrations, were run. Suspended sediment was very fine grained (median grain size of 3 phi) and well sorted (0.45 phi) sand. Upstream of the wood, water depths averaged about 0.08m, velocities averaged about 0.3 m/s, and Froude numbers averaged around 0.3. Downstream of the first LWD structure, velocities were reduced tenfold. Small amounts of sediment passed through the rootwad and fell out of suspension in the area of reduced flow behind LWD, but most of the sediment was carried around the LWD by the main flow and then behind the LWD by a recirculating eddy current. Upstream migrating dunes formed behind LWD due to recirculating flow, similar to reattachment bars documented in bedrock canyon rivers partially obstructed by debouching debris fans. These upstream migrating dunes began at the reattachment point and merged with deposits formed from sediment transported through the rootwad. Downstream migrating dunes formed along the channel margin behind the LWD, downstream of the reattachment point. FGCM deposits were about 3 m long, with average widths of about 0.8 m. Greater sediment concentration created thicker FGCM deposits, and higher flows eroded the sides of the deposits, reducing their widths.",

            "abstract": "Several observations suggest that water and other volatiles delivered by past comet impacts may have migrated to permanently shadowed regions near the poles of the Moon and Mercury, where they may still remain cold-trapped. Here, we compare the nature of gas transport and loss processes in a collisionless exosphere to the situation after a lunar comet impact. The sheer quantity of volatiles delivered by a comet can transform the way in which gas transport and deposition occur; we model this using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method. It is observed that post-impact gas transport occurs primarily through low-altitude winds that sweep over the lunar day-side, as opposed to migration of molecules through ballistic hops. The resultant deposition patterns are markedly non-uniform, with preferential redistribution of water antipodal to the point of impact, and short-term variations in simulated volatile abundance between different cold traps, suggesting that a non-uniform delivery mechanism could contribute towards the non-uniform distribution of lunar polar volatiles observed in remote sensing datasets. Due to the amount of vapor that remains gravitationally bound to the Moon, the transient, impact-generated atmosphere is initially sufficiently dense that lower layers are shielded from photodestruction, prolonging the lifetime of water molecules and allowing greater amounts of water to reach cold traps. Other physical processes, such as radiative heat transfer and photochemical reactions, also operate differently when the exosphere becomes collisionally and optically thick. The longevity of the transient atmosphere and the significance of the phenomena mentioned above depend on specific impact parameters, as well as the gravitational and solar environment of the body in question - for instance, Mercury could retain a thicker atmosphere, but sees much more intense ultraviolet radiation than the Moon. However, the characteristic structure of the atmosphere and the nature of volatile transport, loss and sequestration should be similar whenever a nominally airless body holds a significant quantity of vapor gravitationally bound after an impact, thus temporarily transforming its exosphere, with implications for the abundance and distribution of volatiles today.",

In fact, about 40% of European freshwater is originated there. In this study, we characterize several features of the spring water cycle over the Alps. In particular, we discuss the observed decadal variability and the long-term trend of total precipitation, snowfall, and of the timing of maximum river discharge in the last 150 years. Finally, we provide an interpretation in terms of weather patterns frequency distribution that explains these aspects of the Alpine climate variability.",

            "abstract": "Mixing processes control spatial and temporal patterns of water quality in large rivers. Studies of mixing at river confluences have mainly been limited either to laboratory junctions or to field investigations at small confluences. Detailed studies of mixing downstream from confluences in large rivers are difficult due to the expense and effort required to conduct such studies. The objectives of this research are: 1) to develop an empirically based model, based on spectral reflectance information, for predicting total suspended solids concentrations (SSCs) at and downstream of confluences, and 2) to use the predicted values of SSCs to better understand the dynamics of mixing downstream from confluences. The study site for our research is the Mississippi River at and downstream of its confluence with the Missouri River. Data consist of SSCs measured by the USGS in the Mississippi River between 1988 and 2003 and atmospherically corrected imagery obtained by Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 satellites during the same period. Data on spectral reflectance for pixels with measured sediment concentrations are used in a RandomForest regression tree analysis to develop a predictive model relating spectral reflectance to SSCs. This model is used to estimate SSCs downstream of the confluence for different dates of imagery. Cross-channel patterns of SSCs illustrate the degree of transverse mixing at various distances downstream from the confluence and are useful for ascertaining how changes in channel characteristics influence rates of transverse mixing. Preliminary results indicate that the magnitude of differences in SSCs between the two rivers, the momentum flux ratio between the rivers, and changes in channel width are important factors controlling rates of transverse mixing. These results advance our understanding of mixing in large rivers and help inform water quality management practices for such rivers.",

            "abstract": "The origin and nature of Hangay Dome, an unusual large-scale doming structure in Central Mongolia, remains enigmatic, partly due to lack of knowledge on its underlying seismic structure. Here we present a new high-resolution multi-parameter seismic model derived from adjoint tomography, utilizing the full wavefield recorded by an unprecedented seismographic network in its surroundings. The new seismological constraints include Vs perturbation, the Vp/Vs ratio and radial anisotropy, (Vsh-Vsv)/Vs. We observe clear correlation between the high topography of the dome and regions with a low Vs and high Vp/Vs ratio down to 150 km. We also observe negative radial anisotropy (faster Vsv) at deeper asthenospheric depths (250 - 500 km) underlying positive radial anisotropy (faster Vsh) at shallow depths (< 250 km) right below the dome, and negative radial anisotropy at shallower depths (50 - 150km) on the flanks of the dome. These observations are consistent with a scenario that a deep asthenospheric upwelling arises from the mantle transition zone, producing decompression melting that feeds magmatism causing high topography of the area.",

            "abstract": "Increased understanding of the processes controlling biospheric CO2 flux is\nnecessary for improved climate projections. While satellite CO2 observations\nare expected to better constrain surface sources and sinks, separating\nbiospheric and anthropogenic fluxes is particularly challenging. Correlations\nbetween CO and CO2 can help to differentiate between different types of\nfluxes, but a more thorough understanding of these correlations is still\nneeded. This presentation discusses the estimation of, and the corresponding\nuncertainty about, correlations between CO and CO2 surface fluxes in given\nregions during given periods of time. The estimates follow from statistical\ndiagnostics, including those popularized by Desrozies et al. (2005), applied\nto the results of model simulations and assimilations of constituent\nmeasurements, notably data from satellites, in situ sites, and the Total\nCarbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). Nevertheless, the usefulness of\nthese estimates is limited by their uncertainty, a property that depends on\nthe spatial and temporal resolution of the surface fluxes. This work\nconsiders a variety of different divisions of space (e.g., Global, land and\nsea, and Transcom regions) and time (e.g., total, seasonal, and monthly) and\nexamines the conclusions that can be drawn from the correlation estimates.\nFor example, the correlation coefficient can give some indication of the\ncombustion efficiency of emissions from different regions, or it may suggest\nthat the surface fluxes of the two constituents are from two different\nprocesses. This investigation is used to improve the diagnosis of biospheric\nflux processes in the GEOS-5 modeling system.",

            "abstract": "Weathering rind thicknesses have long been used in geochronology, even though the rate at which they develop has never been established. Experimental studies show that the thickness of the weathered layer increases as an approximate power of the time, with an exponent between 0.5 (commonly considered diffusion controlled) and 1.0. We use percolation theory to show that the observed time dependences result from advective transport limitations. Calculations for non-reactive transport suffice, but Gaussian transport theory must be abandoned. Two-dimensional (2D) flow connectivity under unsaturated conditions generates an exponent of 0.82, 3D unsaturated flow the exponent 0.69, 2D saturated flow, 0.625, and 3D saturated conditions 0.53. As it turns out, these are the values observed, under conditions that match expectations, and with R2 values often near 1 (0.999). The time derivative of the weathering rind thickness gives the weathering rate, and the corresponding powers in this case are – 0.18, -0.31, - 0.375, and – 0.47. At this time we can report studies with the first and the last values. The same scaling of length and time is observed in non-Gaussian transport in semiconductors and polymers. Of the 25 data sets that we have so far investigated, every one fits securely into one of the above classifications. Thus, we conclude that our current framework describes the known data on silicate weathering rates.",

            "abstract": "Many projections of sea-level rise (SLR) by 2100 require rise rates of >7 mm/yr after about 2050. Thus, in the latter half of this century, the global average SLR rate may be higher than it has been since about 7000 years ago. That includes a prolonged period of relatively slow sea-level rise over the past 2000-4000 years, during which many coastal landforms and their associated ecosystems (e.g., barrier islands, estuaries, wetlands) matured and extended across the landscape, building rich sedimentary archives. The understanding of coastal evolution in these settings is typically based on both recent geologic history and modern process observations. The recent geologic history can be sampled from relatively accessible sedimentary records, as opposed to earlier records deposited more than ~5000 years ago, which are scarce on the transgressed continental margin. In addition, few to no modern analogs exist for many coastal settings that will experience high SLR rates and where there is significant human infrastructure and development. These settings provide valuable resources and ecosystem services on which society depends (e.g., sandy recreational beaches and fisheries), where useful projections are most needed. Thus, traditional sources of insight – the stratigraphic record and modern analogs – are lacking and limit our ability, and confidence, to predict the form, magnitude, and spatial extent of future changes to the coastal landscape. If sea-level is indeed heading towards ~1 m SLR by 2100, we have a limited timeframe to understand coastal change at higher SLR rates, communicate information to decision makers, and allow sufficient time for action. This is a moderate probability, but extraordinarily high risk, high impact scenario. It is a region of the coastal evolution parameter space that warrants focused exploration to identify critical knowledge gaps, conduct research to fill these gaps, and build our understanding. We also need to apply current knowledge to this problem; we know how to make skillful, yet imperfect models. Are we ready to set them against reality and evaluate their utility for a rapidly-changing world? We present some examples of current landscape-change predictive capability and discuss their application with and without updated understanding of higher-end SLR scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Vertical profiles and emission lifetimes of lightning nitrogen oxides (LNOx) are derived using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Approximately 200 million flashes, over a 10 year climate period, from the United States National Lighting Detection Network (NLDN), are aggregated with OMI cloud top height to determine the vertical LNOx structure. LNOx lifetime is determined as function of LNOx signal in a 36 kilometer vertical column from the time of the last known flash to depletion of the LNOx signal. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Station (AQS) surface data further support these results by demonstrating as much as a 200% increase in surface level NO2 during strong thunderstorm events and a lag as long as 5 to 8 hours from the lightning event to the peak surface event, indicating a evolutional process. Analysis of cloud resolving chemical transport model (REAM Cloud) demonstrates that C-shaped LNOx profiles, which agree with OMI vertical profile observations, evolve due to micro-scale convective meteorology given inverted C-shaped LNOx emission profiles as determined from lightning radio telemetry. It is shown, both in simulations and in observations, that the extent to which the LNOx vertical distribution is C-shaped and the lifetime of LNOx is proportional to the shear-strength of the thunderstorm. Micro-scale convective meteorology is not adequately parameterized in global scale and regional scale chemical transport models (CTM). Therefore, these larger scale CTMs ought to use a C-shape emissions profile to best reproduce observations until convective parameterizations are updated. These findings are used to simulate decadal LNOx and lightning ozone climatology over the Continental United States (CONUS) from 2004-2014.",

            "abstract": "The color and albedo of the surface of a large ice sheet is critical to its response to a changing climate. Decreasing the ice surface albedo enhances surface melt and has been suggested as a mechanism to trigger rapid collapse. Each summer, dark bands of ice 20-40 km wide are exposed along the margin of the Greenland ice sheet. These dark bands are clearly visible in satellite imagery and best developed along the west coast.\nWe use airborne radar data in both northeast and western Greenland to demonstrate that the dark bands are the result of outcropping stratigraphy. Where these dark bands are exposed at the ice surface correlate with locations where the well defined stratigraphy imaged with airborne radar is truncated at the surface. Surface work in the northeast by Boogild and coworkers (2010) has constrained the age of the three major intervals of exposed strata. Pink or brown Pleistocene ice lies closest to the ice margin, and is overlain by white pre-Boreal ice. The impurity-rich dark strata, are dated as early Holocene. The dark strata are likely a result of either periods of elevated dust during the Holocene or excess melt during the Holocene Climatic Optimum.\nWe use satellite data to map the extent of the exposed dark ice in Greenland using imagery from Landsat 8, Landsat 7, ASTER VNIR, EO1 Ali, and Quickbird with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.65m to 30m. Image acquisition focused on the months of July and August when the stratigraphy is best exposed. Little dark ice is presently exposed in the southeastern margin of the Greenland ice sheet as this region experiences higher surface accumulation. By examining satellite images from multiple years we have identified areas where the patterns of the dark ice are changing. Both movement of the strata towards the margin due to ice flow and inland retreat due to increased erosion are documented.\nAn outstanding question is what will be color of the strata exposed as the bare ice region expands in Greenland. The next step in this work will be to determine the thickness of the dark ice and what fraction of it is presently exposed. Dating the dark ice could be completed with linking the stratigraphy to the major ice cores.",

            "abstract": "The fluid dynamics of core merging after giant impacts provides constraints on metal-silicate equilibration, core stratification, and possible dynamo initiation in the late stages of accretion. The energy released during giant impacts, such as those thought to have formed Earth's Moon and the crustal dichotomy on Mars, resulted in melting of the impactor and much or all of the protoplanet's mantle. Under these conditions, the liquid core of the impactor migrates through a fully liquid magma ocean and merges with the protoplanet's core.\nIn contrast with the laminar flow in numerical simulations, liquid impact experiments can produce turbulent entrainment and mixing, as expected during planetary formation. We present experiments on liquid blobs released into another liquid consisting of two immiscible layers, representing the magma ocean and protocore, respectively. The released liquid is immiscible with the upper layer, miscible with the lower layer, and denser than the upper layer. Our release conditions are compatible with a free-fall impact. When the released fluid density is equal to the density of the lower layer, we observe formation of a turbulent immiscible mixture in the upper layer, penetration of the immiscible mixture in the lower layer, and collapse into a gravity current that spreads between the upper and lower layers. By varying the density contrast between the released liquid and the liquid in the lower layer, we observe differences in the penetration depth and the extent of the stratification in the lower layer at the end of each experiment. Our results suggest that metal-silicate equilibration processes are not limited to the magma ocean but instead extend deep inside the protoplanet's core.",

            "abstract": "Landscapes of the High Himalaya are broadly characterised by glacial valleys and steep, tall bedrock hillslopes, with the highest peaks represented by glacial horns surrounded by cirques. Himalayan glaciers are noteworthy for the high contribution of avalanching snow to their mass balance, and the thickness of surface debris derived from periglacial hillslopes. However, many glaciers here also do not conform to the typical case of ice accumulating in a cirque and spilling out to form a valley glacier. These exceptions include “beheaded” glaciers lacking cirques at their heads (e.g., the Barun Glacier), and “reconstituted” glaciers whose upper and lower portions are separated by bare rock slopes (e.g., the Langshisha and Yebokangal glaciers). In extreme cases these features can combine to form isolated, low-relief, ice-covered surfaces far above the rest of the glacial valley network (e.g., the Sakyetang Glacier, >6,600m, above the Kazhen Glacier, <5,400m). Such low-relief surfaces could be a key component of topographic evolution in the High Himalaya.\nThe ice on low-relief surfaces > 6,000m will be frozen to the bed and move very slowly. Thus subglacial erosion rates will also be very low, and outpaced by both rock uplift and rockwall retreat. Given ongoing tectonic uplift, these low-relief surfaces will continue to rise to higher elevations, raising the possibility that remnants of low-relief surfaces may end up as high as, or even higher than, current glacial horns.",

            "abstract": "Within our community data volume is rapidly expanding. These data have limited value if one cannot interact or visualize the data in a timely manner. The scientific community needs the ability to dynamically visualize, analyze, and interact with these data along with other environmental data in real-time regardless of the physical location or data format.\nWithin the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s), the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) is actively developing the NOAA Earth Information System (NEIS). Previously, the NEIS team investigated methods of data discovery and interoperability. The recent focus shifted to high performance real-time visualization allowing NEIS to bring massive amounts of 4-D data, including output from weather forecast models as well as data from different observations (surface obs, upper air, etc...) in one place.\nOur server side architecture provides a real-time stream processing system which utilizes server based NVIDIA Graphical Processing Units (GPU’s) for data processing, wavelet based compression, and other preparation techniques for visualization, allows NEIS to minimize the bandwidth and latency for data delivery to end-users.\nClient side, users interact with NEIS services through the visualization application developed at ESRL called TerraViz. Terraviz is developed using the Unity game engine and takes advantage of the GPU’s allowing a user to interact with large data sets in real time that might not have been possible before.\nThrough these technologies, the NEIS team has improved accessibility to ‘Big Data’ along with providing tools allowing novel visualization and seamless integration of data across time and space regardless of data size, physical location, or data format. These capabilities provide the ability to see the global interactions and their importance for weather prediction. Additionally, they allow greater access than currently exists helping to foster scientific collaboration and new ideas.\nThis presentation will provide an update of the recent enhancements of the NEIS architecture and visualization capabilities, challenges faced, as well as ongoing research activities related to this project.",

            "abstract": "The average recurrence interval of the interplate earthquakes along the Nankai Trough is estimated from historical literature and archaeological data. However, the details of tectonic movements by past Nankai earthquakes are mostly left unclear from historical literature, therefore, we need to obtain the geological evidence of the tectonic movements. Yuki city, Tokushima prefecture, located in north part of the Nankai Trough, has been subsided and many tsunamis attacked along the coast of the Shikoku islands accompanied by the previous Nankai earthquakes. Therefore, some historical documents and memorial monuments written about the past Nankai earthquakes and tsunamis remain in the city. The study purposed to reveal tectonic movements of the earthquakes from Nankai Trough during the late Holocene at Tainohama in Minami city which is adjacent to the southwest of Yuki city by fossil diatom analysis. We obtained a 700cm long core at a marsh behind a barrier spit probably be not affected directly from sea waves in Tainohama. The core includes more than 13 sand layers in organic-rich muddy or peaty sedimentary succession up to 500cm depth in the core. And the diatom assemblages included in the peat and peaty mud deposits were dominated by fresh and brackish water species, especially Pseudostaurosira brevistriata, P. subsalina and Tabellaria fenestrate. In contrast to the above mentioned sand layers, brackish and marine species, such as Diploneis smithii increased. The diatom assemblages from the organic rich muddy sediments and radiocarbon ages indicate that freshwater marsh or saltmarsh formed in this region during the late Holocene. On the other hand, the sandy layers include the diatoms living in environments where salinities are higher than freshwater or salt marsh, so the assemblages suggest that the sand layers were transported from seaside by past tsunamis. In addition, changes of diatom assemblages in the peaty or peaty mud sediments show increase or decrease of freshwater species, suggesting paleo-sea level changes. The sea level in this area declined gradually to modern sea level from +50cm higher level than modern by eustatic sea level fall during the late Holocene (Sato 2014), thus the fluctuations suggest co-seismic or inter-seismic crustal movements of the past interplate earthquakes along the Nankai Trough.",

            "abstract": "The measurement of chemical fluxes between natural waters and their benthic sediments by most existing methods, such as benthic chambers and sediment core incubations, is slow, cumbersome, and often inaccurate. One promising new method for determining benthic fluxes is eddy correlation (EC), a minimally invasive, in situ technique based on high-speed velocity and concentration measurements. Widespread application of EC to a large range of chemicals of interest is currently limited, however, by the availability of rapid, high-resolution chemical sensors capable of precisely measuring concentrations at a point location and at sufficient speed (several Hz).\nA proof of concept spectrofluorometry instrument has been created that is capable of high-frequency concentration measurements of naturally fluorescent substances. Designed with the EC application in mind, the system utilizes optical fibers to transmit excitation and emission light, enabling in situ measurements at high spatial resolution. Emitted fluorescence light is passed through a tunable monochromator before reaching a photomultiplier tube; photons are quantified by a custom miniaturized, low-power photon counting circuit board. Preliminary results indicate that individual measurements made at 100 Hz of a 10 ppm humic acid solution were precise within 10%, thus yielding a precision of the order of +/- 1% in a second.\nUsed in an EC system, this instrument will enable flux measurements of substances such as naturally occurring fluorescent dissolved organic material (FDOM). Measurement of fluxes of FDOM is significant in its own right, and also will allow the indirect measurement of the numerous other chemical fluxes that are associated with FDOM by using tracer techniques. The use of a tunable monochromator not only allows flexibility in detection wavelength, but also enables full wavelength scans of the emission spectrum, making the spectrofluorometer a dual-function device capable of both characterizing the chemistry of the water (e.g. characterizing the FDOM present, or identifying additional compounds), and measuring fluorescence at selected wavelengths for EC and other applications.",

            "abstract": "The CARBFIX project near Reykjavik in Iceland includes is a field-based pilot injection to study the feasibility of permanent CO2 (and H2S) storage in permeable basalt formations [1]. Pure CO2 and CO2/H2S mixtures from the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant were dissolved downhole in groundwater and injected into a permeable confined basalt formation at about 500m depth below ground. We are using non-reactive (sodium fluorescein, SF5CF3, and SF6) and reactive (14C and 13C) tracers in the project to characterize subsurface CO2 transport and in situ CO2-water-rock reactions. In January 2012, 170 tons of pure CO2 tagged with 14C and SF6 were injected followed by 73 tons of a CO2/H2S mixture starting in June 2012. Samples were collected from injection and monitoring wells in evacuated serum glass bottles with butyl stoppers and analyzed by AMS and mass spectrometry for carbon isotopes, by fluorometry for Na-fluorescein and by gas chromatography for SF6 and SF5CF3. Tracer breakthrough curves obtained from the first downstream monitoring well indicate that the injected water arrives in a fast short pulse and a late broad peak. 14C/SF6 and DIC/SF6 ratios are considerably lower in the monitoring wells as compare to the injection well. Evidence for carbonate precipitation was also found in the pump and on the pump lines in the monitoring well. The 14C/12C ratio of the precipitated carbon is the same as that of the DIC during injection and in the monitoring well, but distinct from ambient groundwater background. Mass balance calculations suggest that about 90% of the injected CO2 has been mineralized over a period of only 2 years.\n[1] Gislason et al. (2010), Int. J. Greenh. Gas Con. 4, 537-545.",

            "abstract": "The advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) has provided a new and powerful facility for probing the atmospheres of solar system targets at long wavelengths (84-720 GHz) where the rotational lines of small, polar molecules are prominent. Previously, observatories such as the Sub Millimeter Array (SMA) and IRAM (30-m and Plateau de Bure Interferometer) have demonstrated the detection of molecules such as CO, HCN, HC3N and CH3CN in Titan’s atmosphere, allowing the determination of vertical abundance gradients, and isotopic ratios of 13C/12C, 15N/14N and 18O/16O. More recently, the Herschel observatory made the first detection of hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) in Titan’s atmosphere. However, to date all these observations have not resolved Titan’s disk, and measured only disk-averaged abundances. ALMA changes this picture dramatically, since the full ALMA will eventually achieve a resolution of 0.004” at the shortest wavelengths, compared to Titan’s angular size of 0.800”. We will discuss early Titan science using ALMA, including the re-observation of species seen previously by SMA, IRAM and Herschel, and the search for new species and isotopes. We will also show the capability of ALMA to spatially map the emissions of stronger molecular species, and measure winds by using resolved spectral line profiles.",

Here, we utilize self-organizing map (SOM) cluster analysis to determine the occurrence, persistence, and maximum duration of mid-tropospheric planetary wave patterns from the 1979 to 2013 and 1990 to 2013 periods in the ERA-Interim, NCEP/NCAR R1 and NCEP-DOE R2 reanalysis 500 mb geopotential height fields. We conduct seasonal analyses of seven northern hemisphere mid-latitude domains and determine circulation pattern matches between reanalysis datasets using rmse and pattern correlation metrics. We consider a particular spatial pattern within a given domain to exhibit a robust trend in either occurrence or persistence when a matching pattern from all three reanalysis datasets exhibits a statistically significant trend over the chosen analysis period. We find robust trends in a limited number of domains, including less frequent troughing events over central North America in the winter months for the 1979 to 2013 period, more frequent and longer maximum duration ridging events over central/eastern Europe and western Asia in the summer months for both periods, and longer maximum duration ridging events over the eastern Pacific/western North America during the winter months for the 1990 to 2013 period. In regions that exhibit a robust trend in a particular mid-latitude wave pattern, we test whether such a trend in circulation can be linked to the occurrence of extreme hot/cold surface temperature events. Lastly and conversely, we assess the fraction of temperature extreme trends that can be attributed to changes in the occurrence or persistence of particular wave patterns.",

            "abstract": "Mars has no global magnetic field. Changes in the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field can impact the upper atmosphere and induce currents in the ionosphere of Mars. During aerobraking maneuvers, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) made over 1000 passes through Mars’s ionosphere. During these passes, MGS measured the local magnetic field. From these measurements, we can determine the ionospheric currents. We restrict our analysis to passes where the radial component of the magnetic field is nearly zero. This restriction, along with some assumptions about the gradients in the magnetic field, allows us to estimate the horizontal ionospheric currents. Additionally, we focus on the magnetic field data acquired over regions above negligible crustal magnetic fields in order to simplify the analysis. At a maximum altitude of 250 km, the Mars map was segmented to 30 by 30 degrees east longitude and latitude for analysis. We find that on the night side, where the solar zenith angle (SZA) lies between 130 to 180 degrees, only 4% of the data (out of a total of 52 profiles) is usable for computing currents, that is the radial component of the magnetic field is nearly zero. We also find that near the terminator, where the SZA lies between 50 to 130 degrees, an average of 2% of the magnetic field profiles (out of 1905) are usable to compute currents. This implies that currents are rarely horizontal (as required by our assumptions) in these regions. The currents computed from these profiles can give us insights into how the changing solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field can affect the upper atmosphere of Mars. For example, induced currents can lead to Joule heating of the atmosphere potentially modifying the neutral dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The PICASSO (Program to Investigate Convective Alboran Sea System Overturn) project and the concomitant TopoMed (Plate re-organization in the western Mediterranean: Lithospheric causes and topographic consequences – an ESF EUROSCORES TOPO-EUROPE project) project were designed to collect high resolution, multi-disciplinary lithospheric scale data in order to understand the tectonic evolution and lithospheric structure of the western Mediterranean. The over-arching objectives of the magnetotelluric (MT) component of the projects are (i) to provide new electrical conductivity constraints on the crustal and lithospheric structure of the Atlas Mountains, and (ii) to test the hypotheses for explaining the purported lithospheric cavity beneath the Middle and High Atlas inferred from potential-field lithospheric modeling.\nWe present the results of an MT experiment we carried out in Morocco along two profiles: an approximately N-S oriented profile crossing the Middle Atlas, the High Atlas and the eastern Anti-Atlas to the east (called the MEK profile, for Meknes) and NE-SW oriented profile through western High Atlas to the west (called the MAR profile, for Marrakech). Our results are derived from three-dimensional (3-D) MT inversion of the MT data set employing the parallel version of Modular system for Electromagnetic inversion (ModEM) code.\nThe distinct conductivity differences between the Middle-High Atlas (conductive) and the Anti-Atlas (resistive) correlates with the South Atlas Front fault, the depth extent of which appears to be limited to the uppermost mantle (approx. 60 km). In all inverse solutions, the crust and the upper mantle show resistive signatures (approx. 1,000 Ωm) beneath the Anti-Atlas, which is the part of stable West African Craton. Partial melt and/or exotic fluids enriched in volatiles produced by the melt can account for the high middle to lower crustal and uppermost mantle conductivity in the Folded Middle Atlas, the High Moulouya Plain and the central High Atlas.",

            "abstract": "Streamflow through the Middle Rio Grande Valley is largely driven by snowmelt pulses and monsoonal precipitation events originating in the mountain highlands of New Mexico (NM) and Colorado. Water managers rely on results from storage/runoff models to distribute this resource statewide and to allocate compact deliveries to Texas under the Rio Grande Compact agreement. Prevalent drought conditions and the added uncertainty of climate change effects in the American southwest have led to a greater call for accuracy in storage model parameter inputs. While precipitation and evapotranspiration measurements are subject to scaling and representativeness errors, streamflow readings remain relatively dependable and allow watershed-average water budget estimates. Our study seeks to show that by “Doing Hydrology Backwards” we can effectively estimate watershed-average precipitation and evapotranspiration fluxes in semi-arid landscapes of NM using fluctuations in streamflow data alone. We tested this method in the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP) in the Jemez Mountains of central NM. This method will be further verified by using existing weather stations and eddy-covariance towers within the VCNP to obtain measured values to compare against our model results. This study contributes to further validate this technique as being successful in humid and semi-arid catchments as the method has already been verified as effective in the former setting.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed spatially- and temporally-continuous GRACE gravity observations by decomposing the gravity field changes into five independent moment tensor elements to understand the regional surface and interior deformation in response to post-earthquake stress/strain redistribution. For the 2011 Tohoku-Oki thrust earthquake, the GRACE data revealed postseismic gravity increase by 6 microGal over a 500-km scale within a couple of years, which is nearly 40–50 % of the coseismic gravity change. It originates mostly from changes in the isotropic component corresponding to the Mrr moment tensor element. For the 2012 Indian Ocean strike-slip earthquakes, the postseismic gravity change was similar to the coseismic change (including the Mw 8.6 and Mw 8.2 ruptures) with the magnitude smaller by ~80 % in two years. The gravity change corresponding to the Mtp moment tensor element is dominant (and also Mtt–Mpp to a lesser extent). In both earthquakes, the exponential decay with rapid change within a year and gradual change afterwards is a characteristic temporal pattern. We also compared the two earthquakes in terms of their respective seafloor vertical and interior deformation (Bouguer gravity). The processes responsible for the coseismic and postseismic gravity changes at a such spatial scale are, respectively, the density change (dilatation) and the viscoelastic deformation without much perturbation in density. The postseismic gravity variation is best modeled by bi-viscous relaxation with a transient and steady-state viscosity of 10^18 and 10^19 Pa s, respectively, for the asthenosphere. Furthermore, we found viscoelastic relaxation triggered by the partially-ruptured elastic lithosphere is a main driver of the local subsidence above the rupture region reported from the GPS-acoustic seafloor surveying after the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The ridge and valley province of central Pennsylvania is named for the resistant ridges of sandstone and quartzite adjacent to more easily eroded valleys of limestone and shale. Colluvium and alluvium have accumulated against the base of the ridges, enabling pedogenic processes to develop and preserve a rich history of paleoenvironmental conditions in buried soils. Our group builds on the legacy of existing scholarship on these paleosols by deciphering the timing of the initiation of pedogenesis, and characterizing the most likely paleoenvironmental conditions of soil formation.\nIn this work, we report on our first efforts to study two paleosols developed through alluvium deposited on the north-facing slope of South Mountain adjacent to the Cumberland and Lehigh Valleys. The first is a periglacial kame deposit near Emmaus, Pennsylvania that hosts a 4 meter thick soil, and the second deposit is a series of alluvial fan sequences near Mainsville, Pennsylvania that host a 10 meter thick soil. Common features observed in both these soils include a deeply rubified color and horizons with abundant iron and manganese oxides. In some localities, these iron oxides were abundant enough to be a source of iron ore during in the late 1800s. The relative proportion of amorphous iron oxides, as calculated from the ratio of oxalate extractable iron to dithionite extractable iron can be used to coarsely estimate an age for these soils. Ratios in the shallow modern brown-colored soils range from 0.21 to 0.35, and then evolve towards values of 0.088 to 0.143 in the rubified paleosols as the amorphous iron is converted to crystalline iron minerals. Evolution of iron crystallinity from comparable profiles reported in the literature takes between 1e5 and 1e6 years, suggesting a fairly long period of stability in these hillslopes.",

            "abstract": "Dynamical downscaling of Global Climate Model (GCM) simulated future projections using smaller scale, higher resolution models is widely used to assess the regional impacts of climate change on weather, ecosystems and economy. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to dynamically downscale Community Earth System Model (CESM) future projections using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 to simulate the possible effects of climate change in New Hampshire (NH). The first step to ensure that the downscaled model output is representative of the NH region is to find the correct WRF model set up for the region. This task is accomplished using CESM simulations of the historical period as forcing for WRF simulations and performing multiple sensitivity tests with different options for WRF physics parameterizations such as boundary layer, cloud microphysics and convection parameterizations. Simulated precipitation, temperature and other variables are compared with observations to obtain the more suitable model setup for NH. WRF simulations are performed on nested grids with 36, 12 and 4 km grid spacing, and the smallest grid sized nest is focused over NH. Furthermore, to prevent the drift of regional model from global model simulated climatology, WRF is reinitialized from GCM output every five days. Previous studies have shown that future regional climate model predictions of precipitation and snow water equivalent depend on the re-initialization interval of WRF from GCM forcing specifically over the western U.S, where topography is high. This problem is mainly because re-initialization erases the simulated memory for certain variables such as soil moisture. To evaluate whether re-initialization time-scale is also important in the Eastern US, in this study, the effects of 5-daily versus monthly re-initialization of WRF using CESM output on model simulated precipitation are also investigated. The obtained WRF model setup is then used to simulate future climate changes in NH using CESM forcing with RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The climatology from these downscaled climate simulations will then be used as forcing in smaller scale ecosystem and economy models to predict the economical value of climate change in the region.",

The semiarid grasslands of Mexico are part of the shortgrass steppe ecosystem, which extends from the North American midwest in the north to Llanos de Ojuelos in the south, where the study site is located. Soil moisture dynamics are measured on two homogeneous fields; one dominated by the native species (Bouteloa gracilis), and another with an introduced species (Eragrostis curvula) at three different depths with high temporal resolution along with standard climatological data. These data are related to measured Leaf Area Index (LAI) and spectra at 16 different wavelengths, both of which, in turn, are related to remotely sensed imagery through different vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI and Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI)) for different sensors (LANDSAT, SPOT, Pleiades) at different growth stages. To date, the MCARI exhibits a larger correlation with LAI for all sensors and growing stages for both grass species (ongoing field work will provide additional data). Regionalization of soil moisture dynamics (i.e. recharge) will be done using a numerical model of the vadose zone that will be linked to the temporal variation of MCARI.

The April 1, 2014 mainshock broke a portion of the subduction interface that had been previously identified as highly coupled, and seems to have been limited along strike by two zones of lower coupling. A significant earthquake occurred some 100 km to the south of, and approx. 24 hour after the mainshock (April 3, 2014 Iquique Mw 7.6 earthquake). This sequence illustrates the importance of short-term, short-range earthquake interaction mechanisms in controlling the slip behaviour of a megathrust interface, with important implications on associated hazards.\nStatic surface displacements during each phase of the sequence are determined using a combination of continuous GPS, InSAR (TerraSAR-X ScanSAR) and tide gauge records. Using a single elastic inversion procedure, we invert for the slip distribution associated with the sub-events, as well as interseismic coupling using continuous GPS, campaign GPS and InSAR measurements acquired in the years preceding the sequence. This methodology allows for consistently determining the spatial relationship between the different slip patches (pre-seismic, co-seismic, post-seismic and inter-seismic).\nThe bulk of the moment during the April 1, 2014 earthquake (Mw 8.1) was released 50 km to the south of the hypocenter, 50 km offshore from Pisagua town. In contrast, the April 3, 2014 earthquake (Mw 7.6) occurred beneath the coastal city of Iquique. Coseismic slip during the two main events depicts a complex pattern, broadly complementary with interseismic coupling, preshock / aftershock distribution and post-seismic afterslip. A detailed comparison of the successive sub-events aims at providing a first-order interpretation of the heterogeneity of frictional properties of the megathrust segment, alongside with the initial stress conditions that prevailed before the main rupture. The existence of major structural / geometric complexities within the megathrust system may also be inferred.",

            "abstract": "Accurate forecasts of solar irradiance are required for electric utilities to economically integrate substantial amounts of solar power into their power generation portfolios. A common failing of numerical weather models is the prediction of shallow cumulus clouds which are generally difficult to be resolved due to complicated processes in the planetary boundary layer. The present study carried out the sensitivity test of turbulence parameterization for better predicting solar irradiance during the shallow cumulus events near the state of Arizona by using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The results from the simulations show that increasing the exchange coefficient leads to enhanced vertical mixing and a deeper mixed layer. At the top of mixed layer, an adiabatically ascending air parcel achieved the water vapour saturation and finally shallow cumulus is generated. A detailed analysis will be discussed in the upcoming conference.",

            "abstract": "Many of the greatest challenges in the earth and environmental sciences are complex and interdisciplinary in nature. Ecohydrology exemplifies the type of holistic inquiry needed to address these challenges because it spans and integrates earth science, biological science and, often, social science. Ecohydrology courses can prepare the next generation of scientists, decision-makers and informed citizens to understand and address these challenges, and field courses in particular can play an important role in this preparation. Ecohydrology field course instructors have unique opportunities to convey interwoven theoretical and applied principles through a variety of modes that include lecture, discussion, immersion, and hands-on activity. In this presentation, we report on our experience co-teaching the Mountain Ecohydrology Field Course, a full-credit course taught 3 times in the past 5 years to more than 30 students representing 6 universities. The course, which has ranged from 1-2 weeks in length, has given students in-depth exposure to intensively instrumented ecohydrological field sites in the southern Appalachian and northern Rocky Mountains. Students learn fundamental principles in ecohydrology and related fields of watershed hydrology, soil biogeochemistry, micrometeorology and plant ecophysiology. They gain hands-on experience in a variety of cutting edge field techniques, tools and analyses while practicing presentation and communication of science. Students and instructors deal with real-world challenges of conducting fieldwork in remote settings. We offer our experience as one potential template for others interested in developing or refining ecohydrology field courses elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "A sizeable mid-crustal low velocity layer is mapped beneath the North-Western (NW) Himalaya and clear evidence for a decollement plane is reported. We performed ambient noise tomography for the NW Himalaya region using data of 31 broadband seismic stations. The ray paths sample the Himalayan region, the south Tibetan detachment zone and the Indo-Tsangpo suture zone, therefore covering the boundary regions of Indian and Eurasian plates to the South of the Karakoram fault. This part of the Himalayan region has witnessed devastating earthquakes such as Kashmir earthquake of 2005 and Kangra earthquake of 1905 along with many strong events. Rayleigh and Love waves data is utilized to extract dispersion curves for more than 500 paths for each wave. The spatial regional difference for group velocities are mapped for the periods in the range 4-40 sec, however most of the data are for period lower than 30 sec. The 2D tomography maps of fundamental mode highlight high lateral variations that may account for sub-surface tectonic deformation and variable crustal thicknesses. Larger variations are depicted for high period Rayleigh waves rather than Love waves and this mainly for the paths passing close to India-Tibet tectonic boundary. This study based on latest data gives new detail of sub-surface structural setup of the western part of Himalaya highlighting a low velocity mid-crustal layer characterized by an absence of lower crustal seismicity below decollment plane . A clear discontinuity within the physical properties mimics a possible decollement plane that could transfer sizeable earthquakes. Specifically a minimum value of Rayleigh wave velocity close to the decollement zone is reported and may likely correspond to mineral anisotropy while its existence to the lower part can be due to partial melting as per previous finding. The influence of Moho on the dispersion data suggests that this discontinuity is dipping towards north. However in the northern part close to India-Tibet plate tectonic boundary the Moho should be deeper than the efficiency of available data.",

            "abstract": "Over the past few decades there has been enormous investment in atmospheric aerosol measurements across the globe. However, ultimately only a small fraction of these measurements are used to test and improve models. GASSP aims to bring together as much aerosol measurement data as possible in combination with a novel application of statistical methods to test and improve atmospheric model processes and improve our understanding of global aerosol and climate.\nPresently, we have synthesised a vast array of diverse aerosol measurements from aircraft, ground stations and ships, combining campaign and long-term measurements conducted over the past two decades. These data include in-situ measurements of cloud condensation nuclei and aerosol particle number concentrations, sizes and chemical composition. By combining different aerosol measurements we can ensure that the model skill is consistent across a range of aerosol properties in a range of environments. We will present spatial maps and time series of these data, identifying key regions where gaps currently exist in the dataset and where future contribution from the measurement community will be most crucial.\nWe have also performed a sensitivity analysis of the output from a global aerosol model, which has identified the important sources of parameter uncertainty in all model grid cells throughout a single year. Cluster analysis of this data shows which model uncertainties can be constrained by observations in any particular global region during the year. Similarities and distinctions between clusters allows us to identify how observations made around the globe have the potential to constrain the global aerosol model and identify which model uncertainties will remain irreducible with the current suite of observations. As a first step we have used synthetic observations to constrain the model uncertainties and quantify the potential of real observations for model constraint. We then use these results to target real observations from the GASSP database that will provide the greatest constraint on model uncertainty.\nGASSP is foreseen as an ongoing effort to continually improve global models by synthesising the latest observations and we welcome continued contributions from the aerosol measurement community to our ever growing database.",

            "abstract": "Crystallization behavior of water-undersaturated haplogranite-Li-B-H2O melts was observed and recorded in diamond anvil cell (DAC) experiments. We have generated salient pegmatitic features such as coarse and zoned crystals; comb and radiating textures; and graphic intergrowths from moderately-fluxed granitic melts in the absence of a hydrous phase. The experimental conditions placed the hydrous melt under variable degrees of undercooling between their liquidus and glass transition. Undercooling of ~100-150°C below the liquidus produced crystals that reached 0.4 of cell diameter in less than one day.\nThe starting material was a homogeneous glass with 2% Li2O, 4.6% B2O3, and 3.0 or 6.5% H2O synthesized in an internally heated pressure vessel at 1200°C and 400 MPa. The composition was selected to approximate bulk cores of Li-rich pegmatites. The crystallization temperature was dropped in 50°C intervals from 600°C to 400°C to simulate pegmatite cooling. Run duration was < 3.2 days. The pressure of ~150 to 450 MPa was generated isochorically, based on a preconfigured ratio of glass to void space (created by femtosecond laser drilling) included in the cell. The shift in the wavenumber of the ν3-SiO4Raman band of a chemically inert zircon crystal was used to determine pressure as a function of temperature.\nReproducible phase assemblages were documented using Raman spectroscopy and EPMA. Virgilite (solid solution between SiO2 and LiAlSi2O6) nucleated at T≤600°C. Alkali-feldspar and muscovite nucleated at T≤550°C. Virgilite and alkali-feldspar nucleated heterogeneously on surfaces of zircon, gasket, and diamond windows (see attached figure), whereas muscovite nucleated homogeneously. Development of pegmatite texture was facilitated by the relatively low nucleation density at P of ~300 to 400 MPa. Radically higher nucleation density at an estimated P of <2.5 GPa led to an equigranular, fine-grained texture. Time-lapse photography allowed for accurate growth-rate measurements and demonstrated constant volumetric growth rate of unobstructed crystals at low to moderate fraction of crystallization. The DAC experiments complement prior kinetic studies conducted in 3 to 60 day-long time series runs in cold-seal vessels. This technique has a great potential for further applications in physical petrology.",

            "abstract": "Helium isotopes (3He/4He) have been extensively used to define distinct segments of Earth’s mantle and characterize its chemical structure. Specifically, they have been used to illustrate the long-term isolation and preservation of high-3He/4He (≥50 RA; [1]) plume-derived materials from the well-mixed and more-extensively degassed depleted MORB mantle (DMM) (8 RA; [2]). However, the He-isotope signature of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) remains relatively poorly characterized (6.1 RA; [3]). The Siberian craton hosts >1000 kimberlite intrusions, which carry mantle-derived xenoliths – of varying compositions (i.e., peridotites, dunites, and eclogites) – to the Earth’s surface, making it an ideal setting for investigating the chemical evolution of the SCLM. Here, we report new He-isotope and concentration data for a suite of eclogitic xenoliths (n=10) from the Udachnaya pipe, Siberia.\nHe-isotopes and [He] contents were determined by crushing garnet and pyroxene mineral separates from 2.7-3.1 Ga Siberian eclogites. 3He/4He values ranged from 0.11 to 1.0 RA, displaying predominantly radiogenic (i.e., low 3He/4He) He-isotope values. In contrast, Siberian flood basalt values extend up to ~13 RA [4]. Helium concentrations span ~4 orders of magnitude from 60 to 569,000 [4He]C ncm3STP/g. The radiogenic nature of Udachnaya eclogites indicate that they have been largely isolated from basaltic metasomatic fluxes over geological time due to position within the lithosphere and/or lithospheric age. Further, low 3He/4He values may reflect the addition of high U-Th material into the lithosphere by accretion of ancient island-arc terrains. These new data add to the growing He-isotope database [5,6] for the Siberian SCLM, and reveal the heterogeneous nature of this region with respect to He-isotopes, as well as the potential importance of crustal recycling and metasomatic processes.\n[1] Stuart et al., 2003.

            "abstract": "Once seen as exotic, global subsurface oceans are now considered to be a likely feature of many large icy satellites, with Europa and Titan as prime candidates. Under tidal forcing, the icy crust deforms as a viscoelastic membrane decoupled from the deep interior by the ocean layer. Regarding tidal effects, these satellites thus deserve more to be called `membrane worlds' rather than `ocean worlds'. I describe here the viscoelastic membrane approach, a new powerful tool to compute all tidal effects in a laterally uniform crust with depth-dependent rheology. This approach leads to simple analytical formulas for viscoelastic tidal Love numbers, with an accuracy better than one percent for h2 and k2, and a few percents for l2. This accuracy is sufficient for most applications. Membrane formulas clearly show how Love numbers depend on the interior structure (primarily the crust rigidity, crust thickness, ocean density and mean density). This method also yields simple analytical formulas for viscoelastic tidal stresses and tidal dissipation in the crust. All in all, the viscoelastic membrane approach is a good alternative to software encoding the full theory of viscoelastic-gravitational deformations.",

This powerful in-situ computational platform has been created to help serve and analyse the massive amounts of data across the spectrum of environmental collections – in particular the climate, observational data and geoscientific domains. This paper examines the infrastructure, innovation and opportunity for this significant research platform.\nNCI currently manages nationally significant data collections (10+ PB) categorised as 1) earth system sciences, climate and weather model data assets and products, 2) earth and marine observations and products, 3) geosciences, 4) terrestrial ecosystem, 5) water management and hydrology, and 6) astronomy, social science and biosciences. The data is largely sourced from the NCI partners (who include the custodians of many of the national scientific records), major research communities, and collaborating overseas organisations. By co-locating these large valuable data assets, new opportunities have arisen by harmonising the data collections, making a powerful transdisciplinary research platform\nThe data is accessible within an integrated HPC-HPD environment - a 1.2 PFlop supercomputer (Raijin), a HPC class 3000 core OpenStack cloud system and several highly connected large scale and high-bandwidth Lustre filesystems.\nNew scientific software, cloud-scale techniques, server-side visualisation and data services have been harnessed and integrated into the platform, so that analysis is performed seamlessly across the traditional boundaries of the underlying data domains. Characterisation of the techniques along with performance profiling ensures scalability of each software component, all of which can either be enhanced or replaced through future improvements.\nA Development-to-Operations (DevOps) framework has also been implemented to manage the scale of the software complexity alone. This ensures that software is both upgradable and maintainable, and can be readily reused with complexly integrated systems and become part of the growing global trusted community tools for cross-disciplinary research.\n ",

            "abstract": "The National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) has established a powerful in-situ computational environment to enable both high performance computing and data-intensive science across a wide spectrum of national environmental data collections – in particular climate, observational data and geoscientific assets. This paper examines 1) the computational environments that supports the modelling and data processing pipelines, 2) the analysis environments and methods to support data analysis, and 3) the progress in addressing harmonisation of the underlying data collections for future transdisciplinary research that enable accurate climate projections.\nNCI makes available 10+ PB major data collections from both the government and research sectors based on six themes: 1) weather, climate, and earth system science model simulations, 2) marine and earth observations, 3) geosciences, 4) terrestrial ecosystems, 5) water and hydrology, and 6) astronomy, social and biosciences. Collectively they span the lithosphere, crust, biosphere, hydrosphere, troposphere, and stratosphere. The data is largely sourced from NCI’s partners (which include the custodians of many of the national scientific records), major research communities, and collaborating overseas organisations.\nThe data is accessible within an integrated HPC-HPD environment - a 1.2 PFlop supercomputer (Raijin), a HPC class 3000 core OpenStack cloud system and several highly connected large scale and high-bandwidth Lustre filesystems. This computational environment supports a catalogue of integrated reusable software and workflows from earth system and ecosystem modelling, weather research, satellite and other observed data processing and analysis.\nTo enable transdisciplinary research on this scale, data needs to be harmonised so that researchers can readily apply techniques and software across the corpus of data available and not be constrained to work within artificial disciplinary boundaries. Future challenges will involve the further integration and analysis of this data across the social sciences to facilitate the impacts across the societal domain, including timely analysis to more accurately predict and forecast future climate and environmental state.",

            "abstract": "The effect of bottom trawling activities on continental shelves has been a topic of interest for both fishery resource studies and ecological impact studies for a while. However, the impact of demersal fishing gear was almost exclusively studied from a perspective of its effects on benthic fauna, but recently it has also attracted attention due to its profound impact on sediments. Here we present the first study to quantify the trawling-induced sediment resuspension effect by combining satellite-based spatial patterns of bottom trawling with quantitative measurements of induced sediment plumes. This study examined high-resolution GPS vessel monitoring data from one year (2011-2012) to quantify the sedimentary budget caused by bottom trawling activity for the entire NW Iberian shelf, an area that is widely affected by chronic (continuous and intensive) commercial bottom trawling and is exemplary for many other narrow shelves worldwide.\nBy filtering the GPS data by vessel type, vessel speed, and geometry of the trawl path, we resolved geographically detailed bottom trawling activities with varying local trawling intensities depending both on legal restrictions and bedrock geomorphology. Initial results show that trawling-induced resuspended sediments mark a significant if not dominant factor for a source to sink sedimentary budget, as they are calculated to be approximately two times as large as fluvial sedimentary input to the shelf.\nUltimately, these results not only allow for a trawling affected sediment budget but also significantly help with marine management decisions by allowing to predict the mobilization and transport of sediment caused by bottom trawling gear at the level of a specific fishing fleet or ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "The Atacama Desert of northern Chile is one of the driest regions on Earth and receives less than 5mm of precipitation annually. The Pampa del Tamarugal (PdT) Basin contains the largest aquifer system in the region, yet the mechanisms and timing of aquifer recharge and continental-scale groundwater flux are poorly understood. Although there is little debate that the source of groundwater recharge is the higher elevation regions of the Andean Altiplano to the east of the PdT Basin, there remains much uncertainty surrounding the mechanisms and timing of aquifer recharge and continental-scale groundwater flux. Most recharge models of the PdT focus on surface water runoff and alluvial fan recharge on shorter time scales, but many of these models explicitly neglect deep flow pathways. Previous investigators have combined the thermal aquifer profile and 14C groundwater ages to propose an alternative conceptual model in which cold meteoric water infiltrates deep into the Cordillera before circulating upward into the PdT by thermal convection through fault-controlled migration pathways. Although this conceptual model provides a convincing theoretical argument for deep fluid circulation, it cannot constrain the magnitude of this deep recharge flux. In this work, we revisit deep-flow conceptual model by combining the spatial distribution of hydrogen and oxygen isotope values as groundwater tracers with a non-isothermal model of continental scale groundwater flow through a two-dimensional transect from the Chilean Andes to the PdT Basin. This work provides first-order estimates on the contribution of deep groundwater circulation within the PdT Aquifer, while providing a framework for (1) quantifying boundary conditions for high resolution models of groundwater resources within the PdT Aquifer, (2) assessing the influence of variable future climate scenarios for groundwater availability in the region, and (3) further integrating conservative tracers and numerical models for groundwater resource evaluation in hyperarid environments.",

            "abstract": "In February 2014, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a\nBig Data Request for Information\n(RFI) from industry and other organizations (e.g., non-profits, research laboratories, and universities) to assess capability and interest in establishing partnerships to position a copy of NOAA's vast data holdings in the Cloud, co-located with easy and affordable access to analytical capabilities. This RFI was motivated by a number of concerns. First, NOAA's data facilities do not necessarily have sufficient network infrastructure to transmit all available observations and numerical model outputs to all potential users, or sufficient infrastructure to support simultaneous computation by many users. Second, the available data are distributed across multiple services and data facilities, making it difficult to find and integrate data for cross-domain analysis and decision-making. Third, large datasets require users to have substantial network, storage, and computing capabilities of their own in order to fully interact with and exploit the latent value of the data. Finally, there may be commercial opportunities for value-added products and services derived from our data. Putting a working copy of data in the Cloud outside of NOAA's internal networks and infrastructures should reduce demands and risks on our systems, and should enable users to interact with multiple datasets and create new lines of business (much like the industries built on government-furnished weather or GPS data).\nThe NOAA Big Data RFI therefore solicited information on technical and business approaches regarding possible partnership(s) that -- at no net cost to the government and minimum impact on existing data facilities -- would unleash the commercial potential of its environmental observations and model outputs. NOAA would retain the master archival copy of its data. Commercial partners would not be permitted to charge fees for access to the NOAA data they receive, but would be able to develop and sell value-added products and services. This effort is still very much in the initial market research phase and has complexity in technical, business, and technical domains. This paper will discuss the current status of the activity and potential next steps.",

            "abstract": "Segregation of the metallic core from a silicate mantle is a crucial aspect of early planetary evolution. Although a magma ocean scenario is often used to explain differentiation of large planets such as Earth, smaller planets and planetesimals likely never achieved the high temperatures necessary for wide scale melting. In these smaller bodies, silicates may have only partially melted, or not melted at all. Furthermore, isotopic signatures in meteorites suggest that some planetesimals differentiated within just a few million years. Achieving core segregation on this time scale whereby core material drains through a solid silicate mantle via an interconnected network of melt faces two major problems: (1) in a hydrostatic situation, the percolation threshold is above 5 vol% melt, so the process would lead to inefficient core formation, and (2) the permeability of fully connected melts at microstructural equilibrium is low enough that some planetesimals may still not be able to differentiate on this short time scale. It has been suggested that shear deformation can cause isolated melt pockets to become connected even at low melt fractions. Here, we have measured the change in permeability of core forming melts in solid silicate and partially molten silicate matrix due to deformation. Mixtures of olivine or KLB-1 peridotite and FeS close to the equilibrium percolation threshold (~5 vol% FeS) were pre-synthesized to achieve an equilibrium microstructure, and then loaded into the high pressure X-ray tomography apparatus at GSECARS, sector 13-BMD, at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory). The samples were then pressed to ~2GPa, and heated to ~1100°C. Alternating cycles of rotation to collect X-ray tomography images, and twisting to deform the sample were conducted. Starting materials and run products have also been analysed at high resolution in three dimensions using FIB/SEM cross-beam tools. Quantitative analyses have been performed on the resulting 3-dimensional x-ray tomographic images to evaluate the effect of shear deformation on permeability of core forming melts, and place constraints on the timing of core formation in smaller terrestrial planets and planetesimals.",

The metadata produced by those modules and others are available from the Heliophysics Events Knowledgebase (HEK) and the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO). Having metadata available for large amounts of events and phenomena, obtained with consistent detection criteria unlike catalogs produced by human observers, allows researchers to effectively search solar data for patterns.\nI will show a number of science results obtained recently. Not surprisingly several of the patterns are well known (e.g. flares occur mostly in active regions), but some really surprising new trends have been discovered as well, in at least one case upending scientific consensus. These results show the power and promise that systematic feature recognition and data mining holds for solar physics.",

            "abstract": "Benzene is found at high abundance in Titan’s atmosphere and is a likely constituent of evaporite deposits formed around the hydrocarbon lakes. This work aims to understand the composition and nature of the surface evaporites by focusing on the interaction between benzene and ethane, a principal component of the lake fluids. We have discovered a new benzene-ethane co-crystalline structure which forms under Titan-like conditions (90-150 K and 1 bar), resulting in recrystallization of the benzene lattice that can be detected via micro-Raman spectroscopy. Evidence for ethane incorporation includes two new distinctive ethane features at 2873 and 1455 cm-1 and marked red shifts of the benzene peaks in the Raman spectra. Vibrational analysis reveals a C-H…π interaction between the aromatic ring of benzene and the hydrogen atoms of ethane through a monodentate contact. The kinetics of co-crystal formation is also determined, giving a relatively mild activation energy of 10.2 kJ/mol. It is shown that the formation process would reach completion in ~18 hours, and that benzene precipitates selectively as the co-crystal from a mixture of liquid ethane and methane. Synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data confirms the crystalline nature of the new material. These results imply that benzene and similar organics may act as potential hydrocarbon reservoirs due to this incorporation mechanism. These novel structures represent a new class of materials for Titan’s surface that may influence evaporite characteristics, such as particle size and infrared spectral properties.",

            "abstract": "Urban regions are characterized by highly concentrated emissions of greenhouse gases, accounting for an estimated ~70% of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions from energy usage. Traditional long-term measurement networks designed to constrain the global carbon budget have sites situated in remote regions far from urban centers, rendering such sites unable to resolve signatures of spatial and temporal variability from urban emissions. Here we present a unique, long-term record of CO2 concentrations at five locations ranging from rapidly growing to fully mature urban regions in Utah’s Salt Lake Valley, based on continuous measurements since 2001. Trends in concentration enhancements above background levels were found to vary throughout the valley, with mature urban areas (Salt Lake City) exhibiting declining CO2 enhancements and previously rural areas undergoing urban growth, having increasing CO2 enhancements. Furthermore, divergent trends were observed at different times of the day, potentially indicating long-term changes in emissions from different contributing sources. Multiple hypotheses to explain the trends in CO2 enhancements will be discussed, including changes in socioeconomic (e.g., population, traffic, energy efficiency) and meteorological (e.g., atmospheric mixing heights, temperatures) factors. This spatially distributed long-term CO2 monitoring network also provides a case study for understanding factors relevant to the design of urban trace gas observatories.",

            "abstract": "The prairie pothole region (PPR) extends over approximately 700,000 km2 in the Great Plains region in United States and Canada and is a critical breeding ground for migratory waterfowl, as well as an important ecosystem for diverse invertebrates and aquatic plants (van der Valk, 2003). Consisting of up to 12 million permanent and temporary depressional wetlands, the PPR is negatively impacted by non-point source pesticide pollution due to extensive agricultural development in the region. Recent studies have shown that high (mM) levels of sulfate in the pothole lakes are capable of abiotically reducing dinitroaniline and chloroacetanilide pesticides (Zeng, 2011; Zeng, 2012). In this study the transformation of the organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos (CP) and its analog chlorpyrifos-methyl (CPM) was studied using pore waters sampled from two pothole lakes. CP and CPM have been found to react in the laboratory with sulfur species via a SN2 mechanism, with degradation by sulfur compounds occurring faster than hydrolysis at high pH (Wu, 2006). To date the reaction of CP and CPM in natural environments with sulfur species has not been studied. Chlorpyrifos-methyl underwent rapid degradation in the presence of reduced sulfur species in pore water, while chlorpyrifos degradation occurred at significantly slower rates. Both CP and CPM degradation occurred at comparable rates to what has been previously observed in the laboratory (Wu, 2006).\n",

Also the fundamental physics of the MJO are still elusive. In this talk, by analyzing multi-model climate simulations from the WCRP-WWRP/THORPEX YOTC MJO Task Force and GEWEX GASS global model inter-comparison project, roles of radiative heating and convection-circulation feedback for the MJO will be discussed under a framework of the gross moist stability analysis. While not directly responsible for the model MJO performance, the strength of the cloud-radiative feedback as denoted by the radiative versus convective heating ratio is significantly associated with amplitude of the intraseasonal variability in a model. In agreement with several previous studies, analysis also suggests that the net moist energy import to the atmospheric column by convection-induced circulation could be critical for sustaining the MJO.",

            "abstract": "The Driftless Area of the Upper Midwestern United States is a unique region that was not glaciated during the Quaternary Period. Groundwater discharges in the hilly landscape support over 4,000 miles of coldwater, high-class trout streams that are a destination for anglers across the Midwest. Temperature increases due to anthropogenic climate change are predicted to have a negative impact on the cold water thermal regimes that support species such as brook and brown trout. Previous work has concluded that the hillslopes in the region play an important role in producing the recharge that supports cool groundwater discharges concentrated in the headwaters of these streams.\nIn this study, we used a set of baseflow measurements recorded by Potter and Gaffield (2001) in the headwaters of a Driftless Area stream and a simple Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis to assess the relationship between the percentage of hillslope in a watershed and average unit baseflow. We found that there is a strong correlation between the hillslope percentage and the unit baseflow values from the Potter and Gaffield (2001) study. Further work is needed to verify the findings of this study and to assess the impacts of the underlying geological layers on the production of baseflow, but these results provide a first step in understanding the conditions that produce spatial variability in baseflow conditions in the Driftless Area. Agencies such as the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources are beginning to plan for climate change adaptation in the region to protect the coldwater fisheries, so understanding the hydrology of headwater streams will be important in helping to identify areas with high, coldwater baseflow discharges that can provided refugia for coldwater species.",

The use of a custom automated exchange mechanism allowed for continuous sampling, both above-canopy and in-canopy.

            "abstract": "In the southwestern US, climate change will impact the amount, timing and variability of rainfall during the summer monsoon. Changes in amount and seasonality of precipitation are likely to affect plant community dynamics and ecosystem processes, especially along ecotones. In 2012, we established a rainfall manipulation experiment (EDGE-Extreme Drought in Grasslands Experiment) in Chihuahuan Desert grassland (CDG) dominated by black grama and shortgrass steppe (SGS) dominated by blue grama across a grassland ecotone in central New Mexico. EDGE includes two rainfall treatments, chronic drought (~66% reduction in monsoon rainfall) and altered timing of the summer monsoon. Chronic drought is imposed from July through September by rainout shelters with roof panels that cover 66% of the surface area. To alter precipitation seasonality complete rainout shelters are erected in July and August, and all rainfall that occurred during this period is captured, stored, and then reapplied in several large rain events during September and October. Thus, this treatment receives the same amount of precipitation as ambient but differs in seasonality and frequency of rain events. We measured soil moisture, aboveground net primary production (ANPP), and plant species composition in each replicate (n=10) of each treatment at CDG and SGS sites. There were no significant pre-treatment differences in ANPP or plant species richness at either site. In 2013 following an above average monsoon, ambient ANPP was 99.4 g m-2 at CDG and 44.3 g m-2 at SGS. Event size reduction resulted in a 75% reduction in ANPP at CDG but only a 33% reduction in ANPP at SGS. Shifting the monsoon to later in the growing season resulted in a 50% and 43% reduction in ANPP at CDG and SGS, respectively. Thus, ANPP at CDG partially recovered from the mid-summer drought with late season precipitation but SGS did not. Event size reduction also resulted in a decrease in species richness at CDG, but not at SGS. These short-term results suggest that chronic drought and changes in precipitation seasonality are likely to have significant impacts on grassland communities across this ecotone. The ability of black grama grassland to recover to a greater extent than blue grama suggests that CDG may continue to expand northward replacing SGS vegetation under a changing precipitation regime.",

            "abstract": "Faults are weak features within reservoir-caprock systems and may affect the sealing integrity of suitable CO2-storage reservoirs. Changes in stress state due to CO2-injection may induce fault slip movement and potentially result in the formation of leakage pathways to fluids stored in the reservoir. Therefore, it is important to investigate the effect of changes in stress state on the slip tendency and transport properties of fault zones. However, flow properties of a fault zone are not only controlled by the fault core, but also by the surrounding damage zone. Therefore, it is important to understand the behaviour of both the fault core, consisting of fine-grained fault gouge, and the damaged but intact surrounding caprock.\nFault slip behaviour depends on both the stress state and the mineralogical composition of the fault plane. We investigated the effect of stress state on fault friction behaviour, fault reactivation, slip stability and flow properties. Three types of a natural clay-rich caprock (Opalinus Claystone (OPA), Mont Terri, Switzerland) were used: i) natural clay-rich simulated (crushed) fault gouge, ii) intact claystone samples and iii) intact clay-rich fault core material from the main fault in the OPA. The OPA consists of phyllosilicates (60%), quartz (~20 %) and calcite (~15-25%).\nWe performed triaxial, direct shear experiments at room temperature (σneff = 5-50 MPa, Pp = 2 MPa, V = 0.054 -10.9 µm/s). For the simulated fault gouge samples, across and along fault (argon) permeametry were measured both prior and during deformation to investigate the effect of shear displacement on transport properties. For the intact samples, only across fault permeability measurements were made.\nPreliminary results show that permeability decreases with shear displacement. The initial permeability of intact OPA is in the order of 10-20 m2. The permeability of simulated fault gouges, both along and across fault, is sensitive to the applied normal stress, with permeability decreasing gradually with normal stress from ~10-17 to 10-19 m2 for across fault permeability and from 10-16 to 10-18 m2 for along fault permeability. Across permeability is generally 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than permeability measured along the fault plane. This suggests that flow along the fault will be easier than across fault.",

The lack of such sustained observations was identified in the Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS) Cryosphere Theme Report as a major shortcoming. Conventional altimetry measurements over GISMs exist, but coverage has been sparse and characterized by coarse ground resolution. Additionally, and more importantly, they proved ineffective in the presence of steep slopes, a typical feature of GISM areas. Since the majority of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet mass loss is estimated to lie within 100 km from the coast, but only about 10% is surveyed, there is the need for more robust and dense observations of GISMs, in both time and space.\nThe ESA Altimetry mission CryoSat aims at gaining better insight into the evolution of the Cryosphere. CryoSat’s revolutionary design features a Synthetic Interferometric Radar Altimeter (SIRAL), with two antennas for interferometry. The corresponding SAR Interferometer (SARIn) mode of operation increases spatial resolution while resolving the angular origin of off-nadir echoes occurring over sloping terrain. The SARIn mode is activated over GISMs and the elevation for the Point Of Closest Approach (POCA) is a standard product of the CryoSat mission.\nHere we present an approach for more comprehensively exploiting the SARIn mode of CryoSat and produce an ice elevation product with enhanced spatial resolution compared to standard CryoSat-2 height products. In this so called L2-swath processing approach, the full CryoSat waveform is exploited under specific conditions of signal and surface characteristics. We will present the rationale, validation exercises and preliminary results from the Eurpean Space Agency's STSE CryoTop study over selected test regions of the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets.",

Significant modelling challenges arise, due to the complexities of the cold region hydrology and the current manifestations of climate warming, including permafrost thaw, increased streamflow, tundra shrub expansion, among other processes. Robust large-scale predictive models are necessary for regional and global impacts assessment, along with proper validation and uncertainty estimation of model structure and forcing data. We present an intercomparison of global model performance on the MRB and analysis of the impact of uncertainty in forcing data. With that purpose, we have implemented for the MRB a large-scale model using the Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire – Surface and Hydrology (MESH) model driven with several gridded forcing data sets. We compare the model performance with the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES), the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) models. Results will be presented to illustrate the comparative performance of water balance components and streamflow simulations. As for the uncertainty in forcing data, precipitation has the major impact, especially the rainfall spatial variability.",

            "abstract": "Characterizing the intrinsic nonlinearity in meandering river dynamics is important because it dictates river evolution response to perturbations such as bank armoring or channel straightening. Meandering river dynamics have been described in terms of chaos or self-organized criticality—characterizations predicated on the presence of nonlinearity—yet recent studies have found only limited evidence for its existence.\nStandard nonlinearity tests are performed by generating a number of linearized surrogate series from a signal of interest. Inherent nonlinearities in the original signal are destroyed in the surrogates via phase randomization in the Fourier domain. Nonlinearity is inferred if a significant difference exists between the original and the surrogates in an appropriately determined phase space. These tests detect the presence or absence of nonlinearity but cannot identify which scales and locations are contributing most to the signal’s nonlinearity. A new surrogate generation method called Gradual Wavelet Reconstruction (GWR) has two key advantages over the standard methodology. First, GWR quantifies the degree of nonlinearity rather than simply detecting its presence or absence, providing a basis for comparisons between river planforms and models of meander migration. Second, because the GWR methodology relies on localized transformations, it can determine the scales and locations primarily contributing to the observed complexity. As a result of those advantages too, GWR has been shown to detect the presence of nonlinearity in signals where standard tests have failed.\nWe apply GWR methodology to time series of channel sinuosity predicted by two established models of long-time meander migration: a HIPS-type model and that of Zolezzi and Seminara (2001). Although the former model has been shown to capture first-order meander dynamics, it fails to fully couple sediment and flow dynamics; nor does it account for the resonance phenomenon. Using GWR, we show how incorporating these additional physical processes affects the nonlinearity of the signal. We also analyze planform geometries of meandering rivers flowing through different geomorphic settings and develop hypotheses about how scale-dependent nonlinearities relate to the underlying physical environment.",

            "abstract": "While atmospheric reanalysis datasets are widely used in climate science, many technical issues hinder comparing them to each other and to observations. The reanalysis fields are stored in diverse file architectures, data formats, and resolutions, with metadata, such as variable name and units, that also differ. Individual users have to download the fields, convert them to a common format, store them locally, change variable names, re-grid if needed, and convert units. Comparing reanalyses with observational datasets is difficult for similar reasons. Even if a dataset can be read via Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP) or a similar protocol, most of this work is still needed. All of these tasks take time, effort, and money. To overcome some of the obstacles in reanalysis intercomparison, our group at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado and affiliated colleagues at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) Earth System Research Laboratory Physical Sciences Division (ESRL/PSD) have created a set of Web-based Reanalysis Intercomparison Tools (WRIT) at\nhttp://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/writ/\n. WRIT allows users to easily plot and compare reanalysis and observational datasets, and to test hypotheses. Currently, there are tools to plot monthly mean maps and vertical cross-sections, timeseries, and trajectories for standard pressure level and surface variables. Users can refine dates, statistics, and plotting options. Reanalysis datasets currently available include the NCEP/NCAR R1, NCEP/DOE R2, MERRA, ERA-Interim, NCEP CFSR and the 20CR. Observational datasets include those containing precipitation (e.g. GPCP), temperature (e.g. GHCNCAMS), winds (e.g. WASWinds), precipitable water (e.g. NASA NVAP), SLP (HadSLP2), and SST (NOAA ERSST). WRIT also facilitates the mission of the\nReanalyses.org\nwebsite as a convenient toolkit for studying the reanalysis datasets.",

To this end we use the Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager (SSUSI) instrument on the DMSP F16, F17 and F18 satellites located in a low Earth polar orbit to study EMIC wave related proton aurora. These data are used to characterize the spatial extent and properties of the proton aurora and associated EMIC waves. Specifically, we use the combination of ultraviolet observations of proton aurora, energetic particle data from DMSP, and EMIC wave data to characterize spatial extent of EMIC waves relative to magnetospheric boundaries; magnetic local time differences in wave characteristics and the spatial/temporal extent of the proton auroras. The two dimensional view made possible by ultraviolet imaging will be used to understand the spatial extent of EMIC wave activity in order to guide their incorporation into ring current wave-particle interaction models.",

            "abstract": "We will present estimates of joint probability distributions for climate system properties that are based on new simulations using the MIT Earth System Model (MESM). Differing from earlier estimates, these simulations are based on updating the historical forcing data sets to include data through 2012. These input data include anthropogenic greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols, land-use change, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, stratospheric aerosols due to volcanic eruptions, and total solar irradiance. Additionally, the MESM has been updated to include a new land-surface model (the Community Land Model, CLM3.5) that provides an improved estimate of the components of the surface heat balance compared to CLM2.1. CLM 3.5 allows for an accounting of the impact of land-use change on surface characteristics, such as albedo and roughness.\nWe estimate the likelihood of the climate system properties using the approach of Libardoni and Forest (2013). We include model constraints based on changes in decadal mean, zonal-mean surface temperatures, upper-air temperature trends, and ocean heat content trends and include the period of record up to 2012. These results will be compared with Libardoni and Forest (2013) and results presented in the IPCC AR5 WG1. We will also investigate the dependence of parameter distributions to the structure of model diagnostics. Changes in the diagnostics include changing the end date of the period of record, changing the averaging periods, calculating means with respect to different climatology periods, spatial averaging schemes used to aggregate observational data to the model grid, and the spatial resolution of model diagnostics. In particular, reducing the spatial resolution of the upper-air diagnostic allows for better estimation of the natural variability and allows for temporal information to be accounted for when comparing model output to observations.\nFurther improvements to the likelihood estimates include updating noise-covariance estimates to use control run data obtained from CESM1/CCSM4 to be consistent across the multiple diagnostics. Using control run data from a consistent source allows for correlations and covariances in the model diagnostics to be accounted for in parameter estimation.",

            "abstract": "MIIC started as a NASA funded ACCESS proposal in 2011 to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a web-based tool to support LEO-GEO and LEO-LEO GSICS backed intercalibration studies. The initial effort demonstrated the benefits of using OPeNDAP and user developed server-side functions to provide efficient access to L1 SCIAMACHY, GOES-13, and MODIS data. Matched data in viewing geometry from instruments on separate spacecraft are subset, filtered, and transformed on remote servers prior to network download. The follow-on MIIC proposal will extend features for intercomparison of derived geophysical variables and data mining validation studies; as well as, demonstrate a significant reduction in data transfer to support climate model vs. observational data comparisons using OSSE data. Deployed MIIC services will provide access to L1 and L2 datasets from instruments such as CERES, CALIPSO, VIIRS, CrIS, ATMS, and GOES housed at the NASA ASDC and NOAA NCDC data centers. Data products must be in the HDF or netCDF file format. Server-side functions include 2DHistogram, N-Tuple, spatial and spectral convolution for data matching and synthesis. MIIC services accessible via a web page or RESTful API include event prediction, data acquisition, and analysis. Event prediction determines when satellite instruments meet viewing conditions over surface sites and orbit crossings. Matched data are automatically acquired and filtered using a combination of server-side and client-side functions. MIIC services advance interoperability of data located at the NASA ASDC and NOAA NCDC and reduce data required for analysis by several orders of magnitude.",

            "abstract": "Arctic coastal systems are recognized as being one of the most climate change - vulnerable ecosystems on Earth and represent a complex nexus for examining change at the interface between marine, terrestrial, atmospheric, cryospheric and social systems. Although coastal erosion has received increased attention in the Arctic, few studies have examined the fine scale spatiotemporal dynamics and variability in erosion rates relative to the range of factors that act concomitantly to control erosion (e.g. duration of ice free seas, bathymetry, wave action, sea and air temperature, landscape morphology). This study reports on the spatiotemporal dynamics of annual DGPS surveys of eroding coastal bluffs in northern Alaska near the city of Barrow. Surveys along ca. 11km of the Elson Lagoon coast have been conducted since 2002 and additional surveys along ca. 120km of Elson Lagoon and Chuckhi Sea coast have been conducted since 2013. There has been strong inter-annual spatiotemporal variability in erosion rates with no indication of a long term change in erosion rates over time. Factors controlling wave intensity (e.g. wind run, off shore bathymetry, aspect of the coast relative to prevailing winds) explain most variability in erosion rates over time but during relatively calm periods, landscape history and morphology become more important. These findings highlight the extreme fine scale spatiotemporal heterogeneity in erosion rates along the Arctic Coast, and the importance of incorporating both storm-related climatic events and landscape characteristics when forecasting future environmental states in Arctic coastal landscapes. Case studies outlining new remote sensing technologies and future directions of study will also be outlined including terrestrial and airborne LiDAR, and Kite, UAV, and satellite imagery that is being used to derive and monitor topographic and hydrological change near eroding coastal bluffs; a wireless sensor network of micrometeorological and optical sensors; low cost tri-axial accelerometers that measure wave amplitude, period and azimuth; a survey vessel for mapping near shore bathymetry and water chemistry; and a web-based decision tool for improving management and planning of the coastal zone near Barrow.",

            "abstract": "Volcán Baru, located in the western province of Chiriquí, is Panamas youngest and most active volcano. Although Baru has experienced no historic eruptions there have been four eruptive episodes in the last 1,600 years, the most recent occuring 400-500 years ago (Sherrod et al., 2008). In addition there have been four reported earthquake swarms in the last 100 years. The most recent swarm occured in May of 2006, prompting a USGS hazard assessment (Sherrod et al., 2008). Given its proximity to populated valleys on both the east and west flanks as well as to the coastal plain and interamerican highway 30km to the south, Baru presents a significant hazard. Residents of the small towns on the flanks of Baru frequently feel and hear earthquakes, yet there is no permanent monitoring network, seismic or otherwise, in place. In order to characterize local seismicity and provide a reference for future monitoring efforts, we established a seismic network that operated from May 2013 through April 2014. The network consisted of eight temporary single component, short period sensors generously loaned by OSOP Panama, two permanent sensors (one three component and one single component) funded by the University of Panama, and one three component broadband sensor owned by Angel Rodriguez. These were distributed over a 35 by 15 km area. Preliminary analysis suggests that local, M 0-3.5 events occur at the rate of 10-20 per month. Analysis of the earthquake catalog and the significance of shallow seismicity at Baru will be presented.\nSherrod, D.R., Vallance, J.W., Tapia Espinosa, A., and McGeehin, J.P., 2008, Volcan Baru—eruptive history and volcano-hazards assessment: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2007–1401, 33 p.",

The spatial structure of the OBP anomalies is centered on the North Atlantic Current along the intergyre region separating subtropical and subpolar ocean basins, and their temporal behavior is tied to indices of climate variability, namely, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation. Correspondence to variations in wind stress curl suggests an interpretation of the midlatitude North Atlantic OBP variability in terms of a barotropic Sverdrup balance. Anomalous mass in the midlatitude North Atlantic Ocean covaries with mass anomalies in abutting marginal seas, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Arctic Ocean as well as the North Sea and Hudson Bay. Results have implications for diagnosing ocean meridional heat transports due to depth-independent gyre circulation changes.",

            "abstract": "Several federal agencies in north-central United States are each working to develop and disseminate useful climate information to enhance resilience to climate change. This talk will discuss how the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) the North Central Climate Science Center, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Western Water Assessment RISA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Climate Hub, are building and managing a collaborative research and climate-service network in the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. This presentation will describe the evolution of the interagency collaboration and the partnership with universities to build a climate service network. Such collaboration takes time and intention and must include the right people and organizations to effectively bridge the gap between use-inspired research and application. In particular, we will discuss a focus on the Upper Missouri Basin, developing research to meet needs in a basin that has had relatively less attention on risks of climate change and adaptation to those risks.\nEach organization has its own mission, stakeholders, and priorities, but there are many commonalities and potential synergies. Together, these organizations, and their agency scientists and university partners, are fostering cross-agency collaboration at the regional scale to optimize efficient allocation of resources while simultaneously enabling information to be generated at a scale that is relevant to decision makers. By each organization knowing the others needs and priorities, there are opportunities to craft research agendas and strategies for providing services that take advantage of the strengths and skills of the different organizations. University partners are key components of each organization, and of the collaboration, who bring in expertise beyond that in the agencies, in particular connections to social scientists, extension services.",

It is created by solar wind-magnetospheric coupling, and its size is proportional to the open magnetic flux available for nightside reconnection. One of the difficulties in the study of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling is the large spatial domain it involves. Systematic studies of the polar cap dynamics are still rare. This study addresses this issue by utilizing global auroral images, from which the polar cap area can be extracted, acquired with the Ultraviolet Imager on board the Polar satellite. In particular, we quantify the area of polar cap and correlate it with solar wind parameters. Our preliminary results clearly demonstrate, as expected, a clear relationship between the dayside polar cap area and the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field. Other solar wind parameters also affect the polar cap size but with a lesser degree. We will present a detailed analysis and discuss the resulting implications.",

            "abstract": "High velocity friction experiments on rock gouge and bare rock have demonstrated that, for velocity weakening materials, the value of the coefficient of friction (µ) decreases rapidly as sliding velocities reach seismic slip rates. Several mechanisms have been proposed as sources of dynamic weakening, including flash heating or melting of asperities, caused by insufficient heat diffusion due to large amounts of work generated over a short period of time. Furthermore, during individual rupture events, the bulk shear stress and strain are commonly localized along a principle slip zone (PSZ), located within the fault core zone. To investigate the frictional and microstructural behavior or rock gouge under seismically relevant normal stresses, slip velocities and accelerations, experiments using a modified torsional Kolsky bar apparatus were conducted on SAFOD Interlaboratory Comparison gouge samples at normal stresses from 46 MPa to 121 MPa, slip velocities up to 5.3 m/s, and slip distances up to 4.5 mm. The dynamic friction coefficient (µd) peaked within the first 100 µm of slip followed by a rapid decrease after a critical slip distance for all experiments with slip velocities above 1.2 m/s, on trend with expectations of dynamic weakening. µd decreased with increasing slip velocity for both SAFOD and Westerly granite and µd decreased with increasing normal stress for Westerly granite while SAFOD µd exhibited no pressure dependence. SEM analysis of sheared gouge revealed fully developed principle slip zones exhibiting significant grain size reduction to sizes <<1 µm in all Westerly samples with average slip velocities ≥ 2 m/s irrespective of normal stress, with no evidence of melting. Computed temperatures during the experiments are consistent with flash heating being the dominant weakening mechanism, although grain size reduction associated with initial acceleration likely also plays a role. Initial results also suggest that width of the PSZ decreased with increasing slip velocity, slip distance, total power, and work and µd decreases with increasing work for SAFOD and Westerly gouge.",

            "abstract": "Aftershock forecasting models tend to fall into two classes – purely statistical approaches based on clustering, b-value, and the Omori-Utsu law; and Coulomb rate-state models which relate the forecast increase in rate to the magnitude of the Coulomb stress change. Recently, hybrid models combining physical and statistical forecasts have begun to be developed, for example by Bach and Hainzl (2012) and Steacy et al. (2013). The latter approach combined Coulomb stress patterns with the STEP (short-term earthquake probability) model by redistributing expected rate from areas with decreased stress to regions where the stress had increased. The chosen ‘Coulomb Redistribution Parameter’ (CRP) was 0.93, based on California earthquakes, which meant that 93% of the total rate was expected to occur where the stress had increased. The model was tested against the Canterbury sequence and the main result was that the new model performed at least as well as, and often better than, STEP when tested against retrospective data but that STEP was generally better in pseudo-prospective tests that involved data actually available within the first 10 days of each event of interest. The authors suggested that the major reason for this discrepancy was uncertainty in the slip models and, particularly, in the geometries of the faults involved in each complex major event. Here we develop a variant of the STEP/Coulomb model in which the CRP varies based on the percentage of aftershocks that occur in the positively stressed areas during the forecast learning period. We find that this variant significantly outperforms both STEP and the previous hybrid model in almost all cases, even when the input Coulomb model is quite poor. Our results suggest that this approach might be more useful than Coulomb rate-state when the underlying slip model is not well constrained due to the dependence of that method on the magnitude of the Coulomb stress change.",

            "abstract": "Long-term averages of the isotopic composition of precipitation from 15 sites in Israel and reanalyzed vapor data from the Mediterranean are used to assess the full modern hydrological cycle of sea surface water–vapor–distillation–precipitation–evaporation in the E. Mediterranean and the Levant. The results show that once the source effect is accounted for, the long-term isotopic composition of precipitation in Israel is governed primarily by distillation and to a lesser degree by temperature. These processes govern the amount, altitude and the distance from the ocean effects.\nBased on our understanding of the modern processes, we modeled the distillation as a function of relative humidity during the LGM using δ18O stalagmites and Mediterranean foraminifera. The model defines three scenarios of LGM precipitation: a) distillation and relative humidity were higher then today; b) both were similar to today; c) both were lower then today. Based on the Lisan high we assume an increase in precipitation occurred over Israel, strengthening options a and b, thus promoting the following scenarios: 1) an increase occurred in the amount of precipitation of each event which would demand Mediterranean relative humidity values of ~85% (as apposed to 65% today) and a d-excess of 100/00 (as apposed to 230/00 today), or 2) an increase occured in the frequency of rain events, which would require a rain event every 1.5 days during the rainy months (as apposed to an event every 3.3 days at present), in this case, the relative humidity and d-excess would be similar to present day. By emphasizing the importance of the distillation effect and possible changes in relative humidity over the Mediterranean, our model reconciles the conundrum of the Lake Lisan high-stand during the LGM and the similar offset between the δ18O values from Soreq Cave stalagmites and Mediterranean foraminifera in modern and LGM times.",

            "abstract": "The formation of the broadband aurora (such as seen at substorm onset) is well correlated with Poynting flux associated with dispersive scale Alfven waves that may be generated as a result of reconnection- or instability-driven processes in the plasma sheet. Ion temperature effects are important in this context as the ion gyroradius is a fundamental scale-length for the transfer of global scale substorm energy to particle energization and since these effects modify the phase speed of the wave (which affects both substorm onset timing and electron acceleration). We present simulations of dispersive scale Alfven wave pulses using a new gyrofluid ion-kinetic electron model in curvilinear coordinates. We find that consideration of a realistic ion to electron temperature ratio significantly reduces the propagation time of the wave from the plasma sheet to the ionosphere (relative to the case that neglects ion temperature effects) and leads to an increased dispersion of wave energy perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. Ion temperature effects also reduce the parallel current and parallel electric field within the wave and we elucidate the affects of this reduced coupling on the structure and evolution of the energized electron distribution functions for a range of plasma sheet wave parameters.",

            "abstract": "Warming ocean waters around Greenland have been implicated, along with warmer air temperatures, in the rapid increase of melt of the tidewater glaciers that drain the ice sheet. Most available regional oceanographic measurements have been collected during the summer seasons and are concentrated near the largest and most accessible glaciers. In order to gain a more comprehensive picture of the changing environment around the entirety of Greenland, more fjords, especially in the north, must be sampled. In July 2014, we travelled to Kullorsuaq in Northwest Greenland in order to foster a partnership with the local community to obtain new hydrographic data from CTD casts near Alison Glacier (74.6N, 57W). The terminus of this glacier abruptly retreated 10 km between 2000 and 2006. Although adequate observations from that time period are unavailable, our recently collected temperature and salinity data suggests that the deep water near Alison is similar to the waters further south, where near-synchronous ocean warming and glacial acceleration has been documented.\nOver the course of two sampling days, a hand-operated winch from a small boat was used to make standard CTD casts in front of Alison Glacier. We find evidence of glacial and mélange melt and the signature of both Polar and Atlantic Water masses at depth. Along-fjord casts illustrate how the ocean waters are modified as they circulate in and out of the fjord and the interaction of this water with the melting glacial front. At 500m depths, ocean temperatures are about 3°C above the in-situ freezing point of seawater, suggesting a possible influence of warm ocean waters on the mass loss of Alison Glacier. Using NASA Operation IceBridge and satellite altimetry data, we relate our new hydrographic data to the observed recent changes in Alison Glacier. An additional important result is that this short field campaign uncovered the possibility of working with local Greenlandic communities to aid scientists in both environmental monitoring and scientific discovery. Plans are underway to collaborate with the same and other communities in Greenland to take additional oceanographic measurements throughout the year.",

            "abstract": "Japanese national institutes and MH21 consortium are developing the advanced technology of mining submarine methane hydrates by reducing pressure of hydrates to induce dissociation and gasification of hydrates. However, assessment and prediction technology of dissociation is still under development through intensive study. On the other hands, authors have pointed out the possibility of large-scale submarine landslides by the sliding surface liquefaction of the hydrate-bearing-layers. Author has tested dry-ice and silica-sands mixture specimen as a methane hydrate substitutes in a series of partially-drained high speed / stress-controlled ring shear tests. Their results strongly suggest the possibility of sliding surface liquefaction under strong seismic condition, while the possibility of extensive dissociation especially under mining by reducing pressure is not clear. Author modified the ring shear apparatus DPRI-7 of Kyoto University so that it can cool down the specimen and measure the specimen temperature during shearing. Silica sands #7 submerged in TBAB (Tetra-butyl-ammonium bromide) solution was used for the specimen. This TBAB solution was frozen at around room temperature of 8 – 12 degrees Celsius under 1 atmospheric pressure. A series of constant speed shearing test was conducted to examine the rate-effect. Frictional characteristics was achieved under 0.1 – 10 cm/s of shear speed which was changed in stepping-up and down. The results show rather the temperature effect was obvious than the speed. At the first shearing of the specimen immediately after frozen, extreme high peak stress was obtained. Then the residual shear strength showed medium peak at temperature of about 4 degrees, then gradually decreased up to about 10 degrees. The medium peak of shear strength may come from the generation of angular grains due to crushing the specimen during initial shearing. The decreasing thereafter may have resulted from further crushing, rounding of the hydrates and possible dissociation of the hydrates due to heating in the shear zone. Temperature was continuously rising although the tests and finally all the hydrates were melted. Unfortunately, no excess pore pressure generation was observed possibly because of low saturation degree of the sample and apparatus.",

Within the Bhutan Himalaya, an intra-GHZ structure, the Kakhtang thrust (KT) is proposed to separate the GHZ into structurally upper and lower levels, and is interpreted to extend across much of the eastern Himalaya. In this investigation, peak P–T conditions were determined for rocks from two transects through both levels of the GHZ in north-central and northeastern Bhutan, in order to evaluate the significance of the KT, and to better understand the emplacement mechanism of GHZ rocks. The composition of the phases Grt + Pl + Bt ± Ms ± St ± Amp ± Kfs from twelve metapelite and orthogneiss samples were analyzed using the electron microprobe at UC-Santa Barbara. Peak P–T estimates, determined via THERMOCALC and supplemented by Ti-in-biotite thermometry, show similar T- but differing P versus structural distance trends across each transect. A gradual decrease in temperatures structurally upsection (~750 ºC to 600 ºC) was observed on both transects, and in northeast Bhutan, a steep decreasing pressure trend (0.40 ± 0.08 kbar/km) is documented. In comparison, in north-central Bhutan, a super-lithostatic pressure gradient (0.74 ± 0.16 kbar/km) is observed across >5.5 km of structural thickness, and is interpreted to represent >60 % layer-normal flattening strain, similar in magnitude to flattening documented in GHZ rocks in south-central Bhutan. The documented gradients show no significant change in P–T conditions crossing the KT, and therefore argue that the KT is likely not a first-order intra-GHZ shear zone. Furthermore, the super-lithostatic pressure trends favor large-scale, post-peak metamorphic flattening of the GHZ during emplacement.",

            "abstract": "The ubiquity of cratering events in the solar system motivates understanding how the magnetizations of planetary surfaces are affected by hypervelocity impacts. Passing shock waves may impart target rocks with shock remanent magnetization (SRM) which can, in principle, be preserved if a region does not experience substantial impact-related heating. While SRM has been proposed as an explanation for enigmatic magnetizations observed at impact craters and in extraterrestrial samples, SRM has not yet been conclusively identified in natural samples. At present, the most suggestive evidence for naturally occurring SRM exists at the ~450 Ma Slate Islands Impact Structure, Canada. The islands represent the ~10 km diameter central uplift of a ~30 km diameter complex crater. Target rocks, which consist of Archean and Paleoproterozoic dikes and metamorphic rocks as well as ~1.1 Ga dikes and lava flows, contain a pervasive impact-related secondary magnetization component which is not present in coeval rocks of corresponding lithologies outside the impact crater (Halls 1975, 1979).\nOur paleomagnetic study aims to determine whether the Slate Islands overprint is an SRM. Samples were collected from 18 igneous dikes and 17 lava flows across the impact structure from regions which experienced variable (2-25 GPa) shock pressures (Dressler et al., 1998). Alternating field (AF) and thermal demagnetization results indicate that the secondary component persists to AF levels reaching several tens of mT and unblocking temperatures approaching ~250-525°C. At all studied sites, grains at higher AF levels and unblocking temperatures retain pre-impact magnetizations. Secondary magnetization blocked within the lower coercivity and blocking temperature fractions of samples is consistent with an origin as either SRM or thermoviscous remanence (TVRM) resulting from impact-related heating. Viscous remanence acquired at Earth surface temperatures is precluded by the component’s high unblocking temperature and distinct direction from the present local field. Comparison of natural remanent magnetization with laboratory-induced pressure and thermal remanences paired with thermochronometric and geologic constraints is being used to differentiate between the overprints originating as SRM or TVRM.",

Failure to meet the basic needs of human well-being is not an ethically viable option and strategies for doubling agricultural production and providing energy and goods for a growing population exist. However, the question is, at what cost to environmental quality? We developed an integrated modeling approach to test strategies for meeting multiple objectives within the limits of the earth system. We use scenarios to explore a range of assumptions on socio-economic factors like population growth, per capita income and technological change; food systems factors like food waste, production intensification and expansion, and meat demand; and technological developments in energy efficiency and wastewater treatment. We use these scenario to test the conditions in which we can fit the simultaneous goals of sustainable development.",

            "abstract": "The mineralization of terrigenous dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) discharged by rivers can impact nutrient and trace metal cycling, biological productivity, net ecosystem metabolism, and air-sea CO2 exchange in ocean margins. The extreme heterogeneity of river-influenced ocean margins represents a major challenge for quantitative assessments of tDOC transformations and thereby obscures the role of tDOC in biogeochemical cycles. Here, we demonstrate how a lignin-based optical proxy for tDOC and a shelf-wide mass balance approach can be used to quantitatively assess the fate of tDOC discharged on a river-influenced ocean margin. Such a mass balance was carried out in the northern Gulf of Mexico and revealed that ~40% of the tDOC discharged by Mississippi-Atchafalaya River System between March 2009 and March 2010 was mineralized to CO2 on the Louisiana shelf, with two thirds of the mineralization taking place in the mixed layer. A strong seasonality in tDOC mineralization was observed, with mineralization rates severalfold higher during summer than during winter. Independent assessments of specific mineralization processes indicated biomineralization accounted for ~94% of the tDOC mineralization on an annual basis, and suggested that photochemical transformations of tDOC enhanced biomineralization by ~50% in the mixed layer. Direct photomineralization accounted for a relatively small fraction (~6%) of the tDOC mineralization on an annual basis. This quantitative assessment provides direct evidence confirming ocean margins are major sinks of the tDOC discharged by rivers, and indicates that tDOC mineralization rates in the shelf mixed layer are sufficiently large to influence whether the Louisiana shelf is a net sink or source of atmospheric CO2. In this presentation, we also demonstrate how the remote sensing of ocean color can be used to trace tDOC and its cross-shelf export and further advance our understanding of the fate of tDOC in ocean margins.",

            "abstract": "Measuring spatial patterns and rates of erosion in alpine landscapes is challenging because locations are steep and remote, and hillslope processes including rockfalls, avalanches and landslides are stochastic. This study evaluates how variability between quantitative erosion rates and surface ages and qualitative weathering features on talus deposits may influence interpretations of the spatial distribution of hillslope erosion in the Teton Range. I use cosmogenic nuclide concentrations to estimate erosion rates and surface ages of bedrock and talus deposits. I then compare these cosmogenic nuclide results to talus volumetric estimates of erosion rates. I also compare the quantitative estimates of surface ages and erosion to qualitative weathering observations on talus cobbles. The resulting erosion rates from cosmogenic nuclides are slower than rates estimated from talus volumes, however, both methods produced the same pattern of erosion. The fastest and slowest cosmogenic nuclide and volumetric erosion rates were associated with the same fans. Exposure ages of talus surfaces decrease as elevation of the fans increase. Qualitative observations of weathering on cobble surfaces were not reliable to predict the relative rates of erosion on the talus fans. Using amalgamated samples from hillslope deposits adjacent to steep sided canyons for cosmogenic nuclide analysis has high uncertainty when finding accurate erosion rates or exposure ages due to complicated shielding on steeply sloping walls. The similar patterns of rapid or slow erosion rates, however, suggest that cosmogenic nuclides or volume estimates are both reasonable methods to understand relative timing of hillslope events, even if the absolute age or erosion rate cannot be determined.",

            "abstract": "Glacierized regions are one of the most dynamic land surface environments on the planet (Evans and Delaney, In Press). They are susceptible to various types of natural hazards such as landslides, glacier avalanches, and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF). GLOF events are increasingly common and present catastrophic flood hazards, the causes of which are sensitive to climate change in complex high mountain topography (IPCC, 2013). Inundation and debris flows from GLOF events have repeatedly caused significant infrastructure damages and loss of human lives in the high mountain regions of the world (Huggel et al, 2002).\nThe research is designed to develop methods for the consistent detection of glacier lakes formation during the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) era (1982 – present), to quantify the frequency of glacier lake development and estimate lake volume using Landsat imagery and digital elevation model (DEM) data.\nLandsat TM scenes are used to identify glacier lakes in the Shimshal and Shaksgam valley, particularly the development of Lake Virjeab in year 2000 and Kyagar Lake in 1998. A simple thresholding technique using Landsat TM infrared bands, along with object-based segmentation approaches are used to isolate lake extent. Lake volume is extracted by intersecting the lake extent with the DEM surface. Based on previous studies and DEM characterization in the region, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM is preferred over Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) GDEM due to higher accuracy. Calculated errors in SRTM height estimates are 5.81 m compared with 8.34 m for ASTER. SRTM data are preferred because the DEM measurements were made over short duration making the DEM internally consistent. Lake volume derived from the Landsat TM imagery and DEM are incorporated into a simple GLOF model identified by Clague and Matthews (1973) to estimate the potential peak discharge (Qmax) of a GLOF event. We compare the simple Qmax estimates with those from a more complex model of lake outflow time-varying discharge using the approach developed by Ng et al. (2007).",

            "abstract": "The Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) hosts some of the largest glaciers and ice caps (GIC) outside Greenland and Antarctica and contains one-third of the global volume of land ice outside the ice sheets. Recent observations from satellite and airborne data indicate a large mass loss in that region. Here, we use time series of time-variable gravity from the NASA/DLR GRACE mission using a mascon approach to update the ice mass balance of this region till present. We find a mass loss of 73 Gt/year for April 2003 - December 2013. The mass loss per unit area is disproportionally large compared to that of the entire Greenland Ice Sheet. At the basin scale, we examine laser altimetry records from NASA’s ICESat-1 (2003-2009) and Operation IceBridge’s Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) to delineate areas of thinning and compare the results with surface mass balance (SMB) output products from the Regional Atmospheric and Climate Model (RACMO). We detect the signature of enhanced thinning along some of the CAA fast moving glaciers. Finally, we assemble a reference map of ice velocity from satellite radar interferometry, which we combine with existing ice thickness data to assess the mass flux and state of mass balance of the largest, fast-moving glaciers. Ice velocity from different years (1996 – 2006 - 2013) is used to construct time series of mass loss from the mass budget method. Combining these different sets of information, we address the issue of the partitioning of the mass loss between changes in SMB (essentially melt) and changes in ice dynamics (acceleration of glacier flow) to provide insights about the cause of the CAA change in mass balance in the last decades.",

            "abstract": "Substantial environmental changes are occurring over the Antarctic Peninsula (AP), including rapid climate warming, ice shelf collapse, and accelerated glacier thinning and flow. These changes have major implications for the regional ice sheet mass balance and for global sea level rise. Geodetic estimates of the AP Ice Sheet (APIS) mass balance indicate that it lost mass at an average rate of 20 ± 14 Gt/yr over the period 1992-2011 (Shepherd et al., 2012); this equates to approximately 25% of all Antarctic ice sheet mass losses, despite occupying only 4% of the continental area.\nPast estimates of mass change have either been at a low resolution (gravimetry) or have had sparse spatial sampling (the mass budget method and altimetry). As a consequence, regional patterns of mass change are not well captured which makes understanding the causes difficult. Through the combination of ERS-2, EnviSat, ICESat, ATM and CryoSat-2 altimetry datasets we have succeeded in generating a mass change time series for the APIS with sufficient resolution and spatial sampling to capture regional signals. Here we will present our methods for the optimisation, combination and interpolation of the elevation change measurements, and their conversion to mass change. Furthermore, the observed spatial and temporal trends in APIS mass balance will be examined and the possible causes explored.",

            "abstract": "Probabilistically formulated inverse problems can be seen as an application of data integration. Two types of information are (almost) always available: 1) geophysical data, and 2) information about geology and geologically plausible structures. The inverse problem consists of integrating the information available from geophysical data and geological information. In recent years inversion algorithms have emerged that allow integration of such different information. However such methods only provides useful results if the geological and geophysical information provided are consistent. Using weakly informed prior models and/or sparse uncertain geophysical data typically no problems with consistency arise. However, as data coverage and quality increase and still more complex and detailed prior information can be quantified (using e.g multiple point based statistics) then the risk of problems with consistency increases. Inconsistency between two independent sources of information about the same subsurface model, means that either one or both sources of information must be wrong.We will demonstrate that using cross hole GPR tomographic data, that such consistency problems exist, and that they can dramatically affect inversion results. The problem is two folded: 1) One will typically underestimate the error associated with geophysical data, and 2) Multiple-point based prior models often provide such detailed a priori information that it will not be possible to find a priori acceptable models that lead to a data fit within measurement uncertainties. We demonstrate that if inversion is forced on inconsistent information, then the solution to the inverse problem may be earth models that neither fit the data within their uncertainty, nor represent realistic geologically features. In the worst case such models will show artefacts that appear well resolved, and that can have severe effect on subsequent flow modeling. We will demonstrate how such inconsistencies can be identified during inversion. Finally, we will demonstrate that reducing the certainty of the two types of information (to a realistic level), can lead to a consistent data integration problem with a trustworthy solution.",

            "abstract": "The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission and operations are designed to provide maximum reconnection science. Mission phases and the tetrahedral spacecraft formations are chosen to investigate reconnection at the dayside magnetopause and in the magnetotail. At the dayside, the orbits maximize encounters with the magnetopause in regions where the probability of encountering the reconnection diffusion region is high. In the magnetotail, the orbits maximize encounters with the neutral sheet, where reconnection is known to occur episodically. The mission will collect several gigabits per day of particles and field data. Management of these data requires effective selection, transmission, analysis, and storage of data in the ground segment of the mission. Following MMS launch, the Science Operations Center (SOC), located at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) in Boulder, Colorado, will be actively responsible for instrument suite operations, as well as data production, management, distribution, and archiving of the MMS science data sets. Throughout, the MMS instrument teams work closely with the SOC in conducting instrument operations. The teams will be responsible for much of the science data production activities, with the SOC serving as the Mission Archive and the central node from which data are made available to the science community. The SOC will also handle raw instrument and spacecraft telemetry, calibration data, ephemerides, attitude and other ancillary data needed to support scientific use. Documentation and metadata describing data products, algorithms, instrument calibrations, validation, and data quality will be provided by MMS instrument teams and made available to the user community. A key component of ultimate MMS mission success will be the exploitation of high-resolution burst data products through an innovative burst system and the “Scientist-in-the-Loop” (SITL) concept for key interval identification, downlink, and analysis.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater is increasingly relied on as a critical resource for meeting irrigation water demands. This study quantifies trends in groundwater levels across the US, and determines correlations with irrigation water extraction and climate patterns. We focus on high productivity agricultural regions including the High Plains and the lower Mississippi. Our analysis of all USGS groundwater level records for wells deeper than 30 m indicates that groundwater levels declined across much of these areas between 1949 and 2009. We illustrate some of the dominant patterns in groundwater decline, and explore potential correlations between resource use and availability. We observe correlations between pumping rate and groundwater level in a majority of counties with significant irrigation, with some notable exceptions. To determine how climate corresponded to groundwater levels we performed a simple regression analysis in addition to using wavelet coherence for both annual precipitation and longer-term climate phenomena against groundwater level observations. Due to the focus on deep production wells, we found minimal correlation between groundwater and inter-annual precipitation patterns, though on average the wells correlated with the longer period climate patterns, and specifically with the PDO.

This most recent solution is estimated directly from the reduction of the GRACE L1B RL2 data with an optimized set of arc parameters and the full noise covariance. The mascons are estimated monthly with 1-arc-degree equal-area sampling where anisotropic spatial constraints are applied to maximize the recovery of signal while minimizing noise and signal leakage across the geographic constraint region boundaries. Analysis of the solution signals and errors is presented at global and regional scales and comparisons to the GRACE project solutions and independent models are presented. Time series of cryospheric and hydrologic regions are analyzed with the complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) with adaptive noise algorithm, which adaptively sifts the signal into intrinsic frequency-ordered modes. Lastly, the impact of different solution components is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Orogen building processes are typically associated with crustal thickening and an excess in Gravitational Potential Energy controlled by convergent forces and material resistance. The reduction of gravitational potential commonly occurs via erosion or internal material transfers. Among the latter, the inverse ductile thinning mechanism considered in this work refers to the lower crustal flow induced by lateral pressure gradients in association with extreme ductility of the lower crust. This mechanism has been proposed on the basis of geological evidence in the Vepor Dome, West Carpathians (Jeřábek et al., 2012) and the concept is further developed by means of numerical simulations.\nThe characteristic feature of the lower crustal flow in the Vepor Dome is that it occurs during nappe stacking and overall crustal thickening in the Cretaceous Central West Carpathians orogenic wedge. The along-strike lower crustal flow in the internal part of the wedge induced by thickening and associated lateral pressure gradients is accompanied by synkinematic prograde Barrovian type metamorphism. The high proportion of weak metapelites in the lower crust is suspected to promote nearly instantaneous response to the overburden. To understand dynamics of the proposed mechanism, we designed a two dimensional numerical model characterized by felsic crust with low viscosity layer overlaying elastic mantle lithosphere. In our model, we simulated PT trajectories of individual crustal levels for different rates of tectonic loading and variable initial thermal state. The results of numerical modeling were compared with PT trajectories obtained by thermodynamic modelling and geochronological data from the Vepor Dome. Our numerical simulations imply that the inverse ductile thinning is indeed conditioned by the presence of extremely weak lower crustal layer, however the simulated PT paths were only comparable to our metamorphic data if the constant loading lasted at least 30 m.y.\n",

            "abstract": "Geophysical mass flow models are numerical models that approximate pyroclastic flow events and can be used to assess the volcanic hazards certain areas may face. One such model, TITAN2D, approximates granular-flow physics based on a depth-averaged analytical model using inputs of basal and internal friction, material volume at a coordinate point, and a GIS in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM). The volume of modeled material propagates over the DEM in a way that is governed by the slope and curvature of the DEM surface and the basal and internal friction angles. Results from TITAN2D are highly dependent upon the inputs to the model. Here we focus on a single input: the DEM, which can vary in resolution. High resolution DEMs are advantageous in that they contain more surface details than lower-resolution models, presumably allowing modeled flows to propagate in a way more true to the real surface. However, very high resolution DEMs can create undesirable artifacts in the slope and curvature that corrupt flow calculations. With high-resolution DEMs becoming more widely available and preferable for use, determining the point at which high resolution data is less advantageous compared to lower resolution data becomes important. We find that in cases of high resolution, integer-valued DEMs, very high-resolution is detrimental to good model outputs when moderate-to-low (<10-15°) slope angles are involved. At these slope angles, multiple adjacent DEM cell elevation values are equal due to the need for the DEM to approximate the low slope with a limited set of integer values for elevation. The first derivative of the elevation surface thus becomes zero. In these cases, flow propagation is inhibited by these spurious zero-slope conditions. Here we present evidence for this “terracing effect” from 1) a mathematically defined simulated elevation model, to demonstrate the terracing effects of integer valued data, and 2) a real-world DEM where terracing must be addressed. We discuss the effect on the flow model output and present possible solutions for rectification of the problem.",

            "abstract": "Efforts to reduce the magnitude of climate change due to GHG emissions has focused attention on how different sectors contribute to GHG emitting energy use. California has been a leader in climate change mitigation policy across the nation with its passage of the Global Warming Act of 2006, with a major focus on the energy sector. Directly linked to climate change, the Energy-Travel-Urban Land Use Nexus in California is well recognized and the density/compactness of land use is subject of 2008 state policy (Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act, SB 375). The Water-Energy Nexus is also well-recognized, given that about 19% of electricity use in State is water-related, and water scarcity in the State has led to increasing policy guidelines, e.g., the 2009 water conservation plan, with a target of reducing urban water use by 20% by 2020. Since 40-50% of urban water in California is consumed by outdoor water use, the character of urban land use, its compactness and density, have important effects on water use and resulting energy impacts. However, direct policy attention to the water-urban land use nexus has focused primarily on water-conserving outdoor watering devices, and landscapes. Direct policy on the character of development itself has yet to emerge, and adequate recognition of the interrelationships among energy, water use and the character of urban development has yet to occur. This paper reviews the research and policies on the water-urban land use link, as well as on the larger triadic relation. It identifies research questions, and policy issues that this neglected link poses to California and the nation.",

            "abstract": "The Vietnam Low-Carbon Rice Project (VLCRP) seeks to significantly reduce GHG emissions from rice cultivation, an activity responsible for more than 30% of Vietnam’s overall GHG emissions, while improving livelihoods for the rice farmer community by decreasing costs and enhancing yield as well as providing supplemental farmer income through the sale of carbon credits.\nThe Mekong Delta makes up 12% of Vietnam’s land area, but produces more than 50% of the country’s rice, including more than 90% of the rice for export. Rice cultivation is the main source of income for 80% of farmers in the Mekong Delta. VLCRP was launched in late 2012 in the Mekong Delta in two major rice production provinces, Kien Giang and An Giang. To date, VLCRP has completed 11 crop seasons (in Kien Giang and An Giang combined), training over 400 farmer households in applying VLCRP’s package of practices (known as 1 Must - 6 Reductions) and building technical capacity to its key stakeholders and rice farmer community leaders.\nBy adopting the 1 Must- 6 Reductions practices (including reduced seeding density, reduced fertilizer and pesticide application, and alternative wetting and drying water management), rice farmers reduce their input costs while maintaining or improving yields, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The VLCRP package of practices also deliver other environmental and social co-benefits, such as reduced water pollution, improved habitat for fishery resources and reduced health risks for farmers through the reduction of agri-chemicals.\nVLCRP farmers use significantly less inputs (50% reduction in seed, 30% reduction in fertilizer, 40-50% reduction in water) while improving yields 5-10%, leading to an increase in profit from 10% to as high as 60% per hectare. Preliminary results indicate that the 1 Must- 6 Reductions practices have led to approximately 40-65% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to 4 tons of CO2e/ha/yr in An Giang and 35 tons of CO2e/ha/yr in KienGiang. The greenhouse gas reductions in Kien Giang are the highest reductions we have been able to find in the literature. Both methane and nitrous oxide emissions were measured using chambers, on a weekly basis for methane and for 5 or more days for nitrous oxide following critical events, such as fertilizer application or soil dry down periods.",

Field assessment is essential to evaluate the vapor intrusion pathways, which has been recognized to be challenging due to the heterogeneity of sites and uncontrolled site environments. Modeling of vapor intrusion processes can predict subsurface vapor and oxygen concentrations and indoor air concentration under various environmental site conditions. However, detailed experimental quantification for model validation is typically unavailable. In this work, we report our efforts to quantifying vapor intrusion pathways into a slab-on-ground building by integrating mathematical modeling with well-controlled field measurements under three different pressure and ventilation site conditions. Comparisons between modeling and field measurements include indoor air concentration, contaminant and oxygen distribution profile beneath and inside the building, diffusive and advective flux under different pressure and air vitalization conditions. In addition to typically identified key factors influencing vapor intrusion (e.g. the building construction, the properties of compounds, and depth to the source), we found several additional parameters, such as anisotropic property of surface soil, locations of crack, and dependency of reaction rates on oxygen concentration, are critical to evaluate vapor intrusion pathways.",

            "abstract": "The monitoring and characterization of global crop development by remote sensing is a complex task, in part, because of the time varying nature of the target and the diversity of crop types and agricultural practices that vary worldwide. While some of these difficulties are overcome with the availability of national and market-derived resources (e.g. publication of crop statistics by the USDA and FAO), monitoring by remote sensing has the ability of augmenting those resources to better identify changes over time, and to provide timely assessments for the current year’s production.\nOf the remote sensing techniques that are used for agricultural applications, optical observations of NDVI from Landsat, AVHRR, MODIS and similar sensors have historically provided the majority of data that is used by the community. In addition, radiometer and radar sensors, are often used for estimating soil moisture and structural information for these agricultural regions. The combination of these remote sensing datasets and national resources constitutes the state of the art for crop monitoring and yield forecasts.\nTo help improve these crop monitoring efforts in the future, the joint NASA-ISRO SAR mission known as NI-SAR is being planned for launch in 2020, and will have L- and S-band fully polarimetric radar systems, a fourteen day repeat period, and a swath width on the order of several hundred kilometers. To address the needs of the science and applications communities that NI-SAR will support, the systems observing strategy is currently being planned such that data rate and the system configuration will address the needs of the community. In this presentation, a description of the NI-SAR system will be given along with the currently planned observing strategy and derived products that will be relevant to the overall GEOGLAM initiative.",

            "abstract": "The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the United States Forest Service reports official estimates of national forest floor carbon (FFC) stocks and stock change to national and international parties, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), respectively. These estimates of national FFC stocks are derived from plot-level predictions of FFC density. We suspect the models used to predict plot-level FFC density are less than ideal for several reasons: (a) they are based upon local studies that may not reflect FFC dynamics at the national scale, (b) they are relatively insensitive to climate change, and (c) they reduce the natural variability of the data leading to misplaced confidence in the estimates. However, FIA has measured forest floor attributes since 2001 on a systematic 1/16th subset of a nation-wide array of inventory plots (7 800 of 125 000 plots). Here we address the efficacy of replacing plot-level model predictions with empirical observations of FFC density while assessing the impact of imputing FFC density values to the full plot network on national stock estimates. First, using an equivalence testing framework, we found model predictions of FFC density to differ significantly from the observations in all regions and forest types; the mean difference across all plots was 21 percent (1.81 Mg·ha-1). Furthermore, the model predictions were biased towards the lower end of extant FFC density observations, underestimating it while greatly truncating the range relative to the observations. Second, the optimal imputation approach (k-Nearest Neighbor, k-NN) resulted in values that were equivalent to observations of FFC density across a range of simulated missingness and maintained the high variability seen in the observations. We used the k-NN approach to impute FFC density values to the 94 percent of FIA inventory plots without soil measurements. Third, using the imputed values of FFC density our preliminary estimate of FFC stocks in the US is 6 333 Tg (±106 Tg). This estimate is 29.9 percent larger (1 457 Tg) than current model-based estimates. Our research yields more representative estimates of both plot-level FFC densities and national FFC stocks that will be submitted to the USEPA and UNFCCC as part of the 2015 estimates.",

            "abstract": "Many migmatite domes are emplaced within wrench corridors in which a combination of strike-slip and extensional detachment zones (pull-apart, extensional relay, or transfer zones) focus deep-crust exhumation. The Montagne Noire dome (France, Variscan Massif Central) exemplifies wrench-related dome formation and displays the following structural, metamorphic, and geochronologic characteristics of a ‘transdome’: the dome is elongate in the direction of extension; foliation outlines a double dome separated by a high-strain zone; lineation is shallowly plunging with a fairly uniform trend that parallels the strike of the high-strain zone; subdomes contain recumbent structures overprinted by upright folds that affected upward by flat shear zones associated with detachment tectonics; domes display a large syn-deformation metamorphic gradient from core (upper amphibolite facies migmatite) to margin (down to greenschist facies mylonite); some rocks in the dome core experienced isothermal decompression revealed by disequilibrium reaction textures, particularly in mafic rocks (including eclogite); and results of U-Pb geochrononology indicate a narrow range of metamorphic crystallization from core to mantling schist spanning ~10 Myr.\n3D numerical modeling of transdomes show that the dome solicits a larger source region of partially molten lower crust compared to 2D models; this flowing crust creates a double-dome architecture as in 2D models but there are differences in the predicted thermal history and flow paths. In a transtension setting, flow lines converge at depth (radial-centripetal flow) toward the zone of extension and diverge at shallow levels in a more uniform direction that is imposed by upper crust motion and deformation. This evolution produces a characteristic pattern of strain history, progressive fabric overprint, and P-T paths that are comparable to observed dome rocks.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a high-throughput imaging spectrograph that uses an echelle grating operating at a high dispersion order to observe extended sources such as atmospheric airglow and auroral emissions at high spectral resolution. Instead of the conventional single slit this instrument uses four with appropriate foreoptics to image a long, narrow field of view of approximately 0.1 × 50 deg. By using interference filters for order sorting, this instrument can simultaneously observe multiple spectral features located anywhere in the visible band (approximately 300 to 1000 nm) at high resolution. The current implementation images the scene at 6 wavelengths (427.8, 486.1, 557.7, 630.0, 656.3 and 777.4 nm), but the flexibility of the design of the instrument allows varying the wavelengths of interest with minimal modifications. We have constructed two spectrographs to be located at different geomagnetic locations. This will enable tomography of atmospheric phenomena for full 3-D rendering of the volume emission. We will combine HiT&MIS data with data from LITES, GROUP-C (on ISS) and other ground based sources such as GIRO, HiTIES, HIRISE and CHIMES along with the 13 all-sky imagers operated by Boston University to form a more complete picture of the ionosphere.\nThis work is supported by the NSF grant AGS1315354",

            "abstract": "There is no agreement over how atmospheric oxygen has varied over recent Earth history. Our knowledge of past O2 concentrations relies on biogeochemical modelling, constrained by geochemical data and proxies. There are however few direct indicators of oxygen concentrations, though the presence of fossil charcoal indicates that levels have not strayed outside the “fire window”, say below 16% or above 35%, during the last hundred million years. Different model predictions encompass both decreasing and increasing trends over this period however. These predictions are sensitive to weathering of continental rocks, which provide a sink for O2, but also a supply of phosphorus and sediment to the ocean, both of which increase carbon burial and thereby provide an oxygen source.\nHere we update our COPSE model with a more detailed treatment than hitherto, incorporating new input data, seafloor weathering processes, and different compositions and weatherability of granites and basalts. Our model suggests a broadly declining O2 trend over the late Mesozoic to present. An alternative forcing uses the phosphorus deposition curve of Follmi (1995), which is constructed from P measurements in ocean cores, and indicates P fluxes to the oceans that have varied over time by two orders of magnitude. Used to drive the model this also results in a declining long-term trend for atmospheric O2 over the last hundred million years, but with dramatic shorter-term variations superposed on the trend. These however stay (just) within the “fire window” for oxygen concentrations, and can be tentatively related to the evolution of fire adaptations in plants.",

We will also present several radiative transfer algorithms that may be employed to interpret the various data sets.

            "abstract": "In the assessment of models using observations, or the intercomparison between different observational datasets, it is necessary to examine the coherency in the spatial and temporal variability present in different datasets. Meanwhile, global datasets are always high dimensional, therefore efficient comparison is not an easy task. In this study, we apply several spectral decomposition techniques, namely Combined Principal Component Analysis (CPCA) and Combined Maximum Covariance Analysis (CMCA), as effective means to reduce data dimension and extract the dominant variability. More importantly, these methods find the common modes of variability in different datasets, therefore allowing parallel comparison and evaluation. These methods were applied to the AOD fields from fifteen CMIP5 models and three observational datasets: MODIS, MISR and AERONET. We focus on large-scale features including the spatial distribution, seasonality and long term trends. Results show that while models qualitatively agree with observations, significant regional differences still exist, especially in regions with mixed aerosol types such as the Sahel, North India and East Asia. Compared with observations, models in general lack interannual variability. Moreover, all models indicate consistent AOD trends with increases over East Asia and decreases over East US and Europe. However, the AOD trends over these regions are not very significant in the observations Instead, a significant increase in dust concentrations over the Arabian Peninsula and a significant decrease over the biomass burning regions of South America are found in MODIS and MISR. The aerosol composition for the regions with largest disagreement is also examined.\nFigure caption: The dominant mode of CMCA analysis using fifteen CMIP5 models and MODIS, MISR and AERONET.

            "abstract": "Two advanced four-dimensional ensemble data assimilation systems are applied for studying the genesis of Hurricane Karl (2010) using conventional observations and measurements collected during the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems in the Tropics (PREDICT) field campaign. Both methods combine strategies from four-dimensional variational (4DVar) and Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation techniques that have been developed for the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The first method, denoted E4DVar, operates in a manner similar to the traditional 4DVar data assimilation system, but with hybrid climate/ensemble background errors. The second method, denoted 4DEnVar, uses an ensemble of nonlinear model trajectories to replace the function of tangent linear and adjoint model operators in 4DVar, thus improving the parallelization of the data assimilation. Simulations initialized from E4DVar and 4DEnVar analyses provide track, genesis and intensity forecasts for Karl that are more accurate than an ensemble hybrid data assimilation method based on 3DVar (E3DVar). The two 4-D data assimilation methods are applied for studying Karl’s genesis, while comparing their theoretical advantages and disadvantages for an application where the system dynamics evolve quickly in time, and are constrained by an unusually high number of in situ observations.",

            "abstract": "Estimated values of recent oceanic heat uptake are of order of a few tenths of a watt/m2, and are a very small residual of air-sea exchanges with annual average regional magnitudes of hundreds of watts/m2. By using a dynamically consistent state estimate, the redistribution of heat within the ocean is calculated over a 20-year period. The results support an inference that the near-surface thermal properties of the ocean are a consequence, at least in part, of internal redistributions of heat, some of which must reflect water that has undergone long trajectories since last exposure to the atmosphere. The small residual heat exchange with the atmosphere today is unlikely to represent the interaction with an ocean that was in thermal equilibrium at the start of global warming. An analogy is drawn with carbon-14 \"reservoir ages\" which range over hundreds to a thousand years.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical component of the carbon cycle in freshwater systems and its elemental composition and molecular features determine its reactivity and thus its stability in the environment. DOM is particularly prominent in wetland ecosystems and can be exported through drainage into streams and ultimately the ocean. While DOM has been characterized through a great variety of analytical techniques, much focus has been placed on characterizations in oceanic environments and large river systems. In addition, multi-analytical approaches using advanced analytical techniques for the characterization of DOM in wetlands have been sparse. Here we present a comparative study of DOM from three, large, subtropical wetlands, the Everglades (USA), the Pantanal (Brazil) and the Okavango Delta (Botswana), applying a combination of optical properties (EEM-PARAFAC), high field NMR and FT-ICRMS. We basically confirm findings of other reports that many of the bulk molecular characteristics in freshwater DOM are shared by diverse aquatic ecosystems that can be very different in their environmental character. However, detailed analyses reveal significant variations in the molecular composition that can in most cases be controlled by site-specific ecological processes and watershed dynamics including fire regimes, external sources of sulphur, and hydrological drivers such as hydroperiod or degree of inundation. Differences and similarities between selected sites from the three abovementioned wetland systems will be presented in relation to their specific environmental characteristics.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of ground-based observations of near-surface air temperature (SAT) is extremely skewed toward low elevation areas. Land surface temperature (LST) remote sensing data products -- from thermal and infrared wavelength satellite imagery -- provide spatial coverage independent of elevation, although they only provide values for “clear sky” conditions, the prevalence of which may be influenced by elevation-dependent factors. It is thus imperative for researchers studying EDW to characterise the relationship between observations of “all-sky” SAT and “clear-sky” thermal/infrared (TIR) LST in order to overcome the extreme sparseness of SAT observations at high elevations.\nDrawing on local SAT observation data from both manned meteorological stations and AWS units covering an elevation range from 1500 to 4700m asl in the Upper Indus Basin, coupled with cloud climatologies from MODIS and global reanalyses, this study develops “clear-sky” and “all-sky” comparative, site-based climatologies of:\n[a] ground-observed SAT\n[b] reanalysis SAT and LST (skin surface temperature)\nRelationships between these climatologies and corresponding clear-sky/TIR satellite-retrieved LST are quantitatively assessed in the context of elevation-dependency and cloud cover prevalence. The implications of these relationships are discussed in the context of efforts to develop a multi-decadal TIR LST data product. While multi-decadal and even centennial trends are calculated from station-based observations of SAT, the relatively short record lengths of satellite-borne instruments used to produce currently available TIR LST data products better lend themselves to characterisation of interannual variability than trend calculation. Thus progress is detailed on EDW-driven efforts to validate such an LST product for the Himalayan region using historical imagery from the second and third generation of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/2, AVHRR/3) instrument flown on NOAA satellite platforms since the mid-1980s through present day. Progress and remaining challenges are quantified in terms of skill and bias of AVHRR LST with respect to MODIS LST as well the intrinsically coupled AVHRR cloud product with respect to its MODIS analogue.",

The first method uses importance sampling to generate new members (particles) with the appropriate unbiased mean and covariance. The second method is an adaptation of the Bootstrap particle filter; it processes observations serially, and combines resampled members with prior members using a tapering function, so that posterior members are close to the Bootstrap filter solution near observations, but approach the prior members away from observations. Because both non-Gaussian methods use tapering functions to limit the impact of an observation on distant state variables in the posterior error distribution, they may be computationally feasible for dynamical systems with large spatial dimensions, such as the atmosphere and oceans. The advantages and disadvantages of these two methods---relative to the EnKF---are explored using the Lorenze-96 model for a number of configurations and observation networks.",

            "abstract": "How did the first subduction zone form? Most present-day subduction initiation mechanisms require acting plate forces and/or preexisting zones of lithospheric weakness, which are themselves the consequence of plate tectonics (Stern 2004). In contrast, spontaneous plume-induced subduction initiation - suggested on the basis of numerical thermo-mechanical experiments (Ueda et al., 2008) and supported by data re-interpretation of how subduction started in Late Cretaceous time around the Caribbean LIP (Whattam and Stern, 2014) - does not require pre-existing lithospheric fabric, such as are created by active plate tectonics and is viable for both stagnant lid and mobile/deformable lid conditions. Here, we present first results of high-resolution 3D numerical thermo-mechanical modeling of plume-induced subduction resulting from mechanical-magmatic interaction of an ascending thermal mantle plume with old, cold, dense oceanic lithosphere. We demonstrate that weakening of the strong lithosphere by plume-induced magmatism is the key factor enabling subduction initiation around the plume head. A large plume head is required to overcome ring confinement, and subduction initiation is further favored when plume activity and lithospheric weakening continues for several tens of Ma. We further discuss possible implications of this scenario for modern plate tectonics as well as for plate tectonics initiation in Precambrian time.\n",

            "abstract": "The current CO2 emission trend entails a risk that the 2°C target will be missed, potentially causing “dangerous” changes in Earth’s climate system. This research explores the role of artificial atmospheric CO2 removal (also referred to as “negative emissions”) in stabilizing Earth’s climate after overshoot. We designed a range of plausible CO2 emission scenarios, which follow a gradual transition from a fossil fuel driven economy to a zero-emission energy system, followed by a period of negative emissions. The scenarios differ in peak emissions rate and, accordingly, the amount of negative emissions, to reach the same cumulative emissions compatible with the 2°C temperature stabilization target. The climate system components’ responses are computed using the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model of intermediate complexity.\nResults suggest that negative emissions are effective in reversing the global mean temperature and stabilizing it at a desired level (2°C above pre-industrial) after overshoot. Also, changes in the meridional overturning circulation and sea ice are reversible with the artificial removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. However, sea level continues to rise and is not reversible for several centuries, even under assumption of large amounts of negative emissions. For sea level to decline, atmospheric CO2 needs to be reduced to pre-industrial levels in our simulations.\nDuring the negative emission phase, outgassing of CO2 from terrestrial and marine carbon sinks offsets the artificial removal of atmospheric CO2, thereby reducing its effectiveness. On land, the largest CO2 outgassing occurs in the Tropics and is partially compensated by CO2 uptake at northern high latitudes. In the ocean, outgassing occurs mostly in the Southern Ocean, North Atlantic and tropical Pacific. The strongest outgassing occurs for pathways entailing greatest amounts of negative emissions, such that the efficiency of CO2 removal – here defined as the change in atmospheric CO2 per unit negative emission - decreases with increasing amounts of negative emissions.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is an important component of land surface processes. It plays a critical role in the earth system through affecting both energy and water balances at the surface and in the boundary layer. Because of the spatial and temporal discontinuities in soil moisture observations, model simulated soil moisture are widely used. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the performance of soil moisture simulations in fully coupled earth system models. This project will evaluate the accuracy of soil moisture simulations in 18 earth system models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) by using both in situ and satellite based observations over CONUS. In situ observed soil moisture (top_5 cm and total soil column) will be derived from the North American Soil Moisture Database. Satellite-derived soil moisture from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite will also be used to evaluate model performance. This project will assess the reliability of model-simulated soil moisture and identify systematic biases in the model simulations. Improvements in the accuracy of soil moisture simulation will enhance climate predictability.",

            "abstract": "Native-Fe grains form in basaltic melts at highly reducing conditions (<iron-wüstite), that are atypical for terrestrial magmas. Only three known terrestrial occurrences exist: 1) ~60 Ma basalts at Disko Island, Greenland; 2) ~20 Ma Bühl basalts, Germany, and 3) intrusions of the ~250 Ma Siberian Large Igneous Province (LIP). The reducing conditions recorded are the direct result of assimilation of carbonaceous crustal material during emplacement of the basaltic magmas at or near the surface. Native Fe-bearing basalts are useful natural analogues for studying PGE pre-concentration mechanisms, and the potential for PGE additions to magmas from crustal sources. Here, we present PGE LA-ICP-MS data for Fe-alloy, cohenite, and sulfide for a suite of Siberian and Disko Island native-Fe basalts, in combination with whole-rock PGE data for all known occurrences. The Siberian native-Fe alloys are characterized by highly variable PGE concentrations (1-30 ppm total PGEs), distinct low Os abundances, and PGE profiles similar to those of the nearby Noril’sk sulfide ores. In contrast, the Disko Island alloys are characterized by total PGE concentrations of 1-10 ppm and distinct positive Os and Re anomalies in extended PGE profiles. The Bühl basalts contain low PGE concentrations (~20 ppb). In order to understand contamination contributions, Os-isotopes analyses have been performed. Preliminary whole-rock 187Os/188Os data for high metal content samples from Siberia (0.33606 ± 37) and Disko (0.15402 ± 15) indicate high-time integrated Re/Os. The Re anomalies observed in extended PGE profiles of the Disko Island samples may reflect a potential crustal contribution to the overall PGE budget, through the addition of carbonaceous material. Whereas the Siberian samples contain abundant carbonaceous xenoliths, there is no apparent PGE contribution from crustal materials. Therefore, the role of crustal contamination is important in forming the native-Fe alloys, but the interaction of concomitant contamination, fractional crystallization, and native-Fe segregation varies according to location and style of crust-melt interactions within a LIP; e.g., lavas (Disko) versus intrusions (Siberia).",

            "abstract": "Specular reflections from Titan’s equatorial region have been detected using the Arecibo Observatory’s (AO) 13 cm wavelength radar system (Campbell et al., 2003, Science, 302, 431). Fitting the echo spectra to radar scattering models indicated that they originated from smooth surfaces with root-mean-square slopes of only a few degrees; on this basis they were interpreted as evidence for liquid surfaces. The Cassini Saturn Orbiter however has detected stable surface liquids only in the polar regions and not in the southern tropical regions covered by the AO tracks. High resolution Cassini imagery that overlaps with the AO tracks between the years 2000 and 2008 does not suggest the presence of hydrocarbon liquids and exhibits no apparent correlation with the 13 cm scattering (Black et al., 2011, Icarus, 212, 300). In this work in progress, we explore alternative explanations for the origin of these low latitude specular reflections and attempt to resolve this now decade old mystery. In particular, we use the accumulating Cassini RADAR altimetry coverage to compare the nadir backscatter at 2.2 cm to that at 13 cm. This nadir-to-nadir comparison allows us to constrain whether the southern tropical regions are also smooth and specular at smaller scales. We also plan to constrain whether these regions are representative of Titan in general or have unusually smooth surface by utilizing the complete Cassini altimetry dataset that includes observations dispersed around the globe. Distant Cassini RADAR scatterometry-mode observations suggest that Titan exhibits a greater nadir backscatter than expected from traditional quasi-specular plus diffuse backscattering models (L. Wye, 2011, Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University), hinting that unusually specular radar echoes may be the general behavior for Titan. Additionally, we employ the long baseline of Cassini observations over nearly half a Titan year, to constrain the possible temporal evolution in backscatter that was suggested by the AO echoes. We will also update the comparison of the Arecibo tracks with overlapping Cassini imagery, both by incorporating new coverage and through improvements in determining the regions of overlap.",

            "abstract": "GPS in Arizona reveals a change in the pattern of crustal strain accumulation in 2010 and based on viscoelastic modeling appears to be associated with the distant M7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah (EMC) earthquake in Baja California, Mexico. GPS data collected between 1999 and 2009 near the Santa Rita normal fault in SE Arizona reveal a narrow zone of crustal deformation coincident with the fault trace, delineated by W-NW facing Pleistocene fault scarps of heights 1 to 7 m. The apparent deformation zone is also seen in a preliminary InSAR interferogram. Total motion across the zone inferred using an elastic block model constrained by the pre-2010 GPS measurements is ~1 mm/yr in a sense consistent with normal fault motion. However, continuous GPS measurements throughout Arizona reveal pronounced changes in crustal velocity following the EMC earthquake, such that the relative motion across the Santa Rita fault post-2010 is negligible. Paleoseismic evidence indicates that mapped Santa Rita fault scarps were formed by two or more large magnitude (M6.7 to M7.6) surface rupturing normal-faulting earthquakes 60 to 100 kyrs ago. Seismic refraction and reflection data constrained by deep (~800 m) well log data provide evidence of progressive, possibly intermittent, displacement on the fault through time. The rate of strain accumulation observed geodetically prior to 2010, if constant over the past 60 to 100 kyrs, would imply an untenable minimum slip rate deficit of 60 to 100 m since the most recent earthquake. One explanation for the available geodetic, seismic, and paleoseismic evidence is that strain accumulation is modulated by viscoelastic relaxation associated with frequent large magnitude earthquakes in the Salton Trough region, episodically inhibiting the accumulation of elastic strain required to generate large earthquakes on the Santa Rita and possibly other faults in the Southern Basin and Range. An important question is thus for how long the postseismic velocity changes will persist relative to the recurrence interval of large Salton Trough earthquakes. Understanding the influence of far-field postseismic deformation on the southern Arizona strain rate field could have implications for other regions of diffuse intracontinental deformation in proximity to frequently rupturing large magnitude plate boundary faults.",

Carbon budget in agricultural fields is largely influenced by some artificial managements. After the harvest of crops, residual biomass is burned on fields, brought out from fields, or left and plowed into paddy soils. If the open burning is conducted on fields, one part of biomass carbon would be emitted to atmosphere as CO2, and the other part would be plowed into soils.\nIn this study, an experimental paddy field was divided into two areas to investigate what impact is brought on the annual CO2 flux by the difference of disposal management of residual biomass after the harvest. At the one area, residual biomass was burned and plowed into soils after the harvest in late November 2011, 2012, and 2013. At the other area, residue was not burned and plowed into soils as usual. From three-years average of sampling surveys, carbon content of residue plowed into soils after the harvest was estimated 293±1 and 220±36 g C m-2 at no-burned and burned area, respectively. Continuous eddy-covariance measurements of CO2 fluxes at each area were conducted for three years. A little bit of difference in CO2 flux between two areas was shown during rice season.",

The new parameterization represents boundary layer mixing, and non-precipitating and precipitating convection processes in a unified and physically consistent manner. The parameterization builds on a previously tested stochastic multiple-plume eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux (EDMF) approach. The new parameterization includes a realistic model for microphysical processes as part of the mass-flux parameterization, and a parameterization for convective downdrafts. A method to solve the mass-flux dynamics and microphysics simultaneously is developed. This method avoids the need for an iterative solution of the equations and is numerically stable. The new EDMF parameterization is implemented in a single-column model (SCM) and we show that the model is able to capture essential features of moist boundary layers, ranging from the stratocumulus, shallow and precipitating cumulus regimes. Detailed comparisons of a few important cases with LES results are shown to confirm the robustness of the present approach.

            "abstract": "While wind and wave modelling is nowadys quite satisfactory in the open oceans, problems are still present in the enclosed seas, the more so the smaller the basin and the more complicated the surrounding orography. The Red Sea is an extreme example in this respect, especially because of its long and narrow shape. This deceivingly simple domain offers very interesting challenges for wind and wave modelling, not easily, if ever, found elsewhere. Depending on the season, opposite wind regimes, one direct to southeast, the other one to northwest, are present may coexist in the most northerly and southerly parts of the Red Sea. Where the two regimes meet, the wavespectra can be rather complicated and, crucially dependent on small details of the driving wind fields.\nUsing different meteorological products and wave models, we explored how well we could reproduce the general and unusual wind and wave patterns of the Red Sea. We obtained the best results using two rather opposite approaches; the high resolution Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) regional model and slightly enhanced surface winds from the global European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model. We discuss the reasons why this two approaches produce the best results and the implications on wave modelling in the Red Sea. The unusual wind and wave patterns in the Red Sea suggests that the currently available wave models source functions may not properly represent the evolution of local fields. However, within limits, the WAVEWATCH III wave model, based on Janssen's and also Ardhuin's wave model physics, provides in many cases very reasonable results.",

The EARS, an active continental rift zone, appears to be a developing tectonic plate boundary and thus, has a number of active as well as dormant volcanoes through its extent. These volcanic centers can be used as potential sources for geothermal energy. The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and the Geothermal Development Company (GDC) began collaborating to monitor several volcanic centers, which have included passive seismic sensor deployments experiment. A number of seismological techniques will be applied to the data being collected at the four volcanic centers: Menengai, Silali, and Paka, and Korosi. In particular, we will identify long-period signals and tremor local using a time-reversal approach. Low-frequency earthquakes are interpreted as magma passing through conduits of the magma chamber and/or fluid being transported as a function of magma movement or hydrothermal activity. The time-reversal locations will help identify the margin of the volcano and caldera, and faults that could form conduits for fluids. We will also perform ambient noise tomography to image the magma chamber and the conduit feeding the volcanoes. The combination of the velocity snapshots of the magma chamber, low-frequency events, and long period events will help us interpret the activity of the calderas and volcanoes. Overall, all these techniques will help us understand magma movement and volcanic processes in the region.",

            "abstract": "We propose a conceptual model to explain elevated thermal gradients, localized laterally over a few 100 m, discovered during the SAGE program in 2013 and confirmed in 2014 at the Buckman water well field in the Española Basin of north central New Mexico. The anomalous gradients of temperature with depth, dT/dz, exceed 70 ºC/km and are found in three shallow (< 100 m-deep) USGS monitoring wells close to the Rio Grande. A temperature increase of only 3 - 4 ºC at ~100 m depth would elevate the regional temperature value enough to yield the anomalous dT/dz values in the upper ~100 m. The coincidence of a 25 km2 region of InSAR-confirmed subsidence with the locally anomalous dT/dz region suggests a way to achieve a higher temperature at ~ 100 m depth. The mechanism is an isothermal release of warmer water from ~ 200 m depth along a fissure or reactivated fault. A fourth well, 290 m away, has a temperature gradient of only 33ºC/km in the upper 100 m and a distinctly different geochemical profile, suggesting aquifer compartmentalization and possible faulting close to the anomaly. In 2001 a 800 m-long surface scarp with up to 0.2 m offset appeared 2 km to the east in response to over-pumping that depressed the groundwater table by over 100 m. Such drawdown is expected to have 2 – 5 m of compaction with attendant movement along faults or fissures. This could allow groundwater to be released upward isothermally until encountering an unbreached aquitard where it would establish an elevated thermal boundary. Besides the local thermal anomaly, we have temperature-logged deeper water wells in the area. These and other measurements have been used to construct cross-sections of isotherms across the Española Basin along the groundwater flow units (GFUs). This allows comparison of the local thermal anomaly with classic, regional, basin hydrological models. For example, the fully-screened Skillet well, 2.3 km from the anomaly, shows a classic concave down dT/dz form indicating upwelling water. This is consistent with the regional hydraulic head and historical accounts of artesian wells pre-dating Buckman pumping. We quantified the upwelling by Péclet number analysis to be 0.076 - 0.11 m/yr. Numerical modeling using the TOUGH2 computer code is proceeding to further understand regional and local subsurface groundwater flow patterns and dT/dz values.",

            "abstract": "Studies of aeromagnetic anomalies suggest that the lithospheric mantle may contribute to long wavelength features. Examination of unaltered mantle xenoliths may reveal the mineralogical sources of these aeromagnetic anomalies. Prior work has reported microscopic inclusions of magnetic minerals in mantle silicates. Here we explore the magnetism of pure olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and spinel separated from peridotite xenoliths from the Dariganga and Tariat localities in Mongolia that sample the lithospheric mantle. All separates were leached with HF and HCl to remove secondary minerals adhering to the surface of the grains or in cracks. Separates were then mounted in cement to create monomineralic specimens for investigation using hysteresis loops, first order reversal curves (FORC), alternating field and thermal demagnetization of a 1T IRM, and low-temperature magnetometry. All specimens showed trace concentrations of ferromagnetic inclusions with Ms values of ~10-3 Am2kg-1. Thermal demagnetization showed a range of unblocking temperatures with median destructive temperatures of 300-400°C. Two specimens showed a dramatic demagnetization at 585°C, consistent with pure magnetite (Mt). The presence of Mt was confirmed by observations of the Verwey transition at 100-120K and by backfield remanence acquisition curves that plateau at ~300 mT. The median destructive alternating field was ~20 mT and 40-80 mT for specimens from Dariganga and Tariat, respectively. FORC diagrams show single-domain-like behavior with a median Hc of ~20 mT. The demagnetization experiments suggest that Mt inclusions in the lattice of olivine, opx, cpx and spinel carry magnetic remanence. Thus, the lithospheric mantle may exhibit in-situ ferromagnetism carried by Mt below 585°C. The magnetization of separates varies between xenolith localities but is consistent amongst minerals of the same locality. Future work will address whether the Mt formed before or during xenolith ascent.",

            "abstract": "The increasing demand for food, fibers and biofuels, the consequently escalating prices of agricultural products, and the uncertainty of international food markets have recently drawn the attention of governments and corporations toward investments in productive agricultural land, mostly in developing countries. Since 2000 more than 37 million hectares of arable land have been purchased or leased by foreign investors worldwide. The targeted regions are typically located in areas where crop yields are relatively low because of lack of modern technology. It is expected that in the long run large scale investments in agriculture and the consequent development of commercial farming will bring the technology required to close the existing crop yield gaps. Recently, a number of studies and reports have documented the process of foreign land acquisition, while the associated appropriation of land based resources (e.g., water and crops) has remained poorly investigated. The amount of food this land can produce and the number of people it could feed still needs to be quantified. It is also unclear to what extent the acquired land will be used to for biofuel production and the role played by U.S. and E.U. bioenergy policies as drivers of the ongoing land rush. The environmental impacts of these investments in agriculture require adequate investigation. Here we provide a global quantitative assessment of the rates of water and crop appropriation potentially associated with large scale land acquisitions. We evaluate the associated impacts on the food and energy security of both target and investors’ countries, and highlight the societal and environmental implications of the land rush phenomenon.",

With over twelve years (2001-present) of continuous GPS RO measurements now available from CHAMP, COSMIC, and other missions, the dataset has become increasingly valuable in the study of upper air climate trend, variability, and processes. In this presentation, we will describe our approach towards the generation of global monthly gridded data products that include temperature, geopotential height, and geostrophic wind in the UTLS. To interpolate or map the irregularly sampled RO data into a 2D grid, a Bayesian method with spherical harmonic basis functions is implemented. Furthermore, we will quantify the measurement and sampling uncertainty associated with the monthly gridded data. Applications of the dataset in the variability of the tropical belt and CMIP5 model evaluation will be presented. In addition, we will discuss recent progress in reducing systematic retrieval errors as well as efforts to extend the current data record rigorously to the GPS/MET era (1995-1997).",

Previous work highlighted the Elysium lava flow province as anomalous, with a depletion in K and Th relative to the average crust in the rest of Mars (ROM).[3] We characterize the elemental composition, geology, and geomorphology of the region to constrain the processes that have contributed to its evolution.\nWe compare SE Elysium with its North West lava fields, advancing prior work on thermal evolution of the martian mantle.[6] Lava fields at both sites probably source from Elysium eruptions. Both show similar Si content, as well as a Ca-enrichment compared to ROM, consistent with prior models.[6,7] Nevertheless, the two fields are compositionally distinct from each other, with NW Elysium decisively depleted in Ca and Fe, but enriched in K and Th. Such distinctness, in elements that reflect magmatic fractionation, reveals the possibility that a single volcanic complex on Mars may evolve rapidly during the Amazonian era, causing variable flow compositions.\nInterestingly, a chemical province containing volcanics that is contemporaneous with Elysium, overlaps the Tharsis region.[3] Unlike Elysium, the K and Th distributions within Tharsis are indistinguishable from ROM. Meanwhile, the mass fraction signature in Tharsis is enriched in Cl and depleted in Si. Such contrast, in chemical anomalies between volcanic constructs of similar age, may indicate that the depletion of K and Th in SE Elysium did not arise from temporal evolution of the mantle.\n[1] Taylor, G. et al.

            "abstract": "Trees are critical green infrastructure for mitigating adverse effects associated with human population, land use, and climate change (e.g. urban heat island, greenhouse gasses, air pollution, and floods). i-Tree (www.itreetools.org) is a suite of software tools developed by the USDA Forest Service and The Davey Institute that allows users to assess urban forest structure and the ecosystem services provided. Using i-Tree, the annual effects of trees on air quality and human health in urban and rural areas of counties across the conterminous United States have been quantified for 2010 (Nowak et al. 2014). Here, we extended the study to incorporate future forest structure scenarios using a model that accounts for tree growth, mortality and new plantings. Computer simulations using local environmental data and the possible leaf area index (LAI) for deciduous or evergreen tree covers were performed in urban and rural areas of counties across the conterminous United States. The result is a tree effects database on air pollutant removal (CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2), biogenic emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and monetary values associated with human health quantified per unit tree cover area with deciduous or evergreen trees and LAI ranging from 0 to 18 within each modeling domain. With these data, the potential annual effects that trees have on air quality and human health under future scenarios of urban forest extent can be readily derived for anywhere in the conterminous United States. The developed database will be integrated into i-Tree’s suite in 2015 to enhance its functionality in estimating tree effects under the future scenarios.",

The utilized wide angle camera (21 mm equivalent) delivers aerial images with a ground pixel resolution of approximately 18 cm, which are subsequently combined to digital elevation models (DEMs) mapping the calving front. Ground control points in the study area, measured with L1 phase GNSS receivers, are used to geo-locate the produced DEMs and ensure high quality co-registration between subsequent data sets. The 2 m wing span UAV platform is capable of 40 - 60 minutes of autonomous flight, guided by an open-source, open-hardware autopilot system (pixhawk.org) and thus can map rather large areas of the calving glacier. I will present results from the 2014 field season during which the calving front of Breiðamerkurjökull has been mapped repeatedly with data acquisition intervals ranging from hours to weeks. A lidar dataset from 2011 of the study region is used to validate the acquired DEM data and accuracy/precision statistics will be presented.

MFLL and ACES are multi-frequency, Intensity-Modulated, Continuous-Wave (IM-CW) Lidar systems developed as proof-of-concept demonstrators for NASA’s Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) mission. The National Research Council identified ASCENDS in 2007 as an important mid-term decadal survey mission to provide measurements critical to improved projections of the Earth’s future climate.\nThe ASCENDS measurement requirements have evolved significantly since first proposed by the NRC as has our understanding of the IM-CW measurement technique we propose for use by ASCENDS. To meet these requirements, both MFLL and ACES transmit wavelengths near 1.57 and 1.26 μm modulated with range-encoded signals to minimize bias from thin clouds in the CO2 and O2 column measurements while simultaneously measuring the path length to the surface and to intervening cloud layers.\nIn preparation for the ASCENDS mission, the MFLL has been deployed on 13 airborne field campaigns since 2005, including the latest series of flights in August 2014. NASA also flew the ACES instrument as a technology demonstrator in 2014. In this paper we describe the current ASCENDS retrieval technique and present the accuracy and precision of the measurements obtained using this technique. We also present a reanalysis of the 2011 MFLL measurements and compare the results previously reported to the reanalysis. Reanalysis yields range precisions of less that one meter from an altitude of 12 kilometers from the CO2 offline channel with 1.6 watts of transmitted power.",

            "abstract": "The solar magnetic field enables the heating of the corona and provides its underlying structure. Energy stored in coronal magnetic fields is released in flares and coronal mass ejections (CME) and provides the ultimate source of energy for space weather. Therefore, direct measurements of the coronal magnetic field have significant potential to enhance understanding of coronal dynamics and improve solar forecasting models. Of particular interest are observations of coronal field lines in the transitional region between closed and open flux systems, providing important information on the origin of the slow solar wind.\nWhile current instruments routinely observe only the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields, a proposed airborne spectrometer will take a step toward the direct observation of coronal fields by measuring plasma emission in the infrared at high spatial and spectral resolution. The targeted lines are four forbidden magnetic dipole transitions between 2 and 4 μm. The airborne system will consist of a telescope, grating spectrometer, and pointing/stabilization system to be flown on the NSF/NCAR High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) during the August 2017 total solar eclipse.\nThe project incorporates several optical engineering challenges, centered around maintaining adequate spectral and spatial resolution in a compact and inexpensive package and on a moving platform. Design studies are currently underway to examine the tradeoffs between various optical geometries and control strategies for the pointing/stabilization system. The results will be presented and interpreted in terms of the consequences for the scientific questions. In addition, results from a laboratory prototype and simulations of the final system will be presented.",

            "abstract": "As the awareness of water pollution, eutrophication and other water related environmental concerns grows, the significance of sediment in the transport of nutrients and contaminants from agricultural areas to streams has received increasing attention. Both the physical and geochemical properties of suspended sediment are strongly controlled by sediment sources. Thus, tracing sources of suspended sediment in watersheds is important for the design of management practices to reduce sediment loads and contributions of sediment-adsorbed nutrients from agricultural areas to streams. However, the contributions of different sediment sources to suspended sediment loads within intensively managed watersheds in the Midwest still remain insufficiently explored.\nThis study aims to assess the provenance of suspended sediment and the relation between channel morphology and production of suspended sediment in the Upper Sangamon River Basin, Illinois. The 3,690-km2 Upper Sangamon River Basin is characterized by low-relief, agricultural lands dominated by row-crop agriculture. Sediment source samples were collected in the Saybrook and Wildcat Slough sub-watersheds from six potential sources: row-crop agriculture, forest, floodplains, river banks, pastures, and grasslands. Event-based suspended sediment samples were collected by in situ suspended sediment samplers and ISCO automatic pump samplers from the streams. A quantitative geochemical fingerprinting technique, combining statistically verified multicomponent signatures and an unmixing model, was employed to estimate the relative contributions of sediment from six potential sources to the suspended sediment loads. Our preliminary results indicate that the majority of suspended sediment is derived from channel banks and forest adjacent to meandering reaches in the downstream portions of the watersheds, while only minor amounts of suspended sediment are derived from upland areas adjacent to channelized rivers in the low-relief Upper Sangamon River Basin. These results suggest that poor connectivity exists between upland areas and channelized reaches of headwater streams in low gradient agricultural watersheds. Further work is needed to determine if this finding is event-dependent with connectivity changing according to event magnitude.",

            "abstract": "We present a quantitative evaluation of the simulated MJO in analyses produced with a coupled data assimilation (CDA) framework developed at the National Center for Atmosphere Research. This system is based on the Community Earth System Model (CESM; previously known as the Community Climate System Model -CCSM) interfaced to a community facility for ensemble data assimilation (Data Assimilation Research Testbed – DART). The system (multi-component CDA) assimilates data into each of the respective ocean/atmosphere/land model components during the assimilation step followed by an exchange of information between the model components during the forecast step. Note that this is an advancement over many existing prototypes of coupled data assimilation systems, which typically assimilate observations only in one of the model components (i.e., single-component CDA). The more realistic treatment of air–sea interactions and improvements to the model mean state in the multi-component CDA recover many aspects of MJO representation, from its space–time structure and propagation (see Figure 1) to the governing relationships between precipitation and sea surface temperature on intra-seasonal scales. Standard qualitative and process-based diagnostics identified by the MJO Task Force (currently under the auspices of the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation) have been used to detect the MJO signals across a suite of coupled model experiments involving both multi-component and single-component DA experiments as well as a free run of the coupled CESM model (i.e., CMIP5 style without data assimilation). Short predictability experiments during the boreal winter are used to demonstrate that the decay rates of the MJO convective anomalies are slower in the multi-component CDA system, which allows it to retain the MJO dynamics for a longer period. We anticipate that the knowledge gained through this study will enhance our understanding of the MJO feedback mechanisms across the air-sea interface, especially regarding ocean impacts on the MJO as well as highlight the capability of coupled data assimilation systems for related tropical intraseasonal variability predictions.",

            "abstract": "El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the strongest mode of interannual variability in the modern climate; however, its sensitivity to external forcing is still debated. We examine ENSO’s response to varying late summer insolation during the Holocene, using a sediment core near the Line Islands, central equatorial Pacific, which is well situated to test contrasting hypotheses of ENSO behavior. Some paleoclimate models predict reduced ENSO during the mid-Holocene, when equatorial late summer insolation was at a maximum, due to negative feedbacks from upwelling. This prediction is borne out by coral- and foraminiferal-based paleoclimate records. However, a compilation of Line Island coral records shows no overall Holocene trend, indicating instead that ENSO is dominated by unforced internal dynamics with little response to external insolation forcing.\nHere we present Mg/Ca-derived temperatures from individual planktonic foraminifera analyzed by laser ablation ICP-MS, from seven time intervals during the mid- and early Holocene. Both mixed-layer dwelling G. sacculifer and subsurface-dwelling G. tumida were analyzed to constrain upper water column structure. For each time interval, we generated 70-85 individual temperatures from each species. By analyzing the distribution of temperatures, the dominant modes of variability (including ENSO) can be identified, and distributions from different time intervals can be compared quantitatively. El Niño events strongly affect the warm “tail” of the distribution, whereas changes in seasonality have a small effect on the middle of the distribution, and are readily distinguished from ENSO. Our data show muted El Niño amplitude relative to the coretop in five time intervals 4680-9050 years before present, whereas at 10700 years before present, El Niño amplitude was similar to the coretop. This finding, in conjunction with Holocene temperature records from the eastern equatorial Pacific showing relatively cool mid-Holocene temperatures compared to the early and late Holocene, supports the hypothesis that insolation can control ENSO on orbital timescales via regulation of upwelling in the eastern equatorial Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Faulting of the sediment section on the downgoing Juan de Fuca Plate (JdF) outboard of the Cascadia deformation front is explored using multi-channel seismic (MCS) data collected in 2012 during the JdF Ridge to Trench Survey (MGL1211). MCS data were collected along two full plate transects (“Oregon” (ORT) and “Washington” (WAT)) and one trench parallel line. Sediment velocity analysis is conducted via semblance spectrums on common mid-point super gathers spaced at a 625 m interval. Higher sediment velocities are found in the north, which may reflect the regional differences in sediment composition evident in existing drill holes located along our transects (DSDP site 174 - ORT and ODP site 1027 - WAT) that indicate higher smectite content along the ORT (bulk composition +44%). Accordingly, observations of fault frequency, dip, and throw along both transects show significant differences in faulting characteristics across the JdF plate. Faulting extends ~175 km (8.2 – 1.9 Ma plate age) from the deformation front along the WAT, and reaches a maximum fault density of ~0.48 fault/km in the region between 25 - 113 km (7.5 – 4 Ma plate age). Evidence of faulting extends ~300 km (8.9 – 2.6 Ma plate age) from the deformation front along the ORT and reaches a similar high fault density of ~0.48 fault/km in the region between 113 - 138 km (7.07 – 5.96 Ma plate age). Analysis of fault offset indicates growth faults along both transects. Along the ORT, maximum fault throws remain ~uniform at 10 - 15 m for crustal ages of 7.07 – 5.96 Ma and beginning ~75 km from the deformation front increase landward to maximum throws of 30 m, consistent with increasing fault strain due to flexural bending of the downgoing plate. In contrast, along the WAT, there is no evidence of increasing fault throw toward the deformation front. High fault dips (45 - 70°) are found in the region of highest fault density on both transects. Lower dips (35 - 60°) are measured in the region of increasing fault strain near the deformation front along the ORT. Overall, fault characteristics indicate greater subduction-bend related faulting along the ORT. Additionally, complex intra-plate stresses and/or differential compaction may contribute to the abundant faulting found within the plate interior to young crustal ages along both transects.",

            "abstract": "We evaluate the orientations of the principal stresses and strains regionally in the Central Coast, California and locally in the Irish Hills using two independent datasets: the GPS velocity field and earthquake focal mechanisms. We use two analytical tools to investigate the geometry and rate of strain from the geodetic velocity data: GPSTRN and SSPX. The GPS inversions indicate the maximum shortening strain, d3, in the Central Coast is directed NE to NNE and the sense of vertical axis rotation is clockwise, consistent with distributed dextral shear. Within the Irish Hills, the direction of d3 ranges from ~N1°W to N20°E, with a mean value of ~N13°E, and negative dilatation which suggests deformation is characterized by net horizontal shortening and vertical thickening. Using focal mechanism datasets, we evaluate strain and stress in the Central Coast using the analytical tools FLTSLP and SATSI, respectively. Regionally, d3 derived from FLTSLP is directed NE to NNE; within the Irish Hills, the mean orientation of d3 is ~N21°E and ranges from ~N15°E to N26°E. Assuming that d3 is parallel to the maximum compressive stress, σ1, the SATSI inversions produced similar results as the FLTSLP inversions, with σ1 oriented in the NS to NNE direction, specifically ranging from ~N9°E to N17°E, with a mean value of ~N13°E, for the Irish Hills. The results of the GPS and focal mechanism data inversions generally are in good agreement, suggesting distributed brittle faulting represented by small earthquakes is releasing a small component of the elastic strain accumulating on the major active faults in the region. In the vicinity of the Irish Hills, all analyses indicate NE to NNE directed d3 and σ1 orientations, with average orientations of ~N10°E to N20°E, consistent with distributed transpressional dextral shear sub-parallel to local motion between the Pacific plate and Sierra Nevada-Central Valley microplate, and previous results of N15°E ±4° for the orientation of P-axes of earthquakes in the Central Coast region north of 35° N.",

            "abstract": "Each winter, dozens of fatalities occur when intense North Atlantic windstorms impact Western Europe. Forecasting the tracks of these storms in the short term is often problematic, but long term forecasts provide an even greater challenge. Improved prediction necessitates the ability to identify these low pressure areas at formation and understand commonalities that distinguish these storms from other systems crossing the Atlantic, such as where they develop. There is some evidence that indicates the majority of intense windstorms that reach Europe have origins far west, as low pressure systems that develop over the North American continent. This project aims to identify the specific cyclogenesis regions in North America that produce a significantly greater number of dangerous storms. NOAA Ocean Prediction Center surface pressure reanalysis maps are used to examine the tracks of storms. Strong windstorms are characterized by those with a central pressure of less than 965 hPa at any point in their life cycle. Tracks are recorded using a coding system based on source region, storm track and dissipation region. The codes are analyzed to determine which region contains the most statistical significance with respect to strong Atlantic windstorm generation. The resultant set of codes also serves as a climatology of North Atlantic extratropical cyclones. Results indicate that a number of windstorms favor cyclogenesis regions off the east coast of the United States. A large number of strong storms that encounter east coast cyclogenesis zones originate in the central mountain region, around Colorado. These storms follow a path that exits North America around New England and subsequently travel along the Canadian coast. Some of these are then primed to become “bombs” over the open Atlantic Ocean.",

In this short talk, the author discusses her experience in shifting from a doctoral program in environmental history to a doctoral program in hydrology. The experience of having to learn a radically new skill set is both frightening and hugely rewarding and requires a confidence in one's ability to master new and ostensibly insurmountable concepts and a dedication to pushing beyond the initial endless frustrations. But after overcoming these initial hurdles, it became extremely useful to have a broad background in the geosciences. Conceptualizing the impact of climate change on water resources in terms of human livelihoods, for example, is both necessary and productive to understanding long-term policy impacts. This broader framing of research questions is thus significant in moving beyond the sometimes narrow conversations that are had behind the closed doors of each academic discipline.",

Natural defenses are increasingly cited as an element of the solution. However, their use and widespread acceptance are still under debate and there are limited data on their cost effectiveness. Our goal is to provide comparable cost effectiveness estimates of ‘green’ and ‘gray’ approaches for risk reduction. We follow the Economics of Climate Adaptation (ECA) methodology and further integrates nature-based solutions in to this approach. We propose an ecosystem based risk mitigation perspective and integrate it into local decision making and risk models. A pilot case has been developed for the US Gulf Coast with special emphasis on (1) nature based measures, (2) an open-knowledge approach and (3) on a spatially explicit analyses. We examine potential damage to residential and commercial properties, infrastructure and assets. Our specific goals were to:\nAssess risks from hurricanes in the Gulf Coast in an holistic manner from hazards to damages and possible solutions\nDefine how cost- effective ecosystems are for coastal defense in the Gulf Coast\nQuantify how and where natural solutions may reduce risks accounting for coastal engineering indicators\nAnalyze and compare different scenarios including additional risks from climate change such as sea-level rise, potential coastal policy responses and economic growth",

            "abstract": "Modern research, particularly in areas related to coupled systems, big data analyses, and model development/validation, involves heterogeneous data inputs and derived data products: data come from multiple services, processing is complex and variable, and the derived products don’t easily fit back into any of the source repositories. Significant progress is being made in supporting the assembly, management, and publication of such complex collections, thereby increasing data reproducibility. The Sustainable Environment – Actionable Data (SEAD) project within the U.S. National Science Foundation’s DataNet program is one such service. SEAD is typical of emerging best-practice in terms of managing individual data items (typically files), organized into collections and described using an open set of standard vocabularies, which are then published as rich compound research objects. Such objects minimally expose basic discovery metadata that can be used to register them with third-party search engines but they also maintain the rich descriptive information and provenance at the fine grained level. In the past year, the SEAD project team has worked to provide mechanisms to ingest data directly from other data services and to interact with applications, thereby maintaining provenance links that would otherwise be lost through a download/upload trip through a file system. Further, in coordination with other DataNet projects, we’ve worked to capture and display metadata obtainable from the source service, and to infer research-object-to-research-object provenance from file-level information to support enhanced discovery. These advances begin to realize the vision of researchers working across an ecosystem of data services, but they have also highlighted a range of practical and theoretical issues that arise when it becomes possible to track research activities across multiple research/publication/data lifecycles. This presentation will describe the work that has been done in SEAD and between DataNet projects to allow round-trip integration from data sources through subsequent data publications and will highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in creating richer, higher-value services that leverage the ‘round-trip’ provenance and metadata that becomes available.",

Changes in SWE and snowmelt runoff timing directly impact water availability in alpine watersheds as well as downstream ecosystem services. In this study we evaluated local trends in air temperature, precipitation, snowpack, and streamflow timing to look for similarities to regional trends reported in literature. We assessed two long-term alpine data collection sites in Rocky Mountain National Park: Bear Lake SNOTEL site (2896 m; 1981–2013) and Loch Vale Watershed (3159 m; 1984–2011), using the Mann-Kendall test to examine trends in average monthly temperature, number of days above freezing, peak SWE depth and timing, number of snow-free days, and total precipitation at Bear Lake, as well as streamflow volume and timing metrics at the outlet of Loch Vale.\nWe found seasonal patterns and magnitudes of warming similar to regional trend findings, with significant increasing trends in average monthly mean air temperatures for most months. The average number of days below 0ºC also significantly decreased in fall and winter. However, we found no significant trends in peak SWE, discharge rate, precipitation, accumulated snowfall, or the number of snow-free days at Bear Lake or Loch Vale sites. These results suggest reported regional warming trends are not reflected in localized snowmelt trends in alpine Rocky Mountain watersheds.",

            "abstract": "The impact of horizontal resolution in an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) on mid-latitude storm track simulation is investigated using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS). In one set of experiments, the IFS is forced with prescribed monthly sea surface temperature (SST) observations for 1960-2007 at three resolutions with T159 (~126km), T511 (~39km) and T1279 (~16km). To assess the effect of air-sea feedback, we have also examined three seasonal hindcast experiments of 7-months long initialized in every May and November for 1982-2010. The hindcasts are conducted using the ECMWF seasonal prediction system with IFS as its atmospheric component, which is set at resolutions of T319 (~62km) T639 (~31km) and T1279 for the three hindcasts respectively.\nThe climatologically annual cycle of the large-scale precipitation over the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream regions is well simulated by IFS. The mean precipitation is enhanced with increasing atmospheric resolution in both the AGCM and coupled runs. Monthly averaged variance of high-pass filtered daily 250hPa meridional wind is used as an indicator for storm track intensity. In comparison with ERA-40 reanalysis, all simulations overestimate the mean strength of the storm tracks in the North Hemisphere. An EOF analysis of the high-pass filtered variance fields further shows that the two leading modes of the T159 run are characterized by a simultaneous strengthening/weakening in both North Atlantic and Pacific and a seesaw between the two basins respectively, consistent with those from the ERA-40 reanalysis. As the resolution increases, however, the storm track variations in the two basins become more independent. Further analyses are being conducted to connect the storm track variability with the global and regional atmospheric and SST patterns in these simulations.",

This study finds that early, stringent mitigation would avoid a large proportion of the impacts of climate change induced biodiversity loss projected for the 2080s. Furthermore, despite the large number of studies addressing extinction risks in particular species groups, few studies have explored the issue of potential range loss in common and widespread species. Our study is a comprehensive global scale analysis of 48,786 common and widespread species. We show that without climate change mitigation, 57+/-6% of the plants and 34+/-7% of the animals studied are likely to lose over 50% of their present climatic range by the 2080s. This estimate incorporates realistic, taxon-specific dispersal rates. With stringent mitigation, in which emissions peak in 2016 and are reduced by 5% annually thereafter, these losses are reduced by 60%. Furthermore, with stringent mitigation, global temperature rises more slowly, allowing an additional three decades for biodiversity to adapt to a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels. The work also shows that even with mitigation not all the impacts can now be avoided, and ecosystems and biodiversity generally has a very limited capacity to adapt. Delay in mitigation substantially reduces the percentage of impacts that can be avoided, for example if emissions do not peak until 2030, the percentage of losses that can be avoided declines to 40%. Since even small declines in common and widespread species can disrupt ecosystem function and services, these results indicate that without mitigation, globally widespread losses in ecosystem service provision are to be expected.",

            "abstract": "Metaphors are sometimes used in science communication to explain unfamiliar scientific concepts and processes in more familiar terms. Empirical research has shown that metaphors can help audiences better understand complicated scientific concepts. A growing number of metaphors are used to explain various climate science concepts, but the only empirical evaluation of climate metaphors to date (van der Linden et al, 2014, Climatic Change) found that medical and bridge safety metaphors did not enhance the effectiveness of a simple corrective statement about the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change. Drawing on a recent meta-analysis by Sopory and Dillard (2002, Hum Commun. Res.), we will briefly review what is known about appropriate metaphor usage in communicating scientific concepts. We will also present preliminary findings from an experiment currently underway to further explain the conditions in which metaphors are likely to help in communicating climate science concepts. We hypothesize that metaphors will be more effective in communicating high complexity climate science concepts that are less easily understood by the public than more easily understood low complexity concepts (such as scientific consensus on climate change). We also hypothesize that the more familiar people are with the referent (performance enhancing drugs in baseball is a metaphor about “the climate system on steroids”), the more effective the metaphor will be. To test these hypotheses, we are randomly assigning ~1000 adults – approximately representative of the US adult population – to read one brief passage in which one of four relatively simple or complex climate concepts is presented and explained with or without a metaphor. The outcome measures will include climate change belief, concern, knowledge, and involvement. This study is intended to add to the knowledge base about use of metaphors in science communication, and provide practical advice to climate communicators.",

            "abstract": "The question of what type of role scientists, or experts more generally, should play in policy debates is a perennial point of discussion within the scientific community. It is often thought that communication containing some form of policy advocacy is likely to compromise the perceived credibility of the individual scientist engaged in such behavior, with the possibility that it may also harm the credibility of the scientific community more broadly. Rather than evaluating statements in a binary fashion as representing either pure objectivity or pure advocacy, one recent model proposes that public communication by scientists should instead be thought of as falling along a continuum based upon the extent of normative judgment implicit in a statement. This approach predicts that as the extent of normative judgment increases, it poses a relatively greater risk to a scientist’s perceived credibility. Though such a model is conceptually useful, little empirical social science research has systematically explored how individuals form judgments about different types of advocacy to examine common assumptions about the relative risks associated with such behaviors. In this presentation, we will report results from a national online experiment (N=1200) that examines audience responses to fictional social media posts written by either a climate scientist or a television weathercaster. Following the above model, the posts represent differing degrees of advocacy defined by the extent of normative judgment implicit in each statement. In instances where a specific policy is advocated, we examine whether participants’ reactions are shaped by the extent to which the policy mentioned is congruent with one’s political ideology. We hope this study will serve as an exemplar of applied science communication research that can begin to help inform scientists and other experts about the potential implications of different communication options they may choose from in deciding how to engage with policy.",

From these data, we construct time series of ocean sediment thickness and carbonate deposition rate for the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian ocean basins for the past 120 Ma. These time series are unique to each basin and reflect an integrated response to plate tectonics and climate change. The goal is to parameterize ocean sedimentation tied to crustal age for paleoclimate studies. For each basin, total sediment thickness and carbonate deposition rate from 0.1 x 0.1 degree cells are binned according to basement crustal age; area-corrected moments (mean, variance, etc.) are calculated for each bin. Segmented linear fits identify trends in present-day carbonate deposition rates and changes in ocean sedimentation from 0 to 120 Ma.\nIn the North and South Atlantic and Indian oceans, mean sediment thickness versus crustal age is well represented by three linear segments, with the slope of each segment increasing with increasing crustal age. However, the transition age between linear segments varies among the three basins. In contrast, mean sediment thickness in the North and South Pacific oceans are numerically smaller and well represented by two linear segments with slopes that decrease with increasing crustal age. These opposing trends are more consistent with the plate tectonic history of each basin being the controlling factor in sedimentation rates, rather than climate change. Unlike total sediment thickness, carbonate deposition rates decrease smoothly with crustal age in all basins, with the primary controls being ocean chemistry and water column depth.\n",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic aerosols have a considerable impact on the radiative balance of the Earth and are believed to contribute to a cooling of the climate. However, in contrast to long lived greenhouse gases, aerosols and their radiative forcing display large spatial variations. This uneven radiative forcing distribution may cause changes in regional as well as global circulation patterns.\nThe effect of anthropogenic aerosols on the zonal tropical circulation is investigated using the global coupled climate model EC-Earth.The relatively low forcing resulting from only modeling the direct aerosol effect led to a negligible tropical mean temperature and precipitation response. Nevertheless, the aerosol direct radiative forcing had a considerable local impact on the zonal overturning circulation over the Indian Ocean. The aerosol forcing led to decrease of the most intense convective precipitation and the related pressure velocity field over the Maritime Continent. It is found that it is predominantly scattering aerosols that are responsible for these changes. When the cloud albedo effect was included, on the other hand, the tropics experienced a cooling and a subsequent precipitation reduction.\nThe results indicate that the uneven spatial distribution of the aerosol radiative forcing can lead to substantial local effects on the tropical zonal overturning circulation and precipitation without necessarily relying on a tropical wide cooling and a thermodynamic scaling argument. Moreover, these local aerosol induced convection and precipitation changes may in turn influence the global atmospheric circulation.",

            "abstract": "Many countries of Southern Africa face inadequate weather monitoring networks to provide reliable and consistent information for the development of efficient management strategies for sustainable water and land resources management, drought and flood risk analysis and forecasts as well as climate change impacts assessments. In addition, some existing networks are characterized by station data showing notable gaps in long-term observations. On the other hand, useful climate information is saved in historical documents and archives, but only barely explored up to now. Such documents are also available in archives of European meteorological services, partly also not yet in digital format. A main aim of the SASSCAL Initiative (Southern African Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adaptive Land Management; www.sasscal.org) is to improve the availability of reliable meteorological baseline data along with a set of analytical methods to strengthen the research capacities in the SASSCAL region including Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia, and therewith to support and integrate information of existing national monitoring networks of the Southern African region. In close cooperation with the national weather authorities and various research institutions of the SASSCAL region, the above mentioned deficits are specifically addressed by\ni) extending the existing national monitoring networks through additional automatic weather stations and their integration in the SASSCAL WeatherNet which in near future hosts about 130 stations,\nii) contributing to the development of Climate Data Management Systems (CDMS) at the national weather authorities in Angola, Botswana and Zambia and\niii) the provision of additional time series of climate data based on the historic documents from various archives in all countries.\nThe paper presents first results and shows how these efforts are linked to provide consistent climate information for Southern Africa in order to support research and decision-making activities conducted in SASSCAL and beyond.",

            "abstract": "Thermal pressurization is a co-seismic weakening mechanism driven by the thermal expansion of native pore fluids, which leads to elevated pore pressures and significant co-seismic weakening. While thermal pressurization has been studied theoretically for many decades, and has been invoked in recent earthquake simulations, its activation in laboratory experiments has remained elusive. Several high-speed friction experiments yield indirect evidence for thermal pressurization, yet none have directly linked with existing theoretical models or the relevant physical parameters -- such as permeability, slip, and slip rate – that control the weakening rate. \nWe are conducting thermal pressurization experiments on fluid-saturated, low-permeability rocks (primarily Fredrick diabase; also SAFOD gouge) at slip rates up to ~5 mm/s, with constant confining pressures in the range 21–149 MPa and initial pore pressures in the range 10–25 MPa. The impractically low permeability of the diabase, ~10-23 m2, is increased prior to the friction test by thermally cracking the samples, yielding measured permeabilities in the range 1.3*10-18 to 6.1*10-19 m2. These permeabilites are high enough to allow sample saturation over one to several days, but also low enough to confine pore pressure rises during rapid sliding and allow thermal pressurization to occur. In recent experiments we also embed a thermocouple ~1–2 mm from the sliding surface, and use the resulting data to calibrate a finite element model that calculates the sliding surface temperature. \nOne experiment revealed a rapid decay of shear stress by ~25% following a step-change in velocity from 10 μm/s to 4.8 mm/s. For the first 28 mm of slip the experimentally measured shear stress agrees closely with the theoretical solution for slip on a plane (Rice [2006]) with an inferred slip weakening distance of ~500 mm, which is in the range predicted by inserting laboratory determined rock and fluid properties into the formula for L* from Rice [2006]. Deviations from the theoretical prediction occur at larger displacements since the experimental sample is not a semi-infinite half space, as assumed in the theoretical model, and heat is lost to the high-conductivity steel of the sample assembly. To our knowledge this is the best experimental validation of thermal pressurization to date.",

Over land, ~70% of high quality AOD retrievals at 0.55 µm are within the C5 expected error bounds, which is comparable to C5; however, a slight overestimation of AOD at low optical depths and a slight underestimation at high optical depths that was observed in C5 has been eliminated in C6. The highest agreement with AERONET occurs in the Eastern U.S. and Europe. Regions with large surface reflectance, such as the Western U.S., or higher aerosol loading, including much of Africa and South America, remain a challenge. Over ocean, the inclusion of wind speed in the surface characterization has removed a wind speed dependant bias, and globally, ~63% of high quality AOD retrievals at 0.55 µm are within the C5 expected error bounds.

            "abstract": "Green roofs are a sustainable urban development solution that incorporates a growing media (also known as substrate) and vegetation into infrastructures to reach additional benefits such as the reduction of: rooftop runoff peak flows, roof surface temperatures, energy utilized for cooling/heating buildings, and the heat island effect. The substrate is a key component of the green roof that allows achieving these benefits. It is an artificial soil that has an improved behavior compared to natural soils, facilitating vegetation growth, water storage and typically with smaller densities to reduce the loads over the structures. Therefore, it is important to study the effects of substrate properties on green roof performance. The objective of this study is to investigate the physical properties of four substrates designed to improve the behavior of a green roof, and to study their impact on the efficiency of a green roof. The substrates that were investigated are: organic soil; crushed bricks; a mixture of mineral soil with perlite; and a mixture of crushed bricks and organic soil. The thermal properties (thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity and thermal diffusivity) were measured using a dual needle probe (Decagon Devices, Inc.) at different saturation levels, and the hydraulic properties were measured with a constant head permeameter (hydraulic conductivity) and a pressure plate extractor (water retention curve). This characterization, combined with numerical models, allows understanding the effect of these properties on the hydraulic and thermal behavior of a green roof. Results show that substrates composed by crushed bricks improve the thermal insulation of infrastructures and at the same time, retain more water in their pores. Simulation results also show that the hydraulic and thermal behavior of a green roof strongly depends on the moisture content prior to a rainstorm.",

Recent studies indicated that the friction behaviors of fault gouge materials under oscillatory shear are different from those under monotonic shear. Experimental results revealed that the accelerating and decelerating motion caused weakening and strengthening, while undergoing overall slip weakening. In this study, we try to approximate the temporal variation of friction coefficient during accelerating/decelerating slip based on a velocity-displacement dependent friction law derived from monotonic rotary shear tests. The approximated results show a full strength recovery behavior when the slip velocity equals to zero, which cannot depict the experimental results.

            "abstract": "The goal of this study is to deepen the understanding of past changes in Central Asia, a climate sensitive region located at the intercept of large scale atmospheric circulation systems of which no pre-Holocene records exist so far. A ca. 10 m sediment core with a basal age of ca. 30 ka BP was drilled at Lake Karakul (Tajikistan), a large closed brackish lake situated in a tectonic basin at an altitude of 3,928 m. The lake catchment may be classified as alpine steppe to alpine desert with mean annual temperature and precipitation of ca. -3.9 °C and 82 mm, respectively. We applied a multi-proxy approach which combines inorganic and organic geochemical parameters. δ13C and δ18O values of authigenic carbonates show comparable trends with two pronounced episodes of depleted values at ca. 17.5 ka BP and 24 ka BP. These are indicative for fluctuations within the hydrological cycle and periods of low primary productivity which could have occurred synchronous to Northern Hemispheric climate events H1 and H2. Total organic carbon contents and organic biomarker concentrations are low during the glacial and rapidly increase to Holocene levels between ca. 14 and 11 ka BP. Biomarker fingerprints of aliphatic compounds are mostly dominated by mid-chain n-alkanes with δ13C values up to -14‰ which suggest a primarily aquatic origin. Terrestrial long-chain n-alkanes are mainly abundant during the late glacial to Holocene transition, possibly introduced by enhanced meltwater input during deglaciation. Their hydrogen isotopic variability is ca. 50‰ with constant depletion from ca. 19 to 10 ka BP. This is reflected by generally higher average δD values of aquatic n-alkanes throughout the glacial compared to Holocene values. Effective moisture variations alone cannot explain this offset. We suggest that changes in atmospheric circulation dynamics, origin of water vapour and source water for lipid synthesis (i.e. meltwater vs. precipitation) are the reasons for the observed isotopic shift at the late glacial to Holocene transition.",

            "abstract": "The largest earthquake to be recorded in Yellowstone in over 30 years, a magnitude 4.8 earthquake, occurred on March 30, 2014 near the Norris Geyser Basin on the NW side of the 0.64 Ma Yellowstone caldera. The earthquake was felt throughout Yellowstone and the surrounding region. We analyze this unusual event using data from the Yellowstone Seismic and Geodetic networks in the context of active volcanic-tectonic processes of the Yellowstone volcanic system and its relationship to regional swarm seismicity and crustal deformation. Moment tensor analysis of the March 30 earthquake revealed a strike-slip, double-couple source mechanism with no isotropic contribution. This earthquake was part of a larger sequence of earthquake swarm activity in the Norris Geyser Basin area that began in September 2013 and continued into June 2014. During that period, 50-60% of the total seismicity recorded in Yellowstone, including nearly all of the swarm seismicity (earthquakes clustered in time and space), occurred in the Norris Geyser Basin area. In addition, GPS derived deformation data revealed unusually high uplift rates at ~15 cm/yr in the Norris area prior to the MW4.8 event, while a dramatic reversal to subsidence at rates of ~20 cm/yr occurred after the event. Regionally, the much larger Yellowstone caldera had experienced subsidence since January 2010 at rates of ~1.5 cm/yr prior to the MW4.8 event. After March 30, 2014 the caldera reversed to regional uplift at rates of ~10 cm/yr, similar to accelerated uplift rates observed in mid-2004.",

            "abstract": "The 11 March 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Mw=9.0) produced large displacements of ~50 meters near the Japan Trench. In order to understand earthquake propagation and slip stabilization in this environment, quantitative values of the real elastic properties of fault zones and their surrounding wall rock material is crucial. Because elastic and mechanical properties of faults and wallrocks are controlling factors in fault strength, earthquake generation and propagation, and slip stabilization, an understanding of these properties and their depth dependence is essential to understanding and accurately modeling earthquake rupture. In particular, quantitatively measured S-wave speeds, needed for estimation of elastic properties, are scarce in the literature. We report laboratory ultrasonic velocity measurements performed at elevated pressures, as well as the calculated dynamic elastic moduli, for samples of the rock surrounding the Tohoku earthquake principal fault zone recovered by drilling during IODP Expedition 343, Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST). We performed measurements on five samples of gray mudstone from the hanging wall and one sample of underthrust brown mudstone from the footwall. We find P- and S-wave velocities of 2.0 to 2.4 km/s and 0.7 to 1.0 km/s, respectively, at 5 MPa effective pressure. At the same effective pressure, the hanging wall samples have shear moduli ranging from 1.4 to 2.2 GPa and the footwall sample has a shear modulus of 1.0 GPa. While these values are perhaps not surprising for shallow, clay-rich subduction zone sediments, they are substantially lower than the 30 GPa commonly assumed for rigidity in earthquake rupture and propagation models [e.g., Ide et al., 1993; Liu and Rice, 2005; Loveless and Meade, 2011]. In order to better understand the elastic properties of shallow subduction zone sediments, our measurements from the Japan Trench are compared to similar shallow drill core samples from the Nankai Trough, Costa Rica, Cascadia, and Barbados ridge subduction zones. We find that shallow subduction zone sediments in general have similarly low rigidity. These data provide important ground-truth values that can be used to parameterize fault slip models addressing the problem of shallow, tsunamigenic propagation of megathrust earthquakes.",

During the winter and spring of 2014, we collaborated with the Schmidt Ocean Institute to conduct a detailed bathymetric mapping and geophysical survey of the PMNM on board the R/V Falkor. On two cruises, we collected 14,585 km of gravity data using UNOL's BGM-3 marine gravimeter and magnetic data with the University of Hawaii's G-882 cesium magnetometer. We will present these new data paired with\u0004 a select set of \u0005existing NGDC marine geophysical data. Using these new gravity and magnetics data, we will investigate the internal density structures of these seamounts and the oceanic lithosphere upon which they were emplaced. The locations and volumes of the dense intrusive magmatic centers and rift zone dike complexes of these seamounts will be determined to investigate whether the ratio of intrusive to extrusive volume varies with time and volcano size. One of the largest rift zones of Hawaiian volcanoes is that of the St. Rogatien volcano ( ~125 km in length), and preliminary results from the Bouguer gravity anomaly suggest it is largely made of a dense dike complex. This rift zone, and other long rifts within the Monument will be compared to and contrasted with previously studied rift zones in main Hawaiian Islands to more completely characterize \u0004these features\u0005 along the chain. Few volcanoes within the Monument that have been sampled. Some of these have yielded Cretaceous ages (e.g., O’Conner et al. 2013) and therefore it is unclear how many volcanoes within the Monument were formed by the Hawaiian mantle plume. The gravity data will be used to identify which of the undated seamounts are compensated by an uncharacteristically thin elastic plate and thus, did not form as a part of the hotspot chain. These results will help refine models of Hawaiian mantle plume productivity through time, absolute plate motion, and better define the volcanic loads for studying the rheology of the flexing lithosphere beneath these volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "Streamflow characteristics are known to be sensitive to changes in climate, but few continuous records of flooding exist to evaluate the response of hydrological systems to centennial- and millennia-scale climate changes. Here, we present sedimentary records from two oxbow lakes (Horseshoe Lake and Grassy Lake, Illinois, USA) in the central Mississippi River valley (CMRV) that display abrupt shifts in sediment composition and particle-size consistent with deposition by floodwaters immediately following inundation of the floodplain. The sedimentary record at Horseshoe Lake begins ca. AD 100 and displays five major flood events, with four of these occurring after ca. AD 1100. Situated 200 km downstream, the record from Grassy Lake begins later, ca. AD 800, and also shows four major flood events after ca. AD 1100. An analysis of synchronicity using Bayesian age modelling software shows high likelihoods that the four overlapping flood events occurred at the same time, confirming that these events resulted from flooding of the Mississippi River. The most recent event we record at AD 1840 ± 50 corresponds to the AD 1844 flood, the largest flood by discharge (37 m3/s) measured by the gauging station at St. Louis, Missouri, indicating that our sedimentary records document high magnitude flood events.\nTogether, our two sedimentary records show a major shift in the frequency of high magnitude flooding in the central Mississippi River at ca. AD 1100. From AD 100 – AD 1100, only one relatively subtle flood event is recorded, but from AD 1100 – AD 1900, four high magnitude floods deposited distinctive sediment at both sites. The period of infrequent flooding corresponds to a time of agricultural intensification and population growth in the CMRV, while the entire region was abandoned when flood frequency increased. The pronounced shift in flood frequency we observe in our records at ca. AD 1100 begins during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; AD 950 – AD 1250), a period of warmer and drier conditions in the central USA, but persists through the Little Ice Age (LIA; AD 1400 – AD 1700), when cooler and wetter conditions prevailed in this region, suggesting that the occurrence of high magnitude floods may be controlled by seasonal climatic parameters that remain poorly represented in proxy-based reconstructions and modeled projections.",

Successful identification and characterization of these molecules relies on the sample-processing techniques utilized alongside state-of-the-art detection and analysis. For mass and power restrictions put on space exploration missions, smaller and more efficient instruments are highly desirable. The RF micro-reactor potentially offers a simplified alternative to the typical gold-standard extractions that often use solvents, chemicals, and conditions that can vary wildly and depend on the targeted molecules. Instead, this instrument uses a single solvent ­— water — that can be “tuned” under the different experimental conditions, leveraging the operating principles of the Sub-Critical Water Extractor. Proof-of-concept experiments examining the hydrolysis of glycosidic and peptide bonds were successful in demonstrating the RF micro-reactor’s capabilities. Progress toward coupling the reactor with a micro-scale sample-handling system enabling slurry delivery has been made and preliminary results on heterogeneous reactions and extractions will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The ~90 ppmv increase in atmospheric CO2 over the last deglaciation was most likely driven by changes in the way the high latitude oceans regulate the exchange of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) between the ocean and atmosphere, however the mechanisms involved in this repartitioning remain unclear. The subarctic Pacific Ocean is currently a significant source of CO2 to the atmosphere due to mixing of DIC-rich intermediate waters into the surface ocean and incomplete nutrient utilisation. It is hypothesised that during the last glacial period, greater stratification in the high latitudes, including the subarctic Pacific, reduced CO2 outgassing and increased DIC storage within the deep ocean. During deglaciation, a breakdown in ocean stratification returned the deeply sequestered DIC back to the surface ocean and atmosphere.\nWe present a new deglacial record of carbonate ion concentration [CO32-] and bottom water temperature from the intermediate to deep subarctic Pacific Ocean based on paired Li/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios in benthic foraminifera Uvigerina senticosa from marine sediment core MD01-2416 (51.268°N, 167.725°E, 2317 m water depth). The data indicate a decrease in [CO32-] within the intermediate-deep waters of ~40 µmol/kg during glacial times, equivalent to a ~150 µmol/kg increase in DIC using modern alkalinity. At ~16 ka, an increase in [CO32-], coeval with warmer bottom waters and an increase in benthic ∆14C, denotes a transfer of DIC out of the intermediate-deep subarctic Pacific Ocean. Boron isotopes measured on planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (s) in the same core show surface waters in the subarctic Pacific had a higher pH during glacial times, and a reduction in pH over deglaciation. This trend supports the hypothesis that CO2 outgassing from the subarctic Pacific was reduced during the last glacial and increased during deglaciation.",

One hypothesis relating to the volcanicity that results in such eruptions require fast ascent to allow gas to remain within the magma, resulting in fragmentation. In unmonitored eruptions the prevailing method to determine ascent rates is to compare microlite textures of experimental and natural samples. We are investigating two mafic Plinian eruptions of the Chikurachki volcano, one from 1853 and an ancient eruption. Preliminary microlite texture analyses showed a notable difference between the two eruptions. Through comparing textures with that of previously analyzed mafic Plinian eruptions, one has shown a similarity to the Fontana deposit of Masaya volcano while the other a similarity to the 122 B.C.E. Mt. Etna eruption. This suggests that the ascent histories of the two mafic Plinian eruptions being studied at Chikurachki volcano are different. This also suggest the cause of the variance in the two eruptions is more complicated than a simple rapid ascent. More work is required on all known mafic Plinian eruptions to try and determine how the magma is able to erupt so explosively.",

            "abstract": "The interest in approaches that allow the estimation of pollutant source release in groundwater has increased exponentially over the last decades. This is due to the large number of groundwater reclamation procedures that have been carried out: the remediation is expensive and the costs can be easily shared among the different actors if the release history is known. Moreover, a reliable release history can be a useful tool for predicting the plume evolution and for minimizing the harmful effects of the contamination. In this framework, Woodbury and Ulrych (1993, 1996) adopted and improved the minimum relative entropy (MRE) method to solve linear inverse problems for the recovery of the pollutant release history in an aquifer. In this work, the MRE method has been improved to detect the source release history in 2-D aquifer characterized by a non-uniform flow-field. The approach has been tested on two cases: a 2-D homogeneous conductivity field and a strong heterogeneous one (the hydraulic conductivity presents three orders of magnitude in terms of variability). In the latter case the transfer function could not be described with an analytical formulation, thus, the transfer functions were estimated by means of the method developed by Butera et al. (2006). In order to demonstrate its scope, this method was applied with two different datasets: observations collected at the same time at 20 different monitoring points, and observations collected at 2 monitoring points at different times (15-25 monitoring points). The data observed were considered affected by a random error. These study cases have been carried out considering a Boxcar and a Gaussian function as expected value of the prior distribution of the release history. The agreement between the true and the estimated release history has been evaluated through the calculation of the normalized Root Mean Square (nRMSE) error: this has shown the ability of the method of recovering the release history even in the most severe cases. Finally, the forward simulation has been carried out by using the estimated release history in order to compare the true data with the estimated one: the best agreement has been obtained in the homogeneous case, even if also in the heterogenous one the nRMSE is acceptable.",

            "abstract": "In central Wisconsin, irrigation use has dramatically increased over the last several decades. This increase has given rise to concerns over impacts to surface waters from groundwater pumping. We instrumented an irrigated field and a nearby prairie to assess those impacts and compare hydrogeologic responses. The hydrogeology of the two sites is similar, a layered system of 10 meters of sand over 2 to 3 meters of clay and silt over 30 meters of sand. The clay and silt is a recognized geologic unit, the New Rome Formation. Although the New Rome Formation is found over an area of 160 km2, little is known about its hydrogeologic properties. We used poroelastic responses and near-surface geophysics, in addition to traditional hydrogeologic tools such as pumping tests and sediment characterization, to assess the hydrogeologic parameters of the New Rome and the upper and lower sands.\nThe instrumentation consisted of piezometers in all three layers and pumping wells above and below the New Rome. We observed a head decrease of 1.1 meters across the New Rome. We conducted pumping tests using the wells above and below the New Rome. When pumping from below the New Rome, we observed the Noordbergum effect, a small transitory head increase of 4 cm in the New Rome and 1.5 cm in the shallow piezometer above. The piezometer in the deep sand aquifer showed around 30 cm of drawdown during this pumping. We also conducted a loading test on the New Rome. We backed a truck mounted drill rig over the piezometer and monitored the response. We saw a head increase of 1.3 cm that dissipated in around 3 minutes. These responses were modeling using a coupled poroelastic model. We also collected ground penetrating radar data that can be used to identify the depositional model for the New Rome and the overlying sand aquifer. These results all suggest that the New Rome is behaving like an aquitard at this site with a vertical hydraulic conductivity that varies with depth and location.\nThis new understanding of the hydrogeologic characteristics of a regional aquitard in an area of increased water use is essential for estimating and communicating the impacts of the increased water use. For example, we can better estimate the impacts to surface waters from groundwater pumping for irrigation if we know the role that the New Rome aquitard plays in the regional flow system.",

            "abstract": "Gridded data of 100-yr (1%) and 500-yr (0.2%) storm surge flood elevations for the United States, Gulf of Mexico, and East Coast are critical to understanding this natural hazard. Storm surge heights were calculated across the study area utilizing SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model data for thousands of synthetic US landfalling hurricanes. Based on the results derived from SLOSH, a series of interpolations were performed using spatial analysis in a geographic information system (GIS) at both the SLOSH basin and the synthetic event levels. The result was a single grid of maximum flood elevations for each synthetic event. This project addresses the need to utilize extreme value theory in a geospatial environment to analyze coincident cells across multiple synthetic events. The results are 100-yr (1%) and 500-yr (0.2%) values for each grid cell in the study area.\nThis talk details a geospatial approach to move raster data to SciPy’s NumPy Array structure using the Python programming language. The data are then connected through a Python library to an outside statistical package like R to fit cell values to extreme value theory distributions and return values for specified recurrence intervals. While this is not a new process, the value behind this work is the ability to keep this process in a single geospatial environment and be able to easily replicate this process for other natural hazard applications and extreme event modeling.",

In this study an attempt has been made to compute GC using temperature and salinity observations from Expendable Bathy Thermograph (XBT) and CTD over Bay of Bengal (BoB). Although in recent time we have Argo observations but it is for a limited period and coarse temporal resolutions. In BoB Bengal, where not enough simultaneous hydrographic temperature and salinity data are available with reasonable spatial resolution (~one degree spatial resolution) and for a longer period. To overcome the limitations of GC computed from XBT profiles, temperature-salinity relationships were used from simultaneous temperature and salinity observations. We have demonstrated that GCs can be computed with an accuracy of less than 8.5 cm/s (root mean square error) at the surface with respect to temperature from XBT and salinity from climatological record. This error reduces with increasing depth. Finally, we demonstrated the application of this approach to study the temporal variation of the GCs during 1992 to 2012 along an XBT transect.",

            "abstract": "Ground based interferometric radar (GBIR) measurements of localized surface deformation may be sought-after in various geosciences applications. The University of Missouri (MU) GBIR system is highly portable; moreover, it can be removed and re-positioned at the same point with geodetic-grade precision for long-term and repeat surveys. Initial quick-look imagery at C-band and Ku-band may be viewed in near real-time at the study site. Polarimetric calibration, radiometric calibration, and time-series analysis may further enhance the imagery. The MU GBIR has demonstrated millimeter and better sensitivity to localized surface deformation.\nUsing real-aperture imaging and precision rotation, the MU GBIR acquires data by deploying three antennas that may be mounted parallel to one another on a 1-meter high tower. During typical operation, images are acquired by azimuthally rotating the GBIR antennas about its vertical axis. During deployment, the fast imaging capabilities allow a data collect scan in about 20 seconds for a 180 degree field of view.\nDuring the 2013 and 2014 field seasons using the MU GBIR, several locations were studied. The study sites include a rockfall experiment in Colorado, several dams in Kansas and Missouri, and a rock glacier in southern Colorado. Study results and additional progress will be presented.

            "abstract": "Shemansky et al. (2009, Planetary and Space Science 57: 1659-1670) have reported observations of hydrogen atoms flowing out of the top of Saturn’s sunlit thermosphere in a confined, distinct plume of ballistic and escaping orbits, and a continuous distribution of H atoms from the top of Saturn’s atmosphere to at least 45 Saturn radii (RS) in the satellite orbital plane and to 25 RS azimuthally above and below the plane. These observations have revealed the importance of the excitation of H2 by low energy electrons. H2 is efficiently excited to the triplet states by low energy electrons, and all triplet excitations result in the dissociation of H2 and the production of hot H atoms. Because of this, the electron impact excitation of H2 is an important energy deposition mechanism in the upper atmospheres of Saturn and other giant planets. The a 3Σg+ – b 3Σu continuum transition, which dominates all other H2 transitions in the 168-190 nm region, provides a unique spectral window through which the triplet transition can be observed with the Cassini spacecraft. The excitation and emission cross sections of the a 3Σg+ state and other triplet states are required for the extraction of the triplet emission and excitation rates from the apparent emission rate measured by the spacecraft. These emission and excitation rates, in turn, help to determine the energy deposition rate by electron impact excitation.\nUnfortunately, large discrepancies exist between published measurements of the a 3Σg+ – b 3Σu continuum transition. In order to begin to address this issue, we have recently revisited the problem by measuring electron impact induced a 3Σg+ – b 3Σu emission cross sections. We have also measured direct excitation cross sections of the triplet a 3Σg+ state. Using these, we are able to partition the excitation function into its direct and cascade components. As stated above, these results will enable improved understanding of phenomena observed in Saturn’s atmosphere.\nAcknowledgement: This work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

            "abstract": "Science data files are generally written to serve well-defined purposes for a small science teams. In many cases, the organization of the data and the metadata are designed for custom tools developed and maintained by and for the team. Using these data outside of this context many times involves restructuring, re-documenting, or reformatting the data. This expensive and time-consuming process usually prevents data reuse and thus decreases the total life-cycle value of the data considerably. If the data are unique or critically important to solving a particular problem, they can be modified into a more generally usable form or metadata can be added in order to enable reuse. This augmentation process can be done to enhance data for the intended purpose or for a new purpose, to make the data available to new tools and applications, to make the data more conventional or standard, or to simplify preservation of the data. The HDF Group has addressed augmentation needs in many ways: by adding extra information, by renaming objects or moving them around in the file, by reducing complexity of the organization, and sometimes by hiding data objects that are not understood by specific applications. In some cases these approaches require re-writing the data into new files and in some cases it can be done externally, without affecting the original file.

            "abstract": "Spatial heterogeneity plays a key role in determining physical and geochemical processes in geological systems. In reactive fractures, mineral reactions also can alter fracture properties locally, therefore leading to evolving spatial heterogeneity. Here we use two-dimensional (2D) reactive transport modeling to 1) understand the evolving spatial heterogeneity due to the preferential dissolution of carbonate and 2) quantify the dependence of calcite dissolution on characteristics of spatial heterogeneity, including fracture roughness (i.e., aperture standard derivation, surface parameter and fractal dimension), flow connectivity (i.e., ratio of effective permeability keff over geometric mean of local permeability kG), and transport connectivity indicators (e.g., ratio of late 5% arrival time tlate5% over average arrival time tave). The fractured core samples from Brady’s Hot Springs geothermal field are composed of primarily carbonate, clay, and quartz. The computational domains were set up using fracture images obtained from CT scanning at the resolution of 31.6 μm. The two samples have similar initial average aperture, porosity, permeability, and mineralogical composition. They differ in the spatial patterns: one has narrow large-aperture zones distributed widely (AD sample); the other has a major large-aperture zone in the middle of the sample (AC sample).\nSimulation results show that highly connected flow path forms quickly in the AD sample, leading to an increase of average chemical aperture, effective permeability, and flow velocity by five times after 75 days of injecting salt water. In contrast, these properties remain constant in the AC sample. Other parameters that quantitatively characterize the spatial heterogeneity, including connectivity and the tail slope of the breakthrough curves, also change dramatically, indicating major alteration in fracture properties due to calcite dissolution.",

            "abstract": "Only few catchments in the Andean mountain range are currently monitored. Most basins in the region remain ungauged, and as a result, little knowledge is available on the processes governing their hydrological behavior. In particular, despite the importance of tropical alpine grasslands of the northern Andes (commonly known as the páramo) as providers of abundant high-quality water for downstream populations as well as a variety of other environmental services, very little is known about their hydrologic functioning. To improve this situation, an analysis of 1) the isotopic signature of oxygen-18, and 2) the relations between various landscape attributes and hydrologic behavior in the Zhurucay River experimental catchment (7.53 km2) was conducted. The catchment is located in southern Ecuador between 3200 and 3900 m a.s.l. The isotopic analysis was conducted in water samples collected in rainfall, streamflow, and soils. The influence of soil type, vegetation cover, catchment area, geology, and topography on runoff coefficient, and streamflow rates was investigated using linear regression analysis. Results reveal that water yield accounts for a high percentage of the water budget; runoff coefficient, and high and moderate streamflow rates are highly correlated with the extent of Histosols soils (Andean páramo wetlands), and increase with catchment size; and low streamflow rates are highly correlated with steep slopes. Results from the tracer analysis show that pre-event water stored in the Histosols is the primary source of runoff generation, demonstrating hydrologic connectivity between the Histosols (mainly located at the bottom of the valley) and the drainage network; while the most common soils, the Andosols (mainly located on the steep slopes), laterally drain the infiltrated rainfall recharging the lower situated Histosols. Overall, these findings depict that the combination of different methodologies for investigating hydrological processes at catchment scale provides a more complete understanding of the ecosystem’s hydrologic functioning. Moreover, in developing regions, such as the Andean region, acquiring better understanding of the origin and fate of water is a critical step towards the establishment of scientifically-based programs of management and conservation of water resources.",

            "abstract": "The mechanical deformation of an evaporite caprock with field-mapped meter-scale heterogeneities is modeled numerically. Evaporite caprocks can provide important barriers to CO2 migration. However, lithologic variability could alter caprock quality, reducing CO2 storage efficiency. Caprock deformation is driven by stresses induced by reservoir depletion and subsequent re-inflation. A method to consistently upscale the elastic properties of the caprock from a given two-dimensional geological map of the caprock is proposed. To assess the uncertainties associated with this homogenization approach, we present stress/strain patterns of finite-element models at the meter-scale, based on detailed high-resolution maps of exposures of evaporite successions at a subsurface outcrop. A case study of evaporite caprock is considered; specifically, a sequence of anhydrite in the Upper Jurassic Purbeck Beds, Weald basin, UK. Mechanical perturbations induced by CO2 injection are quantified using a mapped geometric model of the evaporite caprock containing meter-scale sedimentological heterogeneities, represented down to a cut-off size of five centimeters in the direction of maximum extension. The stratigraphic interval in the Purbeck Beds comprises a basal unit of gypsum and three rhythmic carbonate-anhydrite couplets. The mapped model is mirrored to the left and right to form a 15mx2.3m detailed geometric model of the sequence, subjected to tensile deformation. The thirteen mechanical layers include nodular anhydrite, algal limestone, shale, mudstone, satin spar veins, carbonate mud with anhydrite, and nodular gypsum. The central fine-grained carbonate mud layer is populated by hard anhydrite nodules, implicitly modeled as variations of the local Young’s modulus at a sub-mesh level, assumed to vary in density as a function of height. When applying tension to the detailed model, stress concentrations develop at material boundaries, and localize in the shale layers. Stress concentrations also emerge in the nodular anhydrite layer as a result of the contrast in elastic moduli. The modeled stresses do not exceed the locally assumed tensile strength. Upscaled anisotropic Young’s moduli and Poisson’s ratios, suitable for large-scale (≥100 m) CO2 injection models, are proposed for the studied caprock.",

            "abstract": "Tacaná (4100 m asl) is the northernmost volcano of the Central America Volcanic Arc. The volcano hosts a volcano-hydrothermal system that is manifested as a low-temperature fumarolic field at 3600 m asl and several groups of thermal springs principally located at the northwestern slopes of the volcanic edifice, at altitudes 1500 - 2000 m asl. These thermal springs discharge SO4-HCO3-enriched water (up to 1 g/kg of each one) with temperatures in the 25-63°C range. There are two distinct groups of springs with a different chloride-temperature and chloride-sulfate correlations but with the same 87Sr/86Sr ratio (~0.7046±0.0002) indicating the same wall rock composition for different aquifers. On April 2014, we found a cold spring (Manantial Nuevo), located at an elevation ~500 m lower than the others and with a different chemical composition, that discharges Na-Cl-type water with Cl concentration of 1.4 g/l and Na+K concentration up to 1.5 g/l. This new spring forms a fourth group, representing a stratified geothermal aquifer.\nEach thermal spring feeds a thermal stream that flows into the main drainage of the area, Río Coatán. Solute and heat fluxes from thermal springs of Tacaná volcano are estimated by the chloride-inventory method. The total observed chloride discharge from the thermal springs is estimated as 14.8 g/s and the total measured heat output of ~9.5 MW. Considering a deep fluid temperature of 250°C, the corresponding advective heat transport from the deep reservoirs that feed these springs may be estimate as 26 MW. However, the total chloride output measured in the main drainage (Coatán river) is 4 times higher (~59 g/s) than the measured Cl output of all known thermal springs. This means that other, undiscovered, thermal discharges exist in the area and that the natural heat output through thermal springs at Tacaná is significantly higher and depends on the Cl content and temperatures of the unknown thermal water discharges. If chloride concentration in these unknown springs does not exceed 540 mg/l (the average analyzed Cl in Tacaná springs) and the discharge temperature is 50°C, then the natural heat output can be estimated at least as 22 MW and the corresponding advective heat transport as ~100 MW.",

Unfortunately, there remains a general lack of quantitative information pertaining to Cl regimes under a variety of land-use types and flow conditions. Hinkson Creek, located in Boone County, Missouri, was placed on the Missouri Department of Natural Resources 303(d) list of impaired waters in 1998 due to multiple stressors including Cl. A 4-yr study was initiated in 2010 to better understand the loading and persistence of Cl in Hinkson Creek and related implications for stream restoration. Using a scale-nested experimental watershed study design (n = 5 gauging sites), observed mean and maximum daily Cl was 25.0 and 247.7, 55.7 and 351.4, 78.1 and 1167.8, 74.7 and 1021.8 and 71.0 and 941.4 mg/l at forested, agricultural, suburban, and urban (n=2) gauging sites, respectively. Average daily flow was 0.75, 0.90, 1.40, 1.98, and 3.18 m3/s in forested, agricultural, suburban, and urban gauging sites, respectively. Daily Cl loading estimates were 1620, 4350, 9470, 12800 and 19400 kg/day for forested agricultural, rural, suburban, and urban gauging sites, respectively. Results indicate that current winter deicing practices by municipalities and homeowners in the HCW are contributing to year-round elevated chloride concentrations. This finding holds holding important implications for watershed management, aquatic ecosystem health, and stream restoration in the HCW and other developing mixed-land-use watersheds of the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) and elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "The goal of this work is to develop a new set of simulation tools for earthquake rupture dynamics based on state-of-the-art high-order, adaptive numerical methods capable of handling complex geometries. High-order methods are ideal for earthquake rupture simulations as the problems are wave-dominated and the waves excited in simulations propagate over distance much larger than their fundamental wavelength. When high-order methods are used for such problems significantly fewer degrees of freedom are required as compared with low-order methods. The base numerical method in our new software elements is a discontinuous Galerkin method based on curved, Kronecker product hexahedral elements. We currently use MPI for off-node parallelism and are in the process of exploring strategies for on-node parallelism. Spatial mesh adaptivity is handled using the p4est library and temporal adaptivity is achieved through an Adams-Bashforth based local time stepping method; we are presently in the process of including dynamic spatial adaptivity which we believe will be valuable for capturing the small-scale features around the propagating rupture front. One of the key features of our software elements is that the method is provably stable, even after the inclusion of the nonlinear frictions laws which govern rupture dynamics. In this presentation we will both outline the structure of the software elements as well as validate the rupture dynamics with SCEC benchmark test problems. We are also presently developing several realistic simulation geometries which may also be reported on. Finally, the software elements that we have designed are fully public domain and have been designed with tightly coupled, wave dominated multiphysics applications in mind. This latter design decisions means the software elements are applicable to many other geophysical and non-geophysical applications.",

            "abstract": "The Belmont Forum was initiated in 2009 by a sub group of the International Group of Funding Agencies for Global Change Research. The Belmont Challenge embodies the Forum’s central goal: to deliver knowledge needed for societies to take action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change. This is fostered through collaboration among scientists across the globe and by stressing the importance of co-production of knowledge associated with coupled natural and social systems. The Belmont Challenge was clearly aligned with other collective thinking processes within the research community and key knowledge users from intergovernmental bodies. Convergence of these efforts gave rise to the S&T Alliance for Global Sustainability and its initiative – Future Earth.\nCollaborative Research Actions, consisting primarily of multilateral research calls to address topics relevant to Future Earth, have been the main tool developed to address the Belmont Challenge and some early lessons emerged. First, obstacles faced by the Belmont Forum are similar to those met by scientists collaborating across traditional boundaries. Building shared languages and interests between various disciplines and across global cultures, remains difficult; this results in a persistent underestimation of the transformation required to move knowledge creation towards a truly global inter- and transdisciplinary science. Second, the diversity of organizations, cultures and practices within the Belmont Forum is the main source of its creativity and its challenges. While some convergence is needed to build coherent strategies and work efficiently together, diversity is necessary to design actions suitable for all partners regardless of their national research system and science-policy priorities. Finding the right trade-offs is a learning process that Future Earth is also facing; thus both initiatives are not only linked through funding relations but also through strongly intertwined learning curves.",

The present work discusses the sudden disturbances observed in the major ionospheric parameters, such as in the E-region current system as obtained from ground based magnetometer observations near magnetic equator, and at low and mid-latitude stations. A strong intensification of the eastward Equatorial Electrojet (EEJ) was observed over Peru. The dayside ionosphere showed an abrupt increase of the Total Electron Content (TEC) over South America, especially over the low latitude region, due to the flare enhanced ionizing solar radiation flux. In this work we have used the Sheffield University Plasmasphere-Ionosphere Model (SUPIM) to model the TEC enhancement as arising from the flare enhanced solar EUV flux and soft X-rays. The simulation results are compared with the observational data to validate our results. The overall results can significantly advance our knowledge of ionospheric photochemistry and dynamics to improve our predictive capability on the low latitude ionospheric response to solar flares.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake hazard and risk models often assume that earthquake rates can be represented by a stationary Poisson process, and that aftershocks observed in historical seismicity catalogs represent a deviation from stationarity that must be corrected before earthquake rates are estimated. Algorithms for classifying individual earthquakes as independent mainshocks or as aftershocks vary widely, and analysis of a single catalog can produce considerably different earthquake rates depending on the declustering method implemented. As these rates are propagated through hazard and risk models, the modeled results will vary due to the assumptions implied by these choices. In particular, the removal of large aftershocks following a mainshock may lead to an underestimation of the rate of damaging earthquakes and potential damage due to a large aftershock may be excluded from the model.\nWe present a case study based on the 1907 – 1911 sequence of nine 6.9 <= Mw <= 7.9 earthquakes along the Cocos – North American plate subduction boundary in Mexico in order to illustrate the variability in risk under various declustering approaches. Previous studies have suggested that subduction zone earthquakes in Mexico tend to occur in clusters, and this particular sequence includes events that would be labeled as aftershocks in some declustering approaches yet are large enough to produce significant damage. We model the ground motion for each event, determine damage ratios using modern exposure data, and then compare the variability in the modeled damage from using the full catalog or one of several declustered catalogs containing only “independent” events. We also consider the effects of progressive damage caused by each subsequent event and how this might increase or decrease the total losses expected from this sequence.",

Large differential stresses may cause fractures to dilate and become more permeable due to opening mode displacement or shear displacement along irregular surfaces. Topographic perturbations of the regional tectonic stress fields have been shown to be large enough to influence the distribution of fractures in the subsurface. Previous studies of topographically influenced stress distributions have suffered from a lack of spatially continuous characterization of the subsurface fracture distribution. Here we compare stress models that account for both topography and the regional stress fields to seismic velocity profiles. We find a strong correlation between failure potential, a normalized measure of differential stress, and the near surface seismic velocity structure. This correlation suggests that critical zone architecture is, to a first order, controlled by topographic perturbations of the regional stress field.",

Previous studies have hypothesized that changes in atmospheric circulation have increased deep-water, onshore Ekman transport in the Amundsen Sea, bringing warm ocean currents to the base of the glaciers. This change in ocean currents is considered to be the primary cause for the thinning of the glaciers.\nThis study evaluates 35 years (1979 to 2013) of the ERA-Interim reanalysis to identify significant changes in the atmospheric circulation of the Amundsen Sea region. The method of self-organizing maps (SOMs) is used to identify the dominant atmospheric circulation patterns in the region. The SOM methodology allows for identifying specific changes within the more general atmospheric circulation. Sea-level pressure, 10 m winds, and 500 hPa geopotential heights, along with additional secondary fields, are analyzed in this study to identify the significant changes in the atmospheric circulation. Relationships to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) climate indices, as well as sea ice extent are investigated to better characterize the atmospheric circulation across the region. Lastly, possible connections between the identified changes in atmospheric circulation and the thinning of the Amundsen Sea embayment glaciers will be presented.",

To help accelerate the realization of commercial-scale wave power, predictive modeling tools have been developed and utilized to evaluate the likelihood of environmental impact.\nAt present, direct measurements of the effects of different types of WEC arrays on nearshore wave propagation are not available; therefore wave model simulations provide the groundwork for investigations of the sensitivity of model results to prescribed WEC characteristics over a range of anticipated wave conditions. The present study incorporates a modified version of an industry standard wave modeling tool, SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore), to simulate wave propagation through a hypothetical WEC array deployment site on the California coast. The modified SWAN, referred to as SNL-SWAN, incorporates device-specific WEC power take-off characteristics to more accurately evaluate a WEC device’s effects on wave propagation.\nThe primary objectives were to investigate the effects of a range of WEC devices and device and array characteristics (e.g., device spacing, number of WECs in an array) on nearshore wave propagation using SNL-SWAN model simulations. Results showed that significant wave height was most sensitive to variations in WEC device type and size and the number of WEC devices in an array. Locations in the lee centerline of the arrays in each modeled scenario showed the largest potential changes in wave height. The SNL-SWAN model simulations for various WEC devices provide the basis for a solid model understanding, giving the confidence necessary for future WEC evaluations.",

In order to improve the vertical resolution of the density inversion result, 3D geological modeling method is used to build structural model for the inversion, prior constraint conditions can be applied to solve the non-unique problem.\nIn the Okinawa Trough, it is proved by earthquake data that the Philippine plate dives beneath the Okinawa Trough, which result in the upwelling of mantel material and decrease of the crust thickness. The Benioff zone clearly shows the plate’s subduction parameter, such as direction, dip, transformation. Therefore, a structural subduction model is created by geological modeling method and works as the initial model and as constraint condition in gravity inversion. The 3D gravity inversion result and seismology CMT data are both used to explain the oceanic lithosphere structure in the Okinawa Trough. The inversion result illustrates high density anomaly under the Okinawa Trough. Affected by small scale mantle convections, the continental lithosphere is separated, which result in the spreading of back-arc basin and the formation of the Okinawa Trough.",

            "abstract": "Understanding landscape re-organization under changing climatic forcing is fundamental to advancing our understanding of geomorphic transport laws under transient conditions, developing predictive models of landscape response to external perturbations, and interpreting the stratigraphic record for past climates by incorporating possible regime shifts. Real landscape observations for long-term analysis are limited and to this end a high resolution controlled laboratory experiment was conducted at the St. Anthony Falls laboratory at the University of Minnesota. Elevation data were collected at temporal resolution of 5 mins and spatial resolution of 0.5 mm as the landscape approached steady state (for a constant uplift and precipitation rate) and in the transient state (under the same uplift and 5x precipitation). The results reveal rapid topographic re-organization under a five-fold precipitation increase with the fluvial regime expanding into previously debris dominated regime, accelerated erosion happening at hillslope scales, and rivers shifting from an erosion-limited to a transport-limited regime. By studying the space-time structure of the individual erosional and depositional events in terms of their size, location, clustering, and total volume we report complex space-time patterns of change which are scale-dependent and bounded by the river network topology. At the same time, the river network topology itself adjusts at smaller scales, with new channels added to accommodate increased hillslope erosional transport, further adjusting the landscape. Some new ideas related to landscape variability and entropy evolution at different scales during steady and transient states and the possibility of analyzing the self-organization with Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) metrics to infer possible underlying “optimality” principles governing the re-organization will also be presented.",

The flow quantification at the interface merging the two hydrosystem components is a function of both surface and subsurface spatially distributed parameters.\nIn the present study, we apply inverse modeling techniques to a synthetic catchment with connected surface and subsurface hydrosystems. The model is physically-based and implemented with the Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis software. On the basis of hydrograph measurement at the catchment outlet, we estimate parameters such as saturated hydraulic conductivity, overland and channel roughness coefficients. We compare maximum likelihood estimates (ML) with the parameter distributions obtained using the Bayesian statistical framework for spatially random fields provided by the Method of Anchored Distributions (MAD). While ML estimates maximize the probability of observing the data and capture the global trend of the target variables, MAD focuses on obtaining a probability distribution for the random unknown parameters and the anchors are designed to capture local features. We check the consistency between the two approaches and evaluate the additional information provided by MAD on parameter distributions. We also assess the contribution of adding new types of measurements such as water table depth or soil conductivity to the reduction of parameter uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "The C/N ratio of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) is anomalously high compared to cosmochemical sources and this anomaly is likely a remnant of early cataclysmic events of either core formation or catastrophic atmospheric loss. However, this important ratio is subject to large uncertainties and the processes affecting it remain poorly understood. Recent estimates of the C/N mass ratio of the BSE range from 39 [1] to 313 [2]. Reconsideration of mantle C/N, with C derived from C/Nb and C/Ba ratios of oceanic basalts [3], combined with N derived from N/40Ar basalt ratios with the terrestrial K and Ar budgets, propagating all uncertainties, yields a revised C/N estimate of 42±12, which is ~2X greater than CI, CO, or CM chondrites, but plausibly similar to more degassed CV chondrites. N is a siderophile element, leading some to suggest that the N depletion of the BSE is owing to core formation, but C is more siderophile than N, suggesting that core formation cannot account for the high C/N of the BSE. Catastrophic atmospheric loss can account for high BSE C/N, assuming that primitive atmospheres were comparatively N-rich, as should be the case because, at least under oxidizing conditions, N is much less soluble in magma than C. However, core sequestration of volatile elements cannot be estimated from metal/melt partition coefficients alone; solubilities and atmospheric storage must also be considered. If the atmosphere overlying a magma ocean is oxidizing, N2 is much less soluble in magma than CO2, and so metal is separated from silicate that is already N-depleted, and core formation lowers BSE C/N. For a reduced atmosphere, the situation reverses: N is more soluble than C in the magma, and core/mantle/atmosphere partitioning can raise BSE C/N, even if C is much more siderophile than N. Similarly, catastrophic atmospheric loss will have opposite effects if the vapor is oxidized (low C/N vapor) or reduced (high C/N vapor). Thus, the significance of Earth’s anomalously high C/N cannot be determined without constraints on the chemical conditions prevailing during large scale vapor/silicate/metal. Finally, the CK chondrites remind us that some of the C/N fractionation could have occurred on precursors, prior to accretion. [1] Halliday (2013) GCA 105, 146-171. [2] Marty (2012) EPSL 313: 56-66.

            "abstract": "It had been worried about that very uneven heating on tidal-locking exoplanets in the habitable zone around M dwarfs would cause atmosphere and water frozen on the nightside of such exoplanets. Previous studies have demonstrated that atmospheric and oceanic circulations are able to transport sufficient heat to warm the nightside and prevent atmosphere collapse there. However, it remains a question of whether water could be completely frozen on the nightside. If it happens, it would cause exoplanets in the habitable zone of M dwarfs uninhabitable because liquid water on the dayside is essential for exoplanets’ habitability. Here, we apply a coupled atmospheric and oceanic general circulation model and a three-dimensional ice-sheet model to this problem. It is found that for an ocean planet surface winds drive sea ice toward the dayside and the ocean carries heat toward the nightside, both of which keep the nightside sea ice thin. Our results show that the thickness of nightside sea ice is only about 10 m or less. Thus, nightside water trapping on a water-world should not be significant. We also test whether a large ice sheet could grow on a nightside super-continent using an ice sheet model driven by the climate model output. We find that for weak precipitation generated by the climate model the ice-sheet thickness is strongly dependent on the geothermal heat flux, and could reach 1-2 km if the geothermal heat is similar to Earth's or lower. These suggest that tidal-locking exoplanets with low geothermal flux, continents that cover much of their surface area, and relatively shallow oceans may experience extended periods of dayside desiccation as plate tectonics drives continents onto the nightside, and that complete nightside water trapping would not happen if exoplanets have fairly deep and extensive oceans.",

            "abstract": "The moisture balance of the continental boundary layer plays an important role in regulating the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and atmosphere. Near-surface moisture balance is controlled by a number of factors including precipitation, infiltration and evapotranspiration. Measurements of stable isotope ratios in water can be exploited to better understand the mechanisms controlling atmosphere-land surface water fluxes. Understanding the processes that set sub-surface water isotope ratios can prove useful for refining paleoclimate interpretations of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope-based proxies. We present in situ tower-based measurements of stable isotope ratios of water (δD and δ18O) in vapor, precipitation and soil from the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory, a semi-arid tall-tower site in Erie, Colorado, from July 2012 to September 2014. Near surface profiles from 0 to 10 m were measured approximately every ninety minutes. Soil profiles from 0 to 30 cm, the region of maximum variability, were sampled on a weekly basis and cryogenically extracted for stable water isotope measurement. Evaporation-proof bulk rain collectors provided precipitation samples at this site.\nResults show disequilibrium exists between surface vapor and soil water isotopes, with the top 10 cm of soil water approaching equilibrium with the surface vapor right after a rain event because of high infiltration and saturation at the surface. At this semi-arid site with little vegetation, evaporative exchange is the main driver for soil water fluxes as the soil dries, corroborated by soil Dexcess profiles showing progressive enrichment through evaporation. In addition, when nighttime surface temperatures are cooler than deep soil, as is the case in many arid and semi-arid environments, upward vapor diffusion from the soil leads to dew formation at the surface which then contributes to surface vapor values. We use these observations to constrain a Craig-Gordon evaporation model at the land surface to weight the contributions of rainfall, surface water vapor exchange and sub-surface vapor diffusion to soil water isotope values. This has implications both for modeling short-term gas exchange at the land surface as well as for estimating past evaporative conditions from proxies like cave deposits and tree cellulose.",

            "abstract": "The crust of lava flows (of all compositions) is commonly folded into arcuate ridges, bent such that the convex ridges point down flow. In theory, the geometry of flow surface folds can be used to constrain the thickness and viscosity of the folding layer (from the fold wavelength) and the compressional stress (from the fold amplitude). Crustal thickness is controlled primarily by lava composition and extent of cooling. Therefore, lavas of more evolved compositions (higher silica content) have thicker crusts, which should generate surface folds with larger wavelengths.\nWe have determined the characteristic scale of surface folds using 1000m along-channel segments from Lidar-derived 3D Digital Terrain Models over a range of lava compositions (53-72 wt% SiO2). All profiles were analyzed by discrete Fourier transform (DFT) analysis in Matlab, used to determine the spatial scale of periodic surface features. The DFT periodograms produce 1D arrays of spectral density over a range of spatial frequencies, which describe the amplitude and spatial scale (wavelength) of lava surface topography. The DFT analysis allows for unbiased measurements of dominant surface fold wavelengths as well as identification of primary and secondary folds (i.e. folds within folds). Measurements of multiple fold generations are not possible from satellite images or in the field on intermediate to high silica blocky lavas.\nIn our analyses, strong signals of surface periodicities were found at multiple frequencies for all lava flows, indicating multiple generations of surface folds. Additionally, mafic to intermediate lavas (<60 wt% SiO2) show a positive correlation between dominant fold wavelengths and wt% silica. This correlation breaks down with high silica lavas (>65 wt% SiO2) which have a much larger range in dominant wavelength (10 - >100m). The deviation in expected dominant wavelengths for high silica flows is likely explained by effective viscosity, which is strongly influenced by lava crystallinity. Crystallization both adds solid particles to the lava, increasing the effective viscosity, and increases the silica content (and viscosity) of the remaining matrix melt. Therefore, dominant surface fold wavelengths likely increase with increasing effective viscosity, rather than more evolved compositions.",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of the detailed physical mechanisms that underlie erosion remains limited due to the complexity of the coupling between hydrodynamic shear, sediment transport, internal granular bed rearrangement, and bedform dynamics. In particular, it is unclear how the internal bed structure, including grain rearrangements, jamming, and force networks, affects bedform evolution and sediment transport. To address these questions, we perform experimental studies of shear flow across model granular beds in a recirculating laboratory flume. We monitor changes in the contour of the granular bed surface and in structural properties of the internal granular packing, and we examine the effects of varied fluid flow regimes and time scales on bed rearrangements.",

            "abstract": "The metamorphism of snow under advective air flow, with and without temperature gradient, was never experimentally investigated. We developed a new sample holder where metamorphism under advective conditions can be observed and measured using time-lapse micro-tomography [1]. Long-term experiments were performed and direct pore-level simulation (DPLS) [2,3] was directly applied on the extracted 3D digital geometry of the snow to calculate the effective transport properties by solving the governing fluid flow equations. The results showed no effect of isothermal advection, compared to rates typical for isothermal metamorphism. Appling a temperature gradient, the results showed increased snow metamorphism compared to rates typical for temperature gradient metamorphism. However, for both cases a change in the isotopic composition in the air as well as in the snow sample could be observed. These measurements could be influential to better understand snow-air exchange processes relevant for atmospheric chemistry and isotopic composition.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Ebner P.

            "abstract": "Introduction: Although still debated, spherule beds in the Barberton Mountain Land (~3.4 Ga) are suspected to represent remnants of impact-generated and ballistically emplaced silicate melt droplets [e.g. 1]. Such deposits provide the only window into the late stages of the heavy meteorite bombardment on Earth as their source craters have long since been obliterated. In order to identify a possible meteoritic component and, if successful, to discuss potential projectile materials, we are performing a detailed Os-W isotope as well as HSE abundance study on spherule layers from the recently drilled ICDP BARB5 core (grid location 25°30`50.76``S, 31°33`10.08``E).\nSamples and Methods: Samples were taken from a spherule-containing meta-sedimentary core section discovered between 510 and 512 m depth. About 100 mg of homogenized sample powders were spiked with a mixed 190Os, 185Re, 191Ir and 194Pt tracer and treated in a high pressure asher using inverse aqua regia, followed by conventional extraction schemes for Os and the other HSEs [4]. Chemical and Os isotope measurements (via N-TIMS) were performed in Vienna, whereas HSE measurements were undertaken via ICP MS in Bonn.\nResults and Discussion: Our preliminary Os isotope data reveal a trend between samples exhibiting high spherule to matrix ratios (187Os/188Os ~0.106 and Os ~0.4 ppm) and samples with lower ones (187Os/188Os up to ~0.304 and Os ~0.008 ppm). Notably, the most unradiogenic samples exhibit carbonaceous-chondrite-like initial 187Os/188Os and HSE ratios, whereas all other samples are clear non-chondritic. These findings support an extraterrestrial contribution in the spherules and can be interpreted compared to conclusions drawn from a Cr isotope study performed on similar samples [3], possibly representing a different impact event and favouring a chondritic projectile. However, further considerations based on precise Os/W ratio determinations and high-precision 182W isotope data, will be presented at the conference.\nAcknowledgements:We thank W.U. Reimold and T. Mohr-Westheide (Natural History Museum Berlin) for the BARB5 samples, which were obtained in an ICDP project.\n",

            "abstract": "The human and social dimensions of climate change are addressed in courses in humanities, social sciences, and arts disciplines. However, faculty members in these disciplines are not climate science experts and thus may feel uncomfortable discussing the science that underpins our understanding of climate change. In addition, many students are interested in the connections between climate change and their program of study, but not all students take courses that address climate science as a principal goal. At Gustavus Adolphus College, the Climate Science Project aims to help non-geoscience faculty introduce climate science content in their courses in order to increase climate science literacy among students and inform discussions of the implications of climate change.\nWe assembled an interdisciplinary team of faculty with climate science expertise to develop climate science modules for use in non-geoscience courses. Faculty from the social sciences, humanities, arts, education, and natural sciences attended workshops in which they developed plans to include climate science in their courses. Based on these workshops, members of the development team created short modules for use by participating faculty that introduce climate science concepts to a non-specialist audience. Each module was tested and modified prior to classroom implementation by a team of faculty and geoscience students. Faculty and student learning are assessed throughout the process, and participating faculty members are interviewed to improve the module development process.\nThe Climate Science Project at Gustavus Adolphus College aims to increase climate science literacy in both faculty members and students by creating accessible climate science content and supporting non-specialist faculty in learning key climate science concepts. In this way, climate science becomes embedded in current course offerings, including non-science courses, reaching many more students than new courses or enhanced content in the geosciences can reach. In addition, this model can be adopted by institutions with limited geoscience course offerings to increase geoscience literacy among a broad cross-section of students.",

            "abstract": "Development of offshore alternative energy production methods through the deployment of Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) devices (e.g. wave, tidal, and wind generators) in the United States continues at a rapid pace, with significant public and private investment in recent years. The installation of offshore MHK systems includes cabling to the shoreline and some combination of bottom foundation (e.g., piles, gravity bases, suction buckets) or anchored floating structure. Installation of any of this infrastructure at the seabed may affect coastal sediment dynamics. It is, therefore, necessary to evaluate the interrelationships between hydrodynamics and seabed dynamics and the effects of MHK foundations and cables on sediment transport. If sufficient information is known about the physical processes and sediment characteristics of a region, hydrodynamic and sediment transport models may be developed to evaluate near and far-field sediment transport. The ultimate goal of these models and methods is to quantitatively evaluate changes to the baseline seabed stability due to the installation of MHK farms in the water.\nThe objective of the present study is to evaluate and validate wave, current, and sediment transport models (i.e., a site analysis) that may be used to estimate risk of sediment mobilization and transport. While the methodology and examples have been presented in a draft guidance document (Roberts et al., 2013), the current report presents an overall strategy for model validation, specifically for a case study in the Santa Cruz Bight, Monterey Bay, CA. Innovative techniques to quantify the risk of sediment mobility has been developed to support these investigations. Public domain numerical models are utilized to estimate the near-shore wave climate (SWAN: Simulating Waves Near-shore) and circulation and sediment transport (EFDC: Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code) regimes. The models were validated with field hydrodynamic data. Sediment size information was provided by the USGS usSEABED sediment database program. Near-bottom current- and wave-induced shear stresses were computed and used directly to derive a sediment mobilization risk relationship.",

            "abstract": "Annual temperatures in subarctic regions are increasing, resulting in rapid disappearance of long-standing permafrost. This directly affects plant community structure, increases soil active layer thickness, and changes greenhouse gas emissions. The change in carbon cycling alters climate feedback cycles, calling for accurate, efficient, permafrost degradation monitoring techniques in Earth Systems models.\nAt Stordalen Mire, 68°21’N and 19°02’E, 50 randomized one-square meter plots were measured for vegetation composition and hyperspectral reflectance using an ASDinc FieldSpec4. Plots were classified into one of five site-types based on vegetation composition and microtopography, with each site type representing differing stages of permafrost degradation.\nA discrete forward multivariate model with stepwise selection successfully paired 49 of 49 plots with their site types using the reflectance values for the wavelengths centered at 1115nm, 1190nm, 1334nm, 1340nm, and 1813nm. These wavelengths correspond to reflectance features resulting from varying plant intercellular structure (1115nm, 1190nm), and particular in-cell air-water interactions (1334nm, and 1340nm 1813nm). A decision tree partitioning the reflectance feature at 1334nm across all site types resulted in a 4-split tree with an R2 of .793, and a 10-fold cross-validation R2 of .712.\nA discrete forward multivariate analysis model successfully paired 84% of plots with their correct site types using the percent cover of five dominant species (Empetrum nigrum, Eriophorum vaginatum, Rubus chamaemorus, Sphagnum spp, Open Water). A five-split partition of site type with these five dominant species returned an R2 of .893, and a five-fold cross-validation R2 of .859.\nA least squares regression model used 5 species-specific spectral bands distinguishing content of plant pigment, cell-water, and physical structure to predict percent cover of four primary species: E. nigrum (R2 .82), R. chamaemorus (R2 .64), Sphagnum spp. (R2 .92), and Open Water (R2 .79).\nResults indicate the usefulness of hyperspectral measurements for estimating vegetative composition. Continued work will examine field spectrometer measurements with those from the EO-1 Hyperion sensor in an effort to scale-up permafrost degradation monitoring.",

            "abstract": "River salinity is increasing in urban areas throughout the world, and can impact habitat for aquatic organisms. Riverine impairment cascades through the stream network based on the distribution of development and climate conditions that affect dilution capacity. We present a regional river network transport model that assimilates data from the Lotic Volunteer Temperature Electrical Conductivity and Stage (LoVoTECS) network in New Hampshire, USA. LoVoTECS is measuring high temporal resolution stream conductivity at over 100 sites spanning 6 stream orders and ranging from pristine to near complete imperviousness. Total upstream developed land area is a strong predictor of baseflow specific conductance across the region (r2=0.848, p<0.001, n=85). Empirical loading of dissolved solids from head-water specific conductance data, and characteristic storm dilution rates, are incorporated into a network scale transport model using the Framework for Aquatic Modeling in the Earth System (FrAMES). The model predicts specific conductance and derived Cl to develop a continuous spatial mapping of habitat degradation potential. The model performs well against LoVoTECS and USGS station data in high (5 – 7) order rivers with median residual of 7 μS cm-1 (9.5%), and RMSE of 25 μS cm-1 (12% of measured range). Summertime exceedances of EPA guidance for chloride (4 days above 230 mg Cl/L) are only predicted in small urban catchments. Potential thresholds for fish community shifts may be as low as 33 to 108 mg Cl/L (Morgan et al 2012), and exceedances of 108 mg Cl/L occur in low (1 – 2) order developed streams. In higher order (3 – 7) streams passing through New England urban centers, dilution from more pristine watershed areas moderates chloride concentration. However, exceedances of 33 mg Cl/L are common and 7th order reaches exceed this threshold more than lower order reaches due to local urban runoff and the downstream accumulation of dissolved solids. Further simulations will test the influence of changing winter temperatures, summer storm events, and build-out scenarios. Regional maps of predicted salt impairment will identify river reaches at highest risk for reduced aquatic biodiversity and locate communities that would engender greatest habitat improvement through mitigation activities.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) is a precursor for secondary particulate matter and a contributor to soil acidification and eutrophication when deposited to land and surface waters. Fertilizer application is a major source of atmospheric NH3, particularly in intensive agricultural regions such as the Midwestern U.S. Quantification of NH3 emission from fertilized crops remains highly uncertain, which limits the representativeness of NH3 emissions that are used in air quality models. A collaborative study to improve understanding of NH3 emission from fertilizer application focused on [1] measurement of above-canopy NH3 fluxes from a fertilized corn field in Illinois using the relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) and flux gradient methods and in-canopy fluxes with the inverse Lagrangian dispersion analysis method, [2] estimation of NH3 emissions at the regional scale using a process-based approach with available archived independent variables, and the currently used top-down approach, in order to compare and determine differences in predicted spatial and temporal variability of NH3 emissions, and [3] performance of spatial analysis to determine spatial and temporal patterns of ammonia emissions and relate them to independent variables characteristic of land use, soil, meteorology, and agricultural management practices. NH3 flux was measured over and within a maize canopy from pre-cultivation through senescence (May-September 2014) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Energy Biosciences Institute Energy Farm, and data from the field study was incorporated into models to facilitate connection of local emissions with the regional scale and to improve understanding of the processes that drive emission and deposition.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost-associated gas hydrate deposits exist at shallow depths within the sediments of the circum-Arctic continental shelves. Degradation of this shallow water reservoir has the potential to release large quantities of methane gas directly to the atmosphere. Gas hydrate stability and the permeability of the shelf sediments to gas migration is closely linked with submarine permafrost. Submarine permafrost extent depends on several factors, such as the lithology, sea level variations, mean annual air temperature, ocean bottom water temperature, geothermal heat flux, and the salinity of the pore water. The salinity of the pore water is especially relevant because it partially controls the freezing point for both ice and gas hydrate. Measurements of deep pore water salinity are few and far between, but show that deep off-shore sediments are fresh. Deep freshening has been attributed to large-scale topographically-driven submarine groundwater discharge, which introduces fresh terrestrial groundwater into deep marine sediments.\nWe investigate the role of submarine ground water discharge on the salinity field and its effects on the seaward extent of relict submarine permafrost and gas hydrate stability on the Arctic shelf with a 2D shelf-scale model based on the finite volume method. The model tracks the evolution of the temperature, salinity, and pressure fields given imposed boundary conditions, with latent heat of water ice and hydrate formation included. The permeability structure of the sediments is coupled to changes in permafrost. Results show that pore fluid is strongly influenced by the permeability variations imposed by the overlying permafrost layer. Groundwater discharge tends to travel horizontally off-shore beneath the permafrost layer and the freshwater-saltwater interface location displays long timescale transient behavior that is dependent on the groundwater discharge strength. The seaward permafrost extent is in turn strongly influenced by the salinity field and location of the freshwater-saltwater transition. Our results suggest that the role of salt transport and its effect on permafrost evolution can provide context for the interpretation of recent permafrost maps and methane observations in the Arctic.",

In the solar atmosphere, reconnection is considered a primary contributor of flare evolution and coronal heating. Directly observing reconnection occurring in the solar atmosphere, however, is not trivial considering that the scale size of the diffusion region is magnitudes smaller than the observational capabilities of current instrumentation, and coronal magnetic field measurements are not currently sufficient to capture the process. Meanwhile, reconnection occurring in the Earth's magnetosphere transfers energy from the solar wind through a comparable process, although on vastly different scales. Magnetospheric measurements are made in situ rather than remotely; ergo, comparison of observations between the two regimes allows for potentially significant insight into reconnection as a stochastic and possibly turbulent process. We will present a set of observations from long-duration solar events and compare them to in situ measurements from the magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "As part of the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HYSPIRI) preparation mission, the Airborne Visual Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) has over flown the Mono-Inyo Craters chain located in Mono County, California to study the geothermal potential of the area. Data was taken at a spatial scale of 15m, similar to that of the highest resolution Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) data. The Mono-Inyo Craters is a geologically young volcanic chain of 40 eruptive events, with the oldest eruptions dating to 40 Ka and the latest 200 years ago. Today 23 craters show exposure on the surface and vary from a more rhyolitic composition to a more basaltic composition in the north. This data shows spectral variability in the 1.0μm and 2.21μm absorption bands between volcanic centers. The 1.0μm absorption is attributed to iron and iron oxides and the 2.21μm to the Si-OH stretch likely due to the opalization of silica rich of volcanic materials. Such variation can be attributed to weathering of the exposed surface material within each crater. Older volcanic centers show a much deeper 2.21μm than younger volcanic centers. One exception to this is a volcanic dome known as the South Coulee. South Coulee is the location of a pumice mine that has exposed a fresh surface that has little to no weathering, and therefore a smaller 2.21μm band. We will show a correlation between crater exposure age and the 2.21μm band depth. On Mars weathering will take place at a slower pace, due to less water, but with much longer timescales such differences could still exist and be used to determine relative weathering and exposure ages of surfaces.",

            "abstract": "Numerical simulation models are increasingly used to estimate greenhouse gas emissions at site to regional / national scale and are outlined as the most advanced methodology (Tier 3) in the framework of UNFCCC reporting. Process-based models incorporate the major processes of the carbon and nitrogen cycle of terrestrial ecosystems and are thus thought to be widely applicable at various spatial scales. Regional inventories require high spatial resolution input data on soil properties, climate drivers and management information. The acceptance of model based inventory calculations depends on the assessment of the inventory’s uncertainty (model, input data and parameter induced uncertainties).\nIn this study we fully quantify uncertainty in regional N2O / NO3 inventory predictions from arable soils of Saxony (Germany) using the biogeochemical model LandscapeDNDC. We address model induced uncertainty (MU) by contrasting two different soil biogeochemistry modules in conjunction with two different plant growth descriptions within LandscapeDNDC. Input data induced uncertainty (DU) was addressed by Latin Hyper Cube sampling of soil properties, climate drivers and agricultural management practices. The parameter induced uncertainty (PU) was assessed by using a joint parameter distribution for key parameters describing microbial C and N turnover processes as obtained by a Bayesian calibration study. We representatively sampled different parameter vectors from the discrete joint parameter distribution comprising all parameter combinations and used these to calculate individual realizations of the regional inventory. The spatial domain (4042 polygons) was set up with spatially explicit soil and climate information and a region-typical 3-year crop rotation consisting of winter wheat, rapeseed, and winter barley.\nFor the MU, DU and PU we calculated several hundred regional inventories each to assess the individual uncertainty contributions. For the overall uncertainty quantification we calculated several thousand regional inventories with sampled model configurations, input datasets and parameter distributions. Statistical analysis of the regional simulation results have been used to quantify the overall full uncertainty of the inventory.",

            "abstract": "The Great Plains low-level jet (GPLLJ) is influential to the hydroclimate in the Great Plains of the U.S. in late spring and early summer. In this study, we stratify the El Niño influences on the summer GPLLJ according to the El Niño type and find the influences are dramatically different between the Eastern Pacific (EP) and Central Pacific (CP) types. Associated with the CP El Niño, negative sea level pressure anomalies are established over the Gulf of Mexico that induce northerly wind anomalies to weaken the GPLLJ. In contrast, the EP El Niño intensifies the GPLLJ via inducing anomalous surface air temperature gradient between northeastern and southwestern U.S. This finding indicates that the El Niño impact on the GPLLJ may have changed after early 1990s, since when the El Niño changed from the conventional EP type to the newly-emerged CP type. A weakened GPLLJ and less transport of heat and moisture fluxes from the Gulf of Mexico into the Great Plains can lead to a drier environment in the central United States.",

            "abstract": "Rapid changes in climate and socio-economic systems are affecting hydrologic processes and fresh water availability. In particular, temperatures, population growth and urban development are all expected to increase in the Southern United States over the next 50 years, which will further stress regional water resources. With improved knowledge of the interactions among land use-land cover (LULC), climate change, and hydrologic processes, decision makers and natural resource managers can explore opportunities to increase the resilience of water resources to future changes. To address this need, we investigated the impacts of climate and LULC changes on water resources throughout the Yadkin River watershed in North Carolina. From forested headwaters in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Yadkin River flows through agricultural areas and regions of expanding urbanization in the Piedmont. We selected small watersheds representative of each region for detailed analyses, including changes in LULC, climate, and stream flow. We found no significant trends in water yield, precipitation, or evapotranspiration in representative watersheds dominated by forest, agriculture, or medium intensity development using historic climate and USGS stream gauge data. This suggests that precipitation and LULC have been relatively stable throughout the Yadkin watershed over the last two to three decades. However, our approach melding the National Land Cover Data and U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Plots indicate that the watershed will experience rapid and substantial changes in land use over the next 50 years, particularly as forest is replaced by urban development. Preliminary analyses with a distributed ecohydroloic model (RHESSys), suggest water yield is sensitive to LULC even without climate change. We will present results that quantify the impact of these changes on hydrologic processes by applying projections of future climate (9 scenarios) and multiple realizations of LULC change projections using RHESSys.",

            "abstract": "Sulfur isotope fractionations within the chemocline can be an indication of green and purple sulfur photosynthetic activity. This isotopic signal is, however, small and variable, on the order of +2-6‰ (Zerkle et al. 2009). It is therefore advantageous to investigate the environmental and ecological effects on this signal so that these influences can be taken into account when estimating the contribution of anoxygenic phototrophs to the sulfur cycle in aquatic environments.\nThis project aims to investigate the ways in which anoxygenic phototroph community structure and lake water geochemistry impact the sulfur isotope fractionation expressed during anoxygenic photosynthesis in meromictic lakes. During the summer of 2013, water column profile analysis of six lakes in the Pacific Northwest (located in eastern Washington and western Montana) were conducted to assess photosynthetically available radiation, salinity, pH, temperature, dissolved solids, and specific conductivity. Water column samples were obtained to determine the sulfur isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate and sulfide, major ion and sulfide concentrations. Microbial samples were also collected for genetic sequencing. Initial results found green (e.g., Chlorobiaceae sp.) and purple (e.g., Lamprocystis purpurea) bacteria at the same depth in one of the study lakes. These data, in addition to the same suite of samples collected in the summer of 2014, provide insight into relationships between the isotopic composition of sulfur (in H2S, S0, and SO4), lake water chemistry, and the presence or absence of green and purple sulfur bacteria.",

            "abstract": "Field studies are providing the opportunity to characterize ice nucleating particle (INP) number concentrations, their varied sources, and to examine their influence on ice formation and precipitation processes in winter clouds in California. Aerosol sources that may influence orographic cloud properties in California include pollution, marine aerosols, and transported dusts. Vertical stratification affects the role of different aerosol types. Boundary layer dust and pollution in Central Valley locations may influence cloud properties at times, but may be decoupled from cloud layers at other times or be restricted in affecting clouds by the Sierra barrier jet phenomenon. Marine layers may sometimes be lifted over topography to influence clouds. Finally, long range transported dust/biological particles may directly enter upper cloud levels to act as the trigger for ice initiation.\nWe present analyses of INP number concentrations, INP chemical composition, and related data collected from flights on the DOE G-1 aircraft during the CalWater 1 field study in winter 2011. Sampling of mostly marine boundary layer INP during the surface-based BBACPAX (Bodega Bay Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation in Atmospheric rivers eXperiment) study in 2014 included first sampling with an online method for measuring the mass spectral composition of INP, and new immersion freezing INP measurements extending to the warm temperature limit of heterogeneous ice formation. Studies reveal the strong influence of long range transported aerosols on INP populations and typically lower INP concentrations in marine air layers. Plans for new studies including G-1 aircraft flights during the ACAPEX (ARM Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment) study, overlapping with ground-based measurements in the CalWater-2 campaign in winter 2015 will be introduced.\nAnalyses are being applied toward numerical modeling studies of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions in California, presented separately in this session.",

            "abstract": "Surface melt in the ablation zone of Greenland varies considerably, with increasing rates over the satellite observational period. Prior to airborne and satellite altimetry studies, the record is primarily based on point measurements. Here, we develop an independent method of estimating supraglacial melt from satellite images to produce a broad spatial record of mass balance in west Greenland through three decades.\nThe ablation zone along the margin of the ice sheet in central west Greenland shows a band of dark grey ice approximately 25 km wide traceable over 150 km from 66° 40' N to 68° 20' N, inland from Kangerlussuaq, and visible again to the north of Jakobshavn Isbrae. This grey ice is characterized by large, km-scale zigzags of alternating dark and light ice bands. Ice penetrating radar data show that the outcropping ice throughout this band is strongly stratified, with strata dipping inland towards the centre of the ice sheet. The large zigzags across the ice surface are seen on the surface where these dipping strata undulate, or when the ice surface is incised by meltwater channels. The amplitude of the zigzags is determined by the relative dip of the strata and the surface topography.\nWe focus on data from the Russell Glacier, where surface velocity is on the order of 100 m/yr, and surface melt erodes the bare ice on the order of 1 m/yr. While ice flow moves the exposed strata upwards and towards the margin, surface melt displaces the exposed trace of the stratigraphy down dip, i.e. towards the interior of the ice sheet. By cross-correlating satellite images from a 30 year period we can distinguish the seaward movement of ice surface features, such as crevasses and melt channels that move with ice flow, from the landward apparent displacement of the exposed strata. We combine this with high resolution DEMs, photographs and shallow ice radar from Operation IceBridge and the IcePod instrument suite to constrain the geometry of the ice surface and exposed strata. By combining satellite and airborne observations we demonstrate that the apparent displacement of the exposed strata documents the increased surface melt over the last three decades. Integrating structural geology into the surface mass balance analysis provides unique insights into the spatial variability of melt across the region.",

This poster encompasses one of one such professional development (PD) effort. The Enhancing Understanding of Concepts and Processes of Science (EUCAPS) project serves 31 K-8 in-service teachers in two southeast Washington school districts. In year two of this three year PD project, in-service teachers explored the Earth sciences and pedagogical approaches such as the Science Writing Heuristic, concept mapping, and activities which emphasized the epistemic nature of science. The goals of the EUCAPS PD project are to increase in-service teachers’ big ideas in science and to provide support to in-service teachers as they transition to the NGSS. Teachers used concepts maps to document their knowledge of Earth science processes before and after visiting a local field site in Lewiston, Idaho. In the context of immersive inquiries, teachers collected field-based evidence to support their claims about the geological history of the field site. Teachers presented their claims and evidence to their peers in the form a story about the local geologic history. This poster will present an overview of the PD as well as provide examples of teacher’s work and alignment with the NGSS.",

Input from five rivers into the gulf has constructed a three-dimensional mid-shelf clinothem composed of three depositional lobes, with a central lobe downlapped by two younger lobes to the north and south. This geometry suggests that the three lobes are not syndepositional but rather that clinoform depocenters have shifted 60 km, thus bypassing adjacent accommodation. Newly examined CHIRP (Compressed High Intensity Radar Pulse) seismic lines and XRF analysis of piston cores from the 2004 NSF MARGINS program reveal distinct lobes offshore that exhibit increased complexity moving shoreward. Evidence of shoreward complexity and lobe interfingering cause us to question the originally proposed mechanism for depocenter shift involving circulation changes. An alternative hypothesis that stems from distinct lobe architecture farther offshore suggests that channelized downslope processes and nearshore storage may play important roles in lobe growth.",

            "abstract": "The MAVEN probe includes the EUV instrument, which will be used to produce a model of the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV: 0-190 nm) spectrum at Mars. This VUV irradiance model is an iteration of the Flare Irradiance Spectral Model (FISM), an empirical model of the solar irradiance spectrum from 0.1 to 190 nm at 1 nm spectral resolution with a 1 minute time cadence. This latest iteration is called FISM-P, where the ‘-P’ suffix stands for ‘planetary’, and estimates mean daily irradiances from 0.1 to 190 nm for every planet in the solar system from 1948 to the present through weighted interpolation of earth measured proxies. In addition to daily irradiances, planetary 1-minute (flaring) irradiances are available if the planet is positioned such that the flaring emissions are observed by instruments at Earth or MAVEN EUV at Mars. FISM is optimized to use the best available proxies for each layer of the solar atmosphere (chromosphere, transition region, cool corona, and hot corona). FISM-P uses both interpolated earth proxies (the MgII core-to-wing ratio, H Ly-a and F10.7) and, when available, the MAVEN EUV measurements (H Ly-α, 17-22 nm, and 0-6 nm) for improved accuracy at Mars. FISM has already been successfully used as an input for ionospheric and thermospheric models for Earth, Mars, as well as comparisons of photoelectrons at Earth and Mars, and surface charging of the moon. FISM-P now provides the capability for similar studies throughout the solar system; and the in situ VUV measurements by MAVEN EUV will result in the most accurate VUV spectrum to date at Mars.",

            "abstract": "Slow slip events (SSEs) are a type of slow earthquakes that can be observed with Global Positioning System (GPS) networks in the world. Those events are detected on intensely coupled plate boundaries such as Cascadia subduction zone (Dragert et al., 2001), western North America, Mexico (Kostoglodov et al., 2003), Alaska (Ohta et al., 2007) and Tokai and Boso areas (Ozawa et al., 2002, 2003), central Japan and are considered to have relations to large subduction thrust earthquakes. However, in southwestern Ryukyu trench where most of researchers believe that it should be a decoupled plate boundary, SSEs recur regularly and are located at a patch that is as deep as 20 to 40 km (Heki and Kataoka, 2008). For comprehending the characteristics and time variations of SSEs in this area, the GEONET GPS data of 16 years are used in this study. During 1997 to 2014, more than thirty SSEs are identified near Hateruma Island, Ryukyu. The average recurrence interval is calculated to be 6.3 months and release seismic moment is Mw 6.6 on average. However, the values of recurrence interval are not invariable. From 1997 to 2002, interval period of SSEs is 7.5 months, but during 2002 to 2008, the interval period decreases suddenly to 5.5 months. After 2008, the value restores to 7.2 months again. Furthermore, the slip amount of SSEs in this area varies with time. From 1997 to 2002, the slip is 9.5 cm/year; and during 2002 to 2008, the value slightly increases to 10.5 cm/year. However, in 2008 to 2013, the slip drops to 6.6 cm/year, but accord to the trend of cumulative slip, the slip value would increase in 2014. Considering these data, we find the slip values increase conspicuously in 2002 and 2013. Coincidentally, one Mw 7.1 thrust earthquake occurred in 2002 and earthquake swarm activity started in the Okinawa trough approximately 50km north of the SSE patch. In 2013, another earthquake swarm activity occurred in nearly the same area as the 2002 activity. This suggests that the slip amount varies due to the earthquake swarm activities in Okinawa trough; the external stress perturbations such as magma injection and the Mw 7.1 earthquake could accelerate the slip amount of SSEs.",

            "abstract": "EarthCube is envisioned as a cyberinfrastructure that fosters new, transformational geoscience by enabling sharing, understanding and scientifically-sound and efficient re-use of formerly unconnected data resources, software, models, repositories, and computational power. Its purpose is to enable science enterprise and workforce development via an extensible and adaptable collaboration and resource integration framework. A key component of this vision is development of comprehensive inventories supporting resource discovery and re-use across geoscience domains. The goal of the EarthCube CINERGI (Community Inventory of EarthCube Resources for Geoscience Interoperability) project is to create a methodology and assemble a large inventory of high-quality information resources with standard metadata descriptions and traceable provenance. The inventory is compiled from metadata catalogs maintained by geoscience data facilities, as well as from user contributions. The latter mechanism relies on community resource viewers: online applications that support update and curation of metadata records. Once harvested into CINERGI, metadata records from domain catalogs and community resource viewers are loaded into a staging database implemented in MongoDB, and validated for compliance with ISO 19139 metadata schema. Several types of metadata defects detected by the validation engine are automatically corrected with help of several information extractors or flagged for manual curation. The metadata harvesting, validation and processing components generate provenance statements using W3C PROV notation, which are stored in a Neo4J database. Thus curated metadata, along with the provenance information, is re-published and accessed programmatically and via a CINERGI online application.\nThis presentation focuses on the role of resource inventories in a scalable and adaptable information infrastructure, and on the CINERGI metadata pipeline and its implementation challenges. Key project components are described at the project’s website (http://workspace.earthcube.org/cinergi), which also provides access to the initial resource inventory, the inventory metadata model, metadata entry forms and a collection of the community resource viewers.",

Here we closely followed the method described by Bensen et al. in 2007 to obtain the vertical-vertical ambient noise cross-correlations using the earthquake’s code wave data of events with magnitude larger than 6 between 2012 and 2014 in China and South America. We observed several body wave phases such as PKIKP, PcPPKP and SKKS in the stacking result. We also generated 30 uniformly distributed events’ synthetic data for an antipodal station pair by mineos and processed them with the ambient noise cross-correlation. The match to the real data is very good and therefore, we believe that this can be explained by a 1-D earth model without scattering from lateral heterogeneities as in the standard ambient noise tomography. We also change the focal mechanism solution to find whether this can influence the phases’ relative amplitude.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring Earth surface dynamics at an ever increasing resolution has helped to support the characterization of local topography, including vegetated and urban environments. Airborne remote sensing using light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is naturally suited to characterize vegetation and landscapes as it provides detailed three-dimensional spatial data with multiple elevation recordings for each laser pulse. The full waveform LIDAR receiver is unique in this aspect as it can capture and record the complete temporal history of the reflected signal, which contains detailed information about the structure of the objects and ground surfaces illuminated by the beam. This study examines the utility of co-collected, dual-wavelength, full waveform LIDAR data to characterize vegetation and landscapes through the extraction of waveform features, including total waveform energy, canopy energy distribution, and foliage penetration metrics. Assessments are performed using data collected in May 2014 over Monterey, CA, including the Naval Postgraduate School campus area as well as the Point Lobos State Natural Reserve situated on the Monterey coast. The surveys were performed with the Chiroptera dual-laser LIDAR mapping system from Airborne Hydrography AB (AHAB), which can collect both green (515nm) and near infrared (1064nm) waveforms simultaneously. Making use of the dual waveforms allows for detailed characterization of the vegetation and landscape not previously possible with airborne LIDAR.",

            "abstract": "There is a need for the improvement and optimisation of clay swelling inhibitors for the enhancement of oil and gas exploration. The hydration region of both ions and the possibility of ion pairing in 1 molar aqueous solution of clay swelling inhibitor, tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl), in D2O, under elevated hydrostatic-pressures and temperatures has been determined with unprecedented detail using a combination of neutron diffraction and small-angle scattering in conjunction with hydrogen/deuterium isotopic labeling. The O-H correlation function (H-bonds) for the water in the 1.0M solution is measured and compared with that for pure D2O. Also investigated is the effect of burial conditions on the d-spacing of TMA-intercalated vermiculite. Contrary to expectations, no aggregation of TMA ions due to hydrophobic interactions is observed, nor are any ionic pairs of TMA+ and Cl- at these burial conditions. The data revealed a more ordered water-water structure with the addition of TMACl from bulk D2O. There is no change in the hydration structure measured at the applied elevated conditions. This is in remarkable contrast to pure water at the same conditions which is well known to be compressible. The dry d-spacing of the TMA-exchanged Eucatex vermiculite is measured at 13.66 Å which increases to 14.03 Å with the addition of D2O. Beyond this, there is no change in d-spacing with increasing pressure and temperature indicating the strength of the TMA ions binding to the clay interlayers and therefore its performance as a clay-swelling inhibitor.",

            "abstract": "Sudden environmental changes along the southeast coast of Korea due to the appearance of cold water in summer, sometimes less than 10oC, has seriously damaged on fisheries, aquaculture, and even ship traffics due to the sea fog caused by the extreme air-sea temperature difference. This cold water, originating from the bottom cold water in the Korea Strait connecting the East/Japan Sea and the East China Sea, has often been observed mainly during the summer months. Although previous studies have suggested possible causes why the bottom cold water intrusion is stronger during summer, its mechanism is not clear yet. Here we investigate the influence of tides on the bottom cold water intrusion using numerical simulations. A real-time ocean forecasting system with 1/12-degree grids, which assimilates in-situ data and includes both atmospheric and tidal forcings, reveals a significant seasonal variation of semidiurnal internal tides around the continental shelf slope between the Korea Strait and the southwestern East/Japan Sea. The internal tide energy during summer shows larger energy than during winter by a factor of about three in this region. Shipboard and Argo profiler measurements near the internal tide generation region and in the open basin support the simulated results. The seasonal stratification change induced by the Asian monsoon causes the seasonal internal tide energy change. This result leads us to investigate the influence of semidiurnal internal tides on the bottom cold water intrusion into the shallow Korea Strait. A series of numerical simulations using a 1/108-degree fine-resolution regional ocean model with different configurations demonstrates that the semidiurnal internal tides play a crucial role in enhancing the intrusion of the Korea Strait bottom cold water by an internal tidal pumping effect. Our results provide not only an explanation why the intrusion of the Korea Strait bottom cold water is strengthened during summer, but also an implication for the role of internal tides in water exchanges between the shelf seas and deep oceans.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice monitoring is an important field of scientific research and relevant to marine operational applications. Remote sensing imagery is useful for monitoring sea ice, identifying and tracking ice features over broad spatial scales. At the same time the current satellites have limited capabilities in providing some of the important sea ice characteristics with required temporal frequency and coverage. This work investigates possibilities of model-based estimation of sea ice geophysical parameters from multisource data. The Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE) was implemented on a high resolution regional scale (up to 2km) taking model advantages, such as the possibility of including oceanographic and climatological information, in order to extract parameters and to determine the dynamic and thermodynamic behaviour of sea ice. The sea ice simulation was performed over the Baffin Bay region and the Labrador Sea demonstrating a good agreement with remote sensing measurements acquired by the microwave radiometer and altimeter satellites. The number of geophysical parameters, such as ice thickness, age, concentration, floes statistics, and ridging were extracted using model and imaging satellite data. Information on characteristics of sea ice pressure ridges was also derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The method to study ice ridges was validated with detailed information from very high resolution (0.5m) optical satellites and involved 3D modelling and visualization of ridge information. The identification of various ice types, including ice deformation features and glacier ice, was performed using medium and low resolution SAR and optical satellite data as well as their fusion product.",

High-pressure laser heating experiments on liquid water compressed in a diamond-anvil cell up to 2500 ± 150 K demonstrate the flexibility and performance of the system. Temperature is determined from the grey-body thermal radiation of the heated samples,. New single-crystal laser heating Brillouin measurements were made on San Carlos Olivine in the (111) plane at pressures up to ~13 GPa, and T~1300 ± 200 K. We obtain quantitative values for the thermal pressure in the diamond cell. Using KCl and KBr and pressure-transmitting media, we show that pressure gradients in the sample chamber are small at high P-T conditions based on observations of the olivine-wadsleyite transition. This system is additionally designed for continuously varying scattering angles from near forward scattering (0º scattering angle) up to near back scattering (~141º). Our results on the sound velocities of olivine at high pressure-temperature conditions have implications for the nature of the 410 km discontinuity and the olivine content of the upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how groundwater is transported and stored in fractured environments using traditional hydrologic measurements presents a unique challenge because groundwater is channeled into narrow zones that are difficult to detect and characterize. Non-invasive geophysical methods provide a way to image the subsurface over large spatial scales, providing the necessary insight to guide more traditional hydrologic investigations in fractured systems. We collected approximately 3.3 line kilometers of electrical resistivity and seismic refraction data, plus three nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) soundings, in a small catchment located in the Laramie Range, WY. Using a Bayesian inversion based on fundamental rock physics equations we estimate porosity from seismic velocities, then identify areas of saturation using the resistivity values. Using geostatistics we generate a three-dimensional model of porosity and resistivity over the entire catchment. The data show that porosity decreases rapidly beneath the valley but porosity remains higher beneath the ridge. The resistivity volume shows a possible groundwater connection from the stream through the highly porous ridge into an adjacent valley. The hydrostratigraphic insights from geophysical data are being used to strategically place traditional hydrological measurements to quantify groundwater flow within this small catchment.",

            "abstract": "The Himalayan river system transfers annually ca. a billion ton of sediment from the Himalayan slopes to the Bay of Bengal. The transport conditions are highly contrasted with a very steep mountainous part and a long and very flat floodplain and deltaic part. The modest slope and the subsidence in the floodplain tend to favor deposition of pebbles in the vicinity of the Himalayan outlet and of sandy sediments downstream. Because deposition preferentially involves coarse and quartz rich sediments it tends to geochemically fractionate the overall sediment load transported by the rivers [1]. This can be tracked using the evolution of major element concentrations in the sediment tacking into account the potential bias due to chemical erosion. Al/Si ratio best describes the partition between coarse quartz rich sand and phyllosilicate rich silty-clays.\nWe use a set of chemical compositions and granulometric distribution for modern sediment samples of Himalayan rivers and selected locations in the floodplain and the Bangladesh delta. Sampling includes river depth sampling during the flood season to document river variability due to settling processes in the water column, daily sampling on the Narayani-Gandak river to document seasonal variability. We also use data from sediments deposited in the floodplain to document the geochemical effect of floodplain sequestration.\nData show that grain size/mineralogical segregation becomes more pronounced downstream and is dependent on the hydrodynamic conditions [1]. At the Himalayan front, data show that Al/Si ratios vary from 0.29 to 0.20 with limited variation in the water column. Their integrated ratio is between to 0.23 and 0.24. Average pebble composition near the outlet of the Narayani is highly enriched in silica with a ratio of 0.11. Sediments sequestered in the floodplain have an average composition between 0.15 and 0.20. Downstream, Ganga in Bangladesh typically varies from 0.32 at the surface to 0.13 in the bedload with an integrated value of 0.23. This represents quartz proportion varying from less than 30% in the upper suspension to ca. 60% in the bottom sediments. The modest evolution of Al/Si ratios from Himalaya to the Delta implies that deposition in the floodplain is limited around 10% ±10. [1] Lupker et al. 2011: JGR doi:10.1029/2010JF001947",

            "abstract": "Geomechanical modelling can provide insights enabling us to successfully answer questions such as: (1) Given a known stress field, geology, rock mass fabric and injection strategy, what are the most likely resulting microseismic characteristics (e.g., hypocentres, source mechanisms and magnitudes)? (2) What does measured microseismicity reveal about the existing stress field and local geomechanical properties of the rockmass? We use two different modelling approaches to investigate various aspects such as event locations, source mechanisms and energy balances.\nThe first method uses bonded-particle modelling. This tool simulates rock deformation using an assemblage of rigid, round particles that are bonded together (Potyondy and Cundall, IJRMMS, 2004). This grid of particles can deform freely and bonds can be broken to represent local failure. Bonds are characterized by normal and shear strengths as well as friction coefficients to model respectively tensile and shear failure. One advantage of this approach is that it reveals microseismic event locations, including their moment tensors. This is achieved by integrating local bond failure in both space and time (Hazzard and Young, IJRMMS, 2004).\nIn the second approach we use the distinct element method to investigate how the heterogeneity of the rock affects the development of fractures. This method computes the stresses and strains inside discontinuous media such as fractured layered rock masses. We examine the likelihood of failure throughout a stratigraphic column, thus revealing the most likely positions for microseismic events.\nGeomechanical modelling is a powerful tool to help bridge the gap between geophysical data analysis and engineering applications of microseismic data by providing a framework for advanced interpretation strategies (Van der Baan, Eaton, Dusseault, Intech, 2013). In particular, it helps answering questions such as: Why is failure occurring in specific locations and not others? What are the failure mechanisms? Where does the input energy go?\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank the sponsors of the Microseismic Industry Consortium for financial support, and Itasca for providing licenses to their 3DEC and PFC software packages.",

            "abstract": "The Transverse Ranges within the structural province of southern California, an east-west trending active fold and thrust belt system, has rapid uplift rates that are capable of generating large earthquakes and tsunamis. This system to the west consists of north and south dipping reverse faults offshore Santa Barbara and Ventura (i.e., Pitas Point fault, Red Mountain fault, Rincon Creek fault). Ventura Avenue Anticline (VAA) is one of the fastest uplifting structure within this system has experienced nearly 2.7 km of structural uplift since fold initiation about 200-300 thousand years ago, yielding an average uplift rate of 9-13 mm/yr. Mapped and dated Holocene marine terraces between Ventura and Carpenteria reveal that large uplift events occurred at 0.8 ka and 1.9 ka; a recurrence interval of approximately a thousand years. The VAA trends offshore to the west and is buried by sediment from Rincon Creek. This sediment completely obscures the surficial expression of the fold between Rincon Point and Punta Gorda, indicating that Holocene sedimentation has kept pace with fold growth. Given the high sedimentation rate, each uplift event should be captured by stratigraphic rotation and onlap, and formation of angular unconformities. With that perspective, we acquired ~240 km-long very high-resolution (decimeter) CHIRP seismic reflection data from offshore Santa Barbara in the west to Ventura in the east, in order to examine discrete folding/uplift events that are preserved in the Holocene sediment record. CHIRP data together with re-processed USGS sparker profiles provide new constraints on timing and architecture of deformation offshore. A transgressive surface that dates back to ~9.5 kyr B.P is identified in seismic reflection data and dips landward; bending of the transgressive surface appears to be due to active folding and faulting. Observed onlapping sediments together with the deformation of the transgressive surface mark the onset of deformation while periods of the tectonic quiescence are recorded by progradational packages. We are able to identify 3 discrete uplift events above the transgressive surface along the VAA. Similar uplift events (3-4 events) are also observed along the Rincon Creek Fault offshore Santa Barbara.",

            "abstract": "The processes and interactions that drive global ice volume variability and deglaciations are a topic of considerable debate. Here we analyze the drive-response relationships between data sets representing global ice volume, CO2 and insolation over the past 800 000 years using an information theoretic approach. Specifically, we use a non-parametric measure of directional information transfer (IT) based on the construct of transfer entropy to detect the relative strength and directionality of interactions in the potentially chaotic and non-linear glacial-interglacial climate system. Analyses of unfiltered data suggest a tight coupling between CO2 and ice volume, detected as strong, symmetric information flow consistent with a two-way interaction. In contrast, IT from Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer insolation to CO2 is highly asymmetric, suggesting that insolation is an important driver of CO2. Conditional analysis further suggests that CO2 is a dominant influence on ice volume, with the effect of insolation also being significant but limited to smaller-scale variability. However, the strong correlation between CO2 and ice volume renders them information redundant with respect to insolation, confounding further drive-response attribution. We expect this information redundancy to be partly explained by the shared glacial-interglacial \"sawtooth\" pattern and its overwhelming influence on the transition probability distributions over the target interval. To test this, we filtered out the abrupt glacial terminations from the ice volume and CO2 records to focus on the residual variability. Preliminary results from this analysis confirm insolation as a driver of CO2 and two-way interactions between CO2 and ice volume. However, insolation is reduced to a weak influence on ice volume. Conditional analyses support CO2 as a dominant driver of ice volume, while ice volume and insolation both have a strong influence on CO2. These findings suggest that the effect of orbital variability on global ice volume may work primarily through its influence on CO2. Our preliminary results are consistent with the idea that the coupling between CO2 and ice volume likely occurs via a feedback loop that involves meltwater-induced shifts in oceanic circulation and associated changes in the carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forests in mountainous regions are often assumed to be nitrogen (N) limited, yet N dynamics across rugged terrain can be complex due to gradients in climate and topography. Elucidating patterns of N availability and loss across such gradients is necessary to predict and manage tropical forest response to environmental changes such as increasing N deposition and rising temperatures. However, such data is currently lacking, particularly in remote locations that are of high conservation value. To address this gap, a research expedition organized by the American Climber Science Program recently made a coast-to-coast journey across a remote region of Costa Rica, travelling over the Cordillera Talamanca and through La Amistad International Park. Numerous biological, chemical and hydrologic measurements were made en-route across montane to premontane wet tropical forests, spanning nearly 2,000 m in elevation and 200 km. Surface soil samples collected at regular intervals along this transect illuminate environmental drivers of N dynamics across the region. The dataset reveals strong links between soil natural abundance N isotopic composition (δ15N) and elevation and temperature parameters, and weaker links to precipitation and topography. This is in general agreement with global scale observations, but divergence from some previously published works is apparent and will be discussed. δ15N mass balance models suggest that N isotope patterns reflect differences in forms of N loss and the relative importance of fractionating and non-fractionating pathways. When combined with data on several other edaphic properties, especially C:N stoichiometry, the results points toward notable variation in soil N availability and N constraints across the transect. This study illustrates large, but predictable, variation in key N cycle traits across the premontane to montane wet tropical forest transition. These findings have management-relevant implications for tropical regions.",

Secondly, comparisons of the temperature (T), precipitation (P) and runoff (Q) simulated by the fully coupling run and observations were conducted.

            "abstract": "Rivers draining densely populated landscapes are extremely impacted by modern human engineering: armored beds, artificial levees and dams modified natural fluvial dynamics, and consequently, the evolution of alluvial plains, deltas and coastal environments. Dams, in particular, segmented the longitudinal continuity of the river and reduced (or even interrupted) the export of sediment toward the sea. Here we investigate the impact of the Isola Serafini dam on the upstream portion of the Po River (Italy) influenced by backwater, by using an integrated approach of aerial and satellite images, longitudinal cross-sections, grain size analysis, backscatter data and multibeam bathymetry. The analysis of aerial photographs, acquired every 10 yr since the dam construction in 1960, and of longitudinal cross-sections, allows understanding how the river adjusts its profile in response to the backwater and quantifying areas of net river banks erosion and deposition in meanders. The drowning of the reaches influenced by backwater reduced the progradation of point bars and promoted the deposition of fine grained sediments, as highlighted by grain size analysis on surficial sediment sampled across and along the river course. Calibrated back-scatter data with grain-size distributions of two selected meanders, under the backwater effect and beyond, show how sands are progressively replaced by fine-grained sediments in the meander belt and in the river axis, mainly reflecting the reduction of flow velocity, inferred also by river bed roughness. The understanding of river and sediment dynamics under the influence of backwater due to dam construction is useful when studying pristine systems in which natural backwater affects their evolution, as in the case of the formation of standing water bodies during the drowning of an incised valley.",

Without these there is a risk that biochar use could deliver negative unforeseen consequences. Key to biochar sustainability is the feedstock sustainability, which in developed nations can be novel due to the ability to process biomass locally.\nUsing field trial data and primary biodiversity assessments we modelled different sustainability indicators (local GHG balance, global GHG balance, local biodiversity, global biodiversity and local economic return) associated with four different biochar feedstocks (woodlands, hedgerows, Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) and straw) over 20 years for UK arable agriculture. Global measures included Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC).\nOur results showed that trade-offs are inherent. Local GHG emissions are reduced by use of straw and SRC, and increased through the use of woodlands. In contrast all feedstocks reduced the global GHG emissions. Local biodiversity was increased through use of hedgerows, woodlands, SRC and low fertiliser rates. Global biodiversity was maximised through high fertiliser rates and use of all feedstocks. Critically economic return was maximised through high use of woodland and straw, and substantially reduced when hedgerows or SRC is used as feedstock. The introduction of high (£52 t-1 CO2) and low (£11.44 t-1 CO2) carbon prices were never enough to shift a system between loss and profit.\nThis research demonstrates that the sustainability of biochar varies substantially depending on the scale (local or global) and the breadth of indicators included. Ultimately biochar is designed to have a role in solving global problems, but the decisions determining use will be made locally. Regulation to ensure biochar is used appropriately may be necessary.",

            "abstract": "There has been a general expectation that warming temperatures will facilitate transformation of high elevation meadows to woody dominated communities. We have been using observational and experimental approaches to analyze potential state changes of meadows and the role seed and seedling predation play in conifer expansion in the high elevation zone of the Sierra Nevada mountain range of the western United States. The observational component consists of 256 plots spanning 3 degrees of latitude and an elevation range from 3000 m to 4000 m. The experimental component consists of mammal seed predator exclosures (N = 252) allocated among three arrays at each of two sites separated by > 100 km. Three cohorts of seeds at five seed densities (1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 seeds per 0.25 m2) and one seedling cohort were placed within and immediately outside the exclosures at each site. Trend surface and distance decay analyses of community composition indicate vegetation communities in the high elevation zone have not assembled predictably along environmental or spatial gradients. Rather, we have found strong support for neutral dynamics, implying that communities assemble more stochastically as a result of dispersal limitation or priority effects. Density of mature and sapling conifers decrease as a function of distance from conifer patches, but seedling density has no relationship with distance from conifer patches. Germination of seeds outside of the exclosures was 19% compared to 65% within, and these were mainly at densities of 1 seed per 0.25 m2. None of the seeds that germinated outside the exclosures survived more than 1.5 years compared to 23% within the exclosures. Virtually all of the seedlings planted outside the exclosures were removed within a year. Collectively, these findings indicate a highly patchy rather than uniform pattern of treeline extension in the high elevation zone of the Sierra Nevada. Moreover, smaller mammals appear to be playing a critical role in slowing or decoupling colonization of conifers into high elevation meadows and other vegetation types.",

            "abstract": "Automated identification of particles in lunar thin sections is necessary for practical measurement of particle shape, void characterization, and quantitative characterization of sediment fabric. This may be done using image analysis, but several aspects of the lunar regolith make such automations difficult. For example, many of the particles are shattered; others are aggregates of smaller particles. Sieve sizes of the particles span 5 orders of magnitude. The physical thickness of a thin section, at a nominal 30 microns, is large compared to the size of many of the particles. Image acquisition modes, such as SEM and reflected light, while superior to transmitted light, still have significant ambiguity as to the volume being sampled. It is also desirable to have a technique that is inexpensive, not resource intensive, and analytically robust. To this end, we have developed an image acquisition and processing protocol that identifies and delineates resolvable particles on the front surface of a lunar thin section using a petrographic microscope in reflected light. For a polished thin section, a grid is defined covering the entire thin section. The grid defines discrete images taken with 20% overlap, minimizing the number of particles that intersect image boundaries. In reflected light mode, two images are acquired at each grid location, with a closed aperture diaphragm. One image, A, is focused precisely on the front surface of the thin section. The second image, B, is made after the stage is brought toward the objective lens just slightly. A bright fringe line, analogous to a Becke line, appears inside all transparent particles at the front surface of the section in the second image. The added light in the bright line corresponds to a deficit around the particles. Particle identification is done using ImageJ and uses multiple steps. A hybrid 5x5 median filter is used to make images Af and Bf. This primarily removes very small particles just below the front surface of the section. Bf – (Bf/Af) is then computed. The division strongly enhances the fringe and the deficit, while minimizing the correlated information in A and B. The subtraction emphasizes the particle-epoxy boundaries. The resulting image is converted to binary, and then holes are filled. Cracks are removed using a median-based operator.",

            "abstract": "In Germany, education in astronomy and planetary sciences is limited to very few schools or universities and is actively pursued by only selected research groups. Our group is situated at the Freie Universität Berlin and we are actively involved in space missions such as Mars Express, Cassini in the Saturnian system, and DAWN at Vesta and Ceres. In order to enhance communication and establish a broader basis for building up knowledge on our solar-system neighborhood, we started to offer educational outreach in the form of workshops for groups of up to 20 students from primary/middle schools to high schools. Small group sizes guarantee practical, interactive, and dialog-based working environments as well as a high level of motivation. Several topical workshops have been designed which are targeted at different age groups and which consider different educational background settings. One workshop called “Impact craters on planets and moons” provides a group-oriented setting in which 3-4 students analyze spacecraft images showing diverse shapes of impact craters on planetary surfaces. It is targeted not only at promoting knowledge about processes on planetary surfaces but it also stimulates visual interpretation skills, 3D viewing and reading of map data. A second workshop “We plan a manned mission to Mars” aims at fostering practical team work by designing simple space mission scenarios which are solved within a team by collaboration and responsibility. A practical outdoor activity called “Everything rotates around the Sun” targets at developing a perception of absolute – but in particular relative – sizes, scales and dimensions of objects in our solar system. Yet another workshop “Craters, volcanoes and co. – become a geologist on Mars” was offered at the annual national “Girls’ Day” aiming at motivating primary to middle school girls to deal with topics in classical natural sciences. Small groups investigated and interpreted geomorphologic features in image data of the Martian surface and presented their results in the end. Extensive handouts and high-quality print material supplemented face-to-face exercises. For the future we plan to expand our workshop concepts, to give students the possibility of conducting a week-long internship with our Planetary Sciences research group.",

            "abstract": "Multi-scale interactions over the Maritime Continent (MC) may cause island-scale seasonal rainfall anomaly dipoles during the rainy season in association with ENSO: El Niño events are found to accompany increased frequency of a quiescent large-scale daily circulation type. These large-scale quiescent conditions in turn allow stronger island-scale diurnal land-sea breeze circulations to develop; the latter result in more rainfall over the mountainous regions of Java and increased subsidence over the coastal plains. A similar phenomenon occurs over Borneo, where rainfall is enhanced in the coastal regions, in which sea breezes head against off-shore synoptic-scale low-level winds.\nThis contribution builds on our previous work to consider the impacts of both the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and ENSO, in addition to the seasonal cycle, on daily weather types (WTs); here WTs are identified using cluster analysis over the MC, throughout the entire austral summer season. We investigate how strongly ENSO and MJO control WT frequency versus their modifying the circulation patterns of the WTs; both will modify air-sea interactions through changes in surface fluxes. Robust control of WT frequency is found, with the seasonal cycle being the strongest of the three effects, ENSO the intermediate one, and the MJO being least important. In terms of circulation patterns, ENSO is found to modify the circulation patterns themselves to some extent while the MJO does not.\nWe argue that these findings have important implications for sub-seasonal to seasonal predictability at local scales: predicting the changes in frequency of occurrence for a small number of weather types is potentially more tractable than the full, much higher-dimensional prediction problem. They may also allow a better understanding of air-sea interactions involving modulations of wind-driven surface fluxes associated with the seasonal cycle, ENSO and the MJO.",

            "abstract": "To quantify the H2 production associated with serpentinization at slow spreading mid-oceanic ridges, hydrothermal alteration experiments have been performed. Starting materials are a fine-grained harzburgite from Pindos ophiolite and artificial seawater (3.2 wt.% NaCl). Two grain sizes (P1 and P2), both <60μm, are used. The water-rock ratio is ~1.8 (40g of rock and 72g of water). Experiments are carried out at 250, 300 and 350°C, and for a constant pressure of 500 bar. For each temperature, two experiments are conducted in parallel. In the first, the hydrothermal fluid is periodically sampled and its H2 concentration ([H2]) determined by gas chromatography. In the second, the H2 fu/gacity (ƒH2) inside the reaction cell is continuously monitored with a H2semi-permeable membrane made of Au20Pd80.\n[H2] is maximum at 300°C with a plateau at ~115 mmol/kgwater against ~50 mmol/kgwater at 250°C (for the same duration, the experiment at 350°C (still in progress) shows [H2] ~10 times lower). The kinetics of H2 production is controlled by the particle size. At 300°C, the [H2] plateau is reached in ~35 days for P2 against ~55 days for P1. At 250 and 300°C, an ƒH2 increase is observed after the 2nd day and the rate of fH2 increase reaches a maximum during the 4th day. At 300°C, the ƒH2 stabilizes after ~40 days at 23 bar (fO2 ≈ NNO - 4.1 to 4.3). At 250°C, it takes ~70days to reach a plateau ƒH2 of 38 bar (fO2≈ NNO - 4.6 to 5.1). The solid products recovered and analyzed at the end of experiment are characterized by a serpentinization rate > 60% and they contain variable amounts of magnetite and brucite, in addition to serpentine minerals.\nTo link ƒH2 and [H2], experiments coupling the two types of measurement have been performed in the H2O-H2 system. For [H2] <50 mmol/kgwater, at 250 and 300°C, the first results show ƒH2/[H2] ≈ 660 and 380 bar.kgwater/molH2respectively.\nThese results imply that H2-bearing fluids associated with serpentinization strongly positively deviate from ideal behaviour, consistent with the proximity of the two-phase field of the H2O-H2 system. This specific behaviour of H2O-H2 fluid mixtures needs to be accounted for in thermodynamic models of serpentinization.",

            "abstract": "Since 1978, space based passive microwave (PM) radiometers have been used to comprehensively measure Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) on a global basis. The ability of PM radiometers to directly measure SWE at high temporal frequencies offers some distinct advantages over optical remote sensors. Nevertheless, in mountainous terrain PM radiometers often struggle to accurately measure SWE because of wet snow, saturation in deep snow, forests, depth hoar and stratigraphy, variable relief, and subpixel heterogeneity inherent in large pixel sizes. The Himalaya, because of their high elevation and high relief—much above tree line—offer an opportunity to examine PM products in the mountains without the added complication of trees. The upper Sutlej River basin— the third largest Himalayan catchment—lies in the western Himalaya. The river is a tributary of the Indus River and seasonal snow constitutes a substantial part of the basin’s hydrologic budget. The basin has a few surface stations and river gauges, which is unique for the region. As such, the Sutlej River basin is a good location to analyze the accuracy and effectiveness of the current National Snow and Ice Data Center’s (NSIDC) standard AMSR-E/Aqua Daily SWE product in mountainous terrain. So far, we have observed that individual pixels can “flicker”, i.e. fluctuate from day to day, over large parts of the basin. We consider whether this is an artifact of the algorithm or whether this is embedded in the raw brightness temperatures themselves. In addition, we examine how well the standard product registers winter storms, and how it varies over heavily glaciated pixels. Finally, we use a few common measures of algorithm performance (precision, recall and accuracy) to test how well the standard product detects the presence of snow, using optical imagery for validation. An improved understanding of the effectiveness of PM imagery in the mountains will help to clarify the technology’s limits.",

            "abstract": "The death of the Martian dynamo ~4.1 Ga and sustained volcanism throughout Martian history place fundamental constraints on the thermal history of the planet. To explore the implications for mantle structure, we constructed holistic models of Mars that include the core, mantle, lithosphere/surface, atmosphere, and an atmospheric capture of Phobos in a collaborative effort begun at the CIDER 2014 summer program.\nFor our thermal model of the core, we employ an iterative solver and parameterized phase diagram to compute pressure, density, and temperature in the core for a variety of initial accretion temperatures and bulk compositions. We use this model to constrain core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature and heat flow.\nWe couple this model for the evolution of the core with a one-dimensional parameterized convection model for the mantle. The upper boundary condition is set by the state of the Martian atmosphere. We consider the effect of a distinct compositional layer at the base of the mantle that may represent dense magma ocean crystallization products or a primitive layer untouched by magma ocean processes. We find successful models that allow sufficient CMB heat flow to power an early dynamo and the potential of melt generation through extended periods of Mars’ history.\nIn addition to dynamo and magmatism timing, other diagnostics allow us to compare model outputs to modern observables. The mass, moment of inertia, and tidal Love number of our model planet are compared directly to measured values. Additionally, deformation and stress on the lithosphere due to internal volume changes and changes in surface loading predicted by our thermal evolution models could be recorded in the Martian crust. Finally, coupling temperature-dependent tidal dissipation affects Phobos’ orbital secular evolution and gives constraint on mantle temperatures. These constraints are discussed for the different scenarios of Phobos capture.\nWe present a suite of models that satisfy the constraints of mass, moment of inertia, dynamo power and shutoff timing in addition to outlining predictions and implications for the forthcoming InSight and MAVEN missions.",

            "abstract": "A significant gulf still exists between the state of practice and state of the art in hydrologic modeling. Part of this gulf is due to the lack of adequate pre- and post-processing tools for newly developed computational models. The development of user interfaces has traditionally lagged several years behind the development of a particular computational model or suite of models. As a result, models with mature interfaces often lack key advancements in model formulation, solution methods, and/or software design and technology.\nPart of the problem has been a focus on developing monolithic tools to provide comprehensive interfaces for the entire suite of model capabilities. Such efforts require expertise in software libraries and frameworks for creating user interfaces (e.g., Tcl/Tk, Qt, and MFC). These tools are complex and require significant investment in project resources (time and/or money) to use. Moreover, providing the required features for the entire range of possible applications and analyses creates a cumbersome interface. For a particular site or application, the modeling requirements may be simplified or at least narrowed, which can greatly reduce the number and complexity of options that need to be accessible to the user. However, monolithic tools usually are not adept at dynamically exposing specific workflows.\nOur approach is to deliver highly tailored interfaces to users. These interfaces may be site and/or process specific. As a result, we end up with many, customized interfaces rather than a single, general-use tool. For this approach to be successful, it must be efficient to create these tailored interfaces. We need technology for creating quality user interfaces that is accessible and has a low barrier for integration into model development efforts. Here, we present efforts to leverage IPython notebooks as tools for rapid prototyping of site and application-specific user interfaces. We provide specific examples from applications in near-shore environments as well as levee analysis. We discuss our design decisions and methodology for developing customized interfaces, strategies for delivery of the interfaces to users in various computing environments, as well as implications for the design/implementation of simulation models.",

Stresses arise in the crust in accordance with crustal deformations due to plate motions and geodynamic processes. Gamma-ray emission associated with the radioactive decay of radon is continuously recorded in the station, considered to be discharged into surface from deep source area. Fluctuations of gamma-ray data are found to show a clear inverse correction with atmospheric temperature. Based on the linear regression method, possible temperature effects can be removed and the corrected data can be obtained. Variations exceeding the normal trend can be used to identify events associated with geodynamic processes such as earthquake. These anomalies usually appeare as procursors a few days before the local earthquakes, which occur in eastern Taiwan. It is noted that there are two significant increases in the gamma-ray counting rate during the period of 20th to 25th March and the period of 22nd April to 1st May. These increases are observed one week before the earthquake swarm. Furthermore, a progressive anomalies were recorded two weeks before the Fanglin earthquake (ML = 5.9, May 21, 2014) located in the Longitudinal Valley area. A continuous monitoring on the multiple parameters can improve our understanding of the relationship between the observed gamma-ray variations and the regional crustal stress/strain in the area.",

            "abstract": "Sediment permeability and consolidation behavior are key parameters in governing the drainage state and thus potential for excess pore fluid pressure in subduction zones. Elevated pore pressure, in turn, is one important control on the strength and sliding behavior of faults. Along many subduction margins, evidence of elevated, near-lithostatic, in situ pore pressure comes from high seismic reflectivity, low P-wave velocity (Vp), and high Vp/Vs ratios. This inference is broadly supported by numerical modeling studies that indicate elevated pore pressures are likely given high rates of burial and tectonic loading, combined with the low permeability of marine mudstones.\nHere, we report on a series of high-stress consolidation experiments on sediment core samples from the incoming Cocos plate obtained as part of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 344. Our experiments were designed to measure the consolidation behavior, permeability, and P-wave velocity of the incoming sediments over a range of confining stresses from .5 to 90 MPa. We explore a range of paths,including isostatic loading (σ1=σ2=σ3), K0 consolidation, in which the ratio of σ3/σ1 is maintained at ~0.6, and the trixial loading paths designed to maintain a near critical-state failure condition. In our tests, load is increased in a series of steps. After equilibration at each step, we conduct constant head permeability tests, and measure P-wave velocities in a “time of flight” mode. Initial results from isostatic loading tests on hemipelagic mudstone samples from 34 mbsf document consolidation and permeability-porosity trends, in which porosity decreases from 69% to 54% as stress in increased from .5 MPa to 15 MPa, and permeability decreases from 8.1 X 10-18 m2 at 1 MPa to 1.1 X 10-19 m2 at 15 MPa. P-wave velocity increases by 486-568 km/s over this effective stress range. Ultimately, data from our experiments will provide a robust basis for quantifying fluid content and pressure from seismic velocity and fault plane reflectivity at this margin, and provide data to parameterize forward models of fluid flow and consolidation.",

            "abstract": "The S-Web theory provides a physical explanation for the origin and properties of the slow solar wind, particularly its composition. The theory proposes that magnetic reconnection along topologically complex boundaries between open and closed magnetic fields on the sun releases plasma from closed magnetic field regions into the solar wind at latitudes away from the heliospheric current sheet. Such a wind would have elevated charge states compared to the fast wind and an elemental composition resembling the closed-field corona. This theory is currently being tested using time-dependent, high-resolution, MHD simulations, however comparisons to in-situ observations play an essential role in testing and understanding slow-wind release mechanisms. In order to determine the relationship between S-Web signatures and the observed, slow solar wind, we compare plasma data from the ACE and Ulysses spacecraft to solutions from the steady-state models created at Predictive Science, Inc., which use observed magnetic field distributions on the sun as a lower boundary condition. We discuss the S-Web theory in light of our results and the significance of the S-Web for interpreting current and future solar wind observations.\nThis work was supported, in part, by the NASA TR&T and SR&T programs.",

A set of core top samples from the Fram Strait and the Norwegian margin have been studied for Mg/Ca ratios in C. wuellerstorfi in order to establish a calibration relationship to the environmental conditions. In this part of the northern North Atlantic the bottom water temperature range between -0.5 and -1°C. For the calibration to modern water mass conditions, modern oceanographic data from both existing conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) casts and the World Ocean Data Base 2013 (Boyer et al., 2013) have been used. Benthic Mg/Ca ratios are relatively high suggesting a preference of C. wuellerstorfi to incorporate Mg below 0°C. Although no correlation has been found to existing temperature calibrations, the data are in line with earlier Mg/Ca data from C. wuellerstorfi in the area (Martin et al., 2002; Elderfield et al., 2006). The carbonate ion effect is most likely a main cause for the relatively high Mg/Ca ratios found in core top samples from the Fram Strait and the Nordic Seas, however, other factors may influence the values as well. Holocene records of benthic trace metal/Ca ratios from the eastern Fram Strait display trends similar to those found in other proxy indicators, despite the difficulties to constrain a temperature calibration for this low temperature range. In particular, the benthic B/Ca and Li/Ca records resemble trends in Holocene planktic foraminifer assemblages, suggesting to be influenced by environmental factors such as the carbonate ion effect consistent for the entire water column.",

            "abstract": "The configuration of present and historical exact-repeat mission (ERM) altimeter ground tracks determines the maximum resolution of empirical tidal maps obtained with ERM data. Although the mode-1 baroclinic tide is resolvable at mid-latitudes in the open ocean, the ability to detect baroclinic and barotropic tides near islands and complex coastlines is limited, in part, by ERM track density. In order to obtain higher resolution maps, the possibility of combining ERM and geodetic mission (GM) altimetry is considered, using a combination of spatial thin-plate splines and temporal harmonic analysis. Given the present spatial and temporal distribution of GM missions, it is found that GM data can contribute to resolving tidal features smaller than 75 km, provided the signal amplitude is greater than about 1 cm. Uncertainties in the mean sea surface and environmental corrections are significant components of the GM error budget, and methods to optimize data selection and along-track filtering are still being optimized. Application to two regions, Monterey Bay and Luzon Strait, finds evidence for complex tidal fields in agreement with independent observations and modeling studies.",

            "abstract": "Io-correlated brightness change in Io plasma torus (IPT) has been discovered by Voyager and show an evidence of local electron heating around Io. However, the amount of observation data is still limited to investigate its detail properties. In addition, the clear Io-correlated change has not been detected by EUVE and Cassini observations. Cause of the Io-correlated effect is still open issue.\nThe HISAKI satellite was launched on Sep. 14, 2013 and started observation of IPT and Jovian aurora for more than two months since the end of Dec. 2013. EUV spectrograph onboard the HISAKI satellite covers wavelength range from 55 to 145 nm, a wide slit which had a field of view of 400 x 140 arc-second was chosen to measure radial distribution and time variation of IPT.\nObservation of IPT with HISAKI showed clear Io-correlated brightness change since the Voyager observation. The amplitude of the periodic variation associated with Io’s orbital period was found. It also showed long-term variation during the HISAKI’s observation period. Through the observation period, the amplitude was larger in the short wavelength than in long wavelength. The wavelength dependence suggests significant electron heating and/or hot electron production. The Io phase dependence shows that bright region is located just downstream of Io. These are evidence of local electron heating around/downstream of Io and consistent with the Voyager result. The brightness also depends on system-III longitude and has local maximum around 120 and 300 degrees. Based on an empirical model of IPT, electron density at Io also shows maxima around the same longitudes. This suggests that the electron heating process is related with plasma density at Io. Candidate mechanisms which are responsible for the electron heating will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "We are so used to analysing the climate with the help of giant computer models (GCM’s) that it is easy to get the impression that they are indispensable. Yet anthropogenic warming is so large (roughly 0.9oC) that it turns out that it is straightforward to quantify it with more empirically based methodologies that can be readily understood by the layperson. The key is to use the CO2 forcing as a linear surrogate for all the anthropogenic effects from 1880 to the present (implicitly including all effects due to Greenhouse Gases, aerosols and land use changes). To a good approximation, double the economic activity, double the effects. The relationship between the forcing and global mean temperature is extremely linear as can be seen graphically and understood without fancy statistics, [\nLovejoy, 2014a\n] (see the attached figure and http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~gang/Lovejoy.htm). To an excellent approximation, the deviations from the linear forcing - temperature relation can be interpreted as the natural variability. For example, this direct - yet accurate approach makes it graphically obvious that the “pause” or “hiatus” in the warming since 1998 is simply a natural cooling event that has roughly offset the anthropogenic warming [\nLovejoy, 2014b\n].\nRather than trying to prove that the warming is anthropogenic, with a little extra work (and some nonlinear geophysics theory and pre-industrial multiproxies) we can disprove the competing theory that it is natural. This approach leads to the estimate that the probability of the industrial scale warming being a giant natural fluctuation is ≈0.1%: it can be dismissed. This destroys the last climate skeptic argument – that the models are wrong and the warming is natural. It finally allows for a closure of the debate.\nIn this talk we argue that this new, direct, simple, intuitive approach provides an indispensable tool for communicating – and convincing – the public of both the reality and the amplitude of anthropogenic warming.\n",

            "abstract": "We image the Nazca plate subduction zone system by detecting and (re)locating intra-slab earthquakes in southern Peru. Dense seismic arrays (PeruSE, 2013) were deployed along four lines to target geophysical characterization of the subduction system in the transition zone between flat and normal dipping segments of the Nazca plate (2-15°S). The arc volcanism is absent near the flat slab segment, and currently, the correlation between the location of the active volcanic front and corresponding slab depth is neither clear nor consistent between previously published models from seismicity. We detect 620 local earthquakes from August 2008 to February 2013 by manually picking 6559 and 4145 arrival times for P- and S-phases, respectively. We observe that the S-phase data is helpful to reduce the trade-off between origin time and depth of deeper earthquakes (>100 km). Earthquake locations are relocated to constrain the Nazca slab-mantle interface in the slab-dip transition zone using 7322 measurements of differential times of nearby earthquake pairs by waveform cross-correlation. We also employ the double-difference tomography (Zhang and Thurber, 2003) to further improve earthquake source locations and the spatial resolution of the velocity structure simultaneously. The relocated hypocenters clearly delineate the dipping Wadati-Benioff zone in the slab-dip transition zone between the shallow- (25°) to-flat dipping slab segment in the north and the normal (40°) dipping segment in the south. The intermediate-depth seismicity in the flat slab region stops at a depth of ~100 km and a horizontal distance of ~400 km from the trench. We find a significant slab-dip difference (up to 10°) between our relocated seismicity and previously published slab models along the profile region sampling the normal-dip slab at depth (>100 km).",

            "abstract": "The NOAA long term balloon-borne ozonesonde sites at Boulder, Colorado; Hilo, Hawaii; and South Pole Station, Antarctica have measured weekly ozone profiles for more than 3 decades. The ozonesonde consists of an electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) sensor interfaced with a weather radiosonde which transmits high resolution ozone and meteorological data during ascent from the surface to 30-35 km altitude. During this 30 year time period there have been several model changes in the commercially available ECC ozonesondes and radiosondes as well as three adjustments in the ozone sensor solution composition at NOAA. These changes were aimed at optimizing the ozonesonde performance. Organized intercomparison campaigns conducted at the environmental simulation facility at the Research Centre Juelich, Germany and international field site testing have been the primary process for assessing new designs, instruments, or sensor solution changes and developing standard operating procedures. NOAA has also performed in-house laboratory tests and launched 28 dual ozonesondes at various sites since 1994 to provide further comparison data to determine the optimum homogenized data set. The final homogenization effort involved reviewing and editing several thousand individual ozonesonde profiles followed by applying the optimum correction algorithms for changes in type of sensor solution composition. The results of improved data sets will be shown with long term trends and uncertainties at various altitude levels.",

            "abstract": "Energetic radiation caused by thunderstorm activity is observed at various places, such as the ground, high mountain areas, and artificial satellites. In order to investigate the radiation source and its energy distribution, we measured energetic radiation by a sounding balloon, and the ground observation. On the measurement inside/above the thundercloud, we conducted a sounding observation using a radiosonde mounted two GM tubes (for gamma-rays, and for beta/gamma-rays), in addition to meteorological instruments. The balloon passed through a region of strong echoes in a thundercloud shown by radar image, at which time an increase in counting rate of the GM tube about 2 orders of magnitude occurred at the altitude from 5 km to 7.5 km. Furthermore, the counting rate of two GM tubes indicated the tendency different depending on movement of a balloon. This result suggests that the ratio for the gamma-rays (energetic photons) of the beta-rays (energetic electrons) varies according to the place in the thundercloud. Furthermore, we carried out a ground observation of the energetic gamma rays during winter thunderstorm at a coastal area facing the Sea of Japan. Two types of the energetic radiation have been observed at this time. We report the outline of these measurements and analysis in the session of the AGU meeting.",

            "abstract": "A line of evidences reveal an increasing tree growth decline and tree mortality mainly attributable to climate warming and the warming-mediated changes in drought and other processes in many parts of world tropical, temperate and boreal forests. However, the growth responses to climate change of the widely distributed semi-arid forests are unclear. Here, we synthetically investigate the tree growth patterns during past decades and its interannual response to climate variations in Inner Asia combining the ground truth field survey and samplings, remote sensing observations and climate data. We identified a pervasive tree growth decline since mid-1990s in semi-arid forests in Inner Asia. The widely observed tree growth decline is dominantly attributable to warming-induced water stress during pre- and early growing season. Tree growth of semi-arid forests in Inner Asia is particularly susceptible to spring warming and has been suffering a prolonged growth limitation in recent decades due to spring warming-mediated water conditions. Additionally, we identified a much slower growth rate in younger trees and a lack of tree regeneration in these semi-arid forests.\nThe widely observed forest growth reduction and lack of tree regeneration over semi-arid forests in Inner Asia could predictably exert great effects on forest structure, regionally/globally biophysical and biochemical processes and the feedbacks between biosphere and atmosphere. Notably, further increases in forest stress and tree mortality could be reasonably expected, especially in context of the increase frequency and severity of high temperature and heat waves and changes in forest disturbances, potentially driving the eventual regional loss of current semi-arid forests. Given the potential risks of climate induced forest dieback, increased management attention to adaptation options for enhancing forest resistance and resilience to projected climate stress can be expected.\nHowever, the functionally realistic mechanisms beneath the pervasively climate-induced forest decline/dieback still remain unclear. Network-based global/regional long-term surveys and experiment studies are urgently needed for further understandings regarding the responses of forest/tree growth to climate warming/variations.",

            "abstract": "We present the geometry, kinematics and mechanics of large-scale active thrusting in the western Kunlunshan and southwest Tarim basin, which accounts for ~130-165km total shortening of Tarim crust at the northern margin of Tibet. The great frontal structure is the ~230km long bedding-parallel Hotian thrust sheet, which is perhaps the longest active intact thrust sheet in the world, composed of flat-lying strata of the Tarim basin sliding northward on a regional gypsum detachment at the base of the Cenozoic sequence. The toe of the Hotian thrust ramps to the surface two thirds of the way across the Tarim basin, forming the Selibuya-Mazartag hills in the Taklamakan sand desert. At the southern edge of the Tarim basin in the Kunlunshan foothills, a set of high-amplitude anticlines are growing by complex break-forward ramping and wedging in the Hotian thrust sheet as it steps up to the Cenozoic gypsum detachment from a regional Cambrian evaporate detachment that extends under Tibet. More interior structures such as the Tiklik thrust bring older strata and Proterozoic basement to the surface, together with their Cenozoic Tarim cover in the Buya basin. The Cambrian detachment also extends northward under the Tarim basin with minor hanging-wall deformation that locally warps the overlying Hotian thrust sheet, producing a complete syntectonic record in seismically imaged growth strata of its northward motion over these warps. Seismic profiles in the southwest Tarim foothill belt also reveal widespread growth strata that record much of the structural history beginning in the early Pliocene Atushi Formation. Ages of seismic reflectors are calibrated to a surface magnetostratigraphic sequence (Zheng et al., 2000). The beginning of thrusting and folding in the southwest Tarim basin north of the Tiklik thrust is dated at 3.6Ma with shortening >25km and a progressive northward propagation toward the Selibuya-Mazartag hills. The overall shortening rate is ~10 mm/yr. The gypsum detachment of the 240km long Hotian thrust sheet has an effective friction of <0.02-0.03 from its tapered wedge geometry (Suppe, 2007). In the last ~1Ma it has moved at ~13mm/y, suggesting an effective linear viscosity for the 60-100m thick gypsum detachment of <0.7-4.0x10-18 Pa s, which is consistent with a creeping detachment as opposed to frictional sliding.",

However, the over extraction of groundwater occurs in the coastland results in serious land subsidence. Groundwater systems are heterogeneous with diverse temporal-spatial patterns, and it is very difficult to quantify their complex processes. Data-driven methods can effectively capture the spatial-temporal characteristics of input-output patterns at different scales for accurately imitating dynamic complex systems with less computational requirements. In this study, we implement various data-driven methods to suitably predict the regional groundwater level variations for making countermeasures in response to the land subsidence issue in the study area. We first establish the relationship between regional rainfall, streamflow as well as groundwater levels and then construct intelligent groundwater level prediction models for the basin based on the long-term (2000-2013) regional monthly data sets collected from the Zhuoshui River basin. We analyze the interaction between hydrological factors and groundwater level variations; apply the self-organizing map (SOM) to obtain the clustering results of the spatial-temporal groundwater level variations; and then apply the recurrent configuration of nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (R-NARX) to predicting the monthly groundwater levels. As a consequence, a regional intelligent groundwater level prediction model can be constructed based on the adaptive results of the SOM. Results demonstrate that the development of the regional intelligent groundwater level prediction model produces high accuracy and stability, which is beneficial to authorities for sustainable water resources management in a basin scale.

The event transported Saharan dust from Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula in advance of the warm front of a Cyprus low pressure system. Satellite images show the dust plume covering the Negev desert and Southern Israel and moving north. The concentrations of PM10 particles measured by the air-quality monitoring network of the Israeli Ministry of the Environment in Beer-Sheba reached values > 450 μg m-3 and AOT from the AERONET station in Sde-Boker was 1.5 on the 10th. The gradual intensification of the event reached peak values on February 11th of over 1200 μg m-3 and AOT of 1.8. This was the most severe dust event in a decade.\nContinuous measurements of the fair weather vertical electric field (Ez) and vertical current density (Jz) were conducted with 1 minute temporal resolution. Meteorological data was also recorded at the site. As the dust was advected over the observation site, we noted very large fluctuations in the electrical parameters. Since the onset of the dust storm, the Ez values changed between +1000 and +8000 V m-1 while the Jz fluctuated between -10 pA m2 and +20 pA m2, both on time-scales of a few minutes. These values are a significant departures from the mean fair-weather values measured at the site, which are -~200 V m-1 and ~2 pA m2.\nThe disturbed episodes lasted for several hours on the 10th and 11th and coincided with local meteorological conditions related to the wind direction, which carried large amounts of dust particles. We interpret the rapid changes as caused by the transport of electrically charged dust. Calculation of the total electrical charge during the dust storm will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The objective for the USDA Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network Common Observatory Repository (CORe) is to provide data management services including archive, discovery, and access for consistently observed data across all 18 nodes. LTAR members have an average of 56 years of diverse historic data. Each LTAR has designated a representative ‘permanent’ site as the location’s common meteorological observatory. CORe implementation is phased, starting with meteorology, then adding hydrology, eddy flux, soil, and biology data. A design goal was to adopt existing best practices while minimizing the additional data management duties for the researchers. LTAR is providing support for data management specialists at the locations and the National Agricultural Library is providing central data management services.\nMaintaining continuity with historical observations is essential, so observations from both the legacy and new common methods are included in CORe. International standards are used to store robust descriptive metadata (ISO 19115) for the observation station and surrounding locale (WMO), sensors (Sensor ML), and activity (e.g., re-calibration, locale changes) to provide sufficient detail for novel data re-use for the next 50 years. To facilitate data submission a simple text format was designed. Datasets in CORe will receive DOIs to encourage citations giving fair credit for data providers. Data and metadata access are designed to support multiple formats and naming conventions. An automated QC process is being developed to enhance comparability among LTAR locations and to generate QC process metadata. Data provenance is maintained with a permanent record of changes including those by local scientists reviewing the automated QC results. Lessons learned so far include increase in site acceptance of CORe with the decision to store data from both legacy and new common methods. A larger than anticipated variety of currently used methods with potentially significant differences for future data use was found. Cooperative peer support among locations with the same sensors coupled with central support has reduced redundancy in procedural and data documentation.",

The amplitude is usually less than a few nT and they were observed almost always on the dayside. Most of them are interpreted as the spatial structure of small scale FACs probably generated by atmospheric gravity waves (Nakanishi et al., 2014). From a statistical analysis of correlation coefficients between a pair of the SWARM satellites, Iyemori et al. (2015) estimated the temporal scale of FAC variation to be roughly about 200 secs for meridional magnetic components and about 340 secs for longitudinal, i.e., east-west component. Based on a spectral analysis of ground geomagnetic and micro-barometric observations, we found that the spectral peaks with similar periods, i.e., 200sec or 320-350sec tend to appear statistically. This tendency supports the idea that the source of the FACs is mainly the acoustic mode of gravity waves.

            "abstract": "Recharge estimates in desert environments are complicated by several factors. Deserts have low and infrequent rainfall that frequently occur in the form of sudden thunderstorms. For the most part, precipitation on desert valleys evaporates without much, if any, infiltration due to high evaporation rates, and precipitation on mountain tops quickly turns into runoff that has little time to infiltrate where it originated. Furthermore, water flow in washes is usually sizable and rapid but short lived and ephemeral, thus difficult to gage. Here we present recharge calculations for the Amargosa Desert, NV, using a simple elevation‑dependent chloride mass-balance method modified by estimating a Minimum Effective Recharge Elevation (MERE). For each defined watershed, an average groundwater chloride concentration is used and the chloride deposition rate is assessed in the subject watersheds over all land elevations above the estimated MERE by assuming two constant spatial and temporal concentrations of chloride in precipitation and that precipitation is a function of elevation. The first chloride concentration used corresponds to contemporary values of the region and the second concentrations corresponds to an upper bound as an attempt to correct for either greater past chloride loading or a higher past precipitation with chloride concentration remaining constant. The MERE for the Amargosa desert was appraised as 1,200 m AMSL, based upon the elevation of the orifice of Cane Spring (1,237 m AMSL), one of the lowest‑elevation permanent spring on the Nevada National Security Site. This minimum elevation is the cutoff altitude for our calculations at which precipitation is considered to make a significant contribution to recharge. Elevation-dependent precipitation was evaluated relating elevation data from the online mapping software ACME Labs Mapper 2.1 and precipitation data from the PRISM Climate Group’s PRISM model. The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) developed by the Oregon State University is a knowledge-based system that uses point measurements of precipitation, temperature, and other climatic factors to produce continuous, digital grid estimates of climatic parameters. Finally, we compare our calculated estimates to those from the State Engineer.",

            "abstract": "Plains Elevated Convection At Night (PECAN) was a large field campaign that studied nocturnal mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), convective initiation, bores, and low-level jets across the central plains in the United States. MCSs are responsible for over half of the warm-season precipitation across the central U.S. plains. The rainfall from deep convection of these systems over land have been observed to be underestimated by satellite radar rainfall-retrieval algorithms by as much as 40 percent. These algorithms have a strong dependence on the generally unmeasured rain drop-size distribution (DSD).\nDuring the campaign, our group measured rainfall DSDs, precipitation fall velocities, and total precipitation in the convective and stratiform regions of MCSs using Ott Parsivel optical laser disdrometers. The disdrometers were co-located with mobile pod units that measured temperature, wind, and relative humidity for quality control purposes. Data from the operational NEXRAD radar in LaCrosse, Wisconsin and space-based radar measurements from a Global Precipitation Measurement satellite overpass on July 13, 2015 were used for the analysis.\nThe focus of this study is to compare DSD measurements from the disdrometers to radars in an effort to reduce errors in existing rainfall-retrieval algorithms. The error analysis consists of substituting measured DSDs into existing quantitative precipitation estimation techniques (e.g. Z-R relationships and dual-polarization rain estimates) and comparing these estimates to ground measurements of total precipitation. The results from this study will improve climatological estimates of total precipitation in continental convection that are used in hydrological studies, climate models, and other applications.",

This ice field is surrounded by uplands of varying morphology from hilly terrain to the northeast, plains of apparent ices interspersed with rough terrain to the east, and textured ice surrounding the mountainous terrain to the southwest. The morphology and composition of this bordering terrain will provide clues to the long-term evolution of Sputnik Planum as higher resolution visual and spectral imaging of this region are returned from the New Horizons spacecraft over the next few months. Interactions between Sputnik Planum and surrounding terrain may have involved glacial erosion and deposition. The geomorphic evolution of this region will be discussed in the context of newly-returned encounter data.",

While the scars of the repeated episodes of rifting, subduction, and collision are evident in the surficial geology of the eastern United States, the deeper crust and mantle lithospheric structure of the region also was altered during this tectonism. In general, the bulk crustal structure of the eastern US has largely remained uncharacterized before the arrival of the EarthScope, other than through analysis of a handful of regional seismic arrays. We present results of receiver function stacking of seismic data recorded from the MAGIC EarthScope Flex Array, composed of 27 STS-2 broadband stations located in a linear array that spans roughly SE-NE from Richmond,VA to Fort Wayne, Indiana. The array traverses several physiographic provinces, including the Atlantic Piedmont, Blue Ridge, Appalachian Valley and Ridge, and Appalachian Plateau. Preliminary results suggest that the crustal thickness varies significantly over short lateral distances in Virginia, and that the crust within the Appalachian Valley and Ridge contains significant layering. Characterization of the crustal thickness can help address long-standing questions regarding the relative contribution of isostasy in sustaining Appalachian topography.",

            "abstract": "Mineral dehydration-derived fluids expelled episodically during the earthquake cycle have been implicated in increasing pore fluid pressure and decreasing the effective stress and thus strength of subduction zone forearc crust. Such weakened crust would be more susceptible to damage from dynamic stresses generated by large megathrust earthquakes. We document a seismic velocity reduction in the forearc crust of the Nicoya Peninsula Costa Rica, following the Mw 7.6, 2012 earthquake that we attribute to an increase in fracture density in high pore fluid pressure, weakened crust. Using data from the Nicoya Peninsula broadband seismic network, we perform cross-correlation of two years of ambient seismic noise to retrieve Empirical Green’s Functions (EGFs) between different station pairs. Analysis of short period (1-10 s) data reveal a shallow (1-5 km depth) crustal velocity reduction of ~ 0.5% beneath station pairs within the coseismic rupture zone. This reduction is likely related to non-linear ground acceleration during coseismic deformation of the upper plate. Long-period (3-10 s) analysis, reveals a deeper (5-15 km) and stronger 0.6% coseismic velocity reduction farther from the rupture area, in the southeastern part of the Peninsula. This is the same region where a previous study documented the presence of anomalous forearc fluid pressures. Although pressurized fluids have been linked to weakened crust and an induced seismic velocity reduction beneath volcanic arcs, this is the first observation of a similar process occurring in a subduction zone environment, using ambient seismic noise monitoring. It therefore demonstrates the potential of imaging regions of high pore fluid pressure in subduction zones using temporal variations in ambient noise.",

Up to now, all CME catalogs were based on observations from a single viewpoint and hence subject to the same projection effects. However, simultaneous CME observations from the two vantage points of the STEREO/SECCHI coronagraphs raises several issues: Is a CME always visible in both telescopes? Does it look the same, etc?\nTo answer these questions, we compiled a cross-linked STEREO COR2 A/B catalog. First, we built, by visual inspection, a preliminary list of CME events observed by each of the two COR2 instruments, starting in 2007. The CME detection and tracking is carried out by a state-of-the-art supervised image segmentation technique named CORSET. \nUsing a supervised technique, we seek to overcome the intrinsic caveats that both fully automated and fully manual methodologies exhibit, in particular when dealing with a bi-segmentation problem where the features of interest show different intensity levels, morphologies, and texture embedded in an ever-changing noisy background. We have successfully applied CORSET to about 30% of the total number of events in our list. The catalog contains a comprehensive list of the temporal evolution of the relevant morphological, kinematical, and dynamical properties of the CMEs uniquely identified and cross-referenced in both datasets. Here, we briefly review the technique, and present the first results on the analysis of the main characteristics of this set of CMEs throughout the whole period of the mission.",

Despite of importance of salinity, the study on salinity analysis is limited due to sparse and lack of continuous observational data. Recently, global observation of salinity based on satellite is contributing to various fields such as salinity variability, interaction between atmosphere and salinity, and data assimilation to numerical model. It is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of salinity which is retrieved from satellite using in situ observation data. This study evaluates the accuracy of salinity retrieved from NASA Aquarius satellite during year 2012 to 2014 and investigates the annual and seasonal variation of salinity during observation period. And, we seek for the mechanism of salinity variability from rainfall. Salinity of Aquarius observation in the low-latitude is underestimated, while it is overestimated in the high-latitude. The difference of salinity between in situ (Argo) observation and satellite is about 0.5-0.6PSU in the low-latitude, and it shows over 1.0PSU in the high-latitude. Salinity distribution in the subtropics increases during year 2013 and 2014 than year 2012. In addition, salinity represents seasonal variability with maximum during the March-June and minimum during August-September in the northwestern Pacific region. Salinity distribution is consistent with rainfall distribution. Spatial distribution of salinity and comparison with rainfall observed from TRMM satellite will be presented at the conference.",

Combining the uplift and injection data through a poroelastic model allows for the resolution of a complex crustal distribution of hydraulic conductivity and pore pressure. We find that the ~5 years pore pressure increase is capable of triggering the 17 May 2012, Mw 4.8 earthquake, the largest event recorded in east Texas.

            "abstract": "It is important to estimate subtle variations of the minimum principal stress (Shmin) with depth because it controls the propagation of hydraulic fractures in normal and strike-slip faulting environments. We argue that variations of the minimum principal stress can be due to varying degrees of viscous relaxation in different formations following Sone and Zoback (2014). As the viscous relaxation occurs in a formation, the stress field becomes more isotropic, leading to an increase in the minimum principal stress. An important result of this effect is that the formations with high minimum principal stresses tend to arrest the propagation of hydraulic fractures. To quantify this ductile behavior of unconventional reservoir rocks, a power-law creep compliance relationship was developed from laboratory experiments. By taking the Laplace Transform of this creep compliance, the viscous relaxation constitutive law is obtained as, SV – Shmin = (ε0×E×t^-n)/(1-n), where SV, Shmin, ε0, E, t are overburden stress, minimum principal stress, total tectonic strain, Young’s modulus, total geological time, respectively, and n describes the tendency for viscous relaxation. This constitutive law essentially relates the measureable properties of unconventional reservoir rocks to the in situ stress. From this constitutive law, in order to estimate Shmin in a specific formation, we need to know the relevant parameters. Therefore, SV is integrated from density logs, ε0 is assumed in a generic plot but can be fitted by one measured minimum principal stress for a specific case study, and t is not important when it is large enough. With these methods and using E and n measured from rock samples, we estimate variations of the minimum principal stress in different unconventional reservoirs around North America. We also examine variations of the viscous relaxation with depth in a case study from the Permian Basin in West Texas, and compare them to the minimum principal stress measurements from Diagnostic Fracture Injection Tests (DFITs).",

The occurrence of these long-term oscillations and their periods depend on aquifer properties and boundary forcing conditions. The critical conditions and extent of the long-term oscillations were found to be determined by three non-dimensional numbers: (1) a gravity number indicating if long-term oscillations can be initiated; (2) a critical Rayleigh number predicting the development of long-term oscillations; and (3) a perturbation parameter correlating with the oscillation period. In contrast with the quasi-steady condition observed previously, the long-term oscillations represent an important characteristic of tidally influenced subterranean estuaries. These oscillations intensify mixing of discharging freshwater with recirculating seawater and affect the fate of chemicals in the subterranean estuaries and subsequent discharge to the ocean.",

However, the occurrence of the giant impact has been poorly constrained by factual evidence. On the other hand, Pluto is one of the largest Kuiper belt objects, which is highly likely to contain various interstellar volatiles, including aldehyde and ammonia. The previous studies show that these soluble volatiles are thermally polymerized in solutions at high temperatures, leading to a formation of complex insoluble organic solids [Cody et al., 2011; Kebukawa et al., 2013]. Thus, impact-induced heating could have melted the icy crust and converted the interstellar volatile into complex organic solids near the impact site.\nIn the present study, we produce complex organic solids by thermal polymerization of formaldehyde and ammonia in solutions for various temperatures. By comparing the colors (in UV-VIS range) of the produced organic solids, we constrain possible temperatures achieved in the dark areas on Pluto, assuming that they were formed by thermal alterations of interstellar volatiles. In addition, we perform hydrodynamic simulations of a giant impact onto Pluto in order to examine whether both the formations of a Charon-sized moon and the spatial distribution and achieved temperatures of heated materials can be reproduced. Based on the combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, we will examine the giant-impact hypothesis for the origin of the Pluto-Charon system.",

            "abstract": "Model calibration of groundwater flow analysis is a difficult task, especially in the complicated hydrogeological condition, because available information about hydrogeological properties is very limited. This often causes non-negligible differences between predicted results and real observations.\nWe applied the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), which is a type of data assimilation technique, to groundwater flow simulation in order to obtain a valid model that can reproduce accurately the observations. Unlike conventional manual calibration, this scheme not only makes the calibration work efficient but also provides an objective approach not depending on the skills of engineers.\nIn this study, we focused on estimating hydraulic conductivities of bedrocks and fracture zones around an underground fuel storage facility. Two different kinds of groundwater monitoring data were sequentially assimilated into the unsteady groundwater flow model via the EnKF.\nSynthetic test results showed that estimated hydraulic conductivities matched their true values and our method works well in groundwater flow analysis. Further, influences of each observation in the state updating process were quantified through sensitivity analysis.\nTo assess the feasibility under practical conditions, the assimilation experiments using real field measurements were performed. The results showed that the identified model was able to approximately simulate the behavior of groundwater flow. On the other hand, it was difficult to reproduce the observation data correctly in a specific local area. This suggests that inaccurate area is included in the assumed hydrogeological conceptual model of this site, and could be useful information for the model validation.",

            "abstract": "Low-angle normal faults (LANFs) have induced debate due to their apparent non-Andersonian behavior and lack of significant seismicity associated with slip. Dipping ~21°, the Mai’iu Fault, Woodlark Rift is an active, rapidly slipping LANF located at the transition between continental extension and seafloor spreading. Based on campaign GPS data [\nWallace et al., 2014\n] the Mai’iu Fault is thought to slip at 7-9 mm/yr, accommodating a large fraction of total basinal extension, although it is uncertain whether slip is seismic or aseismic. Surface geomorphology indicates that the fault scarp is not significantly eroded despite high rainfall and ~3000 m relief. We have obtained 15 rock samples (~5 m spacing) from the lowermost Mai’iu Fault scarp in order to determine Holocene slip rate and style over the last ~10 kyr using cosmogenic 10Be in quartz. This slip direction-parallel profile in exposed bedrock is supported by a suite of soil samples for 10Be analysis, which extend our temporal coverage. We model exposure age data in terms of slip rate and style by identification of discontinuities within the profile. Of particular interest is whether slip is seismic or aseismic. In addition we analyze the structure of conglomeratic strata and abandoned, back-rotated rider blocks in the Mai’iu Fault hanging wall, which record Quaternary splay faulting and tilting in response to sustained LANF slip. 20 quartz pebble samples were obtained from hanging wall conglomerates for the purpose of calculating cosmogenic burial (26Al/10Be) ages. These constrain the chronology of Quaternary hanging wall deformation. High-angle (~50°) faulting competes with LANF slip at <2 km depths, with high-angle faults cutting the main LANF and exposing footwall metabasalt up to 2 km north of the Mai’iu Fault. Past splay faulting is recorded in the progressive back-tilting and folding of the Gwoira rider block in a ~2 km deep depression in the corrugated Mai’iu fault plane. Our results provide new constraints on LANF strength and slip behavior.",

However, there has been hitherto limited attention towards the measurement of vertical temperature profiles extending from the urban surface through to the urban boundary layer. Knowledge of these profiles, through how they vary over different local urban morphologies, and develop with respect to synoptic meteorological conditions, are important towards several aspects of UHI research; these include validating modelling urban canopy lapse rate profiles or estimating the growth of urban plumes. In this study, we utilised temperature sensors attached onto remote controlled aerial quadcopter platforms to measure urban temperature and humidity profiles in Singapore, which is a rapidly urbanizing major tropical metropolis. These profiles were measured from the surface to ~100 m above ground level, a height which includes all of the urban canopy and parts of the urban boundary layer. Initial results indicate significant variations in stability measured over different land uses (e.g. urban park, high-rise residential, commercial); these profiles are also temporally dynamic, depending on the time of day and larger-scale weather conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Alpine Fault, New Zealand, is a plate boundary with slip rate of ~ 37 mm/yr, with major historic seismic events. The Deep Fault Drilling Program (DFDP) into the Alpine Fault had two phases in 2011 and 2014, with main objectives of fault-zone sampling and borehole instrumentations. As complementary work to the drilling, we analyze the frictional properties of the Alpine Fault gauge on samples collected at three field exposures (Waikukupa, Cataclasite, and Gaunt) at distances up to 70 km away from DFDP-2. The bulk samples (1-3 kg) were first manually disintegrated without shear, and then sieved to the 250-350 micron fraction. The gouge was sheared in a Confined Rotary Cell (CROC) in the natural, moisture conditions, at slip-velocity range of 0.01 m/s to 0.5 m/s (constant and stepped) with a constant normal stress of 2-3 MPa. Runs included monitoring the CO2 and H2O emission, in addition to the standard mechanical parameters.\nThe preliminary results show an initial friction coefficient ~0.6. Initial slip at low velocities (0.01 m/s) display gentle velocity strengthening, that changed to a drastic weakening (~50%) at velocity of 0.5 m/s. This weakening was associated with intense slip localization along a hard, dark slip surface within the gouge zone. After the establishment of this slip surface, the low friction remains for the following low slip-velocity steps.\nFuture work will include: (1) systematic investigation of the dynamic friction dependence on the slip-velocity and slip-distance; (2) analysis of the relations between friction, mineralogy and the release of CO2/H2O; and (3) application of the experimental results to characterize natural fault behavior.",

            "abstract": "Improved knowledge about fundamental physical processes, advances in computing power, and a focus on integrated modeling has resulted in complex environmental and water resources models. However, the high-dimensionality of these models adds to overall uncertainty and poses issues when evaluating them for sensitivity, parameter identification, and optimization through rigorous computer experiments. The parameter screening method of elementary effects (EE) offers a perfect blend of useful properties inherited from inexpensive one-at-a time methods and expensive global techniques. Since its development EE has undergone improvements largely on the sampling side with over seven sampling strategies developed during the last decade. These strategies can broadly be classified into trajectory-based and polytope-based schemes. Trajectory-based strategies are more widely used, conceptually simple, and generally use the principle of spreading the sample points in the input hyper-space as widely as possible through oversampling. Due to this their implementation have been found to be impractically time consuming for high-dimensional cases (when # input factors > 50, say). Here, we enhanced the Sampling for Uniformity (SU) (Khare et al., 2015), a trajectory-based EE sampling scheme founded on the dual principle of spread and uniformity. This new scheme – enhanced SU (eSU) is the same as SU except the manner in which intermediate trajectory points are formed. It was tested for sample uniformity, spread, sampling time, and screening efficiency. Experiments were repeated with combinations of the number of trajectories and oversampling size. Preliminary results indicate that eSU is superior to SU by some margin with respect to all four criteria. Interestingly, in the case of eSU oversampling size had no impact on any of the evaluation criteria except linear increament in sampling time. Pending further investigation, this has opened a new avenue to substantially bring down the sampling time while concentrating on other aspects of the EE method to improve its usefulness as a low cost and reliable model evaluation tool.",

            "abstract": "Fire is increasingly appreciated as a threat to peatlands and their carbon stocks. The global peatland carbon pool exceeds that of global vegetation and is similar to the current atmospheric carbon pool. Under pristine conditions, most of the peat carbon stock is protected from burning, and resistance to fire has increased peat carbon storage in high latitude regions over long time scales. This, in part, is due to the high porosity and storage coefficient of surface peat, which minimizes water table variability and maintains wet conditions even during drought. However, higher levels of disturbance associated with warming and increasing human activities are triggering state changes and the loss of resiliency in some peatland systems. This presentation will summarize information on burn area and severity in peatlands under undisturbed scenarios of hydrologic self-regulation, and will assess the consequences of warming and drying on peatland vegetation and wildfire behaviour. Our goal is to predict where and when peatlands will become more vulnerable to deep smouldering, given the importance of deep peat layers to global carbon cycling, permafrost stability, and a variety of other ecosystem services in northern regions. Results from two major wildfire seasons (2004 in Alaska and 2014 in the Northwest Territories) show that biomass burning in peatlands releases similar amounts of carbon to the atmosphere as patterns of burning in upland forests, but that peatlands are less vulnerable to severe burning that tends to occur in boreal forests during late season fire activity.",

            "abstract": "Most studies quantifying the effects of permafrost thaw on carbon cycling focus on gradual top-down thawing of permafrost. However, the thaw of ice-rich permafrost may trigger more abrupt changes via thermokarst and thermal erosion. While the slow gradual deepening of the seasonally thawed layer affects permafrost carbon at regional scales, thermokarst and thermal erosion can potentially affect large volumes of soil at local scales. These processes expose previously-frozen carbon to microbial processes but also alter hydrology. The fate of permafrost carbon in these situations depends on whether material is exposed to aerobic or anaerobic conditions, which will determine the overall rate of carbon mineralization as well as the balance between carbon dioxide and methane emissions. We are synthesizing process-level studies to parameterize a book-keeping model to track the effects of thermokarst disturbance on changes in carbon storage and in carbon dioxide and methane emissions. The goal of this modelling is to enable a comparison of changes in carbon storage and greenhouse gas exchanges between those resulting from deepened active layer versus those due to thermokarst and thermal erosion. The book-keeping model is based on state-and-transition conceptual models for generalized abrupt thaw trajectories in the northern permafrost region. Our initial results show that cumulative carbon release associated with wetland thermokarst are equivalent to up to 55% of estimated carbon emissions stemming from top-down thaw, suggesting that these localized, abrupt thaw processes are important to consider in assessments of permafrost feedbacks to climate.",

Proxy-based reanalyses aim to make optimum use of both proxy and model data while presenting paleoclimate information in an accessible format—they will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in the future of paleoclimate research. In the Paleoclimate Reanalysis Project (PaleoR) we use ‘off-line’ data assimilation to constrain the CESM1(CAM5) Last Millennial Ensemble (LME) simulation with a globally distributed multivariate proxy dataset, producing a decadal resolution reanalysis of the past millennium. Discrete time periods are ‘reconstructed’ by using anomalous (±0.5σ) proxy climate signals to select an ensemble of climate state analogues from the LME. Prior to assimilation the LME simulates internal variability that is temporally inconsistent with information from the proxy archive. After assimilation the LME is highly correlated to almost all included proxy data, and dynamical relationships between modeled variables are preserved; thus providing a ‘real-world’ view of climate system evolution during the past millennium. Unlike traditional regression based approaches to paleoclimatology, PaleoR is unaffected by temporal variations in teleconnection patterns. Indices representing major modes of global ocean-atmosphere climate variability can be calculated directly from PaleoR spatial fields. PaleoR derived ENSO, SAM, and NAO indices are consistent with observations and published multiproxy reconstructions. The computational efficiency of ‘off-line’ data assimilation allows easy incorporation and evaluation of new proxy data, and experimentation with different setups and model simulations. PaleoR is our first attempt at a global paleoclimate reanalysis and we have identified several opportunities for future improvements.

Previous studies of tidal dissipation on icy satellites, however, have either assumed a static ocean, or ignored the effect of the ice lid on subsurface ocean dynamics. In this study, we examine inertial effects on tidal deformation of satellites with a dynamic ocean overlain by an ice lid based on viscoelasto-gravitational theory. Although ocean dynamics is treated in a simplified fashion, we find a resonant configuration when the phase velocity of ocean gravity waves is similar to that of the tidal bulge. This condition is achieved when a subsurface ocean is thin (<1 km). The enhanced deformation (increased h2 and k2 Love numbers) near the resonant configuration would lead to enhanced tidal heating in the solid lid. A static ocean formulation gives an accurate result only if the ocean thickness is much larger than the resonant thickness. The resonant configuration strongly depends on the properties of the shell; a thicker shell and a more rigid shell leads to a thinner resonant thickness. This result demonstrates the importance of the presence of a shell on tidal dissipation.",

The general consensus among scientists is that wind speeds have declined over the past century.

Therefore, this study provides a climatological assessment of wind speed trends across Brazil using in-situ and climatic model datasets from 1980–2014. Seasonal and annual trends are determined across the study area using linear and quantile regression. Geographical Information Systems is used to interpret and understand how wind speed trends have changed across Brazil. Preliminary results show two distinct wind speed trend patterns exist across Brazil. The largest wind speed magnitude increases occurred along northeastern and coastal Brazil, where as decreasing wind speeds have been observed for central and southeastern Brazil. Furthermore, quantile regression also shows the largest seasonal and annual wind trend fluctuations occur at lower (5%) and upper percentiles (95%) for both in-situ and climate model datasets. As a result, these findings indicate possible alterations in atmospheric and oceanic circulations could be affecting wind speed trends across Brazil and warrants further investigation and research.",

The unit includes a diverse range of surface textures (e.g., pāhoehoe, ʻaʻā, and transitional lavas), and structural features (e.g., streamlined islands, pits, and interactions with older tumuli). However, these features are generally below the threshold of visibility within previously acquired airborne and spacecraft data.\nIn this study, we have generated unique, high-resolution digital images using low-altitude Kite Aerial Photography (KAP) system during field campaigns in 2014 and 2015 (National Park Service permit #HAVO-2012-SCI-0025). The kite-based mapping platform (nadir-viewing) and a radio-controlled gimbal (allowing pointing) provided similar data as from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), but with longer flight time, larger total data volumes per sortie, and fewer regulatory challenges and cost. Images acquired from KAP and UAVs are used to create orthomosaics and DEMs using Multi-View Stereo-Photogrammetry (MVSP) software. The 3-Dimensional point clouds are extremely dense, resulting in a grid resolution of < 2 cm. Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) / Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data have been collected for these areas and provide a basis of comparison or “ground truth” for the photogrammetric data. Our results show a good comparison with LiDAR/TLS data, each offering their own unique advantages and potential for data fusion.",

            "abstract": "The expansion and contraction of the late Pleistocene Laurentide ice-sheet (LIS) was the crucial determining factor for the geomorphic features and shelf and slope sediment mobility on the eastern Canadian continental margin, with abundant mass-transport deposits (MTDs) seaward of ice margins on the upper slope. Here, we report for the first time sediment failure and mass-transport deposits from the central Grand Banks slope in the Salar and Carson petroleum basins. High-resolution seismic profiles and multibeam bathymetry show numerous sediment failure scarps in 500-1600 m water depth. There is no evidence for an ice margin on the upper slope younger than MIS 6.\nCentimeter-scale X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF), grain size, and oxygen isotope data from piston cores constrain sediment processes over the past 46 ka. Geotechnical measurements including Atterberg limit tests, vane shear measurements and triaxial and multi-stage isotropic consolidation tests allowed us to assess the instability on the continental margin. Cores with continuous undisturbed stratigraphy in contourite silty muds show normal downcore increase in bulk density and undrained peak shear strength. Heinrich (H) layers are identifiable by a marked increase in the bulk density, high Ca (ppm), increase in iceberg-rafted debris and lighter δ18O in the polar planktonic foram Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral): with a few C-14 dates they provide a robust chronology. There is no evidence for significant supply of sediment from the Grand Banks at the last-glacial maximum. Mass-transport deposits (MTD) are marked by variability in the bulk density, undrained shear strength and little variation in bulk density or Ca (ppm) values. The MTD are older than 46 ka on the central Grand Banks slope, whereas younger MTDs are present in southern Flemish Pass. Factor of safety calculations suggest the slope is statically stable up to gradients of 10°, but more intervals of silty mud may fail during earthquake-induced cyclic loading based on Atterberg tests. By analogy with the Holocene, contourites deposited in MIS 5e may be particularly silty and form a “weak layer” susceptible to failure.",

To better understand the seasonal impacts of bark beetle infestation on water quality, samples were collected regularly over two overlapping snow free seasons at surface water intakes of six water treatment facilities in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado displaying varying levels of bark beetle infestation (high >40%, moderate 20-40%, and low <20%). Organic carbon concentrations were typically 3 to 6 times higher in waters sourced from high beetle-impacted watersheds compared to moderate and low impact watersheds, revealing elevated specific ultraviolet absorbance, fluorescence, and humic-like intensity indicative of elevated aromatic carbon signatures. Accordingly, an increase in disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation potential of 400 to 600% was quantified when contrasted with watersheds containing less tree mortality. Beetle impact exasperated seasonal increases in carbon loading and DBP formation potential following both runoff and precipitation events indicating windows when enhanced water treatment may be utilized by water providers in highly infested regions. Additionally, elevated carbon concentrations throughout the summer and fall along with peaks following precipitation events provide evidence of shifting hydrologic flow paths in areas experiencing high forest mortality from decreased tree water uptake and interception. Collectively, these results demonstrate the need for continued watershed protection and monitoring with a changing climate as the resultant perturbations can have adverse effects on biogeochemistry and water quality in heavily impacted areas.",

As the important \"water tower\", there are 1,091 lakes of more than 1.0 km2 in the QTP areas, which account for 49.4% of the total area of lakes in China. Some studies focus on the lake area changes of the QTP areas, which mainly use the middle-resolution remote sensing data (e.g. Landsat TM). In this study, the coarse-resolution time series remote sensing data, MODIS data at a spatial resolution of 250m, was used to monitor the lake area changes of the QTP areas during the last 15 years. The dataset is the MOD13Q1 and the Normal Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used to identify the lake area when the NDVI is less than 0. The results show the obvious inner-annual changes of most of the lakes. Therefore the annually average and maximum lake areas are calculated based on the time series remote data, which can better quantify the change characteristics than the single scene of image data from the middle-resolution data. The results indicate that there are big spatial variances of the lake area changes in the QTB. The natural driving factors are analyzed for revealing the causes of changes.",

            "abstract": "Bacterial pathogens are a major cause of water quality impairment in the United States. Freshwater ecosystems provide the ecosystem service of reducing pathogen levels by diluting and removing pathogens as water flows from source areas through the river network. However, the integration of field-scale monitoring data and watershed-scale hydrologic models to estimate pathogen loads and removal in varied aquatic ecosystems is still limited. In this study we applied a biogeochemical river network model (the Framework for Aquatic Modeling in the Earth System or FrAMES) and utilized available field data the Oyster R. watershed, a small (51.7 km2) draining coastal New Hampshire (NH, USA), to quantify pathogen removal at the river network scale, using fecal coliform as an indicator. The Oyster R. Watershed is comprised of various land use types, and has had its water quality monitored for fecal coliform, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity since 2001. Water samples were also collected during storm events to account for storm responses. FrAMES was updated to incorporate the dominant processes controlling fecal coliform concentrations in aquatic ecosystems: spatially distributed terrestrial loading, in-stream removal, dilution, and downstream transport. We applied an empirical loading function to estimate the terrestrial loading of fecal coliform across flow conditions. Data was collected from various land use types across a range of hydrologic conditions. The loading relationship includes total daily precipitation, antecedent 24-hour rainfall, air temperature, and catchment impervious surface percentage. Attenuation is due to bacterial “die-off” and dilution processes. Results show that fecal coliform input loads varied among different land use types. At low flow, fecal coliform concentrations were similar among watersheds. However, at high flow the concentrations were significantly higher in urbanized watersheds than forested watersheds. The mainstem had lower fecal coliform concentrations at both low and high flow due to dilution and in-stream processing. Mapping the spatial and temporal distribution fecal coliform sources and removal can help improve water quality management.",

This topic remains challenging in part due to the lack of high-quality earth models, and also because numerous factors may significantly affect surface wave amplitudes. These include: 1) source directivity, 2) anelastic attenuation, 3) multipathing and focusing/defocusing, and 4) local amplification.\nTo better understand the physical causes of the surface wave amplitude variations across Eastern Asia, we model seismic wave propagation using the crustal and uppermost mantle model constructed by Shen et al. (2015), which was produced using surface wave datasets and which captured many geological features. We apply the spectral element method (SEM) and a node-based finite-difference approach perform Rayleigh wave waveform modeling across Eastern Asia.\nBy measuring and analyzing the results of the surface wave waveform modeling, we separate and quantify the effects on surface wave amplitudes; notably , focusing/defocusing and local amplification effects. Our results illuminate the causes of observed amplitude variations across Eastern Asia from earthquake and anthropogenic sources and guide future research based on surface wave amplitudes.",

The schemes are compared using spatial, temporal, and pattern criteria against surface observations. The spatial and temporal criteria are defined by season, diurnal cycle, and topography; the pattern, is based on clusters derived using clustering analysis. Results show that the drag scheme reduces the positive bias of low wind speeds, but over-corrects the high wind speeds producing a magnitude-increasing negative bias with increasing speed. Both other schemes underestimate the most frequent low-speed mode and overestimate the high-speeds. Error characteristics of all schemes respond to seasonal and diurnal cycle changes. The Topo-wind experiment shows the best agreement with the observation quantiles in summer and fall, the best representation of the diurnal cycle in these seasons, and reduces the bias of all surface stations near the coast. In more stable conditions the Topo-wind scheme shows a larger negative bias. The cluster analysis reveals a correlation between bias and mean speed from the Mellor-Yamada and Yonsei University schemes that is not present when the drag scheme is used. When the drag scheme is used the bias correlates with wind direction; the bias increases when the meridional wind component is negative. This pattern corresponds to trajectories with more land interaction with the highest biases found in northwest circulation clusters.",

During the past century, decreased fluvial water and sediment discharge, increasing land reclamation, changing climate, and rising sea level have had an ever-increasing impact on river deltas, particularly those deltas bordering Southeast Asia. Using six stages of navigational and bathymetric chart data from 1906 to 2013 and 2 years (2012,2013) single-beam bathymetric data, together with more than 50 years of fluvial discharge data, we document the impact of human activities on the Pearl River Delta and its estuary at Lingding Bay. Between 1906 and 2010, land reclamation decreased the bay’s water area by ~300 km2 (>17%), mostly at the expense of the shrinking intertidal and shallow subtidal mudflats. Before 1980, the estuary was mainly governed by natural processes with slight net deposition, whereas after 1980 dredging in the estuary and large port engineering projects changed the estuarine topography by shallowing the shoals and deepening the troughs. From 1955 to 2010, the water volume of Lingding Bay decreased by 536 × 106 m3 for a net decrease of 9.7 × 106 m3 a year, which indicates that approximately 9.7 Mt/yr of sediment was deposited in Lingding Bay during that period. In 2012 and 2013, large-scale human activities within Lingding Bay included continued dredging plus a surge of sand excavation that changed local water depths by ±5 m/yr, far exceeding the range of natural topographic evolution in the estuary. The impacts of various human activities have significantly changed submarine topography in Lingding Bay of the complex Pearl River Estuary. With continuing economic expansion in the Pearl River Delta, Lingding Bay should continue to shrink in both area and water volume.",

However, its existence depends on near-surface permafrost, which increases water availability for trees, and the boundary of the forest closely follows the permafrost zone. Therefore, the degradation of near-surface permafrost due to forecasted warming trends during the 21st century is expected to affect the larch forest in Siberia. However, predictions of how warming trends will affect this forest vary greatly, and many uncertainties remain about land-atmospheric interactions within the ecosystem. We developed an integrated land surface model to analyze how the Siberian larch forest will react to current warming trends. This model analyzed interactions between vegetation dynamics and thermo-hydrology and showed that, under climatic conditions predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios 2.6 and 8.5, annual larch net primary production (NPP) increased about 2 and 3 times, respectively, by the end of 21st century compared with that in the 20th century. Soil water content during larch growing season showed no obvious trend, even after decay of surface permafrost and accompanying sub-surface runoff. A sensitivity test showed that the forecasted warming and pluvial trends extended leafing days of larches and reduced water shortages during the growing season, thereby increasing productivity.",

            "abstract": "The fluidity of debris flows containing a wide range of grain sizes is higher than that of debris flows containing fully sorted sediment. This is due to the phase shift of fine sediment in the debris flow. In the phase shift, fine sediment is mixed with pore water and behaves as a fluid phase, although sediment generally behaves as a solid phase. The pore fluid density and representative particle diameter increase with the percentage of fine sediment, which behaves as the fluid phase (the percentage of the phase shift). Studies have estimated the percentage of the phase shift from the change in the equilibrium concentration or friction coefficient. However, the two methods have been applied separately, and no study has examined whether the estimation of phase shift using the equilibrium concentration agrees with that obtained from the friction coefficient. Therefore, we conducted debris flow flume experiments over an erodible bed to apply the two methods and compare the estimations of the phase shift. Five sediment grain size distributions were used, and the equilibrium concentrations, deposition slopes, and flow depths were measured. The pore fluid densities were calculated so that the theoretical equilibrium concentrations and friction coefficients derived from the constitutive equations for debris flow agreed with the experimental equilibrium concentrations and friction coefficients. The pore fluid densities of some grain size distributions calculated using the equilibrium concentration disagreed with those calculated using the friction coefficient. This disagreement was affected by the grain size distribution. Therefore, the grain size distribution should be considered when estimating the influence of the phase shift.",

In addition, it is also a powerful technique with abilities enabling simultaneous measurements of aerosols and their gaseous precursors, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). To exploit its further applications, we are have developed the photovoltaic-driven MAX-DOAS system, called Eco-MAXDOAS. By utilizing the Eco-MAXDOAS, we expect to make multi-component air quality observations possible in areas with problems on stable power supply. For this development, we removed a temperature controller to reduce the power consumption. Instead, a shutter was introduced just before the entrance slit of the spectrometer. With this modification, it was made possible to take dark count measurements more often than for the normal MAX-DOAS instrument by closing the shutter between observations at different elevation angles. We tested the Eco-MAXDOAS and found that the spectrometer temperature varied by less than ±0.3 degrees for 3 minutes interval of changing elevation angles. Using dark count data taken before and after scattered sun light observations, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio(SNR) was estimated to be about 10000. This supports that analysis for a differential absorption as small as 10-4 (0.01%) is possible. In addition, we compared the aerosol and NO2 data retrieved from Eco-MAXDOAS and MAX-DOAS observations, and we confirmed that the two retrieved values were usually almost the same but occasionally showed significant differences. To investigate the cause, we devised the 4AZ-MAXDOAS system, a set of 4 MAX-DOAS instruments directed toward different azimuth angels of north, south, east, and west. The observation with the 4AZ-MAXDOAS confirmed that the data can show significant differences depending on the azimuth angle. We concluded that the differences were caused by the spatial inhomogeneity of atmospheric components, supporting the consistency between Eco-MAXDOAS and MAX-DOAS data.",

            "abstract": "Most gravel-transporting rivers with perennial base flow are armored, with bed surface grain size distributions that are coarser than the subsurface. In contrast, ephemerally flowing rivers, which are commonly flash flood-dominated, are typically unarmored. Both high sediment supply and elevated shear stresses have been identified as processes that may prevent armor development. We use a one-dimensional morphodynamic model that conserves mass and momentum, and tracks grain size distributions of bedload, surface, and subsurface to explore the parameter space of the armor ratio (Surface D50 / Subsurface D50) varying sediment supply, flood peak magnitude, flood duration, and base flow magnitude, including ephemeral hydrographs with no base flow. Our base case in terms of sediment supply, grain size distribution, and hydrograph is based on the Nahal Yatir, an ephemerally flowing river in the Negev Desert. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantitatively rank the importance of each input parameter. We found that armor ratio was the most sensitive to changes in base flow magnitude. In perennially flowing rivers, base flows can preferentially transport smaller grain sizes. In ephemerally flowing rivers, the modeling suggests that a large percentage of flow occurs above the threshold of motion for all grain sizes, transporting all grain sizes nearly equally, resulting in minimal armor development. We find that sediment supply rate and hydrograph shape have measurable but smaller influences on armoring.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies on interactions between the atmospheric waves and ionospheric perturbations concluded that the acoustic-gravity waves triggered by solid earth events such as earthquakes, tsunamis and underground nuclear tests may be used in detecting the ionospheric perturbations. Ionospheric perturbations have been observed using sounding radars and GPS remote sensing techniques since 1970s. As primary examples, ionospheric disturbances associated with the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011 were observed and analyzed using GPS measurements.\nIn this work, we processed GPS stations in South Korea and analyzed traveling ionospheric disturbances that were coincident with the 2014 South Korean earthquake. The 31 March 2014 earthquake occurred at 19:48 UTC and the magnitude of this event was registered to be 5.0 Mw. This earthquake is the fourth strongest in South Korea since records began. After analyzing GPS measurements from nearby stations, strong ionospheric perturbations were observed about 20 minutes after the reported event, and the disturbances were shown to have primarily a wave train with periods of 60-120 minutes. The maximum VTEC perturbations turned out to be between 0.6 to 1.3 TECU. In this research, we will analyze the characteristics of the detected ionospheric perturbations associated with the earthquake and compare these results with those from man-made earthquakes such as underground nuclear tests. These findings are expected to verify our modeling results. We also hope to get a better understanding of the influence of both natural hazards and man-made hazards on the temporal and spatial variability of the global ionosphere",

            "abstract": "Exploitation of the Alberta oil sands, the world’s third largest crude oil reserve, requires fresh water from the Athabasca River, an allocation of 4.4% of the mean annual flow. This allocation takes into account seasonal fluctuations but not long-term climatic variability and change. This paper examines the decadal-scale variability in river discharge in the Athabasca River Basin (ARB) with 1) a generalized-least-squares (GLS) regression analysis of the trend and variability in gauged flow, and 2) a 900-year tree-ring reconstruction of the water-year flow of the Athabasca River at Athabasca, Alberta. The GLS analysis removes confounding transient trends related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Pacific North American mode (PNA). It shows long-term declining flows throughout the ARB. The tree-ring record reveals a larger range of flows and severity of hydrologic deficits than those captured by the instrumental records that are the basis for surface water allocation. It includes periods of sustained low flow of multiple decades in duration, suggesting the influence of the PDO and PNA teleconnections. These results together demonstrate that low-frequency variability must be considered in ARB water allocation, which has not been the case. We show that the current and projected surface water allocations from the Athabasca River for the exploitation of the Alberta oil sands are based on an untenable assumption of the representativeness of the short instrumental record.",

            "abstract": "Most of the traditional Rossby wave propagation studies are based on zonally averaged or varying basic flow, in which the meridional component was often neglected. The meridional propagation of the stationary Rossby waves (SRW) is trapped in the easterly wind belt in this kind of flow. Therefore, the interaction between the westerly and easterly belts through SRW propagation is impossible in this case. However, observations has manifested the interactions are occurring in the real atmosphere. So what’s the mechanism of these interactions? Is it really impossible for SRW propagating across the zero zonal wind latitude? Although several studies have suggested that the inclusion of the meridional component of the background flow can make SRW across the critical latitude, there are still questions remained in this issue.\n We considered two-dimensional spherical Rossby wave theory in a horizontally non-uniform basic state with both zonal and meridional component included, then the propagation behaviors in this situation was analyzed much different with those in the without-v flow. Conditions sufficient for the existence of one propagating wave are obtained, and the meridional group velocity of the wave is shown to have the same direction as the meridional basic wind at the traditional critical latitude. It is concluded that stationary waves with a specific wavelength can propagate across the easterlies from south (north) to north (south) via southerly (northerly) flows. Hence, energy transport by stationary waves on a horizontally non-uniform basic state may produce interhemispheric responses that could pass through the tropical easterly belt. Finally the wave ray tracing method and barotropic model are employed to verify the WKB theory in idealized and climatological flows. Results are consistently in agreement with the theoretical results. This study has an implication for a possible way in the interhemispheric teleconnections and tropical-extratropical interactions, which may be significant, but attracting few attentions.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we make use of the active-source records collected by the TAIGER (TAiwan Integrated GEodynamics Research) project in 2008 at nearly 1400 locations on the island of Taiwan and the surrounding ocean bottom. We manually picked the first-arrival times from the waveform records to obtain a set of highly accurate P-wave traveltimes. Among the 1400 receivers, more than 1000 were deployed along four almost linear cross-island profiles with inter-seismometer spacing down to 200 m. This ground-truth dataset provides strong constrains on the structure between the exactly known active sources and densely distributed receivers, which can be used to calibrate the seismic structure in the upper crust in Taiwan. In this study, we use this dataset to image the two-dimensional P-wave structure along the four linear profiles. A wavelet parameterization of the model is adopted to achieve an objective and data-adaptive multiscale resolution to the 2D structures. Rigorous estimations of resolution lengths were also conducted to quantify the spatial resolutions of the tomography inversions. The resulting 2D models yield first-arrival time predictions that are in excellent agreement with the observations. The seismic structures along the 2D profiles display strong lateral variations (up to 80% relative to regional average) with more realistic amplitudes of velocity perturbations and spatial patterns consistent with geological zonations of Taiwan",

These events are characterized by an anomalously slow seismic rupture, with their true long-period seismic moment, and hence, tsunami potential, deceptively concealed from short-period waves and in particular felt accelerations. In the context of the deployment of long-period ocean-bottom sensors in epicentral areas, we explore simple but robust ways to quantify source parameters which could potentially lead to the real-time identification of tsunami earthquakes in the near field. We use records of 2011 Tohoku aftershocks on the JAMSTEC stations deployed off the coast of Japan in the wake of the mainshock. Because seismic phases are not resolvable at short distances, we simply consider an integrated measurement Ω of the square of pressure variations, sharing the philosophy of Boatwright and Choy's (1986) seismic energy, and compare this parameter, scaled to seismic moment, with other discriminants, such as Newman and Okal's (1998) energy-to-moment ratio, Θ, Okal et al.'s (2002) T-wave parameter Γ, or Okal's (2013) parameter Φ combining (in the far field) body-wave duration and energy.

The fragility functions are derived from two approaches: 1) empirical approach based on field observations of impacts to agriculture from the 2006 eruption of Merapi volcano in Indonesia and 2) the FOSM (first-order second-moment) analytical approach based on distribution and thickness of volcanic ash observed from the 1980 eruption of Mt. Saint Helens and agricultural facility specifications in Korea.\nFragility function to each agricultural commodity class is presented by a cumulative distribution function of the generalized extreme value distribution. Different functions are developed to estimate production losses from outdoor and greenhouse farming. Seasonal climate influences vulnerability of each agricultural crop and is found to be a crucial component in determining fragility of agricultural commodities to an ash fall. In the study, the seasonality coefficient is established as a multiplier of fragility function to consider the seasonal vulnerability.\nYields of the different agricultural commodities are obtained from Korean Statistical Information Service to create a baseline for future agricultural volcanic loss estimation. Numerically simulated examples of scenario ash fall events at Mt. Baekdu volcano are utilized to illustrate the application of the developed fragility functions.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by a grant ‘Development of Advanced Volcanic Disaster Response System considering Potential Volcanic Risk around Korea’ [MPSS-NH-2015-81] from the Natural Hazard Mitigation Research Group, Ministry of Public Safety and Security of Korea.\n",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, ambient noise tomography (ANT) has become an estimated method to construct the earth’s interior structures thanks to its advantage in extracting surface waves from cross-correlations of ambient noise without using earthquake data. However, most of previous ambient noise tomography studies concentrate on short and intermediate periods (<50sec) due to the dominant energy of the microseism at these periods. Studies of long period surface waves from cross-correlation of ambient noise are limited.\nIn this study, we verify the accuracy of the long period (50-250sec) surface wave (Rayleigh wave) from ambient noise by comparing both dispersion curves and seismic waveforms from ambient noise with those from earthquake records quantitatively. After that, we calculate vertical-vertical cross-correlation functions among more than1800 USArray Transportable Array stations and extract high quality interstation phase velocity dispersion curves from them at 10-200 sec periods. Then, we adopt a finite frequency ambient noise tomography method based on Born approximation to obtain high resolution phase velocity maps using the obtained dispersion measurements at 10-150 sec periods. Afterward, we extract local dispersion curves from these dispersion maps and invert them for 1D shear wave velocity profiles at individual grids using a Bayesian Monte Carlo method. Finally, a 3D shear velocity model is constructed by assembling all the 1D Vs profiles. Our 3D model is overall similar to other models constructed using earthquake surface waves and body waves. In summary, we demonstrate that the long period surface waves can be extracted from ambient noise, and the long period dispersion measurements from ambient noise are as accurate as those from earthquake data and can be used to construct 3D lithospheric structure from surface down to lithosphere/asthenosphere depths.",

            "abstract": "The last deglacial changes of the water column conditions in the Northwest Pacific were reconstructed using geochemical and isotope proxies (biogenic opal, CaCO3, total organic carbon (TOC), redox sensitive elements, bulk nitrogen isotopes (δ15N), and silicon isotopes (δ30Sidiatom) of diatom frustules) along with the published data (alkenone temperatures and benthic foraminiferal faunas) at core GH02-1030 recovered from the slope off Tokachi. Age model for core GH02-1030 was determined using both planktonic and benthic foraminiferal AMC 14C dates (Ikehara et al., 2006). Alkenone sea surface temperature (SST) shows that biogenic opal productivity was related to the degree of spring-summer mixed layer depth (MLD). Biogenic opal and TOC contents change almost in parallel. δ30Sidiatom values are high (~+1‰) during the Holocene and low (~-0.4‰) during the last glacial maximum. During the Bølling-Allerød (BA) and the Pre-Boreal (PB), silicic acid utilization represented by δ30Sidiatom increased when the biogenic opal productivity and export TOC productivity are high under shoaling of spring-summer MLD. The BA and the PB intervals contain laminated sediment layers, which are characterized by increases of CaCO3 contents, bulk δ15N values, and redox element concentrations (Mo/Al, Cd/Al, and U/Al). All these indicate low dissolved oxygen content of the bottom water during the BA and PB periods, which is supported by the good preservation of dysoxic benthic foraminifera. In addition, compared to the Holocene biogenic opal productivity and related silicic acid utilization, the high δ15N values during the BA and the PB seemed to be attributed more to denitrification through the water column rather than complete utilization of nitrate. Another distinct feature based on benthic foraminiferal assemblage, CaCO3 contents and redox element concentrations is that the dissolved oxygen content in bottom water was lower during the BA than the PB. Because biogenic opal productivity remained comparable during both periods, it implies that intermediate water ventilation was relatively stronger during the PB, which may be related to reopening of the Bering Strait.\n\n",

            "abstract": "Based on the MODIS MCD12Q2 remote sensing phenology product, we analyzed spatiotemporal variations of vegetation green-up, maturity, senescence and brown-off dates, and their relation to spatiotemporal patterns of air temperature and precipitation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). From 2001 to 2012, phenological time series at about 11.7%~15.1% pixels indicate significant linear trends (P<0.1) with strong spatial consistency. Namely, pixels with significant phenological advancement and growing season lengthening are mainly distributed in the middle and eastern parts of the QTP, while pixels with significant phenological delay and growing season shortening are mainly distributed in the western and southern parts as well as the eastern edge of the QTP. Similar spatial patterns for positive and negative linear trends of the minimum and maximum EVI, and the time-integrated EVI during the growing season were detected in the above two regions, respectively. With regard to climatic factors, mean annual temperature shows an increased trend over the QTP except for the eastern edge, whereas annual precipitation displays an increased trend in the middle and eastern parts but a decreased trend in the western and southern parts as well as the eastern edge of the QTP. These findings suggest that phenological advancement, growing season lengthening, and vegetation activity enhancement in the middle and eastern parts might be attributed to coincident temperature and precipitation increase. By contrast, phenological delay, growing season shortening, and vegetation activity reduction in the western and southern parts as well as the eastern edge might be caused by opposite changes of temperature and precipitation, and strong evaporation induced water shortage. Furthermore, a partial correlation analysis indicates that green-up, maturity, and brown-off dates were influenced by preceding temperature and precipitation, while senescence date was affected by preceding precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The Cordilleran Ice Sheet in western North America had an enigmatic evolution during the last glacial cycle, developing out of sync with the larger Laurentide and global glaciation. The geological record suggests that the ice sheet emerged late, ca. 45 ka, growing to be a fully-established ice sheet in isotope stages 3 and 2 and deglaciating late in the glacial cycle. This has been a challenge to model, and is a paleoclimatic curiosity, because the western Cordillera of North America is heavily glacierized today, and one would intuitively expect it to act as an inception centre for the Pleistocene ice sheets. The region receives heavy precipitation, and modest cooling should induce large-scale glacier expansion. Indeed, a Cordilleran Ice Sheet quickly nucleates in isotope substage 5d in most ice sheet modeling studies to date, and is a resilient feature throughout the glaciation. The fact that a full-scale Cordilleran Ice Sheet did not develop until relatively late argues for either: (a) ice sheet models that have been inadequate in resolving the process of alpine-style glaciation, i.e., the coalescence of alpine icefields, or (b) a climatic history in western North America that deviated strongly from the hemispheric-scale cooling which drove the growth of the Laurentide and Scandinavian Ice Sheets, as recorded in Greenland. We argue that reasonable reconstructions of Cordilleran Ice Sheet growth and decay implicate a combination of these two considerations. Sufficient model resolution is required to capture the valley-bottom melt that suppresses icefield coalescence, while early-glacial cooling must have been modest in the Pacific sector of North America. We argue for a persistent warm, dry climate relative to that in eastern North America and the Atlantic sector, likely associated with positive feedbacks between atmospheric circulation and the nascent Laurentide Ice Sheet (i.e., peristent circulation patterns similar to those of 2014-2015). This must have been disrupted as the Laurentide thickened and advanced southward, allowing the Cordilleran Ice Sheet to emerge from numerous isolated icefield complexes.",

            "abstract": "Net exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere is sensitive to environmental conditions, including extreme heat and drought. Of particular importance for local and global carbon balance and climate are the expansive tracts of tropical rainforest located in the Amazon Basin. Because of the Basin’s size and ecological heterogeneity, net biosphere CO2 exchange with the atmosphere remains largely un-constrained. In particular, the response of net CO2 exchange to changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and precipitation are not yet well known. However, proper representation of these relationships in biosphere models is a necessary constraint for accurately modeling future climate and climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. In an effort to compare biosphere response to climate across different biosphere models, the TRENDY model intercomparison project coordinated the simulation of CO2 fluxes between the biosphere and atmosphere, in response to historical climate forcing, by 9 different Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. We examine the TRENDY model results in the Amazon Basin, and compare this “bottom-up” method with fluxes derived from a “top-down” approach to estimating net CO2 fluxes, obtained through atmospheric inverse modeling using CO2 measurements sampled by aircraft above the basin. We compare the “bottom-up” and “top-down” fluxes in 5 sub-regions of the Amazon basin on a monthly basis for 2010-2012. Our results show important periods of agreement between some models in the TRENDY suite and atmospheric inverse model results, notably the simulation of increased biosphere CO2 loss during wet season heat in the Central Amazon. During the dry season, however, model ability to simulate observed response of net CO2 exchange to drought was varied, with few models able to reproduce the \"top-down\" inversion flux signals. Our results highlight the value of atmospheric trace gas observations for helping to narrow the possibilities of future carbon-climate interactions, especially in historically under-observed regions like the Amazon.",

            "abstract": "Many subduction zones correspond to strong long-wavelength magnetic signatures that are not predicted by forward models in which magnetisation is confined to the continental crust and unsubducted oceanic lithosphere. Previous studies have proposed this signature to be sourced within hydrated, serpentinised mantle wedge. Alternatively, thermal models of subducting oceanic lithosphere suggest slab material cool enough to hold magnetisation may persist >200 km below the Earth’s surface. Here we investigate the origin of long wavelength magnetic anomalies by constructing alternative predictions of the lithospheric geomagnetic field, which we compare to the MF7 model based on satellite observations. We compare 2 models for subduction zone magnetisation, one in which the wedge is magnetised and one in which the subducted slab is magnetised. Magnetisation deeper than the Moho of the overriding plate helps to reconcile the observed anomalies for a number of subduction zones, including Sumatra, the Aleutians, and along the Pacific margin of North and Central America. North-south trending arcs, especially those near to the magnetic equator, have magnetisations within the null space that produces little or no external magnetic field, and are less distinct in the observations. A magnetic anomaly persists along the Baja and Mexican west coast, indicating that the fossil subduction zone continues from California through Central America despite limited seismic evidence of a slab there. Distinguishing between the two competing models is difficult because it depends critically on the trend in magnetic anomaly away from the trench.",

            "abstract": "Microorganisms in aquifers are often assessed by extracting groundwater samples. This technique though typically under-represents the fraction of microorganisms attached to sediment (biofilm). Pre-treatment of groundwater extraction with in-situ low frequency sonication can improve microbial representation. This treatment induces biofilm detachment from sediment through exerting a pressure variation on the local environment. Previously, it was unknown when sonication intensity, as a function of depth, would drop below the threshold required for mobilizing biofilm. A series of sonication pulses (2.43 kW) of increasing duration were applied to a shallow groundwater monitoring well (8.1 m deep, 1.7 m below ground level) in Canterbury, New Zealand at varying depths below the water table (0.7, 3.0, 5.4 m). Samples were collected during sonication pulses and at increasing intervals following sonication. Turbidity values were determined to examine the release of sediment fines and microorganisms. Heterotrophic colony counts were compared to background water samples (no sonication) and cells extracted from biofilms on collected sediment samples. Maximum colony counts were observed during the first sonication pulse. Values dropped rapidly after sonication ceased and subsequent pulses provided slightly lower colony counts. Sonication improved the extraction efficiency up to 84-fold compared to background values and were similar to the levels extracted from the in-situ biofilm samples. Colony counts were on the same order of magnitude for all three depths. Compared to the shallower depths, there was a statistically significant difference in extraction efficiency for the greatest depth during the first pulse, but its increase was marginal. Overall, in-situ sonication across all depths greatly increased extraction efficiency, making this technique a cost-effective tool for improved groundwater microbial assessment.",

            "abstract": "The Philip and de Vries (1957) model and its extensions (e.g., Smits et al. (2011) ) cannot appropriately characterize preferential flow processes in the structured heterogeneous soils including macropores (fractures, cracks, root channels, etc.), which is ubiquitous at the terrestrial surfaces. The macropores in the vadose zone not only provide pathways for increased downward liquid flow and may enhance fast transport of nonvolatile contaminants to the groundwater, but also provide pathways for gas and vapor transport and may enhance upward movement of volatile contaminants (Scanlon et al., 1997). In other words, with respect to the structured soils, the wetting phases (e.g., liquid water) will preferentially reside in the small pores such as soil matrix, while the nonwetting phases (e.g., air and vapor) will tend to occupy the larger pores such as fractures. As a result of such phase distribution, the temperatures in the matrix and macropores are also expected to be different. In this work, we attempted to formulate and develop a dual permeability model in heterogeneous soils suitable for coupled water and heat flow descriptions. We defined two continua (each continuum has its own set of parameters and variables) and solved separate mass and energy balance equations in each continuum. The water and heat transport equations in each continuum are coupled by exchange terms. This dual permeability coupled water and heat flow model has the capability to correctly simulate preferential evaporation over fine-textured soils due to the fact that the capillary forces divert the pore water from coarse-textured soils (high temperature region) toward the fine-textured soils (low temperature region).\n ",

            "abstract": "Coastal regions suffer from increasing terrestrial inputs of nutrients and organic matter. Consequently, hypoxia (dissolved oxygen (DO) < 30% or 2 mg/L) in the coastal regions has become more serious. In the study of coastal eutrophication and hypoxia, incoming offshore seawater has rarely been addressed. With references to the time-series data in the coast of Hong Kong and at the South East Asia Time Series Study (SEATS) station located in the northern South China Sea (SCS), this study demonstrates that coastal waters of Hong Kong have suffered hypoxia for over a decade. The hypoxia condition, however, diminished between 2002 and 2004, most likely owning to a large scale intrusion of the West Philippine Sea (WPS) seawater. For instance, at station SM18 located south of Hong Kong, the summer DO minimum has generally decreased from a saturation state of about 60% to as low as 5% from 1990 to 2013. The almost anoxic condition occurred in 2011 after a La Nina event. On the other hand, the summer DO minimum reached a high value of 79% in 2004 after a long El Nino event. Meanwhile, seawater at the SEATS site also contained the highest proportion of the WPS water, reflecting the large intrusion of the WPS seawater into the SCS. Such a result illustrates a situation that coastal eutrophication and hypoxia could be worsened when the intrusion of open ocean water decreases, and vice versa.",

Basically, visitors have small information of Ontake volcano. After the accident, one mountain guide tells us that we never have long broken such as lunch around the summit, because an active creator is close, and they are afraid of the volcano gas accidents.

            "abstract": "Mineral dust particles profoundly influence the Earth climate due to their varied affects on the radiation and cloud physics. The knowledge of dust emissions from daily to seasonal scales is thus important for interpreting the past and predicting the future climate changes. Satellite measured radiances in the shortwave and thermal infrared are sensitive to the amount and properties of mineral dust present in the atmosphere. Therefore, the climate (i.e., monthly averages) of these reflectance spectra could contain valuable information on the change of dust emissions. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using the climate of spectral radiances for recovering dust emissions. An observation simulation system (OSS) that incorporates the Unified Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model (UNL-VRTM) with forward and adjoint global chemistry transport models (GEOS-Chem and FIM-Chem) has been applied to generate synthetic hyperspectral climate data in the shortwave and thermal infrared (TIR) for summer 2008. Along with the calculation of radiances at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), the OSS also computes their Jacobians of these synthetic data to dust optical depth, plume height, and effective radius, as well as the adjoint gradients of spectral radiances to dust emissions. We found that the brightness temperature (BT) in the TIR spectra at TOA is sensitive to both of the dust plume height and particle size. For the same relative changes of these parameters, BT shows largest change with respect to particle size at the wavenumber of 890-1200 cm-1. This demonstrates the potential for retrieving three-dimensional dust information along with the particle size from hyperspectral TIR measurements. We also assess the information content of monthly versus instantaneous radiances for constraining dust emissionsthe from the calculated adjoint gradients. Our analysis may guide new applications of long-term spectral radiance measurements (such as those from GOME, AIRS, IASI, and CrIS instruments) to constrain dust sources, and thus reduce uncertainty in our broader understanding of the impacts of mineral dust on climate.",

The distance and orientation of the wells relative to the contaminant plume affects the ability of active spreading strategies to efficiently degrade contaminant.

            "abstract": "Deterministic description of the discrete features interpreted from site characterization is desirable for developing a discrete fracture network conceptual model. It is often difficult, however, to delineate preferential flow path through a network of discrete fractures in the field. A preliminary cross-borehole nano-iron tracer test was conducted to characterize the preferential flow path in fractured shale bedrock at a hydrogeological research station. Prior to the test, heat-pulse flowmeter measurements were performed to detect permeable fracture zones at both the injection well and the observation well. While a few fracture zones are found permeable, most are not really permeable. Chemical reduction method was used to synthesize nano zero-valent iron particles with a diameter of 50~150 nm. The conductivity of nano-iron solution is about 3100 μs/cm. The recorded fluid conductivity shows the arrival of nano-iron solution in the observation well 11.5 minutes after it was released from the injection well. The magnetism of zero-valent iron enables it to be absorbed on magnet array designed to locate the depth of incoming tracer. We found nearly all of absorbed iron on the magnet array in the observation well were distributed near the most permeable fracture zone. The test results revealed a preferential flow path through a permeable fracture zone between the injection well and the observation well. The estimated hydraulic conductivity of the connected fracture is 2.2 × 10-3 m/s. This preliminary study indicated that nano-iron tracer test has the potential to characterize preferential flow path in fractured rock.",

            "abstract": "The Integrated Field Exercise of 2014 (IFE14) was an event held in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (with concurrent activities in Austria) that tested the operational and technical capabilities of an on-site inspection (OSI) within the CTBT verification regime. During an OSI, up to 40 international inspectors will search an area for evidence of a nuclear explosion. Over 250 experts from ~50 countries were involved in IFE14 (the largest simulation of a real OSI to date) and worked from a number of different directions, such as the Exercise Management and Control Teams (which executed the scenario in which the exercise was played) and those participants performing as members of the Inspection Team (IT). One of the main objectives of IFE14 was to test and integrate Treaty allowed inspection techniques, including a number of geophysical and remote sensing methods. In order to develop a scenario in which the simulated exercise could be carried out, suites of physical features in the IFE14 inspection area were designed and engineered by the Scenario Task Force (STF) that the IT could detect by applying the geophysical and remote sensing inspection technologies, in addition to other techniques allowed by the CTBT. For example, in preparation for IFE14, the STF modeled a seismic triggering event that was provided to the IT to prompt them to detect and localize aftershocks in the vicinity of a possible explosion. Similarly, the STF planted shallow targets such as borehole casings and pipes for detection using other geophysical methods. In addition, airborne technologies, which included multi-spectral imaging, were deployed such that the IT could identify freshly exposed surfaces, imported materials, and other areas that had been subject to modification. This presentation will introduce the CTBT and OSI, explain the IFE14 in terms of the goals specific to geophysical and remote sensing methods, and show how both the preparation for and execution of IFE14 meet those goals.",

            "abstract": "A primary purpose in our study of exoplanets is the search for life. In hypothesizing how we might detect life, we start by examining life on Earth; it is our only example. How do we understand the meaning of habitability when there is only one example? All clues seem significant: the common need for the existence of water, the range of temperatures over which life on Earth is found, and the chemical cycles that maintain the surface and near-surface of the Earth within that range.\nA common assertion is that plate tectonics is necessary for the carbon cycle that keeps the Earth at habitable temperatures by sequestering carbon in limetone in oceans, and parceling it back into the atmosphere through volcanoes. This is an unproven hypothesis. There are other tectonic processes that cycle carbon into a planetary interior and back to the atmosphere; one possibility is small-scale convection that returns lithospheric material to the mantle and produces small-scale volcanism. Whether this process is sufficient to stabilize climate on one-plate planets or planets with sluggish convection remains to be demonstrated.\nBefore we can discuss the criticality of plate tectonics on other planets we need to understand its criticality on Earth, and its apparent lack on Venus. And before we can predict whether plate tectonics should exist on a given exoplanet, we need to understand why it exists on Earth, and apparently not on Venus, and we need to know more about that exoplanet than can currently be detected.\nIn this talk I will compare the predictions for exoplanetary conditions conducive to plate tectonics, walk through possible pathways in planetary evolution that lead to plate tectonics, and discuss whether any aspect of plate tectonics on an exoplanet is detectable from Earth. Predicting and hoping to detect plate tectonics on exoplanets is walking out a shaky limb; making cautious incremental advances in understanding terrestrial plate tectonics is critical before extending outside our solar system.",

A coupled ocean-hydrologic model is employed to perform three-dimensional simulations of flow and pollutant transport in Singapore coastal waters. The hydrologic SWAT model is coupled with the coastal ocean SUNTANS model by outputting streamflow and pollutant concentrations from the SWAT model and using them as inputs for the SUNTANS model at common boundary points. The coupled model is calibrated with observed sea surface elevations and velocities, and high correlation coefficients that exceed 0.97 and 0.91 are found for sea surface elevations and velocities, respectively. The pollutants are modeled as Gaussian passive tracers, and are released at five upstream locations in Singapore coastal waters. During the Northeast monsoon, pollutants released in Source 1 (Johor River), Source 2 (Tiram River), Source 3 (Layang River) and Source 4 (Layau River) enter the Singapore Strait after 4 days of release and reach Sentosa Island within 9 days. Meanwhile, pollutants released in Source 5 (Kallang River) reach Sentosa Island after 4 days. During the Southwest monsoon, the dispersion time is roughly doubled, with pollutants from Sources 1 – 4 entering the Singapore Strait only after 12 days of release due to weak currents.",

A series of three-dimensional (3-D) numerical modeling of pile foundation subjected to various types of combined loading were carried out using Plaix-3D finite element program to investigate the interactive behaviors between soil and pile. In the numerical modeling, pile diameter, pile length and pile spacing were selected as design parameters to inspect their effects on the bearing capacities and deformation behaviors of the pile foundation. For a specific design parameter combination, one can obtain the corresponding loading-displacement curve, various ultimate bearing capacities, V-H (Vertical-Horizontal combined loading) ultimate bearing capacity envelope, and p-ycurve of pile foundation.\nNumerical results indicate that: (1) Large displacement and plastic points at ultimate state mostly distribute and concentrate in the topsoil of seabed and around pile head. (2) The soil resistance on the soil-pile interface is ascending with the increases of depth, pile diameter and pile length. (3) The vertical and horizontal bearing capacities of pile group increase significantly with the increase of pile diameter. (4) The vertical and bending moment capacities of pile group increase greatly with the increase of pile length whereas the horizontal capacity is almost insensitive to pile length. (5) The bending moment of pile is highly influenced by the pile spacing. (6) For different design parameters, the shape of ultimate bearing capacity envelopes of pile group on V-H plane is similar while the envelopes will expand as the design parameters increase. For different loading levels of bending moment, the envelopes on V-H plane will contract gradually as the bending moment loading increasing.",

Also on board NASA Aqua satellite, Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) measurements provide the all weather temperature and water vapor profiles which are used as the first guess for AIRS inversion algorithm. However, due to lack of absolute on orbit calibration, both AIRS and AMSU also exhibit biases in retrieving atmospheric temperatures and moistures when compared with in situ measurements. These retrieval biases have diverse and complex dependencies on the temperature/moisture being measured, the season and geographical location, surface conditions, and sensor temperature, which is difficult to quantify. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of Global Positioning System (GPS) Radio Occultation (RO) data to serve as a climate calibration observatory in orbit to calibrate and validate AIRS and AMSU measurements. In this study, we use COSMIC RO data to simulate AMSU and AIRS brightness temperatures for the lower stratosphere (TLS) and compare them to AMSU TLS and those of AIRS brightness temperatures at the same height. Our analysis shows that because RO data do not contain mission-dependent biases and orbit drift errors, and are not affected by on-orbit heating and cooling of the satellite component, they are very useful to identify the AMSU time/location dependent biases for different NOAA missions and possible long term drift of the AIRS retrieved temperatures.",

            "abstract": "The Midwestern United States, a region that produces one-third of maize and one-quarter of soybeans globally, is projected to experience increasing rainfall variability with future climate change. One approach to mitigate climate impacts is to utilize crop and soil management practices that enhance soil water storage, reducing the risks of flooding and runoff as well as drought-induced crop water stress. While some research indicates that a winter cover crop in a maize-soybean rotation increases soil water, producers continue to be concerned that water use by cover crops will reduce water for a following cash crop. We analyzed continuous in-field soil moisture measurements over from 2008-2014 at a Central Iowa research site that has included a winter rye cover crop in a maize-soybean rotation for thirteen years. This period of study included years in the top third of wettest years on record (2008, 2010, 2014) as well as years in the bottom third of driest years (2012, 2013). We found the cover crop treatment to have significantly higher soil water storage from 2012-2014 when compared to the no cover crop treatment and in most years greater soil water content later in the growing season when a cover crop was present. We further found that the winter rye cover crop significantly increased the field capacity water content and plant available water compared to the no cover crop treatment. Finally, in 2012 and 2013, we measured maize and soybean biomass every 2-3 weeks and did not see treatment differences in crop growth, leaf area or nitrogen uptake. Final crop yields were not statistically different between the cover and no cover crop treatment in any of the years of this analysis. This research indicates that the long-term use of a winter rye cover crop can improve soil water dynamics without sacrificing cash crop growth.",

            "abstract": "Because the half-life times of uranium isotopes are all very long, e.g., 4.5Ga for 238U and 0.7Ga for 235U, people actually treat uranium isotope system as a stable one in many young geologic systems (e.g., Bopp et al., 2010; Basu et al., 2014). There is an increasing trend of using U isotope method to study surface geochemistry problems. For example, people start to use U isotopes as a new tracer to determine the change of redox conditions (Holmden et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). However, there are only a few equilibrium U isotope fractionation factors available right now. The new enterprise of U isotope method requires a much expanded data-base of equilibrium U isotope fractionation factor.\nMany evidences showed that heavy isotope systems could be significantly fractionated as the consequence of the nuclear volume effect (NVE) or so-called nuclear field shift effect,which is a driving force of mass-independent fractionation induced by differences in nuclear size and nuclear shape of isotopes. Here we theoretically estimate the magnitude of equilibrium isotope fractionation factors of U-bearing gaseous and solid compounds caused by NVE via density functional theory (DFT) quantum chemistry methods with careful evaluation on quantum relativistic effects. Our calculation results show the NVE drives 238U/235U fractionations can be up to -4.43‰ between U(VI) and U(IV) species, or can be up to -1.68‰ between U(IV) and U(III) species, at room temperature. The U4+-bearing species or phases tend to enrich heavier isotopes (i.e., 238U) relative to the oxidized phases (U6+-bearing), and enrich lighter isotopes (i.e., 235U) relative to the reduced U(III) phases (U3+-bearing), which generally agree with the recent experimental results (Wang et al., 2015). Our results provide a base for broad applications of equilibrium U isotope fractionation in surface environments.",

For example, the relative timing of atmospheric and marine changes caused by the abrupt climatic events that punctuated the last glacial period within the North Atlantic region. Here we report on efforts to establish a framework of tephra horizons within North Atlantic marine sequences that can correlate these records and if traced in the Greenland ice-cores can act as isochronous tie-lines.\nInvestigations have been conducted on a network of marine cores from a number of sites across the North Atlantic. Tephra horizons have been identified using cryptotephra extraction techniques more commonly applied to the study of terrestrial sequences. There are two main challenges with assessing cryptotephras in the glacial North Atlantic; i) determining the transportation processes and ii) assessing the influence of secondary reworking processes and the stratigraphic integrity of the isochrons. These processes and their influence are investigated for each cryptotephra using shard size variations, major element heterogeneity and co-variance of IRD input for some cores.\nNumerous Icelandic cryptophras have been successfully identified in the marine records and we will discuss the integration of a number of these with an isochronous nature into a marine tephra framework and how potential correlations to the Greenland ice-core tephra framework are determined. Spatial patterns in the nature of tephra records that are emerging from the core network will be highlighted to outline some of the key areas that could be explored in the future. In addition, the synchronisation of multiple North Atlantic records to the Greenland ice-cores using the North Atlantic Ash Zone II to test the synchroneity of an abrupt cooling in the North Atlantic will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Much of our knowledge about subduction zone processes is derived from analyzing present-day Earth. Several studies of contemporary plate motions have investigated the balance between retreating and advancing trenches and shown that subduction zone kinematics are sensitive to the choice of Absolute Plate Motion (APM) model (or “reference frame”). For past times, the absolute motions of the lithospheric plates relative to the Earth’s deep interior over tens of millions of years are commonly constrained using observations from paleomagnetism and age-progressive seamount trails. In contrast, a reference frame linking surface plate motions to subducted slab remnants mapped from seismic tomography has recently been proposed. APM models derived using different methodologies, different subsets of hotspots, or differing assumptions of hotspot motion, have contrasting implications for parameters that describe the long term state of the plate-mantle system, such as the balance between advance and retreat of subduction zones, plate velocities, and net lithospheric rotation.\nHere we quantitatively compare the subduction zone kinematics, net lithospheric rotation and fit to hotspot trails derived the last 130 Myr for a range of alternative reference frames and a single relative plate motion model. We find that hotspot and tomographic slab-remnant reference frames yield similar results for the last 70 Myr. For the period between 130 and 70 Ma, when hotspot trails become scarce, hotspot reference frames yield a much more dispersed distribution of slab advance and retreat velocities, which is considered geodynamically less plausible. By contrast, plate motions calculated using the slab-remnant reference frame, or using a reference frame designed to minimise net rotation, yield more consistent subduction zone kinematics for times older than 70 Ma. Introducing the global minimisation of trench migration rates as a key criterion in the construction of APM models forms the foundation of a new method of constraining APMs (and in particular paleolongitude) in deep geological time.",

            "abstract": "A noteworthy problem for seismic exploration is effects of multipathing (both wanted or unwanted) caused by subsurface complex structures. We show that reverse time migration (RTM) combined with a unified, systematic three parameter framework that flexibly handles multipathing can be accomplished by adding one more dimension (image time) to the angle domain common image gather (ADCIG) data.\nRTM is widely used to generate prestack depth migration images. When using the cross-correlation image condition in 2D prestack migration in RTM, the usual practice is to sum over all the migration time steps. Thus all possible wave types and paths automatically contribute to the resulting image, including destructive wave interferences, phase shifts, and other distortions. One reason is that multipath (prismatic wave) contributions are not properly sorted and mapped in the ADCIGs. Also, multipath arrivals usually have different instantaneous attributes (amplitude, phase and frequency), and if not separated, the amplitudes and phases in the final prestack image will not stack coherently across sources.\nA prismatic path satisfies an image time for it’s unique path; Cavalca and Lailly (2005) show that RTM images with multipaths can provide more complete target information in complex geology, as multipaths usually have different incident angles and amplitudes compared to primary reflections. If the image time slices within a cross-correlation common-source migration are saved for each image time, this three-parameter (incident angle, depth, image time) volume can be post-processed to generate separate, or composite, images of any desired subset of the migrated data. Images can by displayed for primary contributions, any combination of primary and multipath contributions (with or without artifacts), or various projections, including the conventional ADCIG (angle vs depth) plane. Examples show that signal from the true structure can be separated from artifacts caused by multiple arrivals when they have different image times. This improves the quality of images and benefits migration velocity analysis (MVA) and amplitude variation with angle (AVA) inversion.",

            "abstract": "Serpentinization of the oceanic lithosphere is a known sink for fluid mobile elements (B, Cl, Li, Sr, etc.), while high field strength elements (HFSE: e.g., Hf, Zr, Ti, Nb) are thought to be unaffected by it. In contrast, the fate of REE during serpentinization is equivocal. Correlations between REE and HFSE concentrations in abyssal peridotites suggest control by magmatic processes (Niu, 2004, J. Pet), while some LREE enrichments in serpentinized peridotites compared to their clinopyroxene (cpx) and Nd, Sr isotope data (Delacour et al., 2008, Chem. Geol.) imply seawater-derived REE addition to the mantle protolith (Paulick et al., 2006, Chem. Geol). To further constrain peridotite-seawater interaction during serpentinization we compare bulk rock and cpx Hf and Nd isotope data in partially (up to ~70%) serpentinized abyssal peridotites (9-16°E South West Indian Ridge). We also present a new method that improves yields in Hf, Nd and Pb separations from depleted (<0.03 ppm Hf) ultramafic rocks, which includes coprecipitation of metals with Al-Fe hydroxides and ether-HCl liquid-liquid exchange for Fe removal. Nd isotopes in the bulk peridotite are up to 7εNd units less radiogenic than their cpx (i.e., the magmatic value) while Hf isotopes remain equal to cpx within 1 εHf. Melt-rock reaction by the local lavas cannot generate this decoupling. The largest Nd isotopic difference between cpx and bulk is seen in the most LREE-depleted samples, while refertilized samples show little change. Leaching experiments show that 30-60% of REE are mobilized from the rock, but >90% of Hf, Zr, Ti are retained in the residue. LA-ICPMS data shows that serpentine after olivine typically has higher LREE/HREE ratios than cpx, pronounced negative Ce anomalies, high U, Sr concentrations and low HFSE, unlike the coexisting cpx. These data are consistent with some seawater-derived LREE addition to peridotite during serpentinization, localized in the serpentine and other secondary phases, while cpx retains the magmatic value. This process will lower the Sm/Nd relative to Lu/Hf ratio in the peridotite and can lead to decoupled radiogenic Hf and unradiogenic Nd isotopes upon recycling and aging. Our data further testifies to the fidelity of Hf isotopes in tracing mantle processes, even in serpentinized rocks.",

            "abstract": "Interrogating Earth’s interior is limited to indirect means, such as seismic or magnetic fields, and relies heavily on modeling. A large body of literature either attempts to constrain the composition of the deep mantle by mass balancing the Earth with a chondritic composition, or to demonstrate that the Earth does not have a chondritic composition. These models provide predictions for the composition and density of the ultra-low shear wave provinces and for the D” layer, among others, and compare their results to structures resulting from seismic studies.\nThe bulk composition of the Earth, however, remains an open question. We now know that the planets accreted from embryos that were already differentiated. The complexity of processes that occurred on planetesimals and planetary embryos are just beginning to come to light.\nHeating by radiogenic 26Al likely produced waves of hydration and dehydration in planetesimals. These free fluids may have carried a wide range of volatiles, moving them from the interior to the lid, or even losing them to space. Simultaneously, the first free fluids may have reacted with metals, producing oxides or sulfides. Further heating is required to reduce these to metals and made core formation possible; or perhaps the earliest cores are not fully metallic.\nThese planetesimals and the embryos they were growing into were subjected to a series of impacts. As the work of Asphaug and his group have demonstrated, some of these are accretionary impacts, and some are hit-and-run, or destructive impacts. These destructive impacts may have reduced the thickness of Mercury’s mantle, and stripped the mantle off the metal asteroid Psyche. Where, then would the shattered silicates from such collisions go? Asphuag suggests that at least in part they are added to the growing terrestrial planets.\nIf the planetesimals and planetary embryos were compositionally heterogeneous because of interior fluid and magma movement, then the silicates blown off them by impacts would not have a bulk chondritic composition. The growing planets would not then have a bulk chondritic composition. This talk will discuss the possible ramifications of this model and its application to bulk Earth models.",

            "abstract": "Several important equilibrium Si isotope fractionation factors among minerals, organic molecules and the H4SiO4 solution are complemented to facilitate explanation of distributions of Si isotope in the Earth’s surface environments. The results reveal that heavy Si isotopes will be significantly enriched in the secondary silicate minerals in comparison to aqueous H4SiO4. On the contrary, quadra-coordinated organosilicon complexes are enriched in light silicon isotope relative to the solution. The extent of 28Si-enrichment in hyper-coordinated organosilicon complexes is found the largest. In addition, the large kinetic isotope effect associated with the polymerization of monosilicic acid and dimer is calculated and the result supports previous statement that highly 28Si-enrichment in the formation of amorphous quartz precursor contributes to the discrepancy between theoretical calculations and field observations.\nWith equilibrium Si isotope fractionation factors provided here, Si isotope distributions in many surface systems of the Earth can be explained. For example, the change of bulk soil δ30Si can be predicted as a concave pattern with respect to weathering degree, with the minimum value where allophane completely dissolves and the total amount of sesqui-oxides and poorly crystalline minerals reaches its maximum. When well-crystallized clays start to precipitate from pore solutions under equilibrium conditions, the bulk soil δ30Si will increase again and reach a constant value. Similarly, the precipitation of crystalline smectite and the dissolution of poorly crystalline kaolinite may explain δ30Si variations in the ground water profile. Equilibrium Si isotope fractionations among quadra-coordinated organosilicon complexes and the H4SiO4 solution may also shed the light on the Si isotope distributions in Si-accumulating plants.",

Hydraulic routing provides more realistic flow routing and has not been yet efficiently employed for optimizing hydro-power production. The present model integrates the Pre-Computed Hydraulic Ensembles (PC-HE) technique with an optimization model. PC-HE is basically a methodology that utilizes precomputed solutions along reaches on a river system. These solutions are stored in a database. The use of PC-HE provides efficiency and robustness for performing hydraulic simulations. This study takes advantage the PC-HE features for applying the methodology to reservoir routing. Further, an optimization method is used to optimize the reservoir outflows. These outflows, as a parameter for calculating hydro-power production, are used as decision variables for a multi objective constrained optimization. The combined strategy is expected to reduce the overall computational time for large-scale hydro-power production problems. This paper discusses the results of the application to a part of the hydropower system of the Columbia River (Northwest USA).",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal experiments were conducted on high-silica (73-75 wt% SiO2), fluid-saturated melts at 844-862°C and ca. 50 MPa using crushed glass of the Los Posos rhyolite. Water and salts including NaCl, KCl, Ca(OH)2, and CaHPO4 and HCl were added proportionally to the experiments to restrict the variability of the aluminosity of the melt. The Durango apatite, which contains 3.53 wt% F and 0.41% Cl, was added as “seeds”<5µm in diameter to stimulate apatite growth during the experiments. Samples were loaded into gold capsules and run in cold-seal pressure vessels for durations of 286-1008 hours. Temperature was cycled at ±20˚C to promote apatite crystallization.\nElectron microprobe analyses of run-product glasses and embedded apatite grains support calculation of a range of partition coefficients ( = wt% Cl in apatite/wt% Cl in melt) of 4.7 to 15.9. The mole fraction of Cl in experimental apatites, or XCl, ranges from 0.19 to 0.56, while XF ranges from 0.08 to 0.63. The computed values for XOH range from 0.24 to 0.38. We find that normalizing XCl to XOH of apatites dramatically improves the precision when using apatite compositions to model Cl contents of melts. We compare our Los Posos rhyolite experiments with published data on 50 MPa rhyodacite experiments and find that Cl partitioning is significantly different in each system.\nGiven the importance of chlorine in fluid equilibria, ore transport, and magma evolution, applications of apatite as a proxy for Cl contents in melts are unbounded. It is found that in order to accurately use the volatile composition of natural and synthetic apatites to calculate the volatile composition of melts in felsic systems, several chemical factors, including wt% SiO2 and the aluminosity/alkalinity of melts, should be incorporated as parameters to enhance relevant modeling. This allows geochemists to place better constraints on processes associated with crystallizing Cl-bearing magmatic systems.",

Humphreys (1964) pointedly noted that “the “explanations” generally given of the rainbow [ in textbooks] may well be said to explain beautifully that which does not occur, and to leave unexplained which does” . . . “The records of close observations of rainbows soon show that not even the colors are always the same”.\nTextbooks stress that the main factor affecting the aspect of the rainbow is the radius of the water droplets. In his well-known textbook entitled “the nature of light & colour in the open air”, Minnaert (1954) gives the chief features of the rainbow depending on the diameter of the drops producing it.\nFor this study, we have gathered hundreds of pictures of primary bows. We sort out the pictures into classes. The classes are defined in a such way that rainbows belonging to the same class look similar. Our results are surprising and do not confirm Minnaert's classification. In practice, the size of the water droplets is only a minor factor controlling the overall aspect of the rainbow. The main factor appears to be the height of the sun above the horizon. At sunset, the width of the red band increases, while the width of the other bands of colours decreases. The orange, the violet, the blue and the green bands disappear completely in this order.

Treatment of AMD often includes neutralizing pH to facilitate the precipitation of Fe-oxides and dissolved trace metals, thereby forming Trace Metal Substituted (TMS) forms of known minerals, such as goethite (α-FeOOH). The stability of TMS precipitates is not fully understood. As a result, we conducted a 20 day leach experiment using laboratory synthesized pure (Gt) and cobalt-substituted (CoGt) goethites with a dilute ultrapure HCl solution (pH = 3.61) at T = 23.3±2.5ºC. Leached solids were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy paired with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Leach solutions were sampled for pH and conductivity, and dissolved chemistry was determined with Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Preliminary results indicate Gt and CoGt filtered leach solutions experienced constant pH (Gt = 3.9 ± 0.1, CoGt = 6.8 ± 0.2) and conductivity (Gt = 69 ± 6.6 μS/cm, CoGt = 81 ± 16 μS/cm) for t = 0-20 days. Micro-focused XRD results indicate that leached solids did not change in mineralogy throughout the experiment, and SEM images show minor disintegration along mineral grain edges, but little overall change in shape. Preliminary ICP-MS results show lower dissolved Fe concentrations for CoGt (1.1 ± 1.1 ppb) compared to Gt (17 ± 8.9 ppb) over time. Dissolved Co concentrations ranged from 560 – 830 ppb and increased over time. Compared to leaching of pure Gt, leaching of CoGt generated significantly higher pH, slightly higher conductivity, and significantly less dissolved Fe. During the CoGt leach, Co was preferentially leached over Fe. The differences in leaching behavior between pure and TMS goethite in the laboratory have implications for the leaching behavior of goethite in the environment, where trace metal substitution is expected to be common. These experiments suggest that trace metals coprecipitated with Fe-oxides may not be stable in the long term. Future leach experiments with TMS precipitates from the field are planned to test this.",

            "abstract": "Pyrite nodules have been identified in many sedimentary rocks and their formation has attracted much interest. Recently, however, the mode and timing of nodule formation have become increasingly important as in situ pyrite compositions are now used frequently as proxies for trace element abundance in the oceans through time. For this method to be effective, the pyrite must form in pore waters that are in contact with the overlying water column. In this study we have taken steps toward a refined understanding of pyrite nodule formation by using SHRIMP-SI and LA-ICPMS to examine the in situ S isotope signature and trace element content of 27 pyrite nodules that range from the Archean to the Phanerozoic in age.\nThis study has revealed that there are three different ways in which pyrite nodules form. The first is a rapid precipitation of the entire nodule as indicated by an absence of significant δ34S or trace element zoning in the nodule. The lack of zonation suggests that it formed early during sedimentation when the pore waters were still connected with the overlying water column. The second way results in a clear zoning of δ34S and trace element compositions. This zonation indicates that the nodule formed deeper in the sediments, where the pore waters were not well enough connected to the overlying water column to avoid evolution of the pore fluid composition. The third is a combination of the first two modes of formation. These nodules initiated with rapid formation, as indicated by an initial lack of trace element and δ34S zonation, followed by addition of later pyrite as revealed by the presence of zonation in the rims of the nodule. The identification of these different formation mechanisms may also have paleoceanographic utility as traditional nodule formation models suggest that pyrite nodules form relatively late as a product of diagenesis. Determining by which mechanism a nodule forms could give insight into the diagenetic history of pyritic black shale.",

            "abstract": "The Whillans Ice Plain (WIP) is known for its distinctive stick-slip motion, in which steady, slow ice motion (~100m/yr equivalent) is punctuated once or twice daily by sudden slips of ~0.5 m over ~30 minutes (~5,000m/yr equivalent). These stick-slip events nucleate in one of two areas of the Ice Plain depending on Ross Ice Shelf tidal height: the Central Sticky Spot (CSS) or the Grounding Zone Sticky Spot (GZSS) (Pratt et al., 2014). Basal conditions beneath ice streams are in general poorly constrained, and the specific conditions allowing Ice-Plain-wide unstable sliding and stick-slip motion remain poorly understood. We present preliminary results from two small-aperture networks (<1 km station spacing) of borehole and surface short period seismometers installed at each nucleation area to investigate local seismicity and its relationship to the stick-slip cycle. We present new detections and locations of small basal micro-earthquakes at or near the ice/bed interface at both nucleation areas and demonstrate spatial heterogeneity in bed conditions. CSS basal seismicity occurs as hundreds of small amplitude repeating events, rupturing the same or nearly the same patches of the bed beneath the network many times during a stick-slip event, but changing between events. These events suggest that the 10’s of km wide CSS is comprised of small stick-slip patches. Micro-seismicity is detected using waveform cross correlation of manually selected template events and located using hypoDD. Time- and space-varying basal seismicity demonstrates that bed conditions vary in space, beneath the network, and in time, between slip events and observation years. The GZSS network records similar basal micro-earthquakes during slip events, though far fewer. Larger events characterized by surface waves are much more common near the GZSS. This seismicity occurs preferentially during low tide, independent of the WIP stick-slip cycle. We use beamforming to show that these events occur outside the network, towards the grounding zone. These events may be basal earthquakes providing evidence of higher grounding zone strength during low tide, or surface or basal crevassing events indicating tensional stresses at the grounding zone.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake rupture directivity is essential for improving reliability of shakemap and understanding seismogenic processes by resolving the ruptured fault. Compared with field geological survey and InSAR technique, rupture directivity analysis based on seismological data provides rapid characterization of the rupture finiteness parameters or is almost the only way for resolving ruptured fault for earthquakes weaker than M5.\nIn recent years, ambient seismic noise has been widely used in tomography and as well as earthquake location. Barmin et al. (2011) and Levshin et al. (2012) proposed to locate the epicenter by interpolating the estimated Green's functions (EGFs) determined by cross-correlation of ambient noise to arbitrary hypothetical event locations. This method does not rely on an earth model, but it requires a dense local array. Zhan et al. (2011) and Zeng et al. (2014) used the EGFs between a nearby station and remote stations as calibration for 3D velocity structure and then obtained the centroid location. In contrast, the hypocenter can be determined by P wave onsets. When assuming unilateral rupture, we can resolve the rupture directivity with relative location of the centroid location and hypocenter.\nWe apply this method to the 2011 M5.6 Oklahoma earthquake. One M4.8 foreshock and one M4+ aftershock are chosen as reference event to calibrate the systematic bias of ambient noise location. The resolved rupture plane strikes southwest-northeast, consistent with the spatial distribution of aftershocks (McNamara et al., 2015) and finite fault inversion result (Sun et al., 2014). This method works for unilaterally ruptured strike-slip earthquakes, and more case studies are needed to test its effectiveness.",

            "abstract": "The formation of calcite and aragonite biominerals by pathways involving metastable intermediates is increasingly recognized. Initial precipitates evolve along a multistep pathway that is not well understood. Previous studies of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) provide important insights, but relationships between ACC composition and the subsequent crystalline polymorphs are not yet established.\nThis experimental study quantified control of initial solution composition on the polymorphs that transform from ACC. Using a flow-through reactor to regulate solution chemistry without organic additives, ACC was synthesized with variable Mg contents by tuning input solution Mg/Ca ratio, total carbonate concentration, and pH (Blue and Dove, 2015, GCA). This ACC was transformed to crystalline products under stirred or quiescent conditions while monitoring solution and solid compositions.\nBy quantifying solution chemistry throughout the transformation, we find pH and Mg/Ca evolve along polymorph-specific trajectories. The relations predict the initial crystalline phase to form and suggest incipient differences in the initial ACC. The first crystalline polymorph appears controlled by fast kinetics and determined by a systematic relationship to solution Mg2+/Ca2+ and CO3=/Ca2+ ratios. Stirring versus quiescent conditions further direct the initial crystalline polymorph to form. Over longer time periods, thermodynamic factors can drive the initial phase to transform again.\nThe results suggest a quantitative framework for predicting the products to transform from ACC that is based on the interplay of chemistry and physical conditions. Organic additives and extreme pH are not required. The findings reconcile apparent discrepancies between previous studies of ACC and suggest monohydrocalcite may be an overlooked transient phase in forming some deposits of aragonite and calcite. They also 1) support the idea that calcite composition is determined by local Mg2+/Ca2+ and isotope conditions (Giuffre et al., in press, GCA) at the time of initial precipitation; and 2) demonstrate the importance of kinetic versus thermodynamic factors in regulating multistep pathways (De Yoreo et al., 2015, Science) to determine the polymorphs/compositions that form in biological and geological settings.",

            "abstract": "Of the galaxies in our universe, only a small percentage currently have Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These galaxies tend to be further out in the universe and older, and are different from inactive galaxies in that they emit high amounts of energy from their central black holes. These AGN can be classified as either Seyferts or quasars, depending on the amount of energy emitted from the center (less or more). We are studying the correlation between the ratio of dust emission and accretion disk emission to luminosities of AGN in order to determine if there is a relationship strong enough to act as a predictive model for distance within the universe. This relationship can be used as a standard candle if luminosity is found to determine distances in space. We have created a color-magnitude diagram depicting this relationship between luminosity and wavelengths, similar to the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. The more luminous the AGN, the more dust surface area over which to emit energy, which results in a greater near-infrared (NIR) luminosity. This differs from previous research because we use NIR to differentiate accretion from dust emission. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), we analyzed over one thousand Type 1 Seyferts and quasars. We studied data at different wavelengths in order to show the relationship between color (the ratio of one wavelength to another) and luminosity. It was found that plotting filters i-K (the visible and mid-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum) against the magnitude absolute K (luminosity) showed a strong correlation. Furthermore, the redshift range between 0.14 and 0.15 was the most promising, with an R2 of 0.66.",

GeoClawSed is based on GeoClaw and adds a bed updating and avalanching scheme to the two-dimensional coupled system combining the shallow- water and advection-diffusion equations, which is a set of hyperbolic integral conservation laws. The modeling system consists of three coupled model components: (1) the shallow-water equations for hydrodynamics; (2) advection-diffusion equation for sediment transport; and (3) an equation for morphodynamics. For the hydrodynamic part, the finite-volume wave propagation methods (high resolution Godunov-type methods) are applied to the shallow-water equations. The well-known Riemann solver in GeoClaw is capable of dealing with diverse flow regimes present during tsunami flows. For the sediment-transport part, the advection-diffusion equation is employed to calculate the distribution of sediment in the water column. In the fully-coupled version, the advection-diffusion equation is also included in the Riemann solver. The Van Leer method is applied for calculating sediment flux in each direction. The bed updating and avalanching scheme (morphodynamics) is used for updating topography during tsunami wave propagation. Adaptive refinement method is extended to hydrodynamic part, sediment transport model and topography. GeoClawSed can evolve different resolution and accurately capture discontinuities in both flow dynamic and sediment transport. Together, GeoClawSed is designed for modeling tsunami propagation, inundation, sediment transport as well as topography change. Finally, GeoClawSed is applied for studying marine and terrestrial deposit distribution after tsunami wave.\nKeywords: Tsunami; Sediment Transport; Shallow Water Equations; Advection-Diffusion Equation; Adaptive Refinement Method",

Observational evidences show that the variability of the East Asian upper-tropospheric subtropical westerly jet (EAJ) has a significant correlation with precipitation anomalies over the WNP and CP and that tropical precipitation anomalies over WNP and CP have distinct influence on the variation of EAJ. A series of numerical experiments based on a linear baroclinic model are performed to confirm the influence of the heating anomalies associated with precipitation perturbations over the WNP and CP on the EAJ. The results of numerical experiments indicate that a heat source over the WNP can excite a northward-propagating Rossby wave train in the upper troposphere over East Asia and facilitate a poleward eddy momentum flux. It results in the acceleration of westerly between 30°N and 45°N, which favors a northward displacement of the EAJ. The response induced by a heat sink over the CP features a zonal easterly band between 25°N and 40°N, suggesting that the response to heat sink associated with negative precipitation anomalies over the CP may weaken the EAJ. A strengthened relationship was found between tropical Pacific precipitation and EAJ since 1979. The modeling results suggest that the shift of mean states might be responsible for the strengthened EAJ–rainfall relationship after 1979.",

Recent seismic observations suggest the variation in grain size in the inner core (Monnereau et al., 2010). It is important to understand the variation in grain size for constraints of the dynamics of the inner core because grain size is controlled by the growth rate and growth rate gives us information on time scale of the inner core growth and/or translation (Alboussiere et al., 2010). In this study, we experimentally determine the grain growth rate of ε-iron to understand the dynamics of inner core. \nε-iron is only stable at high pressure and it is unquenchable to an ambient condition. Therefore, in this study, we conduct in situ high pressure experiments to determine the grain growth rate of ε-iron. In the high pressure experiment, the starting materials was compressed in a Kawai-type high pressure apparatus equipped with sintered diamond anvils with 1.0 truncated edge length at BL04B1, SPring-8. At the pressure of ~55 GPa, sample was heated for several hours to determine the grain growth rates. Grain growth can be detected by the reduction of number of diffraction spots on the two-dimensional detector with monochromatic X-ray (Offerman et al., 2002) with annealing time.\nIn the experiments, we observed the reduction of the number of diffracted spots, meaning that grain growth occurs during annealing experiments. From the reduction rates of spots at temperatures ranged from 1200 to 1500 K, we determined the growth constant for grain growth at each temperature and then temperature dependency at ~55 GPa was obtained. By using the homologous temperature scaling to extrapolate the experimental to the inner core condition, we estimated the grain growth rate of ε-iron at the inner core condition. Our results suggests that it takes ~2.9 Gy translation period to explain the variation in grain size, which ranged from ~500 m in the western side to ~5 km in the eastern side of the inner core estimated from the seismic observation (Monnereau et al., 2010). The age of the inner core may be older than 2.9 Gy.\n ",

The CERES instrument consists of a three-channel broadband scanning radiometer. The scanning radiometer measures radiances in shortwave (SW, 0.3-5 μm), window (WN, 8-12 μm), and total (0.3-200 μm) channels. The longwave (LW) component is derived as the difference between total and SW channels. These measured radiances at a given sun-Earth-satellite geometry are converted to outgoing reflected solar and emitted thermal TOA radiative fluxes by using CERES scene-type dependent angular distribution models (ADMs). The CERES instruments must remain radiometrically stable and correctly inter-calibrated to accurately capture changes in Earth’s radiation budget from interannual to decadal timescales.\nThis presentation will focus on comparisons between collocated radiance measurements from CERES instruments on Aqua and on Suomi-NPP. As we do not have a set of ADMs that is constructed specifically for the CERES instrument on Suomi-NPP, CERES Aqua ADMs are used to invert fluxes from radiance measurements on Suomi-NPP. But the CERES Aqua footprint size is smaller than the CERES Suomi-NPP footprint size and the scene identifications provided by MODIS and VIIRS can also be different from each other. Will using Aqua ADMs for Suomi-NPP flux inversion increase the flux uncertainty? We will examine the deseasonalized flux anomaly time series using Aqua data alone and using combined Aqua and Suomi-NPP data. We will also present a simulation study to assess the Suomi-NPP flux uncertainty from using Aqua ADMs for the flux inversion.",

Subducted sediments contribute volatiles, trace elements, and unique isotopic signatures to arc magmas and some mantle domains. While some elements appear to be conservative during sediment subduction, others may be mobilized and isotopically fractionated during the first several tens of kilometers of subduction - well before reaching sub-arc depths. Characterization of the geochemical processes occurring in this early stage of subduction is relatively limited and largely based on the compositions of fluids expelled from the accretionary prism. In order to better understand the life cycle of boron as it is processed through the subduction system, B concentrations and isotope ratios were measured in a suite of shales from the Shimanto Belt, Shikoku Island, Japan. These shales represent pelagic and neritic sediments from the Nankai Trough that have been partially subducted, underplated, and exhumed. As a counterpoint to the mobile and potentially fractionated boron, Pb isotopes (which are not expected to be fractionated by shallow subduction processes) were used to ensure that the sediments studied were derived from a homogeneous source. Peak temperatures of 140-280˚C are constrained by offshore vitrinite reflectance studies. We find that δ11B in the subducted sediment ranges from -6.6 to -9.9‰, with a negative correlation between δ11B and temperature. In contrast, B concentrations show no systematic relationship with temperature. Measured δ11B of -9.7 in the Sanbagawa schist, possibly a high-pressure-temperature analog of the Shimanto shale, is consistent with previous studies. However, 208Pb/204Pb and 207Pb/204Pb ratios indicate that the pelitic schist analyzed in this study was not derived from the same source rock as the Shimanto shale. Further work is needed to determine if there exists an appropriate analog within the Sanbagawa schist for high-temperature (300-500˚C) evolution of the Shimanto shale.",

            "abstract": "The fictitious time domain method (FTD), based on the correspondence principle for wave and diffusion fields, has been developed and used over the past few years primarily for marine electromagnetic (EM) modeling. Here we present results of our efforts to apply the FTD approach to land and airborne TEM problems which can reduce the computer time several orders of magnitude and preserve high accuracy. In contrast to the marine case, where sources are in the conductive sea water, we must model the EM fields in the air; to allow for topography air layers must be explicitly included in the computational domain. Furthermore, because sources for most TEM applications generally must be modeled as finite loops, it is useful to solve directly for the impulse response appropriate to the problem geometry, instead of the point-source Green functions typically used for marine problems. Our approach can be summarized as follows: (1) The EM diffusion equation is transformed to a fictitious wave equation. (2) The FTD wave equation is solved with an explicit finite difference time-stepping scheme, with CPML (Convolutional PML) boundary conditions for the whole computational domain including the air and earth , with FTD domain source corresponding to the actual transmitter geometry. Resistivity of the air layers is kept as low as possible, to compromise between efficiency (longer fictitious time step) and accuracy. We have generally found a host/air resistivity contrast of 10-3 is sufficient. (3)A \"Modified\" Fourier Transform (MFT) allow us recover system’s impulse response from the fictitious time domain to the diffusion (frequency) domain. (4) The result is multiplied by the Fourier transformation （FT） of the real source current avoiding time consuming convolutions in the time domain. (5) The inverse FT is employed to get the final full waveform and full time response of the system in the time domain. In general, this method can be used to efficiently solve most time-domain EM simulation problems for non-point sources.",

            "abstract": "The rheology and viscosity in the lithosphere and mantle are fundamental to understanding mantle and lithospheric dynamics including the emergence and evolution of plate tectonics on Earth and other planets. The viscosity is controlled by temperature, stress, and grain size, and particularly, the grain size leads to history-dependence in viscosity through damaging and healing processes at grain scales. Motivated by studies by Bercovici, Schubert and Ricard, [2015] and Schmalholz [2011], in this study, we investigate the rheology and viscosity in the vicinity of a subducted slab which hangs from the overlying lithosphere. We calculate both numerically and analytically the timescale on which viscosity diminishes to a minimum as a result of grain size reduction caused by buoyancy induced deformation and damage. The evolution equation for grain size (or fineness as the inverse grain size) is solved with a second order Runge-Kutta scheme, together with a tracer method, and the mantle dynamics is solved with Citcom which has been modified to include grain size dependent viscosity. We initially do not allow the slab’s buoyancy to evolve. The analytical solution for viscosity evolution and its timescale is derived under the assumption that stress is constant. We find that the analytical and numerical solutions of viscosity reduction with time are in good agreement with each other. In all cases, when Dσ2 > H, where D is damage parameter, σ stress, and H healing parameter, which ensures damage dominates over healing, the timescale of the viscosity reduction is inversely proportional to D, and is on the order of 1 Myr for an Earth-like planet. Our work implies that the evolution of rheology in a damage-dominated regime around a subducted slab is a rapid process. We will extend the models to allow slab buoyancy to co-evolve with grain size and viscosity to examine the effect on this characteristic timescale and slab dynamics.",

            "abstract": "We investigate variations in normal faulting along the Mariana trench through analyzing deformation of the subducting Pacific plate and geodynamic modeling. Detailed investigation was focused on three areas where high-resolution multibeam bathymetry data are available: the Southern (S) region at 140.8–144°E; the Central (C) region at 14.7–16.8°N; and the Northern (N) region at 18–21.2°N. In each of the study regions, we analyzed seafloor normal faults and calculated the statistics of fault parameters including strike, throw, density, and location relative to the trench axis. Our analysis revealed several key constraints: (1) Most of the normal faults are sub-parallel to the local strike of the trench axis, indicating that the normal faults were initiated by bending stresses in the subducting plate and not by pre-existing seafloor abyssal tectonic fabrics. (2) The normal faults were likely initiated within the outer rise region and reached maximum throw toward the trench. (3) The S-region has the largest trench relief (average of ~6 km) as well as the largest fault throw (maximum throw reached ~320 m when averaged over 5 km of trench-perpendicular profiles). In contrast, the N-region has much smaller trench relief (~2 km) and smaller fault throw (maximum fault throw reached only ~180 m). We then modeled the subducting plate as an elasto-plastic slab subjected to tectonic forcing at the trench axis, including vertical load (V0), bending moment (M0), and horizontal tensional force (F0). Using the above observations as constraints, modeling revealed the following key results: (1) The best-fitting solutions for the S-region are V0 = 5.8 x 1012 N/m, M0 = 9.6 x 1016 N, and F0 = 3.6 x 1012 N/m, yielding the horizontal extensional force to vertical loading ratio F0/V0 = 62%. (2) The best-fitting V0 for the N- and C-regions are about 33% and 41% that of the S-region. Meanwhile, the best-fitting M0 for the N- and C-regions are about 80% and 60% that of the S-region. (3) The best-fitting F0 for the N- and C-regions are calculated to be ~66% larger than that of the S-region. We hypothesize that the significant variations in normal faulting along the Mariana trench are related to variations in tectonic loading and variables including plate subduction geometry, plate properties, and presence of seamounts in the sub ducting plate.",

A focus on the variability in the onset of basal melt is additionally required to understand Arctic melt patterns. Monitoring basal melt provides a glimpse into the importance of ocean heating to sea ice melt. This warming is predominantly through seawater exposure due to lead opening and the associated solar warming at the ocean’s surface. We present the temporal variability in basal melt onset observed by ice mass balance buoys throughout the Arctic Ocean since 2003, providing a different perspective than the satellite microwave data used to measure the onset of surface melt. We found that melt onset varies greatly, even for buoys deployed within 100km of each other. Therefore large volumes of data are necessary to accurately estimate the variability of basal melt onset. Once the variability of basal melt onset has been identified, we can investigate how this range has been changing as a response to atmospheric and oceanic warming, changes in ice morphology as well as the intensification of the ice albedo feedback.",

            "abstract": "Nor’easters can be loosely defined as extratropical cyclones that develop as they progress northward along the eastern coast of North America. The path makes it possible for these storms to generate storm surge along the coastline and/or heavy precipitation or snow inland. In the present analysis, the path of the storms is investigated relative to the behavior of upstream blocking events over the North Atlantic Ocean. For this analysis, two separate Lagrangian tracking methods are used to identify the extratropical cyclone paths and the blocking events. Using the cyclone paths, Nor’easters are identified and blocking statistics are calculated for the days prior to, during and following the occurrence of the Nor’easters. The path, strength and intensification rates of the cyclones are compared with the strength and location of the blocks. In the event that a Nor’easter occurs, the likelihood of the presence of block at the southeast tip of Greenland is statistically significantly increased, i.e., the presence of a block concurrent with a Nor’easter happens more often than by random coincidence. However no significant link between the strength of the storms and the strength of the block is identified. These results suggest that the presence of the block mainly affects the path of the Nor’easters. On the other hand, in the event of blocking at the southeast tip of Greenland, the likelihood of a Nor’easter, as opposed to a different type of storm is no greater than what one might expect from randomly sampling cyclone tracks. The results confirm a long held understanding in forecast meteorology that upstream blocking is a necessary but not sufficient condition for generating a Nor’easter.",

            "abstract": "We have conducted simulations of the response of the geospace system to a sudden change in the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) using the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global magnetohydrodynamic code. Specifically, we have explored a sudden change in the IMF orientation from an extended period during which it was steady northward, to a steady southward IMF. The change in the IMF orientation first causes a reversal in the direction of the bow shock current, which launches a fast mode wave that propagates through the system, causing changes in the overall current pattern even before the southward IMF arrives at the dayside magnetopause to initiate low latitude merging. When the southward IMF does arrive at the magnetopause, the preceding northward IMF in the solar wind flow is still driving high latitude merging poleward of the cusp. Even when the two-cell convection pattern in the ionosphere becomes the dominant convection, the LFM results show that there is still some remnant of the high latitude reverse cell convection that is associated with northward IMF that had previously merged with the geomagnetic field and which takes some time to be cleared out of the system. We will present a detailed account of the timescales and changes in the magnetic topologies, current systems, magnetospheric plasma flows, and ionospheric potential patterns associated with the transition from northward to southward IMF. We will also discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the effect of transient changes in IMF orientations.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic tremors in Taiwan have been discovered beneath the southern Central Range, but their hosting structure has been unknown. Here we constrain the focal mechanism of underground deformation related to tremors, using moment tensor inversion in the very low frequency band and tidal stress analysis.\nThree types of seismic data are used for two analysis steps: detection of tremors and the moment tensor inversion. Short-period seismograms from CWBSN are used for tremor detection. Broadband seismograms from BATS and the TAIGER project are used for both steps.\nAbout 1000 tremors were detected using an envelope correlation method in the high frequency band (2-8 Hz). Broadband seismograms are stacked relative to the tremor timing, and inverted for a moment tensor in the low frequency band (0.02-0.05 Hz). The best solution was obtained at 32 km depth, as a double-couple consistent with a low-angle thrust fault dipping to the east-southeast, or a high-angle thrust with a south-southwest strike.\nAlmost all tremors occur when tidal shear stress is positive and normal stress is negative (clamping). Since the clamping stress is high for a high-angle thrust fault, the low-angle thrust fault is more likely to be the fault plane. Tremor rate increases non-linearly with increasing shear stress, suggesting a velocity strengthening friction law. The high tidal sensitivity is inconsistent with horizontal slip motion suggested by previous studies, and normal faults that dominates regional shallow earthquakes.\nOur results favor thrust slip on a low-angle fault dipping to the east-southeast, consistent with the subduction of the Eurasian plate. The tremor region is characterized by a deep thermal anomaly with decrease normal stress. This region has also experienced enough subduction to produce metamorphic fluids. A large amount of fluid and low vertical stress may explain the high tidal sensitivity.",

In particular, SCF reduces the sensitivity of longitudinal velocity (VP) to lateral temperature variations around 1700 km [2]. It also dramatically impacts the manifestation of two important types of compositional heterogeneities, i.e., change in iron concentration in Fp or in molar fraction of Fp in the aggregate. It enhances the sensitivity of Vϕ and VP to these compositional variations by several-fold. In addition, it affects the mantle adiabatic geotherm, altering the radial velocity profile.

Their existence extends from the Archaean (~3500 mya) until present and their lithified structure evidences the capacity of microbial communities to mediate mineral precipitation. Living microbialites are a useful study model to test the mechanisms involved in carbonates and other minerals precipitation. Here, we studied the chemical composition, the biomass and the microbial structure of extant microbialites. All of these were found in Mexico, in water systems of different and characteristic ionic firms. An elemental analysis (C:N) of microbial biomass was performed and total P was determined. To explore the chemical composition of microbialites as a whole, X-ray diffraction analyses were performed over dry microbialites. While overall inorganic carbon content (carbonates) represented >70% of the living layer, a protocol of inorganic carbon elimination was performed for each sample resulting in organic matter contents between 8 and 16% among microbialites. Stoichiometric ratios of C:N:P in microbialite biomass were different among samples, and the possibility of P limitation was suggested mainly for karstic microbialites, N limitation was suggested for all samples and, more intensively, for soda system microbialites. A differential capacity for biomass allocation among microbialites was observed. Microbialites showed, along the biogeographic gradient, a diverse arrangement of microbial assemblages within the mineral matrix. While environmental factors such as pH and nitrate concentration were the factors that defined the general structure and diversity of these assemblages, we intend to test if the abundance of major ions and trace metals are also defining microbialite characteristics (such as microbial structure and biomass).\nThis work contributes to define a baseline of the chemical nature of extant microbial consortia actively participating in mineral precipitation processes.",

More than 500 kilns were excavated in Sakai city and vicinities, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. The kiln group is called as Suemura Kilns, and are for Sueki earthenware of 5c to 10c CE. About 300 kilns were sampled and most of the samples were measured at the time, and the results are reported in e.g. Hirooka (1971) and Shibuya (1980). However, the results have significant scatter in direction, which may be due to the limitation of old astatic magnetometer measurements and handwriting graphic determination of magnetic direction, and/or the lack of demagnetization. We recently inherited many of those samples and remeasured them with spinner magnetometer applying alternation field demagnetization (afd). The magnetizations are generally very stable, as usual as other archeomagnetic samples, and afd does not change the magnetic direction mostly. However, significant number of sites show large scatter in magnetic directions, which might be due to the wrong identification of kiln floor or disturbance at the time of collapsing or excavation. Taking kilns of α95<4o, we recovered 131 paleomagnetic directions. Although third of them are dated by pottery shape chronology, the range of each pottery style is not precisely known and the relation of the baked floor and the potteries excavated around kilns are not always clear. The carbon dating of those kilns are very scares. Thus we first try to draw secular variation curve in declination-inclination plot. With the rough ages of those kilns, it is pretty easy to draw the SVC. It is also numerically determined taking the distance of each direction from nearest point in SVC and the velocity change of the SVC as penalty function, within a couple of degrees in the error. The the age of each point is assigned to satisfy the archeological ages.\nThis precise SVC in the far east will improve understanding the geomagnetic variations, as well as application to the archeological dating.",

            "abstract": "Previous investigations of ionospheric storm-enhanced density (SED) and tongue of ionization (TOI) focused mostly on the behavior of TOI during intense geomagnetic storms. Little attention has been paid to the spatial and temporal variations of TOI during weak to moderate geomagnetic disturbed conditions. we investigate the source and development of TOI during a moderate geomagnetic storm on 14 October 2012.Multi-instrumental observations including GPS total electron content (TEC), Defense Meteorological SatelliteProgram(DMSP) in situ measured total ion concentration and ion drift velocity, SuperDARN measured polar ionconvection patterns, and electron density profiles from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) have been utilized in the current analysis. GPS TEC maps show salient TOI structures persisting for about 5 h over high latitudes of North America on 14 October 2012 in the later recovery phase of the storm when the magnitudes of IMF By and Bz were less than 5 nT. The PFISR electron density profiles indicate that the extra ionization for TEC enhancements mainly occurred in the topside ionosphere with no obvious changes in the bottom side ionosphere and vertical plasma drifts. Additionally, there were no signatures of penetration electric fields in the equatorial electrojet data and upward ion drifts at high latitudes. At the same time, strong subauroral polarization streams with ion drift speeds exceeding 2.5 km/s carried sunward fluxes and migrated toward lower latitudes for about 5° based on the DMSP cross-track driftmeasurements. Based on those measurements,we postulate that the combined effects of initial build-up of ionization at midlatitudes through daytime production of ionization and equatorward (or less poleward than normal daytime) neutral wind reducing downward diffusion along the inclined filed lines, and an expanded polar ion convection pattern and its associated horizontal plasma transport are important in the formation of the TOI.",

            "abstract": "By using 7 years optical auroral observations obtained at Yellow River Station at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, we performed the first extensive survey for the dayside diffuse auroras (DDAs) and acquired observational results as follows. (1) The DDAs can be classified into 2 broad categories, i.e., unstructured and structured DDAs. The unstructured DDAs are mainly distributed in morning and afternoon, but the structured DDAs predominantly occurred around the magnetic local noon (MLN). (2) The unstructured DDAs observed in morning and afternoon present obviously different properties. The afternoon ones are much stable and seldom show pulsating property. (3) The DDAs are more easily observed under geomagnetically quiet times. (4) The structured DDAs mainly show patchy, stripy, and irregular forms, and are often pulsating and drifting. The drifting directions are mostly westward (with speed ~5 km/s), but there are cases showing eastward or poleward drifting. (5) The stripy DDAs are exclusively observed near the MLN and, most importantly, their alignments are confirmed to be consistent with the direction of ionospheric convection near the MLN. (6) A new auroral form, called throat aurora, is found to be developed from the stripy DDAs. Based on the observational results and previous studies, we proposed our explanations to the DDAs. We suggest that the unstructured DDAs observed in the morning are extensions of the nightside diffuse aurora to the dayside, but that observed in the afternoon are predominantly caused by proton precipitations. The structured DDAs occurred near the MLN are caused by interactions of cold plasma structures, which are supposed to be originated from the ionospheric outflows or plasmaspheric drainage plumes, with hot electrons from the plasma sheet. We suppose that the cold plasma structures for producing the patchy DDAs are in lumpy and are more likely from the plasmaspheric drainage plumes. The cold plasm structure for producing the stripy DDAs should be in wedge-like and are generated by conveying the cold plasmas from lower latitude towards higher latitude with magnetospheric convection, and that for producing the irregular DDAs are resulted from deforming the wedge-like structure by disturbance. The throat aurora is supposed to be projection of a newly-opened flux of reconnection.",

            "abstract": "The Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple is thought to have been a significant early energy metabolism involved in some of the first biogeochemical processes on Earth (Weber et al., 2006). The early evolving and metal-rich nature of modern hydrothermal systems remain particularly significant for Fe-based activities (Vargas et al., 1998). Documented evidence from such systems show a variety of yet unknown microbial lineages potentially linked to the history of Fe (i.e., Meyer-Dombard and Amend, 2014). Here we describe a novel microbe that reduces Fe(III) at shallow-water hydrothermal vents in Milos Island, Greece. Our laboratory experiments show this strain, MAG-PB1T, to reduce Fe(III) between 30 - 70 °C, 0 - 50 g NaCl l-1 and pH 5.5 - 8.0. Shortest generation time occurred under optimal conditions (60 °C, ~1.8 g NaCl l-1, pH 6.0) with H2 as the energy source, CO2 as the carbon source and Fe(III) as electron acceptor. Its metabolic characteristics are, however, not limited to this pathway. Strain MAG-PB1T can also reduce Mn(IV), arsenate and selenate. Its use of at least 9 organic substrates as energy or carbon sources also demonstrates its mixotrophy.\nPhylogenetic 16S rRNA gene analyses place strain MAG-PB1T within the Deltaproteobacteria, with the closest match (99%) being an uncultured microbe from hydrothermal springs in Ambitle Island, Papua New Guinea (Meyer-Dombard and Amend, 2014). Its next closest match (97%) is Deferrisoma camini, isolated from a deep-sea vent in the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (Slobodkina et al. 2012). Our strain represents a novel species, which we named Deferrisoma paleochoriense. The occurrence of D. paleochoriense in the shallow-water vents of Milos and Ambitle islands coincides with high arsenic, iron and sulfide contents (Akerman et al., 2011; Price et al., 2013; Yücel et al., 2013). Consequently, our study provides important physiological and metabolic evidence of the feedback between metal chemistry and life in hydrothermal sytems rich in iron and arsenic.",

            "abstract": "Drought is a major climate change concern for the Earth’s rainforests; however little is currently known about how these forests and individual plants will respond to water stress. At the individual level, the ability of plants to regulate their stomatal conductance is an important preservation mechanism that helps to cool leaves, regulate water loss, and uptake carbon dioxide. At the ecosystem level, transpiration in rainforests is a major contributor to the positive feedback loop that returns moisture to the atmosphere for continued precipitation cycles. Nearly 60% of atmospheric moisture in the Amazon rain forests has been traced back to origins of transpiration from its plants. In relation to current climatic conditions, stomatal conductance rates are highly variable across rainforest species and environmental conditions. It is still unknown to what extent these rates will decrease at leaf and forest level in response to periods of drought.\nThe University of Arizona’s Biosphere 2 (B2) served as the study site for a simulated 4-week long drought because of its ability to mimic the micrometeorology of an Amazonian rainforest. Three species of plants were chosen at various levels in the canopy: Clitoria racemosa, Cissus sicyoides, and Hibiscus elatus. These plants were selected based on their relative abundance and distribution in the B2 forest. It was revealed that two out of the three species exhibited decreases in H20 efflux at each elevation, while one species (C. racemosa) proved much more resistant, at each elevation, to H20 loss. These results may be useful for future integrative modeling of how individual leaf level responses extend to entire ecosystem scales. It will be important to better understand how rainforests conserve, recycle, and lose water to gauge their response to warming climate, and increased periods of drought in the tropics.",

            "abstract": "Model reduction techniques using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) have been very effective in applications to confined groundwater flow models. These techniques consist of performing a projection of the solution of the full model onto a reduced basis. POD combined with the snapshot approach has been successfully applied to highly discretized linear models. In many cases, the reduced model is orders of magnitude smaller than the full model and runs 1,000 times faster. For nonlinear models, such as the unconfined groundwater flow, direct application of POD requires additional calls to the full model to generate additional snapshots. This is time consuming and increases the dimension of the reduced model. The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) is a technique that avoids the additional full model calls and captures the dynamics of the nonlinear term while reducing the dimensions.\nHere, POD and DEIM are combined to reduce both the nonlinear unconfined groundwater flow and solute transport equations. To prove the concept, simple one-dimensional models are created for MODFLOW and MT3DMS separately. The dual approach is then tested on a density-dependent flow and transport simulation using the LMT package developed for MODFLOW. For each iteration of the nonlinear flow solver and the transport solver, the respective reduced models are solved instead. Numerical experiments show that significant reduction is obtainable before errors become too large. This method is well suited for a coastal aquifer seawater intrusion scenario, where nonlinearities only exist in small subregions of the model domain. A fine discretization can be utilized and POD will effectively eliminate unnecessary parameterization by projecting the full model system matrix onto a subspace with fewer column dimensions. DEIM can then reduce the row dimension of the original system by using only those state variable nodes with the most influence. This combined approach allows for full characterization of a groundwater basin in the simulation without the severe runtime limitations introduced by nonlinearities and growing dimensionality.",

During such blocking events the Gulf Stream may be exposed to repeated Cold Air Outbreak (CAO) events, especially during winter. Hypothesizing, based upon basic physical and thermodynamic properties of seawater, one would expect increased CAO events to lead alteration of key characteristics of the Gulf Stream. As the Gulf Stream is a well-known participant in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and the Gulf Stream feeds the North Atlantic Current into the Arctic Ocean, interesting consequences to alterations of this local system into the large-scale general climate circulation are expected.

            "abstract": "Cr(VI) sorption experiments were conducted as a function of pH (4.7, 7.0 and 9.7) using nanosized FeS-coated sand under anoxic environments. Under the experimental conditions, the sand used, with the FeS content of 0.068 mmol per 1 g sand, completely reduced the initially added Cr(VI) to Cr(III) over the pH range examined. The sorption of the once-reduced Cr(III) varied greatly with the solution pH. By the solution-phase analysis, significant amounts of Cr(III) remained as dissolved species at pH 4.7. On the other hands, dissolved Cr was below the detection limit (0.2 μM) at pH 7.0 and 9.7, indicating the greater sorption of Cr(III) at neutral to basic pH than acidic pH. From Cr-K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis of the solid products, the sorbed Cr was shown to be present predominantly as trivalent state in all samples. Regardless of pH, the second coordination shell around Cr (i.e., the Cr-Cr(Fe) shell) was shown to be located at ~2.6 Å, which was far shorter than those in Cr(III)-bearing model compounds such as Cr(OH)3(s) and [Cr, Fe](OH)3(s). Furthermore, the coordination numbers of the second and third shells in the sorption samples (N = 0.7-1.8) were much lower than those in Cr(OH)3(s) and [Cr, Fe](OH)3(s). Taken together, the sorption of the once-reduced Cr(III) was likely to occur via surface-mediated processes (e.g., surface complexation and/or surface precipitation) rather than the bulk-phase precipitation.\nFinancial support was provided by the \"R&D Project on Environmental Management of Geologic CO2 Storage\" from the KEITI (Project Number: 2014001810003).",

            "abstract": "Subducted marine sediments have recently been called upon to explain the heterogeneous Mg isotopic composition (δ26Mg, ‰) found in mantle wehrlites (-0.39 to +0.09 [1]) in the context of a homogeneous mantle (-0.25 ± 0.07 [2]). However, no systematic measurements of δ26Mg on marine sediments are currently available to provide direct support to this model. To characterize the Mg inputs to global subduction zones, we measured δ26Mg data for a total of 90 marine sediments collected from 12 drill sites outboard of the world’s major subduction zones. These sediments span a 1.73‰ range in δ26Mg. The detritus-dominated sediments have δ26Mg (-0.59 to +0.53) comparable to those of weathered materials on continents (e.g. -0.52 to +0.92 [3]), while the calcareous oozes yield δ26Mg (as light as -1.20) more similar to the seawater value (-0.83 [4]). The negative correlation between δ26Mg and CaO/Al2O3 in these sediments indicates the primary control of mineralogy over the Mg isotopic distribution among different sediment types, as carbonates are enriched in light Mg isotopes (-5.10 to -0.40 [5]) whereas clay-rich weathering residues generally have heavier δ26Mg (e.g. up to +0.65 in saprolite [6]). In addition, chemical weathering and grain-size sorting drive sediments to a heavier δ26Mg, as indicated by the broad positive trends between δ26Mg with CIA (Chemical Index of Alteration [7]) and Al2O3/SiO2, respectively. Collectively, the arc systems sampled in this study represent ~30% of global arc length and the extrapolated global Mg flux of subducting marine sediments accounts for ~9% of the yearly Mg riverine input with a flux-weighted average δ26Mg at -0.26. Subduction of these heterogeneous sediments may not cause significant mantle heterogeneity on a global scale, but the highly variable Mg fluxes and δ26Mg of sediments delivered to different trenches are capable of producing local mantle variations. Volcanic rocks sourced from these mantle domains are thus likely to carry a distinct Mg isotopic signal.

In this study, we interpreted four multi-channel seismic profiles across the Southwest Sub-basin (SWSB), integrated for stratigraphic correlation with new drilling data from the Integrated Ocean Discovery Program （IODP） 349 Expedition. Results show that the Neogene sediments are divided into four stratigraphic units, each with distinctive seismic reflectors. Analysis of sedimentation rates and lithology suggests the sedimentary processes were climate dominated. Winter monsoon strength and increased aridity in the late Miocene limited accumulation rates in the SWSB, and summer monsoons and a variable glacial-interglacial climate since the Pliocene enhanced accumulation rates in the SWSB. Although the SWSB experienced NE–SW propagated spreading, terrigeneous sediments in the SWSB more likely originated from the southwest.\nThree basement domains are classified with different sedimentary architectures and basement structures, including hyper-stretched crust, exhumed mantle, and steady state oceanic crusts. The SWSB experienced asymmetry geometry with detachment faulting in the final stage of continental rifting and exhumation of continental mantle lithosphere. Lithospheric breakup occurs after that of the crust, and the establishment oceanic spreading center and steady state crust production is delayed.",

            "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that remote sensing (RS) and Earth System Models (ESM) can make important contributions to the analysis, monitoring and prediction of waterborne and vector-borne illnesses. Unsurprisingly, however, the great majority of these studies have been proof-of-concept investigations, and vanishingly few have been translated into operational and utilized disease early warning systems. To some extent this is simply an example of the general challenge of translating research findings into decision-relevant operations. Disease early warning, however, entails specific challenges that distinguish it from many other fields of environmental monitoring and prediction. Some of these challenges stem from predictability and data constraints, while others relate to the difficulty of communicating predictions and the particularly high price of false alarms. This presentation will review progress on the translation of analysis to decision making, identify avenues for enhancing forecast utility, and propose priorities for future RS and ESM investments in disease monitoring and prediction.",

            "abstract": "Despite the importance of thermoelastic properties of minerals in geophysics, their measurements at high pressures and temperatures are limited. Thus, ab initio calculations are an essential tool for predicting these properties at extreme conditions. Owing to the approximate description of the exchange-correlation energy and to approximations used in calculations of vibrational effects, these methods produce systematic deviations. Hybrid schemes combining experimental data and theoretical results have emerged as a way to reconcile available information and offer more reliable predictions at experimentally inaccessible thermodynamics conditions. Here we introduce a hybrid scheme to reconcile calculated and measured elastic coefficients and apply it to rock-salt-type NaCl, a challenging material to describe by ab initio and an important mineral in the context of oil/gas exploration. The approach is predictive within the temperature range of validity of the quasiharmonic approximation and results are used to generate velocities of NaCl at desirable geological conditions.\n[1] Marcondes, M.

The elastic anisotropy in the Earth’s mantle transition zone which between 410 and 660 km plays an important role to understand the convection from the upper mantle and the low mantle. The three polymorphs of Mg2SiO4, forsterite, wadsleysite, and ringwoodite (α, β and γ phases, respectively), are the most abundant minerals in the Earth’s upper mantle and transition zone. We have determined from first-principles thermal elastic constant tensor and obtain the elastic anisotropy of the three polymorphs of Mg2SiO4 at pressure-temperature conditions of the mantle transition zone. Our results show that the elastic anisotropy of the three polymorphs of Mg2SiO4 is sensitive to temperature at the upper mantle pressure. The mantle transition zone anisotropy may originate from the lattice preferred orientation of the three polymorphs anisotropic materials. Our results can therefore be used to important constrain on mantle deformation mechanisms.",

Because of the abundant rainfall and low-lying terrain, the area frequently suffers from flood hazard which have caused serious casualty and economic loss. In order to reduce the severe impacts of floods events, numerous polder areas and hydraulic constructions (including pumps, water gates etc.) were constructed.\nFlood Hazard Map is an effective non-structural flood mitigation tool measures. Numerical simulation of flood propagation is one of the key technologies of flood hazard mapping. Because of the complexity of its underlying surface characteristics, numerical simulation of flood propagation was faced with some special problems for the plain river network area in Taihu Basin. In this paper, a coupled one and two dimensional hydrodynamic model was established. Densely covered and interconnected river networks, numerous polder areas and complex scheduling hydraulic constructions were generalized in the model. The model was proved to be believable and stable. Based on the results of the simulation of flood propagation, flood hazard map was compiled.",

            "abstract": "We examine surface deformation caused by the Mw 6.0 24 August, 2014 South Napa Earthquake using high-resolution pre and post event airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) observations. Temporally spaced LiDAR surveys taken before and after an earthquake can provide decimeter-level, 3D near-field estimates of deformation. These near-field deformation estimates can help constrain fault slip and rheology of shallow seismogenic zones. We compare and contrast estimates of deformation obtained from pre and post-event LiDAR data sets of the 2014 South Napa Earthquake using two change detection techniques, Iterative Control Point (ICP) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The ICP algorithm has been and still is the primary technique for acquiring three dimensional deformations from airborne LiDAR data sets. It conducts a rigid registration of pre-event data points to post event data points via iteratively matching data points with the smallest Euclidian distances between data sets. PIV is a technique derived from fluid mechanics that measures the displacement of a particle between two images of known time. LiDAR points act as the particles within the point cloud images so that their movement represents the horizontal deformation of the surface. The results from these change detection techniques are presented and further analyzed for differences between the techniques, the effects of temporal spacing between LiDAR collections, and the use of permanent LiDAR scatterers to constrain deformation estimates. The airborne LiDAR results will also be compared with far field deformations from space based geodetic techniques (InSAR and GNSS) and field observations of surface displacement.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data provide the detailed information required to image subsurface structures. Recent advances in GPR monitoring now also make it possible to study transient hydrologic processes, but high-speed data acquisition is critical for this application. We therefore highlight the capabilities of our automated system to acquire time-lapse, high-resolution multifold GPR data during infiltration of water into soils. The system design allows for fast acquisition of constant-offset (COP) and common-midpoint profiles (CMP) to monitor unsaturated flow at multiple locations. Qualitative interpretation of the unprocessed COPs can provide substantial information regarding the hydrologic response of the system, such as the complexities of patterns associated with the wetting of the soil and geophysical evidence of non-uniform propagation of a wetting front. While we find that unprocessed images are informative, we show that the spatial variability of velocity introduced by infiltration events can complicate the images and that migration of the data is an effective tool to improve interpretability of the time-lapse images. The ability of the system to collect high density CMP data also introduces the potential for improving the velocity model along with the image via reflection tomography in the post-migrated domain. We show that for both simulated and empirical time-lapse GPR profiles we can resolve a propagating wetting front in the soil that is in good agreement with the response of in-situ soil moisture measurements. The data from these experiments illustrate the importance of high-speed, high-resolution GPR data acquisition for obtaining insight about the dynamics of hydrologic events. Continuing research is aimed at improving the quantitative analysis of surface-based GPR monitoring data for identifying preferential flow in soils.",

            "abstract": "The central Japan is one of the most concentrated area of active faults (Quaternary fault). These are roughly classified into two orthogonally-oriented fault sets of NE-SW and NW-SE strikes. The study area is located in Gifu prefecture, central Japan. In there, the basement rocks are composed mainly of Triassic-Jurassic accretionary prism (Mino belt), Cretaceous Nohi Rhyolite and Cretaceous granitic rocks. Miocene Mizunami G. and Pliocene-Pleistocene Toki Sand and Gravel F. unconformably cover the basement rocks. The Byobuyama fault, 32 km in length, is NE-SW strike and displaces perpendicularly the Toki Sand and Gravel F. by 500 m. The northeastern terminal of the fault has contact with the southern terminal of the Atera fault of NW-SE strike and offset their displacements each other. It is clear that the activity of the Byobuyama fault plays a role of the development of the complicated fault geometry system in the central Japan.\nIn this study, we performed a broad-based investigation along the Byobuyama fault and collected samples. Actually, we observed 400 faults and analyzed 200 fault rocks. Based on these results, we obtained the following new opinion.\n1. The Byobuyama fault has experienced following activities that can be divided to 3 stages at least under different stress field. 1) Movement with the sinisterly sense (preserved in cataclasite zone). 2) Dextral movement (preserved in fault gouge zone). 3) Reverse fault movement (due to the aggressive rise of mountains). In addition, the change from Stage 2 to Stage 3 is a continuous.\n2. There is a relationship between the distance from the trace of the Byobuyama fault and the combination of alteration minerals included in the fault rocks.\n3. In the central part of the Byobuyama fault (CPBF), fault plane trend and combination of alteration minerals shows specific features.\nThe continuous change is considered to mean the presence of factors that interfere with the dextral movement of the Byobuyama fault. What is considered as one of the factors is the effect of the fault zone adjacent, especially the Atera fault. CPBF is located just southeast extension of the Akou fault, NW-SE strike. We think that this extension reaches up to CPBF.\nBased on the above, we make a presentation about interaction of two faults from the point of view of kinematic vicissitudes and alteration process.",

ICMEs are the predominant drivers of intense geomagnetic storms. In this paper we study the geoeffectiveness of ICMEs based on the ICME catalogue and the Dst indices the geoeffectiveness of ICMEs during 1996-2013. Based on the different in situ observation signatures, all ICMEs (338 events) are divided into three types of: isolated ICMEs (I-ICMEs), multiple ICMEs (M-ICMEs) and shock-embedded ICMEs (S-ICMEs). We find that about 58% of ICMEs caused geomagnetic storms with Dst_min <-30nT. Meanwhile, about 21% of ICMEs caused intense geomagnetic storms and almost all the intense geomagnetic storms are caused by the ICMEs. It also find that the south component of the magnetic field (Bs), the solar wind velocity (V) and the dawn-dust electric field Ey=VxBs are most important parameters in determine the geoeffectiveness of the ICMEs. We further get the critical values of these parameters of the ICMEs which can be used to determine whether a ICME can cause a geomagnetic storm. During solar cycle 24th, there are extremely low number of geomagnetic storms by the reason that the number of strong ICMEs arrived at the Earth is small. The S-ICMEs structures can cause the geomagnetic storms especially intense geomagnetic storms with high possibility. It statistically show the result that the S-ICMEs are important sources of the geomagnetic storms especially for intense storms.",

            "abstract": "Seismic reflection wave is significantly affected by the complexity in the near surface area. Therefore, it is important for subsurface imaging to obtain the near surface information as much as possible in exploration seismology. Seismic attenuation, described by the quality or Q factor, has great effect on the seismic waveform. But it is rarely estimated for the near surface. It is very important to determine a reliable Q structure for accurate full waveform simulation.\n Elastic full waveform data includes a variety of wave modes: P-waves, converted waves and surface waves. Early arrivals mostly contain information of VP and QP. The S waves contain information of VS and QS. We propose a method to determine velocities and Q factors simultaneously via joint early arrivals and surface wave inversions for VP, QP, VS and QS. Many methods for elastic full waveform inversion have been developed in both 2D and 3D. However, these methods need too much computation time when inverting massive data. We develop a technique to perform 2D structure inversion using 1D forward modeling which is named pseudo 2D elastic waveform inversion. This method can only deal with approximate 1D structure which may have small anomalies. However, it saves computational time compared to conventional 2D full waveform inversion. This inversion method can help image useful information about approximately layered near surface.\n We generate some synthetic structures and do inversion tests. The inversion results are satisfying. Then we apply this method to real data from an oil field in China. The inversion results show us this area has strong attenuation in the near surface and low Q values have great influence on waveforms.    ",

Previous studies demonstrated that activated carbon coated with ferric-aluminum hydroxides (Fe-Al-C) has high adsorptive potential for removal of arsenic. In this study, a series of experiments using Fe-Al-C were carried to discuss adsorption equilibrium time, adsorption equilibrium concentration and adsorption rate of arsenic for Fe-Al-C.\nFe-Al-C used in this study was provided by Astec Co., Ltd. Powder reagent of disodium hydrogen arsenate heptahydrate was dissolved into ion-exchanged water. The solution was then further diluted with ion-exchanged water to be 1 and 10 mg/L as arsenic concentration. The pH of the solution was adjusted to be around 7 by adding HCl and/or NaOH. The solution was used as artificial arsenic contaminated water in two types of experiments (arsenic adsorption equilibrium and arsenic adsorption rate tests).\nThe results of the arsenic equilibrium tests were showed that a time period of about 3 days to reach apparent adsorption equilibrium for arsenic. The apparent adsorption equilibrium concentration and adsorbed amount of arsenic on Fe-Al-C adsorbent could be estimated by application of various adsorption isotherms, but the distribution coefficient of arsenic between solid and liquid varies with experimental conditions such as initial concentration of arsenic and addition concentration of adsorbent. An adsorption rate equation that takes into account the reduction in the number of effective adsorption sites on the adsorbent caused by the arsenic adsorption reaction was derived based on the data obtained from the arsenic adsorption rate tests.",

            "abstract": "Evidence of exceptionally warm Arctic interglacials from Lake El’gygytgyn NE Russia, combined with the periodic collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (ANDRILL) suggests the need to reassess climate sensitivity and cryospheric dynamics on many timescales. It may be easier to melt significant portions of large sheets and drive large ecosystem changes in the high latitudes than we thought! Elevated global temperatures of only a few degrees (or less) combined with polar amplification seems to have repeatedly caused large changes in the cryosphere and global sea level, still under investigation given the present knowledge and complexity of glacio-isostatic adjustments. But increasing evidence of a forested Arctic and smaller polar ice sheets in the Pliocene when CO2 was around 400 ppm (like today) and during several more recent super interglacials (under Milankovitch forcing) most likely presages a warming future, partially hidden in recent years by the lagged response of the oceans, atmosphere, and cryosphere to anthropogenic influences. The future will depend on the ability of societies to recognize and respond to the consequences of significant environmental change. The challenge to the science community is to communicate this data-driven reality effectively and without politics.",

Three of these sites were located along the southwestern edge of the valley and\nthe other two adjoined the southeastern. Receiver Functions (RFs) at these sites were calculated using\nthe iterative time domain deconvolution method and jointly inverted with surface wave dispersion\ndata to estimate the shear wave velocity structure beneath each station. To further test the results of\ninversion, we applied forward modelling by dividing the crust beneath each station into 4-6\nhomogeneous, isotropic layers. Moho depths were separately calculated at different piercing points\nfrom the inversion of only a few stacked receiver functions of high quality around each piercing point.\nThese uncertainties were further reduced to ±2 km by trial forward modelling as Moho depths were\nvaried over a range of ±6 km in steps of 2 km and the synthetic receiver functions matched with the\ninverted ones. The final values were also found to be close to those independently estimated using the\nH-K stacks. The Moho depths on the eastern edge of the valley and at piercing points in its\nsouthwestern half are close to 55 km, but increase to about 58 km on the eastern edge, suggesting that\nhere, as in the central and Nepal Himalaya, the Indian plate dips northeastwards beneath the Himalaya.\nWe also calculated the Vp/Vs ratio beneath these 5 stations which were found to lie between 1.7 and\n1.76, yielding a Poisson’s ratio of ~0.25 which is characteristic of a felsic composition.",

            "abstract": "The Perth Abyssal Plain (PAP), offshore southwest Australia formed during Mesozoic East Gondwana breakup and Kerguelen plume activity. This study combines petrographic and geochemical data from the first samples ever to be dredged from the flanks of the Dirck Hartog Ridge (DHR), a prominent linear bathymetric feature in the central PAP, with new bathymetric profiles across the PAP to better constrain the formation of the early Indian Ocean floor.\nThe DHR exhibits high relief and distinctive asymmetry that is unusual compared to most active or extinct spreading centres and likely results from compression and deformation of the recently extinct DHR during changes in relative motion of the Indian plate (110 - 100 Ma). Exhumation of gabbros in the southern DHR and an increase in seafloor roughness towards the centre of the PAP, likely result from a half spreading rate decrease from 35 mm/yr (based on magnetic reversals) to 24 mm/yr at ~114 Ma. The results support a slowdown of spreading prior to full cessation at ~102 Ma.\nThe composition of basaltic samples varies along the DHR: from sub-alkaline dolerites with incompatible element concentrations most similar to depleted-to-normal mid-ocean ridge basalts in the south, to alkali basalts similar to ocean island basalts in the north. Therefore, magma sources and degrees of partial melting varied in space and time, a result supporting the interpretation that the DHR is an extinct spreading ridge rather than a pseudofault. The enriched alkali basalt signatures may be attributed to melting of a heterogeneous mantle or to the influence of the Kerguelen plume over distances greater than 1000 km.\nThe results demonstrate the significance of regional tectonic plate motions on the formation and deformation of young ocean crust, and provide insight into the unique DHR morphology.",

            "abstract": "Networks conducting long term monitoring using in situ sensors need the functionality to track physical equipment as well as deployments, calibrations, and other actions related to site and equipment maintenance. The observational data being generated by sensors are enhanced if direct linkages to equipment details and actions can be made. This type of information is typically recorded in field notebooks or in static files, which are rarely linked to observations in a way that could be used to interpret results. However, the record of field activities is often relevant to analysis or post-processing of the observational data. We have developed an underlying database schema and deployed a web interface for recording and retrieving information on physical infrastructure and related actions for observational networks. The database schema for equipment was designed as an extension to the Observations Data Model 2 (ODM2), a community-developed information model for spatially discrete, feature based earth observations. The core entities of ODM2 describe location, observed variable, and timing of observations, and the equipment extension contains entities to provide additional metadata specific to the inventory of physical infrastructure and associated actions. The schema is implemented in a relational database system for storage and management with an associated web interface. We designed the web-based tools for technicians to enter and query information on the physical equipment and actions such as site visits, equipment deployments, maintenance, and calibrations. These tools were implemented for the iUTAH (innovative Urban Transitions and Aridregion Hydrosustainability) ecohydrologic observatory, and we anticipate that they will be useful for similar large-scale monitoring networks desiring to link observing infrastructure to observational data to increase the quality of sensor-based data products.",

Therefore, reconstructing deglacial changes in benthic δ13C can improve estimates of changes in deep ocean carbon storage and the global carbon cycle.\nOne metric of interest is the deglacial mean δ13C change of the ocean, which provides an estimate of changes in terrestrial biosphere carbon storage. Here we estimate the mean change in ocean δ13C in 1-kyr time steps across the deglaciation by averaging seven regional δ13C stacks weighted by volume. Our regional δ13C stacks are composed of 116 benthic δ13C records that span 20-6 ka on regional age models (Stern and Lisiecki, 2014). We calculate regional δ13C stacks for the intermediate North Atlantic (INA) (0.5-2 km), mid-depth North Atlantic (MNA) (2-4 km), deep North Atlantic (>4 km), intermediate South Atlantic (0.5-2.5 km), deep South Atlantic (DSA) (>2.5 km), intermediate Indo-Pacific (0.5-2 km), and deep Indo-Pacific (>2 km).\nWe also use these regional stacks to perform mixing experiments that simulate MNA δ13C responses to different mixtures of the INA and DSA endmembers. Simulated INA, DSA, and MNA δ13C records are then analyzed with principal component analysis to determine which mixing scenario best fits the MNA δ13C observations. We conclude that the δ13C data are most consistent with a millennial-scale reduction in percent North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) at 2-4 km in the North Atlantic during Heinrich Stadial 1.",

            "abstract": "Detrital zircons from Cretaceous mica schist, Eocene sandstone and Oligocene siltstone of the Western Alps fall into three main separable age clusters at 610-540 Ma, 490-430 Ma, and 340-280 Ma that correspond to the Cadomian, Caledonian (Ordovician) and Variscan (Carboniferous) events widespread in Western and Central Europe. Hf isotopic results indicate that these three magmatic and tectonic episodes did not give rise to significant production of juvenile crust. A small but distinguishable group of Triassic zircon, around 250-200 Ma which is considered to derive from the Southern Alps, has been detected in the Oligocene \"Schistes à Blocs\" formation and the Brianconnais flysch. In contrast, this age group is absent in Eocene sandstones. In agreement with sedimentological studies, our results show that the main source areas of the Eocene flysch were probably located in the European continent. The arrival of detritus from the Internal Zone occurred in Early Oligocene, coeval with the tectonic rotation from northwestward to westward in the propoagation of allochthonous units. Based on previous studies and our new data, the Penninic Frontal Thrust zone was likely a paleorelief during the Eocene that accounts for the lack of detritus from the Internal Zone. Contemporary sediments were accumulated in the foredeep of the Adriatic Plate. From Oligocene time onwards, the blockage was cut through after a regional uplifting, and thus the Internal Zone started to provide detritus into the western flexural basins.",

            "abstract": "Aeolian sand dunes swept across northern Alaska during the last glacial maximum. Today, summer temperatures are moderate and soils can remain waterlogged all summer long. How did the transition from a cold and dry glacial to a warm and wet interglacial take place? To answer this question we reconstructed temperature and precipitation changes during the last deglaciation using biomarker hydrogen isotopes from a new 28,000 year-long sediment core from Lake E5, located in the central Brooks Range of Alaska. We use terrestrial leaf waxes (dDterr, C28-acid), informed by dD measurements of modern vegetation, to infer dD of precipitation, an indicator of relative temperature change. Biomarkers from aquatic organisms (dDaq, C18-acid) are used as a proxy for lake water isotopes. The offset between the two (eterr-aq) is used to infer relative changes in evaporative enrichment of lake water, and by extension, moisture balance.\ndDterr during the last glacial period was -282‰ compared to -258‰ during the Holocene, suggesting a 5.6 ± 2.7 °C increase in summer temperature using the modern local temperature-dD relationship. Gradual warming began at ~18.5 ka, and temperature increased abruptly at 11.5 ka, at the end of the Younger Dryas. Warming peaked in the early Holocene from 11.5 to 9.1 ka, indicating a Holocene thermal maximum associated with peak summer insolation.\nThe eterr-aq supports a dry LGM and moist Holocene. Other sediment proxies (TIC, TOC, redox-sensitive elements) support the eterr-aq, and reveal a shift to more positive P-E beginning around 17 ka, suggesting rising temperature led increases in precipitation during the last deglaciation. Moreover, differing patterns of dDterr and eterr-aq during the deglaciation suggest that the relationship between temperature and precipitation changed through time. Such decoupling, likely due to regional atmospheric reorganization as the Laurentide ice sheet waned, illustrates the importance of atmospheric dynamics in controlling Alaskan climate.",

The occurrence of abnormal weather in major crop production areas leads to soaring world grain prices because it influence the reduction of crop yield. Development of crop yield estimation method is important means to accommodate the global food crisis caused by abnormal weather. However, due to problems with the reliability of the seasonal climate prediction, application research on agricultural productivity has not been much progress yet. In this study, it is an object to develop long-term crop yield estimation method in major crop production countries worldwide using multi seasonal climate prediction data collected by APEC Climate Center. There are 6-month lead seasonal predictions produced by six state-of-the-art global coupled ocean-atmosphere models(MSC_CANCM3, MSC_CANCM4, NASA, NCEP, PNU, POAMA). First of all, we produce a customized climate data through temporal and spatial downscaling methods for use as a climatic input data to the global scale crop model. Next, we evaluate the uncertainty of climate prediction by applying multi seasonal climate prediction in the crop model. Because rice is the most important staple food crop in the Asia-Pacific region, we assess the reliability of the rice yields using seasonal climate prediction for main rice production countries. RMSE(Root Mean Squire Error) and TCC(Temporal Correlation Coefficient) analysis is performed in Asia-Pacific countries, major 14 rice production countries, to evaluate the reliability of the rice yield according to the climate prediction models. We compare the rice yield data obtained from FAOSTAT and estimated using the seasonal climate prediction data in Asia-Pacific countries. In addition, we show that the reliability of seasonal climate prediction according to the climate models in Asia-Pacific countries where rice cultivation is being carried out.",

            "abstract": "Due to discrepancies on the USGS topographic maps made in the late 1950s, the height of the tallest peaks in the US Arctic has remained uncertain -- until now. The five tallest peaks here are located within 40 km of each other in the eastern Brooks Range of Alaska within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The 1:250,000 scale map lists Mt Isto as tallest at 9050’, but the 1:63,360 scale map lists it at 8975’. These values bracket the elevation of Mt Chamberlin, which is listed as 9020’ on both maps, creating the primary uncertainty. We used fodar™, an airborne photogrammetric method utilizing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms, to measure the heights of these peaks and validated these measurements using survey-grade GPS and airborne lidar. The GPS and fodar measurements of Mt Isto and Mt Chamberlin agree to within centimeters, and show that both mountains are under 9000’ and that one of them is actually the third tallest. We have mapped each of the five peaks between 4 and 6 times over the past 7 years using either lidar or fodar, with a final measurement uncertainty of less than +/- 30 cm, noting a gradual loss of elevation over time on most of them, caused by ablation of glacier-capped and snow-corniced peaks. When the USGS maps were made, it is therefore conceivable that one or more of these mountains were over 9000’ but have since lowered due to ice loss. Analysis of the SfM data shows that all five peaks likely have less than 10 meters of ice remaining on them and, at current loss rates, rock may be exposed on some of them within the next 10 years. The difference in height between the 4th and 5th tallest peaks varied temporally between 1 and 3 m, suggesting that their order may yet change before rock is exposed there. The measured heights of these five peaks will be revealed in the presentation. Based on the correspondence between and within data sets, we also conclude that our SfM photogrammetry is as accurate and more precise than our lidar in the measurement of these mountains and offers many other advantages. In particular, the photogrammetric hardware is 10x less expensive than lidar of similar capability, and unlike lidar the SfM measurements also create a perfectly co-registered orthoimage which is useful in interpretation of topographic change.\nFigure. 3D visualization of Mt Isto fodar data with GPS validation data overlain.",

It is essential to storm surge forecasting system as the semidiurnal surge could significantly affect the timing and height of the peak storm surge.\nThe presentation exposes the a real case study during the first week of October in 2005, which reals a consistent semidiurnal surge event induced by the passage of cold frond on the SAB, follow with a landfall event of Tropical Storm Tammy in the north of the Florida. It is found that the semidiurnal surge happened with a phase delay and tidal amplitude reduction of the observed tide at the apex of the SAB, as well as highly associated with parallel-to-shore wind stress. Coriolis acceleration, in the momentum equation of the primary tidal direction (normal-to-shore) on the SAB, is suspected to be one of the fundamental mechanisms contributing to the orientation of the semidiurnal surge. The relevance of the Coriolis force to this phenomenon enhanced with the increase of the parallel-to-shore wind stress. Meanwhile, sea bottom friction, which reinforced by the wind-induced oceanic current, retarded and dampened the tides, thus resulted in the semidiurnal tidal signal in the surge. Geophysical factors, including tidal amplitude, coastline shape and storm parameters, all influence the severity of the semidiurnal surges on the SAB, and their effects were explored via idealized numerical experiments.",

            "abstract": "Whereas the plasma circulation in the ionosphere is driven by convective drift which is the same for ions and electrons, the magnetospheric plasma circulation includes curvature and gradient drifts, which are charge-dependent. There is even a region of the Neutral Sheet in which the ions, but not the electrons, are “unmagnetized” and where charge separation can occur even for convective drift, which the electrons execute but the ions do not. Due to the charge separations in the magnetosphere, field-aligned currents are generated. The FACs and the associated electric fields play an important role in producing the convection pattern in the ionosphere. Here we argue that there are two pairs of FACs near substorm onset. One pair involves the auroral zone portion of the convection. There, a downward D FAC occurs in the poleward part of the auroral zone and an upward U FAC occurs in the equatorward part. We show that the D-U auroral FAC pair results from the odd situation in the INSh, where the electrons can convect earthward while the unmagnetized ions do not and so remain further tailward of the electrons. The equatorward edge of the auroral zone is marked by a convection reversal, because the auroral zone flows have an eastward velocity component, whereas subauroral flows have a westward component. At the convection reversal, the flow is strictly southward and the electric field strictly westward. The subauroral zone maps out to the outer radiation belt, where the high-energy electrons precipitate tailward of the energetic electron trapping boundary,and high-energy ions precipitate tailward of the energetic ion trapping boundary, the latter being earthward of the former. As a result, another FAC pair forms on field lines in the ORB/subauroral regions. The U FAC of the latter region is adjacent but earthward of the U FAC of the auroral zone pair. The D-U auroral zone pair is poleward of the U-D subauroral (Radiation Belt) pair. Finally, we note that the electric field lines in the convection pattern have a strong vorticity near the convection reversal. By Faraday’s Law of Induction there is a decrease in magnetic flux density on the poleward side of the convection reversal, and an increase on the equatorward side. We address this issue for two different time intervals, namely the late growth phase and then the substorm onset.",

            "abstract": "Extratropical baroclinic disturbances, or cyclones, are an important component of the atmospheric general circulation and effectively determine winter hydroclimate variability in regions such as western U.S. and western Europe. Interactions between environmental aerosols and cyclones are often observed over East Asia and western North Pacific. In this study, the SP-CAM (Super-parameterized Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 of CAM) is used to examine the aerosol direct and indirect effects on the development of an extratropical cyclone. Specifically, ensemble simulations with SP-CAM are conducted by increasing aerosol concentrations at slightly different times during the initial growth of a cyclone sampled from a 3-month winter control experiment made also with the SP-CAM. In the polluted environment, the cyclone becomes weaker in association with anomalous heating below the mid-tropospheric trough and anomalous cooling below the ridge. Further investigation indicates that the heating anomaly below the trough is mainly contributed by the weakening of cold advection behind the surface cold front while the cooling anomaly underneath the ridge is mainly caused by suppressed condensational heating in the stratiform clouds ahead of the surface warm front. Radiative heating anomalies associated with aerosol increase are generally weak but have an overall positive contribution to the weakening of the cyclone. Of particular interest is the strengthening of convection ahead of the surface cold front that happens at the same time when the cyclone itself weakens. This behavior suggests fundamental differences in the response to environmental aerosol change between a tropical and an extratropical cyclone with diabatic heating effects of aerosols playing only a secondary role in the development of the latter.",

Without radiative and surface feedbacks, convective organization is dominated by convectively coupled gravity waves without planetary rotation and convectively coupled equatorial waves when there is planetary rotation. This behavior is well captured when the cloud resolving model (CRM) in SPCAM is replaced by its linear response function, computed following Kuang (2010), for the state of radiative convective equilibrium (RCE). With radiative feedback, however, convection self-aggregates, and with planetary rotation, the tropical zonal wavenumber-frequency spectrum features a red noise background. These behaviors in the presence of the radiative feedback are not captured when the CRM is replaced by its linear response function around the RCE state with radiative feedback included in the construction.

            "abstract": "The Permian-Triassic transition witnessed the largest biotic turnover of Earth life during the Phanerozoic history. Ecosystems in sea and on land have also experienced the most protected restoration following the end-Permian mass extinction. These biocrises were also associated with climatic and environmental extremes through the latest Permian to Middle Triassic. In order to uncover the links among these extreme events, we need to establish high-resolution biochronostratigraphy, which offers precise timescales for reconstructing event sequences and probing the possible causes. Of these, conodont biostratigraphy is an operational tool in enhancing stratigraphic resolution. Although their ancestors and phylogeny remain unclear, conodonts are a rapid evolutionary lineage and extremely abundant in the Triassic marine carbonate successions. Here, we present recent study results of the Lower Triassic conodont zonation from the Ganxi and Jianshi areas, western Hubei Province, South China, which were situated on a carbonate ramp at the southern northern margin of the Upper Yangtze Platform. Therein, the uppermost Permian to Lower Triassic successions are well exposed and yield abundant conodonts. A total of nine conodont zones was established: (1) Clarkina yini-Clarkina zhangi Zone, (2) Hindeodus changxingensis Zone, (3) Hindeodus parvus Zone, (4) Isarcicella staeschei Zone, (5) Clarkina planata Zone, (6) Neoclarkina discrete Zone, (7) Neospathodus dieneri Zone, (8) Novispathodus waageni Zone, and (9) Triassospathodus homeri Zone. The Ns. dieneri M1, Ns. dieneri M2 and Ns. dieneri M3 subzones have also been distinguished from the Ns. dieneri Zone. Both Nv. waageni eowaageni subzones and Nv. waageni waageni subzones are also recognizable from the Nv. waageni Zone. The first occurrence of H. parvus marks the Permian-Triassic boundary(PTB), while the first occurrence of Nv. waageni eowaageni defines the Induan–Olenekian boundary. These conodont zones correlate well with those recognized from elsewhere in South China and over the world.",

            "abstract": "The term “beef” refers to fibrous minerals in bedding-parallel veins, where the fibers are approximately perpendicular to the vein margins (Cobbold et al., 2013). It mostly appears within organic-rich black shale layers in sedimentary basin. Although the veins can consist of white gangue minerals, such as calcite, gypsum, or quartz, the commonest mineral in the fibers is calcite. According to the worldwide localities of calcite beef compiled by Cobbold et al (2012), they concentrated in some areas, especially around the Atlantic Ocean. However, they have been rarely reported in the western Pacific margin, except Australia and New Zealand. Recently, calcite beefs have been found in the Cretaceous Jinju Formation, Gyeongsang Basin, Korea. As far as we know, this is the first report of calcite beef in Korea. The lacustrine Jinju Formation is about 1,200 m thick, and made up mainly of lacustrine dark grey to black mudstones. In the study area, calcite beefs were commonly found in the organic-rich black shale layers. The vein thickness is anywhere between a few millimeters to maximum 3 centimeters, and their length ranges from a few centimeters to several tens of meters. The interval between successive veins is from a few centimeters to about 1 meter. Most of them occur parallel to the bedding planes, although some of them are developed along fault planes or within deformed layers. In case of relatively thick beefs, the center of veins often shows a dark grey to black central median line, defined by fine-grained calcite grains, fluid inclusion lines, or wall rock particles. Based on the orientation of fibrous calcite, they can be divided into two types: straight and sigmoidal types. The fibrous calcites are thought to have been symmetrically grown from the median lines to top and bottom of wall rock. The formation mechanism of horizontal fractures, and the formation temperature of beefs in the study area remain as a matter to be studied further.",

            "abstract": "Understanding stress state in the oceanic lithosphere is one of important clues to reveal dynamics of plate tectonics. Previous studies revealed that “thermal stress” and “ridge-push” have an important role to cause differential stress in the oceanic lithosphere, based on focal mechanism of oceanic intraplate earthquakes and their modeling [e.g. Bratt et al., 1985; Wiens and Stein, 1984]. Recently, various new data and experimental results have become available and these enable us to make more precise modeling and detailed discussion. Therefore, we revisit stress evolution of the oceanic lithosphere to reveal detail of it.\n We make a model of stress evolution in the oceanic lithosphere from oceanic ridge to before subduction, using time integration of stress history in the Lagrangian description. Our model considers thermal stress, ridge-push, and basal resistance as the mechanical sources; and brittle fracture and ductile flow as stress relaxation mechanism.\n Our result shows that focal mechanisms of oceanic intraplate earthquakes basically can be interpreted as a result of the thermal stress effects. Predicted seismic moment release rate (SMR) from our model is almost consistent with observed SMR in the young oceanic lithosphere (<45My). On the other hand, in the old oceanic lithosphere (>45Myr), observed SMR is only ~10% of our model prediction. In the old oceanic lithosphere (>45Myr), our results also indicate that thermal strain rate is less than 10^(-10)/year, and seismic moment release should occur in the upper part (~10 km) of oceanic lithosphere (where <300℃). Thus we propose that very slow (~10^(-10)/year) stress relaxation mechanism may work in the oceanic lithosphere even low temperature condition (<300℃). Dissolution-precipitation creep is candidate mechanism, however, its strain rate under geological condition has not been investigated yet. Our results may constrain on mechanism of very slow stress accumulation and relaxation under low temperature condition.",

The constraints frequently encountered are cost, reliability of the estimated parameters, and time and duration of the experiments. In groundwater modeling, if one assumes that observations are taken from the beginning of the pumping test to the end, the experimental design problem is simplified to the determination of observation locations. The commonly used design criteria are: A-optimality – a design that minimizes the trace of the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters; D-optimality – a design that minimizes the determinant of the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters; E-optimality – a design that minimizes the maximal eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters; and G-optimality – a design that minimizes the maximal variance of the estimated response, where the maximum is taken over all possible predictor variables.\nWe examine the A, D, E, and G - efficiencies of various observation well network designs for determining unknown hydrologic properties in a confined, anisotropic groundwater aquifer. Since solving for the optimal observation well network design is non-convex and contains integer variables, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are used to search for optimal designs for the various optimality criterions. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is used to reduce the computational burden of the repeated model calls necessitated by using a GA. The robustness with respect to other optimality criterion of the optimal designs is also investigated.",

The causes and spatial patterns of these motions are difficult to determine because diffuse GPS station spacing. In southern California, a dense GPS network, large seasonal motions, and seasonally variable precipitation make the region ideal for characterizing both seasonal and anthropogenic motions. In this study, we utilize data from 57 permanent GPS sites in the Plate Boundary Observatory network. In order to quantify periodic seasonal motions, we perform a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on detrended GPS time series to calculate the phases and amplitudes of the annual harmonics. To compare ground motions to precipitation patterns, we also perform a DFT on monthly NOAA precipitation data, which allows us to calculate phase differences between the rainfall and GPS recorded motions. Phase calculations show that sites overlying the Santa Ana aquifer and sites not overlying the aquifer have phase differences of 45 and 180 days suggesting that many sites respond quickly to seasonal rainfall patterns. We find that ground movement above the Santa Ana aquifer has significantly different characteristics than the surrounding ground movement suggesting an anthropogenic source. Furthermore, existing InSAR data shows significant localized motions, which have been proposed to be anthropogenic. This suggests that anomalous annual phases and/or amplitudes in GPS time series may help to identify stations that are recording significant anthropogenic motions without the need for other data. To remove these hydrologic motions from the secular velocity estimates, we use inverse dislocation models that simulate aquifer compaction. These models are then used to effectively “correct” the GPS velocities to yield more accurate tectonic estimates of motion.",

To enhance lessons on mid-ocean ridges and ocean basin genesis, we have created movies of seafloor bathymetry for a large-enrollment undergraduate-level class, Introduction to Oceanography. In the past four quarters, students have enjoyed watching 3D movies, and in the fall quarter (2015), we will assess how well 3D movies enhance learning. The class will be split into two groups, one who learns about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from diagrams and lecture, and the other who learns with a supplemental 3D visualization. Both groups will be asked “what does the seafloor look like?” before and after the Mid-Atlantic Ridge lesson. Then the whole class will watch the 3D movie and respond to an additional question, “did the 3D visualization enhance your understanding of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge?” with the opportunity to further elaborate on the effectiveness of the visualization.",

            "abstract": "The various episodic deglacial megafloods of the Quaternary transported continental sediments into the marine domain. The terrestrial sediments exited the continents as hyperpycnal flows and were deposited on the ocean floor as turbidity currents. Previous investigations of pomegaflood-derived turbidites used sedimentologic and seismic methods. The studies entailed the discernment of megaflood-turbidites from those of other causes by delineating their submarine locations, lithology and radiometric ages, and by inferring sequences from seismic reflection profiles. Such scrupulous work, however, was limited in spatial extent because the analyses pertained only to a few sequence profiles from the Missoula-flood turbidites.\nWe have extended the effort by demonstrating the efficacy of gamma-ray profiles as proxies for detecting the megaflood-derived turbidites, which also greatly augment the spatial extent and allows for various megaflood-turbidite surveys. Typically, gamma-ray deflection patterns consistently reveal thick terrestrial sandy beds capping older marine shalely beds, which are laterally traceable to lithologic sequences analyzed in previous studies. The thicknesses of the sandy caps depend on their proximity to main submarine channels. A number of gamma-ray profiles situated at or near submarine channels suggest that the flows were confined whereas a minority of them had even carved their own channels (e.g., in the English Channel), as consistently inferred from the literature. Despite the numerous jolkulhlaups generated, less sediment originated from Greenland and Iceland as a result of their less erodible landmasses. Also predictably, gamma-ray profiles from continental shelves (e.g., the New Jersey shelf) lack such megaflood turbidites as they had been subaerial during the Quaternary glacial times. Thus, utilization of gamma-ray logs allows the detection of megaflood turbidite sequences in a more accessible and affordable manner than did the sedimentologic-seismic methods. Further, our research widens the spatial scope, thereby enabling surveys of megaflood turbidites globally as the spatial extent is limited only by the availability of gamma-ray profiles from various ocean drilling programs.",

An environmental chamber at the UC-Riverside Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) Atmospheric Processes Lab measured the properties of aerosols emitted from the burning of coniferous forest litter. Forest litter was collected from two sites of the San Bernardino Mountains Gradient Study in southern California: one site with high chronic nitrogen deposition rate and a site with low nitrogen deposition rate. The chemical and physical properties of the gas and aerosol-phase emissions were measured as a function of photochemical aging. Results indicate that there is a discernable compositional difference in the emissions from forest litter from an unpolluted (low NOx) environment as compared to a polluted (high NOx) environment. Fuel elemental analysis, NOx emission rates, aerosol volatility, and aerosol particle number distributions all differed significantly between the two sites.",

            "abstract": "WRF-Chem model is used to investigate the seasonal and inter-annual variations of mineral dust over East Asia during 2007-2011, with a focus on the dust mass balance and its direct radiative forcing and climatic impact. A variety of in-situ measurements and satellite observations have been used to evaluate the simulation results. Generally, WRF-Chem reasonably reproduces not only the column variability but also the vertical profile and size distribution of mineral dust over and near the dust source regions. In addition, the dust lifecycle and processes that control the seasonal and spatial variations of dust mass balance are investigated in seven sub-regions. Dust direct radiative forcing in a surface cooling of up to -14 and -10 W m-2, atmospheric warming of up to 9 and 2 W m-2, and TOA cooling of -5 and -8 W m-2, respectively. The ability of WRF-Chem to capture the measured features of dust optical and radiative properties and dust mass balance over East Asian provides confidence for future investigation of East Asia dust impact on regional or global climate. Over the Tibetan Plateau, dust modifies the atmospheric heating profiles and cloud properties, leading to a decrease of snowfall and hence snow coverage on the ground. These results are from a reduction of surface albedo and increased surface temperature, further accelerating snowmelt. This impact is smallest in summer, when the snow coverage is relative low. Over the East China-Korea-Japan regions, dust modifies the atmospheric heating profiles and cloud properties. Dust induces significant changes in the magnitudes and diurnal variations of surface temperature. Cloud liquid water content is also significantly impacted, as reflected in changes of cloud forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) with a maximum in summer. The dust impacts on spatial distribution of precipitation and wind circulation are also investigated, showing distinct seasonality of dust impact on the regional climate over East Asia.",

            "abstract": "We examined the equation of state and high-pressure elasticity of the hydrous aluminosilicate mineral topaz-OH (Al2SiO4(OH)2) using first principles simulation. Topaz-OH is a hydrous phase in the Al2O3-SiO2-H2O (ASH) ternary system, which is relevant for the mineral phase relations in the hydrated sedimentary layer of subducting slabs. Based on recent experiments, it is known that the protons in the topaz-OH exhibit positional disorder with half occupancy over two distinct crystallographic sites. In order to adequately depict the proton environment in the topaz-OH, we examined five crystal structure models with distinct configuration for the protons. Upon full geometry optimization, we find that there are two distinct crystal structures for the topaz-OH. The first crystal structure has an orthorhombic Pbnm space group symmetry, and the second crystal structure has a monoclinic P21/c space group symmetry. At static conditions, the monoclinic (P21/c) topaz-OH has lower energy compared to the orthorhombic (Pbnm) topaz-OH. The energy of the monoclinic (P21/c) topaz-OH remains stable at least up to 40 GPa, i.e., pressures beyond the thermodynamic stability of the topaz-OH. Based on the results from first principles simulation, the equation of state for the monoclinic topaz-OH is well represented by a third-order Birch-Murnaghan formulation, with V0 = 348.63 (±0.04) Å3, K0 = 164.7 (±0.04) GPa, and K'0 = 4.24 (±0.05). The equation of state for the orthorhombic topaz-OH is well represented by a third-order Birch-Murnaghan formulation, with V0 = 352.47 (±0.04) Å3, K0 = 166.4 (±0.06) GPa, and K'0 = 4.03 (±0.04). While the bulk modulus is very similar for both the monoclinic and orthorhombic topaz-OH, the shear elastic moduli are very sensitive to the position of the proton and the orientation of the hydroxyl (O-H) groups.\nIn the hydrated sedimentary layer of a subducting slab, transformation of a mineral assemblage consisting of coesite (SiO2) and diaspore (AlOOH) to topaz-OH (Al2SiO4(OH)2) is likely to be accompanied by an increase in the density, compressional velocity, and shear wave velocity. To gain better insight into the transport of water via subduction of sediments, further constraints on the elasticity at high pressures and temperatures are required.",

The research project is aimed at quantifying the strength and geometry of the Precambrian geomagnetic field. Investigation of the geomagnetic field behavior is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of field generation, and the development of the Earth’s atmosphere and biosphere, and can serve as a focus for connecting high-level Earth science research with a standard physics curriculum. High school science teachers have participated in each summer field and research component of the project, gaining field and laboratory research experience, sets of rock and mineral samples, and classroom-tested laboratory magnetism activities for secondary school physics and earth science courses. We report on three field seasons of teacher field experiences and two years of classroom testing of paleomagnetic research materials merged into physics instruction on magnetism. Students were surveyed before and after dedicated instruction for both perceptions and attitude towards earth science in general, then more specifically on earth history and earth magnetism. Students were also surveyed before and after instruction on major earth system and magnetic concepts and processes, particularly as they relate to paleomagnetic research. Most students surveyed had a strongly positive viewpoint towards the study of Earth history and the importance of studying Earth Sciences in general, but were significantly less drawn towards more specific topics such as mineralogy and magnetism. Students demonstrated understanding of Earth model and the basics of magnetism, as well as the general timing of life, atmospheric development, and magnetic field development. However, detailed knowledge such as the magnetic dynamo, how the magnetic field has changed over time, and connections between earth magnetism and the development of an atmosphere remained largely misunderstood even after specific instruction, laboratory activities, and research examples. Ongoing work is examining the effectiveness of specific classroom and laboratory activities on student perceptions and misconceptions - which models work best to develop deeper understanding and appreciation of paleomagnetic research.",

The crescent shape of thrust wedge, the mountains in Taiwan, and the different strike angles of this wedges in north and southeastern Taiwan reveal complex tectonic evolution as well as collision and subduction mechanisms. Previous studies have shown that the PS slab has subducted under the ES plate along the Ryukyu trench in the north area of Taiwan. But in the south, the ES plate is subducted under the PS slab. Little work has been done in the region of Taiwan Strait especially the pattern of crustal and upper mantle anisotropy. The dynamic process in this region has been a controversy for a long time. In this study we use about 50 broadband stations (2008) located in Fujian province of mainland China and Taiwan to invert for 3-D shear velocity structure and azimuthal anisotropy in the crust and uppermost mantle in this region from ambient noise tomography in the period band of 5-40 s. The lateral resolution of the 3-D model is about 100 km. Our results reveal a high crustal S-velocity anomaly in the strait and a rotational pattern of crustal azimuthal anisotropy around the strait with SE-NW fast direction in the center of the strait. The fast polarization axes are mainly along NE-SW direction in the central Fujian. The preliminary results are important for understanding the mechanisms of material flow and crustal deformation in the margin of ES plate.",

            "abstract": "Sakai et al. (2014, 10th ASC) estimated the source amplitudes in a long-period band of 50 – 100 s using broadband seismic records of earthquakes that occurred in the Philippine and Indonesia, and showed that the source amplitudes fell within a constant band against the moment magnitudes (Mw). Long-period waveforms are thought to be less influenced by structural heterogeneities, and the radiation pattern in a long-period band may not be distorted. However, the results of Sakai et al. (2014) suggest that the nodes are not clearly observed in the long-period band. In this study, we analyzed seismic data from the Japan broadband seismograph network (F-net), which is denser than the networks in the Philippine and Indonesia, and carried out numerical tests using synthetic waveforms to investigate the characteristics of long-period wavefields. We used earthquakes that occurred in Japan with Mw between 4 and 8 since 2003, and estimated their source amplitudes in a long-period band of 50 – 100 s using waveform data from F-net. In each event, we calculated the ratios of the minimum source amplitude to other source amplitudes. We found that the ratios for most of events had values ranging up to roughly 10 regardless of their moment magnitudes and the nodes were also not clearly observed in the F-net data. Using the discrete wavenumber method, we calculated synthetic seismograms assuming uniform station distributions with horizontal intervals of 50 and 100 km as well as the Philippine and F-net station distributions. We assumed an earthquake located in the center of the distributed stations, and systematically changed the dip, strike, and rake angels. We estimated the source amplitudes in the long-period band from the seismograms synthesized with these different fault angles. Our numerical tests indicated that the ratios of the source amplitudes become larger as the density of stations is higher and the ratios depend on the mechanisms. These estimated ratios were larger than the observed ratios. Our numerical results did not reproduce the observed features of the radiation patterns in the long-period band. Our study implies that the radiation pattern may be distorted by structural inhomogeneity and/or source complexity in the long-period band.",

            "abstract": "In the arid area, such as the Heihe watershed in Northwest China, agriculture is heavily dependent on the irrigation. Irrigation suggests human-induced hydro process, which modifies the local climate and water budget. In this study, we simulated the irrigation-induced changes in surface energy/moisture budgets and modifications on regional climate, using the WRF-NoahMP modle with an irrigation scheme. The irrigation scheme was implemented following the roles that soil moisture is assigned a saturated value once the mean soil moisture of all root layers is lower than 70% of fileld capacity. Across the growth season refering from May to September, the simulated mean irrigation amount of the 1181 cropland gridcells is ~900 mm, wihch is close to the field measurments of around 1000 mm. Such an irrigation largely modified the surface energy budget. Due to irrigation, the surface net solar radiation increased by ~76.7 MJ (~11 Wm-2) accouting for ~2.3%, surface latent and senbile heat flux increased by 97.7 Wm-2 and decreased by ~79.7 Wm-2 respectively; and local daily mean surface air temperature was thereby cooling by ~1.1°C. Corresponding to the surface energy changes, wind and circulation were also modified and regional water budget is therefore regulated. The total rainfall in the irrigation area increased due to more moisture from surface. However, the increased rainfall is only ~6.5mm (accounting for ~5% of background rainfall) which is much less than the increased evaporation of ~521.5mm from surface. The ~515mm of water accounting for 57% of total irrigation was transported outward by wind. The other ~385 mm accounting for 43% of total irrigation was transformed to be runoff and soil water. These results suggest that in the Heihe watershed irrigation largely modify local energy budget and cooling surface. This study also implicate that the existing irrigation may waste a large number of water. It is thereby valuable to develope effective irrigation scheme to save water resources.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the interactions of environmental and social dynamics in Central Balkans over the past millennium, a period that experienced three major climatic phases (Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age, and the warm 20th century). Meanwhile, the same period witnessed a complex human history with the emergence-rise-decline of the Ottoman Empire and subsequent socio-political events (e.g. wars, famines, migrations). Environmental datasets for the analysis include biological proxies (pollen, spores, and charcoal), geochemical signals through X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and a detailed chronology based on AMS 14C dating of two western and central Serbian lakes while social datasets include historic population data, land use, settlement patterns, and critical historic events derived from a review of the literature and local archives. Among the environmental datasets, indigenous tree and herbaceous pollen from these Central Balkans records demonstrate fluctuations in woodland-grassland dynamics whereas potassium and titanium counts obtained through XRF act as a proxy for surface erosion and clastic input into the lakes. Microscopic charcoal, cereal pollen and subordinate anthropogenic pollen (e.g. cultivated fruits and vegetables) are used to distinguish strong human impact over the landscape. These key anthropogenic indicators create a more thorough social component of the analysis in association with the social datasets. After reconstructing the individual time series for each environmental and social dataset, the two Central Balkan records are correlated in order to identify the environmental and social homogeneity and heterogeneity patterns occurring at shorter and longer timescales during the period. Results provide insights on how a region responds to social and environmental stressors and our approach demonstrates ways to integrate natural and social science system research.",

            "abstract": "The western Solomon Islands are a remarkable natural laboratory to investigate processes occurring on the shallowest (<10 km depth) portions of the subduction interface. Islands within the New Georgia Group are located <15 km from the San Cristobal Trench, with the subduction thrust located only a few km beneath the southwest coast of islands like Rannonga and Rendova. This offers a globally unique opportunity to use GPS and other land-based methods to monitor deformation processes very close to the trench at a subduction zone. We present results from a campaign GPS network in the western Solomons that has been operated from 1996-present. The data from 1996-2002 indicate interseismic coupling on the shallow portion of the interface, at a rate of nearly 100% of the relative plate motion. Coupling does not appear to extend deeper than ~20 km depth, and the relatively shallow down-dip limit of coupling is consistent with subduction of young (<6 Ma) oceanic crust of the Woodlark Basin. We also show evidence for a slow slip event in late 2000, observed at a GPS site near Gizo that was running continuously from 1999-2002. In April 2007, an Mw 8.1 earthquake occurred on the subduction thrust beneath the network, resulting in large coseismic displacements at nearby campaign GPS sites. The earthquake caused widespread coastal uplift and subsidence in the region, as revealed by studies of coral microatolls following the earthquake (Taylor et al., 2008). We invert displacements of the GPS sites jointly with vertical displacements of coral microatolls to evaluate the coseismic slip during the earthquake. The area of the interface that underwent slip in the earthquake matches well with the region that was interseismically coupled just prior to the 2007 earthquake. The data also require large coseismic slip on the shallow interface near the trench, which likely contributed to the generation of a large, damaging tsunami following the earthquake. We also show results from a recent re-measurement (April 2015) of the network to infer the distribution of crustal deformation during the 8 years following the 2007 earthquake.",

            "abstract": "In the past ten years Acre State, located in Brazil´s southwestern Amazonia, has confronted sequential and severe extreme events in the form of droughts and floods. In particular, the droughts and forest fires of 2005 and 2010, the 2012 flood within Acre, the 2014 flood of the Madeira River which isolated Acre for two months from southern Brazil, and the most severe flooding throughout the state in 2015 shook the resilience of Acrean society. The accumulated costs of these events since 2005 have exceeded 300 million dollars. For the last 17 years, successive state administrations have been implementing a socio-environmental model of development that strives to link sustainable economic production with environmental conservation, particularly for small communities. In this context, extreme climate events have interfered significantly with this model, increasing the risks of failure. The impacts caused by these events on development in the state have been exacerbated by: a) limitations in monitoring; b) extreme events outside of Acre territory (Madeira River Flood) affecting transportation systems; c) absence of reliable information for decision-making; and d) bureaucratic and judicial impediments. Our experience in these events have led to the following needs for scientific input to reduce the risk of disasters: 1) better monitoring and forecasting of deforestation, fires, and hydro-meteorological variables; 2) ways to increase risk perception in communities; 3) approaches to involve more effectively local and regional populations in the response to disasters; 4) more accurate measurements of the economic and social damages caused by these disasters. We must improve adaptation to and mitigation of current and future extreme climate events and implement a robust civil defense, adequate to these new challenges.",

            "abstract": "There are multiple scales on which the local physics of collisionless magnetic reconnection operate. These include the ion scale and electron scales defined by the associated inertial lengths. In Earth’s magnetosphere, even the ion scale is inaccessible to even very large-scale numerical simulations, as it is just a tiny fraction of the total system size. Therefore we primarily rely on resistive MHD simulations when studying Earth’s magnetosphere. In contrast, Ganymede’s magnetosphere is much smaller, and the ion inertial length is much larger compared to the system’s size. The relatively large scales make it possible to model Ganymede’s magnetosphere with more sophisticated approaches while adequately resolving the relevant physical scales. Ganymede is therefore an ideal laboratory for studying both the multiple scales involved in collisionless reconnection as well as the consequences for the global magnetosphere; it is a real magnetosphere with available in situ data that is also accessible to multiple modeling approaches. We present recent Hall MHD simulations with the BATSRUS code, and comparisons to Galileo observations, of this small magnetosphere and demonstrate the global importance of ion scale effects. We further extract magnetic separators and compare the results with resistive MHD, Hybrid and PIC results. As with the GEM reconnection challenge, we find that including ion scale physics is the minimum extension of MHD to capture most basic features of the magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Despite several decades of research there currently exists no mechanistic theory to predict colloid attachment in porous media under environmental conditions where colloid-collector repulsion exists (unfavorable conditions for attachment). It has long been inferred that nano- to micro-scale surface heterogeneity (herein called discrete heterogeneity) drives colloid attachment under unfavorable conditions. Incorporating discrete heterogeneity into colloid-collector interaction calculations in particle trajectory simulations predicts colloid attachment under unfavorable conditions. As yet, discrete heterogeneity cannot be independently measured by spectroscopic or other approaches in ways directly relevant to colloid-surface interaction. This, combined with the fact that a given discrete heterogeneity representation will interact differently with different-sized colloids as well as different ionic strengths for a given sized colloid, suggests a strategy to back out representative discrete heterogeneity by comparison of simulations to experiments performed across a range of colloid size, solution IS, and fluid velocity. This has recently been performed for interaction of carboxylate modified polystyrene latex (CML) microsphere attachment to soda lime glass at pH 6.7 with NaCl electrolyte. However, extension to other surfaces, pH values, and electrolytes is needed. For this reason, attachment of CML (0.25, 1.1 and 2.0 µm diameters) from aqueous suspension onto a variety of unfavorable mineral surfaces (soda lime glass, muscovite and albite) was examined for multiple pH values 6.7 & 8.0), fluid velocities (1.71 × 10−3 and 5.94 ×10−3 ms−1), IS (6.0 & 20 mM), and electrolytes (NaCl, CaSO4, & multivalent mixtures). The resulting representative heterogeneities (heterodomain size and surface coverage, where heterodomain refers to nano- to micro-scale attractive domains) yielded colloid attachment predictions that were compared to predictions from existing applicable semi-empirical expressions in order to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the discrete heterogeneity approach and opportunities for improvement.",

While such tailored approaches can provide significant skill in specific water\nforecasting applications, the lack of a more coordinated general approach can result in inconsistency between various forecast products and can inhibit transfer of information, methodologies between forecast systems. With the aim of improving the timeliness, consistency and spatial fidelity hydrologic prediction products, the U.S. National Weather Service has initiated an effort to provide street-level, water prediction services for the nation. This effort seeks to incorporate advances in hydrometeorological observing capabilities, new hydrologic data assimilation methodologies, improvements in hydrographic and geospatial information and advances in the ulitizion of high performance computers for process-based hydrologic modeling. This talk will summarize the proposed Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for national water prediction using the community WRF-Hydro modeling system, scheduled for operational execution during late spring of 2016. Four different configurations of the WRF-Hydro system are planned including an Analysis and Data Assimilation configuration, Short Range (0-2 day) and Medium Range (0-10 day) deterministic configurations and a Long Range (0-30 day) enesmble configuration. Streamflow analyses and forecasts from each model configurations will be produced on 2.7 million river reaches of the NHDPlusv2 hydrographic dataset. This presentation summarizes results from a number of different model development and benchmarking activities conducted as part of the IOC effort. Results from prototype real-time forecasting activities conducted during the 2015 National Flood Interoperability Experiment (NFIE) will be presented as will retrospective prediction experiment results from each of the IOC WRF-Hydro configurations. Emphasis will be placed on describing the expected model performance across the nation and in identifyng critical sources of error and prediction uncertainty as a means for prioritizing future research and development efforts.",

            "abstract": "ChemCam on Curiosity has used LIBS to obtain elemental compositions of >6000 target points at distances to 7.4 m from the rover. Observations include igneous clasts, sediments, diagenetic features, and other details often not accessible by the rover arm. A major re-calibration was recently completed using >350 standards. This significantly improved the accuracies of mineral end-members including plag-feldspars, hi-Si compositions, oxide grains, Mg-rich end-members (presumably Mg saponites; not yet confirmed by CheMin), and Mg and Ca sulfates. Here we draw conclusions from the overall compositional distributions observed in Gale crater from landing until the present using the new calibration.\nObservations from Bradbury Rise (sols 0-53, 326-520) show a scattering of compositions toward mineral end-members from igneous clasts and pebbles transported from the crater rim. In contrast, Sheepbed mudstones (first drill location; sols 126-300) form a tight cluster close to average Mars composition. The nearby Shaler fluvial sandstone outcrop (sols 306-325)--the first outcrop of potential deltaic foreset beds--shows K enrichment. This enrichment reaches a peak of 6 wt % K2O (sol 625) in the Mt. Remarkable member of the Kimberley formation, Kimberley being a drill location flanked by foreset beds 7 km SW of Shaler. The Pahrump outcrop (sols 753-919)—first observed material of the Murray formation at Mt. Sharp’s base—shows lower Mg, higher Si, and much higher Al, consistent with stronger alteration. Further along the traverse ChemCam discovered an outcrop of light-toned Murray formation rock (sols 992 on) of nearly pure SiO2+TiO2. Overall, the ChemCam database points to a very strong diversity of inputs and alteration processes within a relatively short distance within Gale.\nIgneous compositions: while Jake Matijevic, a float analyzed early by APXS, appeared nepheline normative, no clear nepheline has been found by ChemCam. Additionally, despite the significant number of coarse-grained feldspar-rich rocks observed by ChemCam, only a small number of points show excess silica, and quartz has not been clearly observed, leading to the suggestion that the leucocratic igneous clasts are dioritic/trachybasaltic rather than granitic.",

            "abstract": "Chute cutoffs occur when a bypass or “chute” channel incises across a bar or low floodplain area, re-distributing water and sediment. Cutoffs result from a setup and a triggering event, typically during overbank flow, but the combined effect of magnitude and duration on potential erosion in in-channel and overbank areas is still poorly constrained. Here we investigated how overbank flow duration impacts cutoff formation and spatiotemporal shear stress patterns in a wandering gravel-bed river. We applied a two-dimensional hydraulic model to a recently reconstructed reach of the Clark Fork River in western Montana that experienced chute cutoffs during a long-duration flood in 2011. Hydrographs with increasing durations exceeding overbank were simulated; for each magnitude-duration combination, various metrics were quantified for in-channel and overbank areas separately. We confirm the hypothesized importance of floodplain elevation, vegetation presence, chute-channel inlet entrance location, and high overbank shear stress zones at bend apexes on cutoff occurrence. Floodplain width plays an important role in controlling unit discharge such that overbank areas are more competent in a narrower floodplain conveyance corridor. Duration controls cumulative flow exceeding sediment mobility thresholds, having the largest effect in overbank areas. Side channels at the reconstructed study site act like naturally formed incipient chutes. This work describes a complex floodplain system characteristic of wandering gravel-bed rivers with implications for understanding morphodynamic evolution, river restoration, and flow management in regulated rivers.",

            "abstract": "In order to describe the fluid physics of the dynamo generating regions of planets, the geoscience community has largely adopted a set of scaling laws proposed in the seminal work of Christensen and Aubert (2006).[1] These scalings make use of specially-constructed parameters that are independent of fluid diffusivities, anticipating that large-scale turbulent processes will dominate the physics in planetary dynamo settings. In the work presented here, we test the validity of diffusion-free heat transfer scaling laws by constructing synthetic heat transfer datasets and examining their scaling properties alongside those proposed by Christensen and Aubert (2006). These tests demonstrate that the seemingly robust collapse of heat transfer data using diffusion-free parameters is not indicative of fully turbulent, diffusion-free physics, but is instead an a priori consequence of the way such parameters are constructed. In particular, the diffusion-free heat transfer scaling is determined by the onset of convection, which is itself determined by the viscous diffusivity of the fluid. Our results, in conjunction with those of Stelzer and Jackson (2013),[2] show that diffusion-free scalings are not validated by current-day numerical dynamo datasets, and that it still remains to be established under what conditions dynamo generation becomes free of fluid diffusivities.\n",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous reactions on saline surfaces release reactive halogen species in the Arctic during late winter / spring (Feb--May). These reactive halogens drastically alter the photooxidative environment, removing ozone and oxidizing mercury and hydrocarbons. Both the snowpack and suspended particles / blowing snow possess surfaces that can sustain this chemistry, leading to variations in reactive halogen vertical profiles and temporal evolution of those profiles. This chemistry also occurs in a typically stable (inverted) atmospheric structure that hinders vertical mixing, limiting the vertical extent of snowpack influence. In this presentation, Multiple-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAXDOAS) of bromine monoxide (BrO) along with optimal estimation inversions are used to measure the vertical structure of BrO. The effective mixing height of the BrO layer varies with atmospheric stability, and an event is shown where a shallow but highly concentrated layer of surface BrO encounters sea-ice-lead-induced convection that vertically mixes the BrO higher, initially diluting the surface concentration. Over time, the surface concentration recovers and the now thicker layer grows to a higher column density of BrO. Understanding of the relationship between BrO event intensity and meteorological situations can help to understand BrO chemistry and remote sensing and assist in prediction of how reactive halogens may respond to a changing Arctic climate.",

            "abstract": "To investigate the dynamic response of the outer accretionary wedge updip from the patch of greatest slip during the Mw8.8 2010 Maule earthquake, 10 Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) were deployed from May 2012 to March 2013 in a small array with an inter-instrument spacing of ~12 km . Nine instruments were recovered, with 4 recording data on 3 intermediate-band 3-component seismometers and a differential pressure gauge and 5 recording data from absolute pressure gauges. [note: All instruments were also equipped with a fluid flow meter sensitive to flow rates as low as 0.0001 cm/yr in or out of the sediments. However, no flow signal was detected.] Here we present hypocenters for 569 local events that have S-P times less than 17 seconds (i.e. within ~125 km of the array) using hand-picked arrival times and a 1D velocity model derived from a 2D seismic refraction profile through the region (Moscoso et al 2011, EPSL). We analyze the distribution of seismicity in the context of published slip models, ChilePEPPER high-resolution seismic reflection data, critical taper analysis done by Cubas et al 2013 (EPSL), and offshore gravity data. The data show distinct segmentation within the outer prism. The northern section of the study area is characterized by a lack of seismicity, accretion of nearly all incoming sediment and a prism at critical taper. In contrast, abundant seismicity, significant sediment underthrusting at the deformation front and a prism below critical taper angle characterize the southern part of the study area. Both coseismic slip and post-rupture local seismicity can be related to density anomalies within the upper plate as revealed by free air gravity data corrected for the effects of bathymetry and the subducting plate.

            "abstract": "Accurate and reliable velocity structure of the crust and upper mantle may provide key constraints on the tectonics and deep geodynamics. Seismic tomography methods with single dataset, such as body wave travel time and surface wave dispersions, have already obtained abundant results in the 3-D velocity structures of the crust and upper mantle. However, joint tomography methods are helpful to minimize the geophysical inversion non-uniqueness and improve the reliability and accuracy of the inversions compared to single tomography method. Recently, we developed the joint tomographic method of local body wave travel time and ambient noise surface wave dispersion, to take advantage of shallow sensitivity of surface wave data and deeper sensitivity of body wave data. In order to integrate the linear inversion equations from local earthquake body wave travel time tomography and noise surface wave tomography, the direct surface wave tomography method for 3-D velocity structures from dispersion data is developed. Unified form of the tomographic equation systems for both body and surface wave inversions makes the joint method efficient and effective, which can also accelerate the convergence of the tomographic inversion with limited iterations. With the joint tomographic method, we conduct tomographic inversion in the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau. The obtained velocity structures of the crust and uppermost mantle from the joint inversion are better constraint and well improved compared to that from individual body or surface wave tomography, which could provide better 3-D model for the studies of deep tectonics and geodynamics in the Tibetan plateau.",

These have been operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) since 1976 in Tokai area, Japan, the area of an expected Tokai eartquake. Earth's surface is always influenced by natural force such as earth tide, air pressure, and precipitation as well as by human induced sources. In order to decompose into their components in the maximum likelihood estimation, state-space modeling (Takanami et al., 2013) is applied to the observed time series data for 15 months before and after the earthquake M6.5 that occurred on 11th August 2009 in Suruga Bay. In the analysis, the strain data are decomposed into trend, air pressure, earth tide, precipitation effects and observation noise. Clear long-period strain signals are seen in the normalized trend component time series. Time series data from JMA tide gages around Suruga Bay are similarly decomposed. Then spectral analyses are applied to the trend components for the same time interval. Comparison of amplitude peaks in spectra for both data sets show all have a peak at period of about 1464 hours. Thus strain changes may be influenced by very long-period ocean level changes; it is necessary to consider this possibility before attributing tectonic significance to such variations.",

            "abstract": "Modern molecular ecology techniques are revealing the metabolic potential of uncultivated microorganisms, but there is still much to be learned about the actual biogeochemical roles of microbes that have cultivated relatives. Here, we present metatranscriptomic and metagenomic data from a field study that provides evidence of coupled redox processes that have not been documented in cultivated relatives and, indeed, represent strains with metabolic traits that are novel with respect to closely related isolates.\nThe data come from omics analysis of groundwater samples collected during an experiment in which nitrate (a native electron acceptor) was injected into a perennially suboxic aquifer in Rifle (CO). Transcriptional data indicated that just two groups of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria accounted for a very large portion (~80%) of overall community gene expression: (1) members of the Fe(II)-oxidizing Gallionellaceae family and (2) strains of the S-oxidizing species, Sulfurimonas denitrificans. Metabolic lifestyles for Gallionellaceae strains that were novel compared to cultivated representatives included nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation and S oxidation. Evidence for these metabolisms included highly correlated temporal expression in binned data of nitrate reductase (e.g., narGHI) genes (which have never been reported in Gallionellaceae genomes) and Fe(II) oxidation genes (e.g., mtoA) or S oxidation genes (e.g., dsrE, aprA). Of the two most active strains of S. denitrificans, only one showed strong expression of S oxidation genes, whereas the other was apparently using an unexpected (as-yet unidentified) primary electron donor.\nTranscriptional data added considerable interpretive value to this study, as (1) metagenomic data would not have highlighted these organisms, which had a disproportionately large role in community metabolism relative to their populations, and (2) co-expression of coupled pathway genes could not be predicted based solely on metagenomic data.",

            "abstract": "Previous attempts to constrain N fluxes between the mantle, crust, and atmospheric reservoirs over geologic time have been inhibited due to the difficulty of detecting trace amounts of nitrogen, especially as triply-bonded N2 in oxidized magmas. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) can detect nitrogen as N+, and as the molecular ions SiN-, NO-, and CN-. However, there are few matrix-matched, bulk-analyzed standards for N, which makes quantification of its signal challenging. Here, we use the implantation of known amounts of nitrogen into rhyolitic glasses containing a range of H2O, and subsequent depth-profile analysis of these samples to derive N calibration factors1,2. We use a primary beam of O- and detection of N+ ions. Results demonstrate that the useful yield (ions detected per atom sputtered) of N increases with H2O content, whereas the useful yield of the measured matrix ion (30Si) decreases with higher H2O. Quantification is also complicated by variable N background that scales inversely with observed higher sputtering rates in hydrated glasses. The former issue can be resolved by fitting a curve to the H2O vs. calibration factor plot and the latter by varying the primary beam density on low-H2O materials. Together, these approaches allow us to quantify the N content in variably hydrated rhyolitic glasses. Application of these calibrations to quartz-hosted melt inclusions from the Bishop3, 4 and Huckleberry Ridge Tuffs4 reveals un-degassed N contents of melts at depth. We show that N can be used in concert with other volatiles to tease out magmatic processes, such as recharge events and magma mixing. We conclude that unless these inclusions do not represent the bulk concentration of N in the melt, large silicic eruptions have not released enough N to significantly impact the atmospheric reservoir over geologic time.\n1Burnett DS et al.

            "abstract": "Oblique convergence across Tibet leads to slip partitioning with the co-existence of strike-slip, normal and thrust motion in major fault systems. While such complexity has been shown at the surface, the question is to understand how faults interact and accumulate strain at depth. Here, we process InSAR data across the central Haiyuan restraining bend, at the north-eastern boundary of the Tibetan plateau and show that the surface complexity can be explained by partitioning of a uniform deep-seated convergence rate. We construct a time series of ground deformation, from Envisat radar data spanning from 2001-2011 period, across a challenging area because of the high jump in topography between the desert environment and the plateau. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, we used the latest Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry methodology, such as Global Atmospheric Models (ERA Interim) and Digital Elevation Model errors corrections before unwrapping. We then developed a new Bayesian approach, jointly inverting our InSAR time series together with published GPS displacements. We explore fault system geometry at depth and associated slip rates and determine a uniform N86±7E° convergence rate of 8.45±1.4 mm/yr across the whole fault system with a variable partitioning west and east of a major extensional fault-jog. Our 2D model gives a quantitative understanding of how crustal deformation is accumulated by the various branches of this thrust/strike-slip fault system and demonstrate the importance of the geometry of the Haiyuan Fault, controlling the partitioning or the extrusion of the block motion. The approach we have developed would allow constraining the low strain accumulation along deep faults, like for example for the blind thrust faults or possible detachment in the San Andreas “big bend”, which are often associated to a poorly understood seismic hazard.",

In this study, the newest released satellite-based precipitation product-Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) IMERGE data is evaluated with a distributed hydrological model-Geomorphology Based Hydrological Model (GBHM) over the Mekong River Basin(MRB), which is the most important trans boundary river in Southeast Asia. Compared with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), GPM IMERGE has a higher temporal and spatial resolution (0.1°, 30mins). Firstly, a comparison between GPM IMERGE and TRMM 3B42 is carried out at grids during 2014/3/12-10/31 at MRB. It is found that, GPM IMERGE stays quite consistent with TRMM, but GPM is more sensitive to small rainfall events especially during dry seasons, which means GPM may have a better performance in dry seasons. Then GBHM is set up and calibrated at MRB, and the model is driven by GPM IMERGE and TRMM 3B42 respectively to simulate hydrology cycle between Chiang Saen and Krait, in order to remove the influences of dam operation in upstream. The simulated streamflow is compared against the observed daily time series at five gauges on mainstream. Generally, the simulated streamflow driven by GPM is closer to observation at gauges located downstream while those driven by TRMM 3B42 have a better performance at upstream gauges. On the other hand these two results stay agreement with each other and both of them have a quite good performance with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency higher than 0.75 and relative bias less than 10%. This study demonstrates that for daily scale application, TRMM and GPM have almost the same performance. But GPM is more promising to be applied at fine temporal and spatial scales owing to its advantage of finer temporal and spatial resolution and ability to catch small rainfall events.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies had not identified any slow slip events along the Sumatran subduction zone, other than afterslip following major earthquakes. In the Banyak Islands of Sumatra, coral microatolls reveal a 15-year-long reversal of interseismic vertical displacement from subsidence to uplift between 1966 to 1981. We have examined various oceanographic and tectonic processes that could potentially explain the coral data, and our results show that a long-duration slow slip event is the most likely explanation. Based upon coral records of sea level, we have modeled a range of locations and sizes for this event. Our models suggest that this slow slip event occurred on the portion of the megathrust under the Banyak Islands, within the downdip zone of transitional friction properties from locked to creeping behavior. It had a cumulative moment magnitude of ~Mw 7.3.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the longest-lasting slow slip event known. Its 15-year duration suggests that with increasingly long geodetic records, we will continue to make new discoveries about the varied spectrum of megathrust slip behavior, highlighting both the importance of maintaining multi-decadal GPS networks and the value of paleogeodetic data in extending deformation records further back in time.",

            "abstract": "As the past decade was the warmest in the 110–year active record, and future Southwest warming is expected to be most intense in the summer season, it is important to have an updated atmospheric definition of what constitutes a Southwest summer. This is particularly true given the intensity of current drought conditions and that summers may be changing. Using weather-type data from the Spatial Synoptic Classification, this research aims to synoptically define the summer season in the Southwest since 1950. The Southwest is spatially described here by sub-region and 28 air mass stations within are chosen for air mass analysis. Daily air mass frequencies are examined to determine the dominant and less prevalent types annually and seasonally, from May to September. Then, frequencies in the middle of summer are compared to those in the seasonal fringe months to explore the possibility of a synoptic shift in the timing of the region’s summer season. Finally, to further scrutinize how regional air mass frequencies have changed with time, the data are subdivided and evaluated for the ‘Early record’ (years prior to 1975) and ‘Modern record’ (post 1975). Frequency departures are tested for practical and statistical significance to characterize the strength of summer season variability. Results indicate that Dry Moderate air masses are the most common annually and in summer. Moist and transitional air masses tend to less frequent throughout the Southwest; however, frequencies vary greatly by sub-region. Wet and dry conditions are observed in accordance with the monsoon in some sub-regions, but not throughout the region. Significant changes in sub-regional air mass tendencies are identified that show the Early record experienced cooler air mass conditions (fewer tropical types and more moderate and cool types) than the Modern record. From a long-term synoptic air mass perspective, typical Southwest summers likely last from May to August. However, in the Modern record May frequencies appear less like the rest of summer while September frequencies more closely model the middle of summer frequency record. This indicates that Southwest summers may be synoptically shifting into September.",

We adopt a sum of subtracted bi-Maxwellian components to model the observed proton ring distribution and simulate the wave trajectory and growth. MS waves at first propagate towards lower L-shells outside the plasmasphere, with rapidly increasing path gains related to the continuous proton ring distribution. Then they gradually cross the plasmapause into the deep plasmasphere, with almost unchanged path gains due to the falling proton ring distribution and higher ambient density.

            "abstract": "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) Site 300 was established in 1955 to support weapons research and development. Depleted uranium was used as a proxy for fissile uranium-235 (235U) in open-air explosives tests conducted at Building 812. As a result, oxidized depleted uranium was deposited on the ground, eventually migrating to the underlying sandstone aquifer. Uranium (U) groundwater concentrations exceed the California and Federal Maximum Contaminant Level of 20 pCi L-1 (30 ug L-1). However, the groundwater plume appears to attenuate within 60 m of the source, beyond which no depleted U is detected. This study will determine the relative contribution of physical (e.g. dilution), chemical (e.g. surface adsorption, mineral precipitation), and biological (e.g. biotransformation) processes that contribute to the apparent attenuation of U, which exists as uranyl (UO22+) complexes, at the site. Methods of investigation include evaluating 15 yr of hydrogeologic and chemical data, creating a site conceptual model, and applying equilibrium (e.g. aqueous species complexation, mineral saturation indices) and reactive transport models using Geochemist’s WorkbenchTM. Reactive transport results are constrained by direct field observations, including U major ion, and dissolved O2 concentrations, pH, and others, under varying chemical and hydraulic conditions. Aqueous speciation calculations indicate that U primarily exists as anionic CaUO2(CO3)32- or neutral Ca2UO2(CO3)30 species. Additionally, nucleation and growth of Ca/Mg uranyl carbonate solids are predicted to affect attenuation. Initial reactive transport results suggest surface adsorption (e.g. ion exchange, surface complexation) to layer silicate clays is limited under the aqueous geochemical conditions of the site. Current and future work includes XRD analysis of aquifer solids to constrain iron and aluminum (oxy)hydroxides, and coupling advective-dispersive transport with the chemical and physical processes.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

            "abstract": "The complex interactions/feedbacks between water vapor fields and deep atmospheric convection remain one of the outstanding problems in Tropical Meteorology. The lack of high spatial/temporal resolution, all-weather observations in the Tropics has hampered progress. In this talk, we present results employing GPS meteorology from two topographically/climatologically unique Tropical Continental regimes: Central Amazonia and the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico. Specifically, we presents results on the shallow-to-deep convective transition from both regimes in addition to employing water vapor convergence as a proxy variable for convective intensity. Results from both convective regimes reveal an approximately 4-hour timescale of intense water vapor convergence associated with the transition from shallow to deep precipitating convection. This water vapor convergence time scale provides a useful metric for both high resolution and global climate models to replicate. Furthermore, we examime convective intensity from both regimes (defined utilizing lightning data, cloud top temperature or precipitation), which is also characterized by the time-rate-of-change of precipitable water vapor. The relationship between the time-rate-of-change of precipitable water vapor and convective intensity is positive, however, with a large amount spread in the data and some dependence on the regime and topography.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring Earth from satellite observations by retrieving geophysical variables, such as cloud amount, requires continuity between satellite missions. The continuity also requires careful calibration and instrument characterization. The MODIS VIIRS Cloud Mask is an approach to ensure continuity in cloud cover from MODIS through the VIIRS era by using similar spectral observations and the same algorithm. This presentation discusses the algorithm approach, compares results from the two instruments and discusses validation through comparison with the CALIOP lidar.\nThe MVCM philosophy is the same as for MODIS cloud mask (MOD35) and ingests similar L1b bands for VIIRS and MODIS processing. The MVCM contains similar output as MODIS (48 bits/pixel) MVCM output contains confidence of clear sky (Q) values. The algorithm is the same for MODIS and VIIRS instrument and the ancillary data similar.\nAgreement between CALIOP and MVCM Aqua, and between CALIOP and MVCM NPP is reasonable and approaches that between CALIOP and MYD35 (Aqua MODIS cloud mask). Agreement between MVCM Aqua and MVCM NPP is also reasonable. Dependences on view angle and field-of-view differences between MODIS and VIIRS are presented and discussed. The VIIRS has a constant field-of-view with viewing angle, differing from MODIS and resulting in differences in cloud amount.",

            "abstract": "According to the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department, the citizens of Hong Kong disposes 13,500 tonnes of waste to the landfill everyday. Out of the 13,500 tonnes, 3600 tonnes consist of organic waste. Furthermore, due to the limited supply of land for landfills in Hong Kong, it is estimated that landfills will be full by about 2020. Currently, organic wastes at landfills undergo anaerobic respiration, where methane gas, one of the most harmful green house gases, will be released. The management of such waste is a pressing issue, as possible solutions must be presented in this crucial period of time.\nThe Independent Schools Foundation Academy introduced their very own method to manage the waste produced by the students. With an approximate of 1500 students on campus, the school produces 27 metric tonnes of food waste each academic year. The installation of the rocket food composter provides an alternate method of disposable of organic waste the school produces, for the aerobic environment allows for different by-products to be produced, namely compost that can be used for organic farming by the primary school students and subsequently carbon dioxide, a less harmful greenhouse gas.\nThis research is an extension on the current work, as another natural factor is considered. It evaluates the microorganism community present in leachate samples collected from the North East New Territories Landfill, for the bacteria in the area exhibits special characteristics in the process of decomposition. Through the sequencing and analysis of the genome of the bacteria, the identification of the bacteria might lead to a break through on the current issue. Some bacteria demonstrate the ability to degrade lignin cellulose, or assist in the production of methane gas in aerobic respirations. These characteristics can hopefully be utilized in the future in waste managements across the globe.",

            "abstract": "Modeling the chemical state of the atmosphere is a complicated endeavor due to the complex, non-linear interactions between meteorology, emissions, and kinetics that govern trace gas concentrations. Given the rapid environmental changes taking place, the Arctic is one area of particular interest with regards to climate and atmospheric composition. To observe these changes to the Arctic atmosphere, NASA funded the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) campaign (2008). As part of the mission, measurements of oxidative factors (hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO2) abundances) were taken using the Airborne Tropospheric Hydrogen Oxides Sensor (ATHOS) aboard the NASA DC-8. Using GEOS-Chem, a popular global chemical transport model, we perform a global sensitivity analysis for the period of the ARCTAS campaign, allowing for non-linear interactions between input factors to be accounted and quantified in the analysis. Sensitivities are determined for around 50 model input factors and for combinations of pairs of input factors using the Random Sampling – High Dimensional Model Representation (RS-HDMR) method. We calculate the uncertainty in these oxidative factors, and in ozone, ozone production rate, and hydroxyl production rate and find the sensitivity of these oxidative factors and the differences between the measured and modeled oxidative factors to model inputs in meteorology, emissions, and chemistry. This presentation will include a solid estimate of GEOS-Chem model uncertainty for the period of the ARCTAS campaign, the emissions, meteorology, or chemistry to which oxidative properties are most sensitive for these periods, and the factors to which the differences between the modeled and measured oxidative factors are most sensitive.",

            "abstract": "Variations in the inherited structural architecture along western South America influence the timing, magnitude, and style of Andean deformation and topographic evolution. New results from mapping, balanced cross-section construction, apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronology, and geomorphology spanning the Altiplano, Eastern Cordillera and Subandean zone of southern Peru define the role of Triassic rift inversion on Cenozoic deformation style, thrust belt kinematics, exhumation timing, and spatial variation of canyon incision. A minimum of 130 km (38%) shortening along a 200 km transect accommodated by thin- and thick-skinned structures involved selective reactivation of Triassic normal faults that fed slip to shallower detachments of thin-skinned fold-thrust systems. Map relationships define unique structural domains defined by inherited normal faults. In the Eastern Cordillera, new zircon (U-Th)/He results from a Triassic pluton reveal Oligocene-Miocene (~26-18 Ma) cooling, consistent with previously reported exhumation from ~40 km along strike to the NW. However, rapid ~15 Ma cooling revealed by new apatite (U-Th)/He data is ~11 Myr older than equivalent rocks in a similar structural setting ~40 km to the NW. This suggests a potential middle Miocene shift from synchronous to diachronous exhumation along strike. Modern fluvial profiles constructed along the Eastern Cordillera show a reduction in knickpoint elevations from SE to NW, suggesting more youthful uplift toward the NW, comparable to the spatial trend in apatite (U-Th)/He ages. The deformation front reached the Subandean zone by ~15 Ma, after the majority of reported deformation in the Eastern Cordillera and Altiplano. These variations in exhumation over such distances are consistent with multiple potential scenarios: a northward propagating wave of uplift, spatial variations in climatically driven incision, interactions with mantle dynamics, or complex structural geometries.",

            "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau, ‘the third pole’, has been reported to be sensitive to global change, but the understanding of the relationship between altitude and composition & diversity of microorganisms in this region is poorly characterized. In this study, 18 alpine forest soils located at 704 to 3760 m a.s.l on Tibetan Plateau were selected to investigate the microbial communities by 16S rRNA ion torrent sequencing. Both microbial community richness and evenness were negatively associated with altitude. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that microbial communities were significantly correlated with many environmental variables including temperature, C/N ratio, ammonium and nitrate nitrogen besides altitude. A total of 32 bacterial phyla were detected. Proteobacteria (31.7% average relative abundance) and Acidobacteria (24.0%) had the highest relative abundances across all altitudes. Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes and Nitrospira were also relatively abundant (1–10%). Bacterial communities in relative abundance at different taxonomic levels showed distinct trends with altitude. Acidobacteria sequences, especially of the class Acidobacteria_Gp1, Gp2 and Gp3, were significantly more abundant at higher altitudes, while Gp4, Gp6 and Gp17 were more favorable to lower altitudes. Alphaproteobacteria sequences, especially of the order Rhodospirillales, were significantly more abundant at higher altitudes, while Rhodobacterales and Sphingomonadales favored lower altitudes. The order of Nitrosomonadales and Rhodocyclales within Betaproteobacteria were significantly increasing with the altitude, while Burkholderiales displayed the declining trends. The order of Desulfuromonadales and Syntrophobacterales within Deltaproteobacteria were significantly increasing with the altitude, while Bdellovibrionales and Myxococcales showed the decreasing trends. The order of Chromatiales and Xanthomonadales within Gammaproteobacteriawere significantly favorable to the lower altitudes. These insights into the microbial community and the main controlling factors in alpine forest soils of the Tibetan Plateau provide a valuable background for further studies on biogeochemical processes in this distinct ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "This project is currently engaging twelve undergraduate students in the process of developing new technology and instrumentation for use in balloon borne geospace investigations in the auroral zone. Motivation stems from advances in microelectronics and consumer electronic technology. Given the technological innovations over the past 20 years it now possible to develop new instrumentation to study the auroral ionosphere and stratospheric ozone layer using ultralight balloon payloads for less than 6lbs and $3K per payload. The University of Houston Undergraduate Student Instrumentation Project (USIP) team has built ten such payloads for launch using 1500 gm latex weather balloons deployed in Houston, TX, Fairbanks, AK, and as well as zero pressure balloons launched from northern Sweden. The latex balloon project will collect vertical profiles of wind velocity, temperature, electrical conductivity, ozone, and odd nitrogen. This instrument payload will also produce profiles of pressure, electric field, and air-earth electric current. The zero pressure balloons will obtain a suite of geophysical measurements including: DC electric field, electric field and magnetic flux, optical imaging, total electron content of ionosphere via dual-channel GPS, X-ray detection, and infrared/UV spectroscopy. Students flew payloads with different combinations of these instruments to determine which packages are successful. Data collected by these instruments will be useful in understanding the nature of electrodynamic coupling in the upper atmosphere and how the global earth system is changing. Twelve out of the launched fifteen payloads were successfully launched and recovered. Results and best practices learned from lab tests and initial Houston test flights will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Solar wind halo/strahl electrons carry important information on the formation of suprathermal electrons in the solar wind. Here we present a statistical survey on the energy spectrum of 0.1-1.5 keV electrons observed by WIND/3DP in the solar wind during quiet times at solar minimum and maximum of solar cycle 23 and 24. First, we separate strahl electrons from halo electrons according to their different behaviors in the angular distribution. Secondly, we fit the observed energy spectrum of halo/strahl electrons at 0.1-1.5 keV to a kappa distribution function with an index κ and effective temperature Teff. We also integrate the electron measurements to obtain the number density n of halo/strahl electrons at 0.1-1.5 keV. We find a strong positive correlation between κ and Teff for both halo and strahl electrons. For strahl electrons, the index κ (number density n) appears to decrease (increase) with increasing solar activity. For halo electrons, the index κ also decreases with increasing solar activity, while the number density n shows no clear solar-cycle variation. Based on a simple model, we find that the escape of thermal electrons from the coronal region with a higher temperature T could lead to a larger κ for the 0.1-1.5 keV electrons measured in the solar wind, if T > ~0.73×106 K. These results suggest that strahl electrons are likely related to the escaping thermal electrons from different regions in the hot corona, while halo electrons are probably formed due to the scatter/acceleration of strahl electrons in the interplanetary medium.",

            "abstract": "The Upper Guinean Forests of West Africa encompass one of most fragmented and endangered tropical forest ecosystems on earth. However, relatively little is known about the extent and causes of forest degradation in this heavily human affected region. We used the tasseled cap wetness (TCW) index to detect forest degradation using dry-season imagery from 2001 to 2015. TCW was calculated from MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) at 500 meter resolution. The TCW index was compared with field data and high-resolution imagery and was found to have a strong relationship with different level of forest degradation, with lower TCW index values indicating higher levels of degradation. Mann-Kendall tests were used to detect the monotonic decreases in TCW index. Results indicated that about 12.9% of tropical forest in West Africa has been degraded during past 15 years, and most of these areas were located in isolated forest patches and on the periphery of intact forest. The boosted regression tree (BRT) method was then used to assess the influence of climate and human influence on forest degradation. BRT analysis indicated that climatic variations, human activities, and their interactions were important contributors to forest degradation. Major drivers of forest degradation included distance to cropland, rainfall trend, and rate of population growth.. Our results show that times series of coarse-resolution MODIS imagery can be used for broad-scale assessment of tropical forest degradation, and human activities need to be taken into account when assessing potential forest responses to climate change in this region.",

            "abstract": "We study and compare the effect of temporally variable and uniform pumping regimes on key features of contaminant transport in a randomly heterogeneous aquifer. Pumping wells are used for groundwater supply in the context of urban, agricultural, and industrial activities. Groundwater management agencies typically schedule groundwater extraction through a predefined sequence of pumping periods to balance benefits to anthropogenic activities and environmental needs. The impact of the spatial variability of aquifer hydraulic properties, such as hydraulic conductivity, on contaminant transport and associated solute residence times are widely studied. Only a limited number of studies address the way a given pumping schedule affects contaminant plume behavior in heterogeneous aquifers. In this context, the feedback between a transient pumping regime and contaminant breakthrough curves is largely unexplored. Our goal is to investigate the way diverse groundwater extraction strategies affect the history of solute concentration recovered at the well while accounting for the natural variability of the geological system, in the presence of incomplete information on hydraulic conductivity distribution. Considering the joint effects of spatially heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity and temporally varying well pumping rates, this work offers a realistic evaluation of groundwater contamination risk. The latter is here considered in the context of human health and is quantified in terms of the probability that harm will result from exposure to a contaminant found in groundwater. Two scenarios are considered: a pumping well that extracts a given amount of water operating (a) at a constant pumping rate and (b) under transient conditions. The analysis is performed within a numerical Monte Carlo framework. We probe the impact of diverse geostatistical structures to describe aquifer heterogeneity on solute breakthrough curves and the statistics of target environmental performance metrics, including, e.g., peak concentration and the time at which peak breakthrough at well occurs.",

A myriad of mechanisms are frequently invoked to drive ionospheric outflows, including: effects of superthermal electron populations, resonant and nonresonant wave particle interactions, centrifugal forces, and more. In this study, we focus on the roles of superthermal electrons in the form of photoelectrons, soft electron precipitation, and the associated secondary electrons as well as on the ponderomotive force of waves in generating ionospheric outflows in the cusp and polar cap. The study is carried out using our Kinetic electron Polar Wind Outflow Model (KePWOM) which treats the ions and thermal electrons as a fluid and the superthermal population with an embedded kinetic model of the Landau-Boltzmann equation. Our simulation results examine the competing effects of superthermal electrons and the ponderomotive force of waves for a variety of precipitation and wave inputs that correspond to the cusp and polar cap. We furthermore compare our results to empirical relationships between ion flux and particle and wave input from FAST observations and find that secondary electrons generated as a result of soft electron precipitation play a critical role in the formation of cusp outflows.",

For the case of piecewise-constant hydraulic conductivity, nodal Darcy velocity obtained by the Yeh’s (1981) method may become unreliable, or even against common sense on nodes near the interface of two different porous media. We improved the method for calculating the nodal Darcy velocity for piecewise-homogeneous porous media so that the results are reliable in any case. (2) The fixed time-step used in the original version of MARUN is improved to be variable. It can be automatically increased or decreased accoridng to the convergent speed of the numerical Picard iteration for solving the nonlinear groundwater flow equation. If the numerical Picard iteration converges too quickly, the time step is increased, otherwise, decreased. (3) Tidal loading term is incorporated for groundwater flow overlain by tidal seawater, which has variable loading on the pore water beneath the seafloor. Examples with applications are given to shown these improvements.",

            "abstract": "China experiences extremely severe and frequent PM2.5 (fine particulate matters with diameters less than 2.5 µm) pollution in recent years, arousing unprecedented public concern. Tough targets have been set for three particularly smog-ridden regions: JingJinJi area, the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, requiring these regions to reduce their atmospheric levels of PM2.5 by 25%, 20% and 15% respectively by the year 2017. A lot of mitigation actions have been taken to improve the air quality in China. In January 2013, China began to deploy instruments to measure PM2.5 nationally and released hourly observational data to the public. Observed PM2.5 concentrations showed a significant decrease in 2015 comparing to that of 2014 as shown in Fig.1. Many studies have attributed this kind of air quality improvement to the effect of emission control. However, air quality not only depends on the original emission, the atmospheric abilities of contaminant transfer, spread and wet deposition play a big role in reducing the ambient air pollutants and directly determined by the occurrence of pollution episodes. Here we used the first 2 years PM2.5 observation data in China to quantify the contribution of the effect of emission control and atmospheric ability of diffusing on reducing ambient PM2.5 concentrations. We found that PM2.5 decreased by 24% in 2015 winter (Dec. 2014-Feb. 2015) comparing to that in 2014; and 12% of decrease occurred for the spring time. The inconsistent seasonal improvement of air quality is mainly due to the favorable atmospheric background in 2015, with its frequent precipitation, infrequency of surface calm wind during the wintertime.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological functions of alpine glaciers and their responses to the warming climate have received much attention by hydrologists working in alpine catchments around the world. As alpine glaciers retreat, they commonly leave debris-covered ice or ice-cored moraine behind, which can remain frozen in ground for many decades or centuries. In many alpine catchments, characteristic landforms indicating rock glaciers or their relicts are found in locations where glaciers do not exist under the current climate. These landscape features associated with mountain permafrost are ubiquitous in alpine catchments, but their hydrological functions have not received much attention. Do rock glaciers and other mountain-permafrost features contribute significantly to storage of snowmelt water and its delayed release to sustain baseflow in the critical alpine stream habitats? How are these storage functions responding to the climate warming? In order to answer these questions, we initiated a hydrological study of rock glaciers in an alpine catchment in the Canadian Rockies in 2014. We will present preliminary results of our study using geophysical imaging techniques, hydro-meteorological monitoring, and groundwater tracing using various environmental tracers. Key findings are: 1) substantial amount of permafrost exists in the rock glacier which is inactive (i.e. no active motion) under the present climate, 2) spatial distribution of permafrost is controlled by both meteorological and geological factors, 3) the rock glacier complex contributes 30-50 % of summer stream flow even though they occupy less than 5% of the catchment area, and 4) the low temperature (< 2 C) of groundwater discharging at the toe of rock glacier plays a significant role in regulating the temperature of stream, which hosts a population of trout species that is listed as \"threatened\" in the list of the status of endangered wildlife in Canada.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that current DGVMs have suffered insufficient realism and hard to improve, particularly because they are built on plant functional type (PFT)-climate schemes. It is urgent to develop new approaches, like plant trait-based methods (FTs), to replace of PFT schemes when predicting the distribution of vegetation and investigating the vegetation sensitivity. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to modeling vegetation distributions and analyzing the vegetation sensitivity through trait-climate relationship in China. First, we aggregated data on three key FTs, including leaf mass per area (LMA), area-based leaf nitrogen (Narea), and mass-based leaf nitrogen (Nmass), from the available literatures. In addition, one structural trait of plant communities, leaf area index (LAI), was extracted from MODIS products across China. Second, we derived and developed trait-climate relationships and used different trait combinations in a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model vegetation distribution. Finally, the GMM trained by the LMA-Nmass-LAI combination was applied to investigate the climate sensitivity of vegetation. The results demonstrated the following: (1) all four traits captured well the relationships between climate variables and traits, as well as effectively predicted vegetation distribution and helped analyzing environmental sensitivity; (2) the LMA-Nmass-LAI combination yielded an accuracy of 72.05% for simulating vegetation distribution, providing more detailed parameter information regarding community structures and ecosystem function, and was therefore selected for training GMMs; and (3) a sensitivity analysis indicated that increasing temperatures shifted the boundaries of most vegetation northward and westward. Because the forests in these regions are well adapted to growth under rainy conditions, increasing precipitation is predicted to expand the boundaries of forests compared with the baseline vegetation distribution. Although the trait-climate relationship is not the only candidate useful for predicting vegetation distributions and analyzing climatic sensitivity, it sheds new light on developing the next generation of trait-based DGVMs.",

            "abstract": "Catchments are dynamic, constantly undergoing change be it naturally or due to anthropogenic influences. Changes in land surface conditions such as disturbance due to bushfire or erosion, urbanisation, deforestation or afforestation will affect a catchment’s hydrologic regime. Models calibrated to pre-change conditions will lead to biased streamflow predictions, unless the change is explicitly accounted for in the model. A modelling methodology that is capable of adjusting its form (for instance, through time varying parameters) as catchments undergo change is therefore needed. We developed a framework for automatically and objectively detecting time variations in model parameters using Data Assimilation. The so called Locally Linear Dual EnKF was previously tested against a range of synthetic case studies and shown to reproduce known temporal variations from assimilating streamflow observations only. In this study, we apply the Locally Linear Dual EnKF to the Wights and Salmon paired catchments in Western Australia. Both were initially forested and monitored for a 3 year period, after which Wights was fully cleared whilst Salmon remained unchanged. The lumped conceptual hydrologic model (PDM) was calibrated over the stationary period and the optimal parameterisation used to initialise the Locally Linear Dual EnKF. Resultant parameter trajectories for the Salmon catchment were relatively stationary, whilst parameters for the Wights catchment were automatically adjusted to produce greater flood peaks, sooner after rainfall, consistent with observations. A significant improvement in both streamflow prediction and catchment soil moisture was obtained with the Locally Linear Dual EnKF, compared to the time invariant parameter case. This application has demonstrated the usefulness of this framework for improving predictions in rapidly changing catchments.",

We implement a three-stage inversion strategy, which can take advantages of each dataset due to their complementary sensitivities to crust structures, to obtain structure information step by step using iterative linearized inversion approaches based on Tikhonov regularization of model parameters. We firstly invert surface wave dispersion and ZH ratio data to get 1-D shear velocity model, then incorporate P-wave receiver function data to obtain a much finer shear velocity model considering its high sensitivity to discontinuities. For the first two steps, the compressional velocity and density parameters are obtained from the shear velocity model using some empirical relationship. Finally, three datasets are further used to jointly invert for the compressional velocity structure based on the obtained shear velocity model. Synthetic tests show the superiority of joint inversion against separate inversion using only one or two datasets. They also demonstrate that the three-stage inversion strategy can make better use of different datasets to implement inversion physically and resolve finer crustal structure with more accuracy.",

We simulated N2O emissions under tillage and no-tillage, and different nitrogen (N) fertilizer types and application methods in a cornfield using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model. The model was parameterized with field experimental data collected in Nashville, TN under various management treatments and run for a short term (3 yrs) and a long term (100 yrs). Results showed that the DNDC model could adequately simulate N2O emissions as well as soil and climate conditions under different tillage, alternative use of N fertilizer sources or application methods (i.e. nitrification inhibitor, chicken manure and split applications), given that the model was parameterized based on the measured crop growths for each treatment. The emissions of N2O significantly increased by 29% with tillage, and decreased by 26% with the use of nitrification inhibitor, compared with the no-tillage and normal N fertilization. Chicken manure amendment and split applications of N fertilizer had minor impact on N2O emissions in a short term, but over a long term (100 yrs) they might significantly alter N2O emission (+30%, -12%, respectively). Sensitivity analysis showed that N2O emissions were sensitive to mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, soil organic carbon, and the amount of total N fertilizer application. Our model results provide valuable information for determining the best management practice to maintain highly productive corn yield while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",

            "abstract": "We find evidence for a surface layer of hydrated material in the lunar regolith using “albedo protons” measured by the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). Fluxes of these albedo protons, which are emitted from the regolith due to steady bombardment by high-energy radiation (Galactic Cosmic Rays), are observed to peak near the poles, and cannot be accounted for by either heavy element enrichment (e.g., enhanced Fe abundance), or by deeply buried (> 50 cm) hydrogenous material. The latitudinal distribution of albedo protons does not correlate with that of epithermal or high-energy neutrons. The high latitude enhancement may be due to the conversion of upward directed secondary neutrons from the lunar regolith into tertiary protons due to neutron-proton collisions in a thin (~ 1-10 cm) layer of hydrated regolith near the surface that is more prevalent near the poles. The CRaTER instrument thus provides critical measurements of volatile distributions within lunar regolith and potentially, with similar sensors and observations, at other bodies within the Solar System.",

            "abstract": "Some of the most destructive earthquakes on Earth are associated with active orogenic wedges. Despite a sound understanding of the basic mechanics that govern whole wedge structure over geologic time scales and a growing body of studies that have characterized the deformation associated with historic to recent earthquakes, first order questions remain about the linkage of the two sets of processes at the intermediate seismotectonic timescales. Numerical models have the power to test the effects of specific mechanical conditions on the evolution of observables at active orogenic wedges. Here we use a two-dimensional, continuum mechanics-based, finite difference method with a visco-elasto-plastic rheology coupled with surface processes to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of deformation during wedge growth. The model simulates the contraction of a crustal layer overlying a weak base (décollement) against a rigid backstop and the spontaneous nucleation and evolution of fault zones due to cohesive, Mohr-Coulomb failure with strain weakening. Consistent with critical wedge theory, the average slope across the wedge is controlled by the relative frictional strengths of the wedge and décollement. Initial calculations predict changes in wedge deformation on short geologic timescales (103-105yrs) that involve episodes of widening as new, foreland-verging thrusts nucleate near the surface beyond the wedge toe and propagate down-dip to intersect the décollement. All the while, the wedge thickens via slip on older, internal fault zones. The aim of this study is to identify the parameters controlling the timescales of 1) episodic widening versus thickening and 2) nucleation and life-span of individual fault zones. These are initial steps needed to link earthquake observations to the long-term tectonic states inferred at various orogenic belts around the world.",

Almost meanwhile, the other ARTEMIS orbiter encountered the two corresponding (to the exhausts) current sheets that show no reconnection signals at the relatively central and marginal locations in the near lunar wake. In the ``Margin Event\", a strong magnetic enhancement in the normal direction has been found peaking near the neutral line. In the ``Center Event\", the current sheet was significantly broadened in thickness. The rotations of magnetic field direction of the two current sheets became more smooth than those of the exhausts. It is the dropout currents which cannot penetrate into the near wake that mainly caused these observational magnetic features. Such magnetic configuration is very similar to the magnetic geometry between two anti-polarity permanent magnets parallel to each other in non conducting context. The essential reason is that the extremely low density plasma in the near wake can no longer carry as strong currents as in the solar wind to support the curl of the magnetic fields.",

            "abstract": "Aurora produced by precipitating low-energy electrons can be suppressed in summer daytime. However, the high-energy electrons (>30 keV) that are unsuppressed by sunlight are capable of penetrating deep into the mesosphere, where they can produce the odd hydrogen (HOx) and eventually lead to catalytic ozone (O3) loss. By elevating the D-region ionization level, they also play the important role of facilitating the production of polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE) as a precursor of polar mesospheric clouds (PMC). In the present study, it was discovered that high-energy electrons induce supersonic luminous phenomena, including the enhancement of O(1S) 557.7-nm emission with an intensity of up to 300 kR (horizontally integrated) and a supersonic velocity (300–1500 m s-1) as seen within a field of view that is 150-km wide, also called a supersonic burst (SB). SB-accompanied O(1S) emission enhancement is differentiated from aurora because the former occurs only in summer daytime, at a low altitude of ~80 km, and in the form of an intense localised burst. The source of the SB energy might be linked to the precipitation of high-energy electrons (>30 keV), especially as observed during high-speed solar wind streams (HSSs). In producing O(1S) emission, the secondary electron number flux of the precipitated primary electrons increases in magnitude by as much as an order of four, and a local process is required to provide the supplement. The supplementary local process may involve a supersonic velocity possibly caused by ion acceleration in a strong electric field, resulting in the inducement of electron acceleration in the field.",

The goal is to improve the microphysics schemes in meso-scale models, such as Weather Research and Forecast (WRF). Rain droplets were observed during eight periods of different rain types at three stations on the Yellow Mountain in East China. The SDF in this study were M-P distribution with a fixed shape parameter in Gamma SDF(FSP). Where the Gamma SDFs were obtained with three diagnosis methods with the shape parameters based on Milbrandt (2010; denoted DSPM10), Milbrandt (2005; denoted DSPM05) and Seifert (2008; denoted DSPS08) for solving the shape parameter(SSP) and Lognormal SDF. Based on the preliminary experiments, three ensemble methods deciding Gamma SDF was also developed and assessed.\nThe magnitude of average relative error caused by applying a FSP was 10-2 for fitting 0-order moment of the observed rain droplet distribution, and the magnitude of average relative error changed to 10-1 and 100 respectively for 1-4 order moments and 5-6 order moments. To different extent, DSPM10, DSPM05, DSPS08, SSP and ensemble methods could improve fitting accuracies for 0-6 order moments, especially the one coupling SSP and DSPS08 methods, which provided a average relative error 6.46% for 1-4 order moments and 11.90% for 5-6 order moments, respectively. The relative error of fitting three moments using the Lognormal SDF was much larger than that of Gamma SDF.\nThe threshold value of shape parameter ranged from 0 to 8, because values beyond this range could cause overflow in the calculation. When average diameter of rain droplets was less than 2mm, the possibility of unavailable shape parameter value(USPV) increased with a decreasing droplet size.

            "abstract": "We present a detection and attribution approach to interpret the forcings and feedbacks that shaped Quaternary climate stemming from known variations in Earth’s obliquity, precession, greenhouse gases, and ice sheet extent. Because future climate changes will be driven largely by only one forcing, CO2, it is important to better separate and understand the individual contributions of different forcings in producing past recorded changes. We use idealized equilibrium GCM simulations to fingerprint the annual mean and seasonal responses to individual changes in obliquity, precession, CO2, and ice sheets. These idealized “fingerprint” simulations are scaled by time series of past forcings and summed together to create a time-varying linear reconstruction of past climate that can be compared against proxy records. A multiple linear regression is conducted using Bayesian inference between the components of the linear reconstruction and long proxy time series, such as temperature from deuterium in Antarctic ice cores, to determine whether the modeled response to each forcing needs to be stronger or weaker to better match the data. This methodology offers a simple framework for exploring uncertainties affecting the interpretation of long time series of Quaternary climate variability and a way to use proxy data to test climate response processes relevant to future climate change.",

            "abstract": "Measurement technologies for velocity of river flow are divided into intrusive and nonintrusive methods. Intrusive method requires infield operations. The measuring process of intrusive methods are time consuming, and likely to cause damages of operator and instrument. Nonintrusive methods require fewer operators and can reduce instrument damages from directly attaching to the flow. Nonintrusive measurements may use radar or image velocimetry to measure the velocities at the surface of water flow. The image velocimetry, such as large scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV) accesses not only the point velocity but the flow velocities in an area simultaneously. Flow properties of an area hold the promise of providing spatially information of flow fields. This study attempts to construct a mobile system UAV-LSPIV by using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with LSPIV to measure flows in fields.\nThe mobile system consists of a six-rotor UAV helicopter, a Sony nex5T camera, a gimbal, an image transfer device, a ground station and a remote control device. The activate gimbal helps maintain the camera lens orthogonal to the water surface and reduce the extent of images being distorted. The image transfer device can monitor the captured image instantly. The operator controls the UAV by remote control device through ground station and can achieve the flying data such as flying height and GPS coordinate of UAV. The mobile system was then applied to field experiments. The deviation of velocities measured by UAV-LSPIV of field experiments and handhold Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) is under 8%. The results of the field experiments suggests that the application of UAV-LSPIV can be effectively applied to surface flow studies.",

            "abstract": "Among those hydrocarbon reservoir detection techniques, the time-frequency analysis based approach is one of the most widely used approaches because of its straightforward indication of low-frequency anomalies from the time-frequency maps, that is to say, the low-frequency bright spots usually indicate the potential hydrocarbon reservoirs. The time-frequency analysis based approach is easy to implement, and more importantly, is usually of high fidelity in reservoir prediction, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, and thus is of great interest to petroleum geologists, geophysicists, and reservoir engineers. The S transform has been frequently used in obtaining the time-frequency maps because of its better performance in controlling the compromise between the time and frequency resolutions than the alternatives, such as the short-time Fourier transform, Gabor transform, and continuous wavelet transform. The window function used in the majority of previous S transform applications is the symmetric Gaussian window. However, one problem with the symmetric Gaussian window is the degradation of time resolution in the time-frequency map due to the long front taper. In our study, a bi-Gaussian S transform that substitutes the symmetric Gaussian window with an asymmetry bi-Gaussian window is proposed to analyze the multi-channel seismic data in order to predict hydrocarbon reservoirs. The bi-Gaussian window introduces asymmetry in the resultant time-frequency spectrum, with time resolution better in the front direction, as compared with the back direction. It is the first time that the bi-Gaussian S transform is used for analyzing multi-channel post-stack seismic data in order to predict hydrocarbon reservoirs since its invention in 2003. The superiority of the bi-Gaussian S transform over traditional S transform is tested on a real land seismic data example. The performance shows that the enhanced temporal resolution can help us depict more clearly the edge of the hydrocarbon reservoir, especially when the thickness of the reservoir is small (such as the thin beds).",

            "abstract": "Here, we investigate the outcome of collisions between icy-rocky planetary embryos with strength. In the inner solar system, impacts between embryos are hypothesized to generate crustal dichotomies on global scales, e.g., the Borealis Basin on Mars. In the Kuiper Belt, such global scale collisions differ from the inner solar system in important ways. First, bodies are less massive and their mutual collision velocities are smaller in amplitude compared to the inner solar system. As a result, the amount of direct shock heating is small and very localized. Strength is an important factor because shear heating is a process that can deposit energy more deeply into the final body. With a small gravitational potential, the post impact shape of the body may exhibit features related to residual strength. The variety of possible post-impact structures depends on the pre-impact thermal state and level of differentiation of the silicate-ice mixture and impact conditions. Here, we focus on collisions scenarios proposed for the origin of the Pluto system using the CTH shock physics code. We report on the magnitude of thermal processing and residual strength for varying assumptions about initial conditions.",

            "abstract": "Proper agricultural land management is essential for securing food supply and minimizing damage to the environment. Among available farming practices, relay strip intercropping and fertilizer application are commonly used, but to study their wider environmental implications and possible feedbacks we require an Earth system modeling framework. In this study, the effectiveness of a maize-soybean relay strip intercropping system and fertilizer reduction is investigated using a multi-model method. The DNDC (DeNitrification-DeComposition) model is used to simulate agricultural activities and their impacts on the environment through nitrogen emissions and changes in soil chemical composition. Crop yield, soil nutrient content and nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere in major agricultural regions of China are predicted under various cultivation scenarios. The GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model is then used to estimate the effects on downwind particle and ozone air pollution. We show that relay strip intercropping and optimal fertilization not only improve crop productivity, but also retain soil nutrients, reduce ammonia emission and mitigate downwind air pollution. By cutting 25% fertilization inputs but cultivating maize and soybean together in a relay strip intercropping system used with field studies, total crop production was improved slightly by 4.4% compared to monoculture with conventional amount of fertilizers. NH3 volatilization decreases by 29%, equivalent to saving the pollution-induced health damage costs by about US$2.5 billion per year. The possible feedback effects from atmospheric nitrogen deposition onto the croplands are also investigated. We show that careful management and better quantitative understanding of alternative farming practices hold huge potential in simultaneously addressing different global change issues including the food crisis, air pollution and climate change, and calls for greater collaboration between scientists, farmers and policy makers concerning these issues.",

The obtained lithosphere structure confirms previously imaged features in the CEUS, e.g., the low seismic velocity signature of Proterozoic to Cambrian fossil rifts, the very low velocity at >150 km depth below an Eocene volcanic center in northwestern Virginia, and the very low velocity along a corridor stretching from eastern New York to New Hampshire. The model also reveals new features. The high-velocity Granite-Rhyolite Province sharply bounds the Grenville front at mid-lithosphere depth, suggesting that it acted as a backstop during the Grenville orogeny ca. 1.2 - 1.0 Ga. High-velocity mantle extending ∼ 200 km deep stretches from the Archean Superior Craton well into the Proterozoic terrains (Granite-Rhyolite, Mazatzal and Yavapai provinces). This is consistent with independent seismic velocity images and suggests that the thickness of Proterozoic lithosphere is generally ∼ 200 km. A deep low-velocity zone in central Texas is associated with the late Cretaceous Travis and Uvalde volcanic fields, and a similar deep low-velocity zone is located beneath the South Georgia Rift, which contains Jurassic basalts associated with the Central Atlantic magmatic province. Hotspot tracks may be associated with several of the low-velocity zones, and the central Texas, New York-New Hampshire, and southern Georgia zones may also be associated with the former rifted Laurentia margin. This suggests a systematic pattern whereby transient mantle thermal perturbations are accentuated near former failed rifts or rift margins.",

            "abstract": "Mineral dust is important for climate because it alters the radiation budget, both directly by scattering sunlight and indirectly by influencing cloud processes. Studies have shown that the variability of dust emission is greatly affected by local wind speeds and land surface characteristics. Globally, land cover change is mainly driven by vegetation changes that modify the dust sources, which can be represented by changes in leaf area index (LAI), and its effect on East Asian dust emission under the backdrop of changing wind patterns has yet to be quantified. Here we present a study to investigate how climate and land cover changes might have modified dust emission in East Asia during 1982-2010 using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. New developments include a dynamic geomorphology-dependent dust emission scheme and better representation of vegetation effect on surface roughness and threshold wind speed. We also implement subgrid wind variability to reduce the resolution dependence of the model. The bias of modeled total aerosol optical depth (AOD) relative to observations is reduced from about -86% to -14%, mostly due to the inclusion of subgrid wind variability, but up to 10% of the emission improvements stem from the revised vegetation dependence. Simulations suggest that about 45 Tg, ~9% of the global dust emission, is from East Asia in spring. Sensitivity studies with changing historical LAI vs. surface wind show that climate variability might be a more important factor than land cover change contributing to dust emission variability and trends over the past 30 years.",

            "abstract": "Despite extensive efforts on characterizing organic nitrogen (ON) compounds in atmospheric aerosols and aqueous droplets, knowledge of ON chemistry is still limited, mainly due to its chemical complexity and lack of highly time-resolved measurements. This work is aimed at optimizing the method of using Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS) to characterize ON compounds in atmospheric aerosols. Seventy-five pure nitrogen-containing organic compounds covering a variety of functional groups were analyzed with the HR-AMS. Our results show that ON compounds commonly produce NHx+, NOx+, which are usually attributed to inorganic N species such as ammonium and nitrate, and CH2N+ at m/z = 28, which is rarely quantified in ambient aerosol due to large interference from N2+ in the air signal. As a result, using the nitrogen-to-carbon (N/C) calibration factor proposed by Aiken et al. (2008) on average leads to ~ 20% underestimation of N/C in ambient organic aerosol. A new calibration factor of 0.79 is proposed for determining the average N/C in organics. The relative ionization efficiencies (RIEs) of different ON species, on average, are found to be consistent with the default RIE value (1.4) for the total organics. The AMS mass spectral features of various types of ON species (amines, amides, amino acids, etc.) are examined and used for characterizing ON composition in ambient aerosols. Our results indicate that submicron organic aerosol measured during wintertime in Fresno, CA contains significant amounts of amino-compounds whereas more diversified ON species, including N-containing aromatic heterocycle (e.g., imidazoles), are observed in fog waters collected simultaneously. Our findings have important implications for understanding atmospheric ON behaviors via the widespread HR-AMS measurements of ambient aerosols and droplets.",

            "abstract": "An important application of the atmospheric surface layer research is to characterize the near surface vertical gradients in temperature and humidity in order to predict radar and radio communication conditions in the environment. In this presentation, we will give an overview of a new research initiative funded under the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Multi-University Research Initiative (MURI): the Coupled Air-Sea Processes and EM Ducting Research (CASPER). The objective is to fully characterize the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) as an electromagnetic (EM) propagation environment with the emphasis of spatial and temporal heterogeneities and surface wave/swell effects, both of which contravene the underlying assumptions of Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) used in coupled environmental forecast models. Furthermore, coastal variability in the inversion atop the MABL presents a challenge to forecast models and also causes practical issues in EM prediction models. These issues are the target of investigation of CASPER.\nCASPER measurement component includes two major field campaigns: CASPER-East (2015 Duck, NC) and CASPER-West (2018 southern California). This presentation will show the extensive measurements to be made during the CASPER -East field campaign with the focus on the marine atmospheric surface layer measurements with two research vessels, two research aircraft, surface flux buoy, wave gliders, ocean gliders, tethered balloons, and rawinsondes. Unlike previous research on the marine surface layer with the focus on surface fluxes and surface flux parameterization, CASPER field campaigns also emphasize of the surface layer profiles and the validation of the surface layer flux-profile relationship originally derived over land surfaces. Results from CASPER pilot experiment and preliminary results from CASPER-East field campaign will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The PTWC functions not only as official international tsunami warning center (TWC) for nations with coasts around the Pacific rim, the Caribbean, and other regions of the world, but also as the local TWC for the State of Hawaii. The PTWC began sending local tsunami messages to HI-EMA only since September, 2003. As part of its routine operations, the PTWC strives to send a local tsunami message product for any Hawaii earthquake with a 4.0 magnitude or larger within five minutes of origin time. To evaluate PTWC's performance in that regard, however, we must first compile a suitable local tsunami bulletins' database. For this purpose, we scanned all the available logs for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) communications' circuit between 2003 and 2015 and retrieved 104 local bulletins. We parsed these bulletins and extracted the parametric data needed to evaluate PTWC's performance in terms of essential statistics such as message delay time, epicenter offsets, and magnitude residuals as compared with more authoritative earthquake source parametrizations. To that end, we cross-validated 88 of these seismic events having magnitudes between 2.8 and 6.7 with the corresponding source parameters obtained from the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) and the National Earthquake Information Center's (NEIC) online catalog. Analysis of events with magnitude 4.0 or larger gives a median message delay time of 3 minutes and 33 seconds, a median epicentral offset of 3.2 km, and a median magnitude residual of 0.2 unit. Several message delay outliers exist due to the fact that PTWC has sent local tsunami information statements (TIS) for felt events with magnitudes as small as 2.8 located west of the Big Island. Routine use of a synthetic Wood-Anderson magnitude since the end of 2012 appears to have brought consistency to PTWC's local magnitude estimates and a reduction in the message delays. Station site corrections, a refined attenuation model, and optimization of the peak-amplitude search window may improve magnitude estimates. Improved dissemination software, regional moment tensor determinations for rapid magnitude estimation in addition to ML and Mwp can result in yet faster and more accurate tsunami message products.",

            "abstract": "Carbon budget of terrestrial ecosystems is one of the most crucial themes in ecosystem sciences under current and future climate changes as it would affect our Earth system. Remote sensing and modeling analysis studies from continental to global scales have been indicating that the recent climate change is influential to photosynthetic processes in terrestrial vegetation such as forests and grasslands, by altering phenology (seasonal change) and foliage biomass. In addition, increasing temperature and possibly changing photosynthetic activities of plants are influential to soil carbon dynamics. Our deeper and broader understandings on such photosynthetic and respiratory processes governing carbon cycle and hence budget of terrestrial ecosystems are critical to detect the changes of ecosystem processes and the functions in changing environments, as they would influence the biodiversity, ecosystem services and Earth system.\nIn order to reveal the nature of temporal changes in photosynthetic and respiratory processes in forest ecosystems, we have been conducting multi-disciplinary observations of ecophysiological and optical properties for canopy photosynthesis in a cool-temperate deciduous forest since 2003 (“Takayama site”, contributing to AsiaFlux and JaLTER). In addition, open-field warming experiments have been conducted since 2011 to examine the possible influence of near-future warming condition on forest canopy photosynthesis and soil respiration. (1) Our long-term measurements of leaf and canopy photosynthesis revealed that their phenology is influenced by inter-annual variation of micrometeorological conditions. (2) Combined analysis of leaf-canopy photosynthesis and optical properties enabled us to estimate the forest photosynthetic productivity at regional scale by satellite data. (3) Open-field warming experiments suggested that tree foliage and soil processes would acclimate to near-future warming conditions.",

Six students from Virginia State University, three students from Delaware State University and faculty advisors were hosted by the University of Hawai‘i at Hilo (UHH) Department of Marine Science. This partnership provided integrated, cohesive, and innovative education and research capabilities to minority students on climate change science. Activities included a summer course, instrumentation training, field and laboratory research training, sampling, data collection, logging, analysis, interpretation, report preparation, and research presentation. Most training activities used samples collected during students’ field sampling in Hilo Bay. Water quality and phytoplankton data were collected along a 220 degree line transect from the mouth of the Wailuku River to the pelagic zone outside of Hilo Bay into the Pacific Ocean to a distance of 15.5 km. Water clarity, turbidity, chlorophyll, physical water quality parameters, and atmospheric CO2 levels were measured along the transect. Phytoplankton samples were collected for analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Flow Cytometry. Data showed the extent of anthropogenic activity on water quality, with implications for food web dynamics. In addition, atmospheric CO2  concentration, island vegetation, and GPS points were recorded throughout the island of Hawai‘i to investigate how variations in microclimate, elevation, and land development affect the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, vegetation, and water quality. Water quality results at locations near rivers were completely different from other study sites, requiring students’ critical thinking skills to find possible reasons for the difference. Our data show a correlation between population density and CO2 concentrations. Anthropogenic activities affecting CO2 and ocean conditions in Hawaiian microclimates can potentially have deleterious effects on the life that call these areas home.",

            "abstract": "In order to provide fundamental information for exploration and related scientific research on the Moon and other planets, we propose a new automatic method to recognize craters on the lunar surface based on contour data extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM). First, we mapped 16-bits DEM to 256 gray scales for data compression, then for the purposes of better visualization, the grayscale is converted into RGB image. After that, a median filter is applied twice to DEM for data optimization, which produced smooth, continuous outlines for subsequent construction of contour plane. Considering the fact that the morphology of crater on contour plane can be approximately expressed as an ellipse or circle, we extract the outer boundaries of contour plane with the same color(gray value) as targets for further identification though a 8- neighborhood counterclockwise searching method. Then, A library of training samples is constructed based on above targets calculated from some sample DEM data, from which real crater targets are labeled as positive samples manually, and non-crater objects are labeled as negative ones. Some morphological feathers are calculated for all these samples, which are major axis (L), circumference(C), area inside the boundary(S), and radius of the largest inscribed circle(R). We use R/L, R/S, C/L, C/S, R/C, S/L as the key factors for identifying craters, and apply Fisher discrimination method on the sample library to calculate the weight of each factor and determine the discrimination formula, which is then applied to DEM data for identifying lunar craters. The method has been tested and verified with DEM data from CE-1 and CE-2, showing strong recognition ability and robustness and is applicable for the recognition of craters with various diameters and significant morphological differences, making fast and accurate automatic crater recognition possible.",

            "abstract": "As hydrocarbon extraction techniques that generate large volumes of wastewater have come into widespread use in the central United States, increased volumes have been injected into deep disposal wells, with a corresponding dramatic increase in seismicity rates. South-central Kansas is of particular scientific interest because fluid injection rates have recently increased due to renewed gas and oil production from the Mississippi Lime Play, and the local seismicity is being monitored with a seismometer network deployed by the USGS. In addition, since only a small percentage of injection wells seem to induce seismicity, it is important to characterize contributing factors.\nWe have developed groundwater flow models using MODFLOW-USG to (1) assess hydrogeologic conditions under which seismicity may be triggered, for cases in which wastewater is injected into sedimentary strata overlying fractured crystalline basement rock and to (2) explore the possible relationship between wastewater injection and the November 2014 M 4.8 Milan, Kansas earthquake. The USG version of MODFLOW allows us to use unstructured meshes, which vastly reduces computation time while allowing dense meshing near injection wells and faults. Our single-well test model has been benchmarked to published models (Zhang et al., 2013) and will be used to evaluate sensitivity pore pressures and stresses to model parameters. Our south Kansas model represents high-rate injection wells, as well as oil and gas wells producing from the Arbuckle and overlying Mississippian formations in a 40-km square region. Based on modeled pore pressure and stress changes along the target fault, we will identify conditions that would be consistent with inducing an earthquake at the Milan hypocenter. Parameters to be varied include hydraulic properties of sedimentary rock units, crystalline basement and the fault zone, as well as the (poorly resolved) Milan earthquake hypocenter depth.",

            "abstract": "The alpine critical zone is affected by various inputs, storages, pathways, and outputs. Unfortunately, many of these processes distribute the pollutants beyond the immediate area and into the surrounding biological and anthropogenic communities. Years of mining and improper disposal of the tailings and acid-mine drainage have degraded the quality of surface water within the San Juan Mountains. However, mining may not be the only factor significantly affecting the surface water quality in this high-elevation environment. As a high elevation system, this area is a fragile ecosystem with inputs ranging from local mining to atmospheric transport and deposition. Studies from around the world have shown atmospheric transport and deposition affect high-elevation systems. Thus, a significant question arises: does elevation or aspect affect the volume and rate of atmospheric deposition of pollutants? We assume atmospheric deposition occurs on the slopes in addition to in streams, lakes, and ponds. Deposition on slopes can be transported to nearby surface waters and increase the impact of the atmospheric pollutants along with residence time. Atmospheric deposition data were collected for aluminum, iron, manganese, nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate. Water chemistry data were collected for the same constituents as the atmospheric deposition with the addition of temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and specific conductance. Deposition samples were collected on a five-day sampling regime during two summers. Water quality samples were collected in-stream adjacent to the deposition-ample collectors. Collection sites were located on opposite sides of Red Mountain at five equal elevations providing two different aspects. The north side is drained by Red Mountain Creek and the south side is drained by Mineral Creek. Differences in atmospheric deposition and water quality at different elevations and aspects suggest there is a relationship between aspect and elevation on atmospheric pollution deposition. It is suggested that degradation of water quality in the San Juan Mountains is affected by atmospheric deposition along with the damage sustained from local mining activities. These results facilitate a better understanding of this high-elevation critical-zone system.",

            "abstract": "Most of Earth’s surface is created by seafloor spreading. While most seafloor spreading is orthogonal, that is, the strike of mid-ocean ridge segments is perpendicular to nearby transform faults, examples of significant non-orthogonality have been noted since the 1970s, in particular in regions of slow seafloor spreading such as the western Gulf of Aden with non-orthogonality up to 45°. In contrast, here we focus on fast and ultra-fast seafloor spreading along the East Pacific Rise.\nTo estimate non-orthogonality, we compare ridge-segment strikes with the direction of plate motion determined from the angular velocity that best fits all the data along the boundary of a single plate pair [DeMets et al., 2010]. The advantages of this approach include greater accuracy and the ability to estimate non-orthogonality where there are no nearby transform faults. Estimating the strikes of fast-spreading mid-ocean ridge segments present several challenges as non-transform offsets on various scales affect the estimate of the strike.\nWhile spreading is orthogonal or nearly orthogonal along much of the East Pacific Rise, some ridge segments along the Pacific-Nazca boundary near 30°S and near 16°S−22°S deviate from orthogonality by as much as 6°−12° even when we exclude the portions of mid-ocean ridge segments involved in overlapping spreading centers. Thus modest but significant non-orthogonality occurs where seafloor spreading is the fastest on the planet.\nIf a plume lies near the ridge segment, we assume it contributes to magma overpressure along the ridge segment [Abelson & Agnon, 1997]. We further assume that the contribution to magma overpressure is proportional to the buoyancy flux of the plume [Sleep, 1990] and inversely proportional to the distance between the mid-ocean ridge segment and a given plume. We find that the non-orthogonal angle tends to decrease with increasing spreading rate and with increasing distance between ridge segment and plume.",

            "abstract": "Northern peatlands are projected to become very important in future carbon-climate feedback due to their large carbon storage and vulnerability to changes in hydrology and climate impacts. Understanding the hydrology and biogeochemistry is a fundamental task for projecting the fate of massive carbon stores in these systems under future climate change. Models have started to address microtopographic controls on peatland hydrology, but none have considered a prognostic calculation of water table dynamics in vegetated peatlands rather than prescribed regional water tables. We introduced here a new configuration of the Community Land Model (CLM), which includes a fully prognostic water table calculation between hummock and hollow microtopography in a vegetated peatland. We further integrated the hydrology treatment with vertically structured soil organic matter pools, and a newly developed microbial functional group-based methane module. The model was further used to test against observational data obtained within Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change (SPRUCE) project. Results for water table dynamic, carbon profile, and land surface fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane were reasonable. Model simulations showed that warming and elevated CO2 had significant impacts on land surface fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide. The warming-induced hydrological changes are another factors influencing biogeochemistry along soil profiles and land surface gas fluxes. These preliminary results provide some insights for field experiments as well as data-model comparison in next phase of the SPRUCE project.",

            "abstract": "Scarcity of spatially- and temporally-continuous observations of precipitation and snowpack conditions in\nremote mountain watersheds results in fundamental limitations in water supply forecasting. These limitations\nin observational capabilities can result in strong biases in total snowmelt-driven runoff amount, the elevational distribution of runoff, river basin tributary contributions to total basin runoff and, equally important for water management, the timing of runoff. The Upper Rio Grande River basin in Colorado and New Mexico is one basin where observational deficiencies are hypothesized to have significant adverse impacts on estimates of snowpack melt-out rates and on water supply forecasts. We present findings from a coordinated observational-modeling study within Upper Rio Grande River basin whose aim was to quanitfy the impact enhanced precipitation, meteorological and snowpack measurements on the simulation and prediction of snowmelt driven streamflow. The Rio Grande SNOwpack and streamFLOW (RIO-SNO-FLOW) Prediction Project conducted enhanced observing activities during the 2014-2015 water year. Measurements from a gap-filling, polarimetric radar (NOXP) and in-situ meteorological and snowpack measurement stations were assimilated into the WRF-Hydro modeling framework to provide continuous analyses of snowpack and streamflow conditions. Airborne lidar estimates of snowpack conditions from the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory during mid-April and mid-May were used as additional independent validations against the various model simulations and forecasts of snowpack conditions during the melt-out season. Uncalibrated WRF-Hydro model performance from simulations and forecasts driven by enhanced observational analyses were compared against results driven by currently operational data inputs. Precipitation estimates from the NOXP research radar validate significantly better against independent in situ observations of precipitation and snow-pack increases. Correcting the operational NLDAS2 forcing data with the experimental observations led to significant improvements in the seasonal accumulation and ablation of mountain snowpack and ultimately led to marked improvement in model simulated streamflow as compared with streamflow observations.",

            "abstract": "Tree ring samples were collected from Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum) species in watersheds adjacent to the Choctawhatchee River (Alabama and Florida - USA). These samples were collected to update an existing tree ring proxy that was developed in the late 1980's and early 1990's (Stahle and Cleaveland, 1992, IGBP PAGES/World Data Center for Paleoclimatology Data Contribution # FL001, Choctawhatchee River. NOAA/NCDC Paleoclimatology Program, Boulder, Colorado, USA). The motivation for updating the tree ring proxy was to determine if recent droughts identified in historic unimpaired Choctawhatchee River streamflow records were reflected in Bald Cypress tree ring growth. Historic streamflow from 1934 to 2013 was obtained for the USGS station at Newton, Alabama and one, five and ten-year droughts were identified and ranked. Many of the most severe droughts were identified in recent (~2000 to present) records (see Figure). Combining the new tree ring proxy with other regional proxies, seasonal streamflow was reconstructed for the Choctawhatchee River Newton, Alabama gage. The reconstructed streamflow allows water managers and planners to observe past wet and dry periods that may exceed magnitude, duration and/or severity of wet and dry periods in observed records. ",

            "abstract": "Several sediment ridges (SRs) are located on the continental slope and rise off the Prydz Bay margin, East Antarctica. These SRs contain the history of the regional glacial movements and bottom current activities. Multichannel seismic reflection data and bathymetric data in this region have been interpreted to know the planar distribution, cross-section structures along strike, and the formation and development processes of the SRs. Based on the above work, two different groups of the SRs have been identified. The first one includes two SRs which were asymmetric levees on both sides of the Wild Canyon in the western part of the study area. The second one includes SRs in the eastern part of the study area whose formation and development are closely related to the local, diachronous hiatuses generated by the turbidity flow. The onset time of the turbidity activities in different canyons are not concurrent. For Wild Canyon in the west, the onset time is P1, which is the base of the glaciomarine deposit on the continental rise, while for Wilkins and Murray Canyon in the east, it is a later time P3 (~26.1 Ma), which represents an expansion of the glaciers in Prydz Bay area. All the canyons and the turbidity currents within them both extend seaward with time and so does the consequent SRs. In the areas north of the seaward edge of the SRs, large deep-sea sediment waves consisting of fine-grain sediments supplied mainly by down-slope turbidity currents were generated under westward-flowing bottom currents.",

An approach for deriving volumetric soil moisture using satellite passive microwave radiometry from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometers AMSR-E and AMSR2 was developed in this study. The algorithm adopts a weighted averaging strategy for soil moisture estimation based on a dynamic selection of empirically determined vegetation single-scatter albedo values. The resulting soil moisture retrievals demonstrate more realistic global patterns and seasonal dynamics relative to the baseline University of Montana (UMT) soil moisture product. Quantitative analysis of the new approach against in situ soil moisture measurements over four global study regions also indicates significant improvement over the baseline algorithm, with coefficients of determination (R2) between the retrievals and in-situ measurements increasing by approximately 16.9% and 41.5% respectively; and bias-corrected RMSEs decreasing by about 25.0% and 38.2% for respective ascending and descending orbital data records.

            "abstract": "Dehydration process within the subducting oceanic plate and expelled water from there affect various subduction-zone processes, including arc volcanism and generation of earthquakes. This implies that the degree of hydration within the incoming oceanic plate just prior to subduction might be a key control factor on the regional variations in subduction zone processes like interplate earthquakes and arc volcanism. \nRecent advances in seismic structure studies in the trench-outer rise region of the Japan Trench have revealed that seismic velocities within the incoming oceanic plate become lower owing to the plate bending-related faulting, suggesting the hydration of the oceanic plate. If the degree of the oceanic plate hydration is one of key factors controlling the regional variations of the interplate earthquakes, the degree of the oceanic plate hydration just prior to subduction is expected to show the along-trench variation because the interplate seismicity in the forearc region of the Japan Trench show along-trench variations. However, we cannot discuss the along-trench variation of the incoming plate structure because seismic structure studies have been confined only to the northern Japan Trench so far.\nIn 2014 and 2015, JAMSTEC and GEOMAR conducted wide-angle seismic surveys in the trench-outer rise region of the central Japan Trench to reveal the detailed seismic structure of the incoming oceanic plate. The western extension of our survey line corresponds to the epicenter of the 2011 M9 Tohoku earthquakes. We deployed 88 Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBSs) at intervals of 6 km and shot a tuned air-gun array of R/V Kairei at 200 m spacing. \nIn this presentation, we will show the overview of our seismic survey and present seismic structure models obtained by the data of mainly 2014 seismic survey together with the several OBS data from 2015 survey. The preliminary results show P-wave velocity (Vp) within the oceanic crust and mantle decreases toward the trench axis beneath the area of well-developed horst and graben structure. In addition, we found a low velocity oceanic crust area which is probably not related to plate bending-related faulting, and not observed in the trench-outer rise region of the northern Japan Trench.",

            "abstract": "Decisions to manage the risks of climate change hinge, among many other things, on deeply uncertain and imperfect climate projections. Improving the decision relevance and utility of climate projections requires navigating a trade-off between increasing the physical realism of the model (often by improving the spatial resolution) and increasing the representation of decision-relevant uncertainties. This talk will examine the decision-relevance and utility of alternative ensembles of climate information by comparing two decision support applications, in water management and biodiversity perseveration, both in California. The climate ensembles will consist of different combinations of high and medium resolution projections from NARCCAP (North American Regional Climate Assessment Program) as well as low resolution, but more numerous, projections from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles. The decision support applications will use the same ensembles of climate projections in different contexts. Workshops with decision makers examine the extent to which the different ensembles lead to different decisions, the extent to which considering a wider range of uncertainty affects decisions, the extent to which decision makers' confidence in the projections and the decisions based on them will be sensitive to the resolution at which they are communicated and the resolution dependent skill, and how the answers to these questions varies with the water management and biodiversity contexts. This study aims to provide empirical evidence to support judgments on how best to use uncertainty climate information in water management and other decision support applications.",

            "abstract": "The evidences of climate changes during the Quaternary are abundant but the physical mechanisms behind the climate transitions are controversial. The theory of Milankovitch takes into account the periodic orbital variations and the solar radiation received by the Earth as the main explanation for the glacial-interglacial cycles. However, some gaps in the theory still remain. In this study, we propose elucidating some of these gaps by approaching the Equatorial Pacific Ocean as a large oscillator, capable of triggering climate changes in different temporal scales. A mathematical model representing El Ninõ-like phenomena, based on Duffing equation and modulated by the astronomical cycle of 100 ka, was used to simulate the variability of the equatorial Pacific climate system over the last 2 Ma. The physical configuration of the Pacific Ocean, expressed in the equation, explains the temporal limit of the glacial-interglacial cycles. According to the simulation results, consistent with paleoclimate records, the amplification of the effects of the gradual variation of the Earth's orbit eccentricity - another unclear question - is due to the feedback mechanism of the Pacific ocean-atmosphere system, which responds non-linearly to small variations in insolation forcing and determines the ENSO-like phase (warm or cold) at different time scales and different intensities. The approach proposed here takes into account that the abrupt transitions between the ENSO-like phases, and the consequent changes in the sea surface temperature (SST) along the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, produce reactions that act as secondary causes of the temperature fluctuations that result in a glaciation (or deglaciation) - as the drastic change on the rate of evaporation/precipitation around the globe, and the increase (or decrease) of the atmospheric CO2 absorption by the phytoplankton. The transitional behavior between the warm and the cold phases, according to the presented model, is enhanced as the rate of SST variation increases.",

            "abstract": "The rupture process of the 2011 Off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku earthquake (Mw 9.0) showed smooth rupture and large slip on the shallow parts of the inter-plate mega-thrust fault, close to the trench. While a number of studies have been carried out to understand the mechanisms that generate such feature, some points remain to be clarified.\nIn order to understand the mechanism to produce the huge slip with smoother rupture on the shallow parts of faults, we have carried out dynamic rupture simulations (Tsuda et al., 2015) based on the 3D spectral element method (Galvez et al., 2014). Our model assumed very simple ingredients, such as a homogeneous elastic medium, a planar fault, slip-weakening friction, a large ‘locked area’ (100 km along strike x 75 km along dip) with high stress drop (around 8 MPa) around 15 km deep and a relatively small (100 km along strike x 25 km along dip) dynamic ‘weakening area’ with very small dynamic friction coefficients (e.g. Ujiie et al., 2013) above the locked area. This model produced large shallow slip. The resulting slip distribution as a function of depth coincided with the results by Sun et al. (2015) based on bathymetry differences before and after the earthquake rupture.\nIn this study, we extend these previous dynamic rupture simulations to further investigate the behavior of the shallow parts of mega-thrust faults. We studied the effect of the along-dip size of the locked area and weakening area. We also added a small area with very high stress drop (around 20 MPa) representing the strong motion generation area (SMGA) on the deeper part of the fault, where short-period seismic waves are dominantly radiated. The results of the simulations indicate that the balance of the size between locked area and weakening area plays an important role and the existence of a SMGA can enhance slip on the shallow parts of mega-thrust faults.",

MBARI AUV surveys and ROV dives in 2012 and 2015 discovered 7 hydrothermal vent sites with diverse and varied vent communities within that gap. One field in the Pescadero Basin vents clear shimmering fluids at 3685 m depth and four vigorous black smoker fields and several extinct chimney fields are between 2225 and 2400 m depth on the Alarcón Rise. Low-temperature vent sites are present on both of the Pescadero and Tamayo Transforms. The chimneys were discovered in 1-m resolution AUV bathymetric data, with some indicated to be active based on temperature anomalies in the AUV CTD data and confirmed during later ROV dives. The low-temperature vent sites on the transform faults were found on ROV dives while exploring young lava flows and sediment hills uplifted by sill intrusions.\nPescadero Basin is a deep extensional basin in the southern Gulf. The smooth, subtly faulted floor is filled with at least 150 m of sediment, as determined from sub-bottom profiles collected by the AUV. Three large chimneys (named Auka by our Mexican collaborators) and several broad mounds are located on the SW margin of the basin. Temperatures to 290°C were measured, the fluids are clear, neutral pH, and contain elevated Na. The chimneys are delicate, white, predominantly Ca-carbonate; barite, sparse sulfides, and some aromatic hydrocarbons are also present.\nThree active vent fields (Ja Sít, Pericú, and Meyibó) at Alarcón Rise are located near the eruptive fissure of an extensive young sheet flow. The fourth field (Tzab-ek) is 1.1 km NW of the axis on older pillow lavas. The largest chimneys are in the Tzab-ek field: 31 and 33 m tall, with flanges and upside-down waterfalls. They rise from a sulfide mound, suggesting a long-lived hydrothermal system, in contrast to the near-axis fields where the chimneys grow directly on basalt. The Alarcón chimneys are Zn and Cu-rich sulfides. The fluids are acidic, with elevated Na and temperatures of 330-359°C.",

The CO2 flux in 2014-2015 compared to the 2007-2008 data (Mazot et al., 2011, BV, 73: 423-441) increased almost one order of magnitude (from ~ 140 ton d-1 in 2008 to ~ 840 ton d-1 in 2014). During the last two years the lake became the largest for the whole time of observations with the maximum surface area more than 18 ha covering completely the NE fumarolic field and all thermal springs feeding the lake with mineralized water. Despite the maximum volume of the lake it was characterized in 2015 by the highest since 2007 chloride content (~2500 ppm) and temperature (34°C). A large degassing spot in the middle of the lake for the first time was observed in April 2015 with more than 10,000 g m-2 d-1 of the CO2 flux.

            "abstract": "In Guerrero, Mexico, tremors and low frequency earthquakes have been observed to occur simultaneously, in the subduction interface, downdip where large slow slip events occur. To better understand the mechanism of tremors in Guerrero, we focus on the detection and mechanism estimation of very low frequency (VLF) earthquakes. Following the method of Ide and Yabe [2014], we first locate tectonic tremor (TT) by the envelope cross-correlation method [Obara, 2002]. Then, waveforms are stacked, in the VLF band between 0.02 and 0.05 Hz, at the time of occurrence of tremors. Finally, the stacked waveforms are inverted to better estimate the depth of these events and their moment tensor. This analysis is carried out for the periods of 2005-2007 and 2009-2013, at the time where two temporary networks were operating; the MASE and G-GAP network respectively. In addition, permanent broadband stations of the Servicio Seismológico Nacional (Mexico) are used. Our results show that the VLF sources are located at or close to the plate interface. These events have magnitudes of about 3 and very low-angle thrust mechanism in agreement with both the geometry of the nearly horizontal subduction interface and TT location determined with an independent technique, namely the Tremor Energy and Polarization (TREP) method. The slip directions of VLF earthquakes and TT are also consistent with the plates convergence vector. The MASE data from the first time period allows detection of VLF earthquakes in two different locations, the transient zone and “Sweet Spot” [Husker, 2012] but with similar mechanisms while the second dataset (G-GAP) gives more precise location in the main cluster (the “Sweet Spot”). In addition, some clear VLF signals are detected without any stacking. These events occur at the same time and areas as the TT thus suggesting a common origin of the two phenomena.",

            "abstract": "Fault motion has been estimated by diffusion pattern of frictional heating recorded in geology (e.g., Fulton et al., 2012). The same record in deeper subduction plate interface can be observed from micro-faults in an exhumed accretionary complex. In this study, we focused on a micro-fault within the Cretaceous Shimanto Belt, SW Japan to estimate fault motion from the frictional heating diffusion pattern.\nA carbonaceous material concentrated layer (CMCL) with ~2m of thickness is observed in study area. Some micro-faults cut the CMCL. Thickness of a fault is about 3.7mm. Injection veins and dilatant fractures were observed in thin sections, suggesting that the high fluid pressure was existed. Samples with 10cm long were collected to measure distribution of vitrinite reflectance (Ro) as a function of distance from the center of micro-fault. Ro of host rock was ~1.0%. Diffusion pattern was detected decreasing in Ro from ~1.2%-~1.1%. Characteristic diffusion distance is ~4-~9cm.\nWe conducted grid search to find the optimal frictional heat generation per unit area (Q, the product of friction coefficient, normal stress and slip velocity) and slip duration (t) to fit the diffusion pattern. Thermal diffusivity (0.98*10-8m2/s) and thermal conductivity (2.0 W/mK) were measured. In the result, 2000-2500J/m2 of Q and 63000-126000s of t were estimated.\nMoment magnitudes (M0) of slow earthquakes (slow EQs) follow a scaling law with slip duration and its dimension is different from that for normal earthquakes (normal EQ) (Ide et al., 2007). The slip duration estimated in this study (~104-~105s) consistent with 4-5 of M0, never fit to the scaling law for normal EQ. Heat generation can be inverted from 4-5 of M0, corresponding with ~108-~1011J, which is consistent with rupture area of 105-108m2 in this study. The comparisons in heat generation and slip duration between geological measurements and geophysical remote observations give us the estimation of rupture area, M0, and earthquake style, for non-active geological records.",

            "abstract": "Lakes are widely distributed on the Mongolian Plateau and as critical water sources have sustained Mongolian pastures for hundreds of years. However, the plateau has experienced significant lake shrinkage and grassland degradation during the past several decades. To quantify the changes in all the lakes on the plateau and the associated driving factors, we performed a satellite-based survey using multi-temporal Landsat images from the 1970s to 2000s, combining with ground-based censuses. Our results document a rapid loss of lakes on the plateau in the past decades: the number of lakes with a water surface area >1 km2 decreased from 785 in the late 1980s to 577 in 2010, with a greater rate of decrease (34.0%) in Inner Mongolia of China than in Mongolia (17.6%). This decrease has been particularly pronounced since the late 1990s in Inner Mongolia and the number of lakes >10 km2 has declined by 30.0%. The statistical analyses suggested that in Mongolia precipitation was the dominant driver for the lake changes, while in Inner Mongolia coal mining was most important in its grassland area and irrigation was the leading factor in its cultivated area. The deterioration of lakes is expected to continue in the following decades not only because of changing climate but also increasing exploitation of underground mineral and groundwater resources on the plateau. To protect grasslands and the indigenous nomads, effective action is urgently required to save these valuable lakes from further deterioration.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) is one of the principle factors that have significant influence on global climate variability. Due to large mass and great thermal capacity of the oceans, oceanic conditions change relatively slowly and dominant patterns are thus easy to detect. Most of the current research on SSTA make use of PCA methods like EOF or SVD. Though such methods are effective in reducing dimensions, it is always hard to give a physical interpretation of the results and difficult to distinguish the minor eigenvectors from noises. Instead of finding patterns, we put forward a framework for the direct prediction of SSTAs, using a sparse approximation method, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), to reduce the noises in global SST observation. Global SSTA time series in 5°×5° resolution were used to fit each target SSTA vector and the lasso method was utilized to avoid over-fitting. Taking the Nino 3.4 Index as an example, the predictability of the lasso model was studied and the results showed a relatively satisfying prediction skill in terms of correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error compared with the results obtained from LDEO 5. Moreover, by taking other climate variables into consideration, we discovered a stable relation between the Nino 3.4 Index and the sea-ice extent anomaly in South Pole at a lead time of around 2 years. In addition, the bootstrapping method was used to resample the coefficients in the sparse regression model so that we could study their statistical property. 14 regressors were reserved suggesting 10 potential indices which have relatively strong relations with the Nino 3.4 Index. Some of the potential indices corresponded well to known climate indices while the rest indicated an undiscovered index in tropical oceans of eastern South America. In conclusion, the lasso method approved its feasibility in climate prediction at a relatively low computation cost, and its potential to discover climate indices from the sparsified results.",

            "abstract": "Although established procedures for treatment of point sources have been available for the last fifty years, effective and efficient management procedures for reducing non-point source pollution are still being developed. One of the reasons for the slow development is that the various management practices need to be tailored to the landscape in order to be optimal. Water quality simulation models for watersheds would be ideal for designing these effective practices but in many cases are only validated at the watershed outlet where the monitored data are available which does not guarantee that the spatial distribution of runoff and pollution sources inside the watershed are simulated correctly. Especially, in rural, humid regions where runoff is associated with saturation-excess processes from variable source areas our modeling of the hydrology and water quality is limiting. Recently, we adapted successfully a watershed model El-SWAT that realistically can simulate saturation excess surface runoff and interflow by introducing a perched water table reservoir that can transfer water via the subsurface to the wet areas in the watershed and thereby overcomes one of the major limitation of the SWAT model. For this presentation, we have combined El-SWAT with a set of spatially dependent phosphorus sub routines developed by us for simulating spatially dependent phosphorus losses in upstate New York State. In this presentation we will show its application in designing effective best management practices in the New York City Source Watersheds in the Catskill Mountains.",

We applied this method for the isolated phases of LFEs, which are regarded as S-waves and used by hypocenter determination. In this method seismic anisotropy is represented by polarization direction of fast S-wave (direction of anisotropy) and delay time between two S-waves. In order to examine the difference between anisotropy within the subducting plate and around the plate interface, we also investigated anisotropy of slab earthquakes, which occurred within the slab. Furthermore, we measured anisotropy of crustal earthquakes in order to evaluate anisotropy near receiver, because anisotropy obtained by S-wave splitting analysis is strongly affected by anisotropy in shallow crust and often masked by it.\nWe used filtered seismograms (2-8 Hz) at stations of Hi-net deployed by NIED in all the analyses. Results of S-wave splitting analyses of LFEs showed that the directions of anisotropy are tend to be orientated in the East−West-trending direction and the delay times are 0.2-0.4 sec. The delay times of LFEs are larger than those of slab earthquakes and crustal earthquakes (~ 0.2 s), suggesting a possibility that there exists a unique anisotropy in the source regions of LFEs. However, the direction of anisotropy is similar to crust anisotropy in the study area, implying that the anisotropy of LFE might be masked by crustal anisotropy. In order to rigorously discuss anisotropy around the source region, we have to remove the effect of the anisotropy in the crust.",

            "abstract": "Shocked cobbles are the cobbles having shock-induced deformation structures on the surfaces. The most distinctive macroscopic features are the subparallel fractures and the pervasive surface craters, with or without radial fractures. Until now, these shocked cobbles have been reported mainly in Europe (Spain and UK) and N. America (USA and Canada), but never been found or reported in Asia. Shocked cobbles have recently found in the Lower Cretaceous Duwon Formation in South Korea, which was the first report in Asia. The Duwon Formation consists mainly of conglomerates, gravelly sandstones and intercalated mudstone and shale layers. The shocked cobbles are commonly found in the lowermost clast-supported conglomerate layers, and they show various deformation features, such as pockmarked (circular or elliptical) cobbles, cratered (Hertzian or bowl-shaped) cobbles with or without radial fractures, cobbles showing subparallel fractures, and strongly squashed or heavily dissected cobbles. In general, these deformation structures are considered to have resulted from pressure dissolution by overburden, tectonic compression, and seismic or meteorite impacts. However, the exact formation mechanism is not clearly understood, and still in debate. The shocked cobbles found in the Duwon Formation have similar features to those of previously reported shocked cobbles, especially to Triassic Buntsandstein conglomerates in northeastern Spain. Based on the macroscopic and microscopic observations, the impact shock is thought to be the best explanation for the deformation features of the Duwon Formation. However, we think that further studies are still needed to clarify the formation mechanism in detail.",

            "abstract": "Reservoir cooling near the wellbore is expected when fluids are injected into a reservoir or aquifer in CO2 storage, enhanced oil or gas recovery, enhanced geothermal systems, and water injection for disposal. Ignoring thermal effects near the well can lead to under-prediction of changes in reservoir pressure and stress due to competition between increased pressure and contraction of the rock in the cooled near-well region.\nIn this work a previously developed semi-analytical model for immiscible, nonisothermal fluid injection is generalised to include partitioning of components between two phases. Advection-dominated radial flow is assumed so that the coupled two-phase flow and thermal conservation laws can be solved analytically. The temperature and saturation profiles are used to find the increase in reservoir pressure, tangential, and radial stress near the wellbore in a semi-analytical, forward-coupled model.\nSaturation, temperature, pressure, and stress profiles are found for parameters representative of several CO2 storage demonstration projects around the world. General results on maximum injection rates vs depth for common reservoir parameters are also presented.\nPrior to drilling an injection well there is often little information about the properties that will determine the injection rate that can be achieved without exceeding fracture pressure, yet injection rate and pressure are key parameters in well design and placement decisions. Analytical solutions to simplified models such as these can quickly provide order of magnitude estimates for flow and stress near the well based on a range of likely parameters.",

In the presence of biogenic volatile organic compounds, lightning NOx may be converted to peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). PAN formation acts to sequester NOx and decrease ozone formation, thereby playing an important role in determining the oxidation capacity of the troposphere. However, comprehensive in situ measurements of reactive nitrogen species in the upper troposphere are insufficient for the purpose of validation of the representation of the relevant processes in chemical transport models.\nNew satellite measurements of PAN from the Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) provide an opportunity to place new constraints on the influence of lightning NOx on ozone production. Here we show that TES provides direct observations of enhanced PAN concentrations downwind of convective events over the US in summertime, evaluate the ability of the GEOS-Chem model to reproduce these enhancements and quantify the reduction in ozone formation that would result from the observed PAN. We will also discuss the prospects for PAN retrievals from other nadir-viewing satellite instruments.",

            "abstract": "Climate change impact studies are associated with error propagation and amplification of uncertainties through model chains. Water management, especially reservoir management, reduces discharge variability. In this study we investigated how water management influences uncertainty propagation of climate change scenarios. We applied a model ensemble of (i) the regional climate model STAR (STAR 0K: no further climate change, STAR 2K and 3K: increase of mean annual temperature by 2 K and 3 K resp.; each scenario is represented by 100 realizations), (ii) the hydrological models SWIM and EGMO, and (iii) the water management model WBalMo. The study was performed in the two neighbouring catchments of the Schwarze Elster River (Germany) and the Spree River (Germany and Czech Republic). These catchments have similar climate, topography and land use, but differ in their water management. The Spree River has a higher reservoir capacity, more withdrawals and discharges from water users and more water transfers.\nThe projected natural runoff in both catchments is similar. Compared to STAR 0K, the natural runoff decreases remarkably in the other climate scenarios. The uncertainties related to the climate projection are propagated through the hydrological model. In the Schwarze Elster River catchment, these uncertainties are slightly increased by the water management model, whereas in the Spree River catchment, due to a higher reservoir capacity and more water transfers, interannual variability and uncertainty of managed discharge are strongly moderated by water management.\nThe results of this study imply that generally, effective water management can reduce uncertainty related to climate change impacts on river discharge. Catchments with a high storage ratio are less vulnerable to changing climate conditions. This underlines the role of water management in coping with climate change impacts. Yet, due to decreasing reservoir volumes in drought periods, reservoir management alone cannot compensate strong changes in climate conditions.",

The rheological stratification strength of the continental lithosphere is traditionally thought to be consistent with the ‘‘jelly sandwich’’ model (a weak lower crust sandwiched by a strong brittle upper crust and a strong plastic lithospheric upper mantle). However, significant seismic activities in some parts of thickened continental lower crust indicate that the rheological strength of continental lower crust can be spatially and temporally heterogeneous. A key question to the controversy is whether the lower crust is dry or wet. Here we report water content and fabric of layered gabbros from the Panzhihua of South China (unaltered Triassic underplating continental lower crust) and granulites from the Manjinggou of North China (Archean continental lower crust). Both rocks show significant amount of water (several hundreds to one thousand ppm) in their constituent nominally anhydrous minerals (clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and plagioclase). There is a significant difference in water content and partition coefficient between clinopyroxene and plagioclase in lower crusts, which also affects the fabrics and rheological strengths of lower crustal minerals. Our results suggest that both Archean continental lower crust and underplating continental lower crust are both wet and weak rather than being dry and strong.",

In arctic rivers, DOM composition is an important control on nutrient availability, trace metal mobilization, and greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, shifts in DOM associated with a changing arctic landscape may alter how aquatic ecosystems function in this region. Here, we examined spatial variation in DOM composition in 72 rivers in the Brooks Range and Seward Peninsula of northern Alaska. We characterized DOM using a suite of techniques, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, absorbance spectra, fluorescence, and chemical fractionation. Watersheds were classified based on traits that influence subsurface hydrology, including parent material (volcanic deposits, loess, sand, glacial moraine, bedrock) and permafrost extent (continuous vs. discontinuous zone) and state (ice-rich vs. ice-poor).\nWe observed considerable variability in DOM composition across rivers. DOC concentrations were lowest in rivers influenced by glacial deposits (<2 mgC L-1) and highest in rivers draining lowland tundra or extensive wetlands (>10 mgC L-1). Specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA254), which serves as an index of DOM aromaticity, was also variable across rivers; spring-fed mountain streams had the lowest SUVA254 values (<1.5 L mgC-1 m-1), whereas tundra and wetland-dominated streams had the highest values (>4 L mgC-1 m-1). While hydrophobic organic acids were the dominant DOM fraction in all rivers, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of hydrophilic compounds during winter flow and in groundwater-fed systems. We also observed variation in DOM composition with permafrost extent and ground ice distribution across the region. Model projections over the next century suggest a heterogeneous response of DOM to thaw, likely mediated by spatial variations in ground ice and parent material.",

            "abstract": "It has been shown that adding visible measurements in the Chappuis band to UV measurements in the Hartley/Huggins bands can significantly enhance retrieval sensitivity to lower tropospheric ozone from backscattered solar radiances due to deeper photon penetration in the visible to the surface than in the ultraviolet. The first NASA EVI TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) instrument is being developed to measure backscattered solar radiation in two channels (~290-490 and 540-740 nm) and make atmospheric pollution measurements over North America from the Geostationary orbit. However, this retrieval enhancement has yet to be solidly demonstrated from existing measurements due to the weak ozone absorption in the visible and strong interference from surface reflectance and the requirement of accurate radiometric calibration across different spectral channels.\nWe present GOME-2 retrievals from joint UV/visible measurements using the SAO optimal estimation based ozone profile retrieval algorithm, to directly explore the retrieval improvement in lower tropospheric ozone from additional visible measurements. To reduce the retrieval interference from surface reflectance, we add characterization of surface spectral reflectance in the visible based on ASTER and other surface reflectance spectra and MODIS BRDF climatology into the ozone profile algorithm using two approaches: fitting several EOFs (Empirical Orthogonal Functions) and scaling reflectance spectra. We also perform empirical radiometric calibration of the GOME-2 data based on radiative transfer simulations. We evaluate the retrieval improvement of joint UV/visible retrieval over the UV retrieval. These results clearly show the potential of using the visible to improve lower tropospheric ozone retrieval.",

            "abstract": "X-ray computer tomography (CT) scans of core recovered from the first phase of the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP-1) through the Alpine Fault provide an excellent opportunity to analyse brittle deformation around the fault. In particular, assessment can be made of the heavily fractured protolith constituting the damage zone. Damage zone structures are divided into two types that result from two distinct processes: (1) “off fault damage” formed by stress changes induced by the passage of a seismic rupture and (2) “off fault deformation” that represent structures, which accommodate strain around the fault that was not localised on the principal slip zone (PSZ). The distribution of these damage zones structures within CT scans of the recovered core was measured along a scanline parallel to the core axis and assessed using a weighted moving average technique to account for orientation bias. The results of this analysis reveal that within the part of the fault rocks sampled by DFDP-1 there is no increase in density of these structures towards the PSZ. This is in agreement with independent analysis using Borehole Televiewer Data of the DFDP-1B borehole. Instead, we consider the density of these structures to be controlled to the first order by lithology, which modulates the mechanical properties of the fault rocks such as its frictional strength and cohesion. Comparisons of fracture density to p-wave velocities obtained from wireline logs indicate they are independent of each other, therefore, for the cores sampled in this study fractures impart no influence on the elastic properties of the rock. This is consistent with the observation from core that the majority of fractures are cemented. We consider how this might influence future rupture dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The Tecoripa chart H12-D64 is located southeast of the state of Sonora, México, south of Arizona. The geology is represented by sedimentary rocks of the Ordovician and Triassic, volcanic rocks of the Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary, intrusive rocks from the Upper Cretaceous- Tertiary and sedimentary rocks of the Cenozoic. In this paper a gravimetric study was conducted to determine the configuration and depth of the basement and to develop a structural model of the subsurface. For this purpose a consistent gravimetric survey in 3 profiles was conducted. To complement this study, gravimetric data obtained by INEGI (96 gravimetric stations spaced every 4000 m) that correspond to a regional survey was also used. The two sets of data were corrected and processed with the WinGLink software. The profiles were then modeled using the Talwani method. 4 Profiles corresponding to the gravimetric survey and 5 data profiles from INEGI were modeled. Aeromagnetic data from the total field of Tecoripa chart were also processed. The digital information was integrated and processed by generating a data grid. Processes applied to data consisted of reduction to the pole, regional-residual separation and upward continuations. In general, the obtained structural models show intrusive bodies associated with well-defined high gravimetric and magnetic and low gravimetric and magnetic are associated with basins and sedimentary rocks. The obtained geological models show the basement represented by volcanic rocks of the Tarahumara Formation from the Upper Cretaceous which are in contact with sedimentary rocks from the Barranca Group from Upper Cretaceous and limestones from the Middle Ordovician. Both volcanic and sedimentary rocks are intruded by granodiorite- granite with ages of the Tertiary-Oligocene. Based on the superficial geology as well as in the configuration of the basement and the obtained structural model the existence of faults with NW-SE orientation that originate Horst and Graben type structures can be inferred. The basins have depths of 2,000 to 4,000m with sedimentary fillings from the Báucarit Formation and Quaternary sediments.",

            "abstract": "The Pacific plate is surrounded by circum-Pacific active margin, along which volcanic and seismic activities are very high. Ultra-Mega-Earthquakes (=UMEs, M>9.0) are occasionally observed along the margin, where sedimentary rocks of subducting slaves contact with the accreted sedimentary rocks of subducted slaves. But, those UME have never been occured along western Pacific islandarc-trench system including Izu-Ogasawara (=Bonin)-Mariana-Yap-Palau-Philippine-Tonga-Kermadec Trenches. I assume that the geological and petrological characteristics of the subduction boundaries are very important to understand those different seismic activities. Along the above mentioned trench inner wall, especially in the southern Mariana, mantle peridotites are widely distributed. Subducting slave contacts directly with the olivine dominant mantle peridotites of subducted slave, serpentinite layer can be deposited easily under hydrous oceanic sub-bottom environment and very slippery subduction boundaries are left along the subduction zone.\nOn the other hand, those geological evidences give us some ideas on how to avoid UMEs in the Japanese Islands along Japan Trench and Nankai Trough in future. We will be able to change artificially from normal subduction boundaries with asperity zone into slippery subduction boundaries with serpentine layer, by means of serpentine mud injection toward the subduction boundaries interior by combining the following improved drilling technologies A and B. (A) Deep Sea Drilling Vessel CHIKYU has a drilling ability to reach subduction boundary with asperity zone in the Nankai Trough. (B) Advanced drilling technology in the shale gas industry is tremendous, that is, after one vertical deep drilling, horizontal drilling towards several direction are performed, then shale gas is collected by hydraulic fracturing method. I hope that, after several generations, our posterity will be able to avoid UMEs by continuous serpentine mud injection.\n ",

However, fire modeling is still a large source of uncertainty in current earth system models due to its broad spatial and temporal variability with complex region-specific characteristics. To improve the modeling capability for fire activities and climate-fire interactions, we newly develop in the CESM framework a region-specific fire scheme that is coupled with CAM5 and CLM4.5 models. The new fire scheme improves fire modeling performance in both offline and online simulations in comparison to the observations. New functionality of the fire scheme enables assessments of climate feedbacks to fire activities. The inclusion of fire emission and plume rise modules also enable fire feedbacks to climate through aerosol radiative and cloud forcing.

            "abstract": "One major challenge of agent-based modeling is to derive agents’ behavioral rules due to behavioral uncertainty and data scarcity. This study proposes a new approach to combine a data-driven modeling based on the directed information (i.e., machine intelligence) with expert domain knowledge (i.e., human intelligence) to derive the behavioral rules of agents considering behavioral uncertainty. A directed information graph algorithm is applied to identifying the causal relationships between agents’ decisions (i.e., groundwater irrigation depth) and time-series of environmental, socio-economical and institutional factors. A case study is conducted for the High Plains aquifer hydrological observatory (HO) area, U.S. Preliminary results show that four factors, corn price (CP), underlying groundwater level (GWL), monthly mean temperature (T) and precipitation (P) have causal influences on agents’ decisions on groundwater irrigation depth (GWID) to various extents. Based on the similarity of the directed information graph for each agent, five clusters of graphs are further identified to represent all the agents’ behaviors in the study area as shown in Figure 1. Using these five representative graphs, agents’ monthly optimal groundwater pumping rates are derived through the probabilistic inference. Such data-driven relationships and probabilistic quantifications are then coupled with a physically-based groundwater model to investigate the interactions between agents’ pumping behaviors and the underlying groundwater system in the context of coupled human and natural systems.",

            "abstract": "<span\">Evaluation of long-term changes in groundwater recharge due to the climate changes is needed to secure the sustainable use of grounwater. In Jeju Island, which is composed of various formations of porous volcanic rocks, groundwater is a sole resource for water supply because of its hydrogeological characteristics. Therefore, preservation of the groundwater resource is an essential issue in the island. Prior to establishing a management plan for maintaining the groundwater resources in Jeju Island, long-term estimation of influencing factors are necessary. The Gosan study <span\">a<span\">rea is located in the western part of the island, where extensive agricultural activity has been performed and groundwater is a main source of supply for watering crops. In this study, we estimated the recharge changes for 100 years (2000~2099) in the Gosan agricultural area based on two climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) by using the HELP3 (Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance) program. The estimated component of water budget in this study are as follows (averaged in 2000~2014), precipitation: 1.28x108 m3/yr; ET: 6.49x107 m3/yr; runoff: 5.84x106 m3/yr; and recharge: 5.27x107 m3/yr. Over the 100 years of the estimated period, precipitation will have a highest increase among other meteorological parameters to be 6.16x109 m3 (RCP4.5) and 6.34 x109 m3 (RCP8.5). Increase in recharge by RCP8.5 scenario (2.75 x109 m3) will be less than that by RCP4.5 (2.77x109 m3) because ET by RCP 8.5 (ET: 3.34x109 m3; runoff: 2.27x108 m3) is estimated to be higher than ET by RCP4.5 (ET: 3.15x109 m3; runoff: 2.35x108 m3). Jeju volcanic island is known to have higher recharge proportions to the precipitation due to the distributed highly porous volcanic rocks. Therefore, variations in precipitation by climate changes would greatly affect the groundwater resource of the island.\nAcknowledgement: This work was supported by the research project of \"Advanced Technology for Groundwater Development and Application in Riversides (Geowater+)\" in \"Water Resources Management Program (code 11 Technology Innovation C05)\" of the MOLIT and the KAIA in Korea.",

            "abstract": "In the recent decade, the global mean surface temperature has risen half a degree in reference to that of the 1980’s. This means that the earth’s total (potential + internal) energy in the atmosphere has increased. In contrary, a slowdown of general circulation under the warming climate is likely in progress. Furthermore, weather extremes, including severe cold surges, occur as before.\nThis study attempts to explain these somewhat contradictory changes — warmer world, slower circulation, but more extremes — by expanding a pioneering work by Lorenz (1955) that explained the maintenance of general circulation from the energetics point of view. In a global scale, the mean available potential energy is generated by diabatic heating, and is converted to eddy energy through baroclinic energy conversion. Kinetic energy conversion either reinforces mean wind or drains energy from the mean flow through barotropic conversion depending on the regions.\nIt was found that all energy terms as well as global mean surface temperature show meaningful changes from the 1980’s to the 2000’s. The available potential energy decreases mostly due to polar amplification, i.e., colder regions warming faster. This supports the slowdown of the mean circulation. Likewise, global mean kinetic energy decreases, most notably at the northern hemisphere. Instead, the baroclinic conversion of the mean available potential energy significantly increases at the subtropics and mid-latitudes. As a result, the eddy energy that originates from the departures from the mean state considerably increases over the mid-latitudes. Although the eddy energy terms may not have direct correspondence to an individual extreme weather event, they are indicative of deviations from the mean flow. The increase in eddy energy terms may indicate more or stronger anomalous weather events.",

            "abstract": "Growing observations of brown dwarfs (BDs) and directly imaged extrasolar giant planets (EGPs), such as brightness variability and surface maps have provided evidence for strong atmospheric circulation on these worlds. Previous studies that serve to understand the atmospheric circulation of BDs include modeling of convection from the interior and its interactions with stably stratified atmospheres. These models show that such interactions can drive an atmospheric circulation, forming zonal jets and/or vortices. However, these models are dry, not including condensation of various chemical species. Condensation of water has previously been shown to play an important role on driving the zonal jets on four giant planets in our solar system. As such, condensation cycles of various chemical species are believed to be an important source in driving the atmospheric circulation of BDs and directly imaged EGPs. Here we present results from three-dimensional simulations for the stably stratified atmospheres of BDs and EGPs based on a general circulation model that includes the effect of a condensate cycle. Large-scale latent heating and molecular weight effect due to condensation of a single species are treated explicitly. We examine the circulation patterns caused by large-scale latent heating which results from condensation of silicate vapor in hot dwarfs and water vapor in the cold dwarfs. By varying the abundance of condensable vapor and the radiative timescale, we conclude that under normal conditions of BDs (near 1x solar abundance and relatively short radiative timescale), latent heating alone by silicate vapors is unable to drive a global circulation, leaving a quiescent atmosphere, because of the suppression to moist instability by downward transport of dry air. Models with high abundance of condensates (~5x solar) and relatively long radiative timescale, which may be the case of directly imaged EGPs, tend to maintain an active hydrological cycle and develop zonal jets. Once condensation happens, storms driven by moist instability can extend vertically over several scale heights, reaching the photosphere and being able to induce flux variability — helping to explain patchy clouds inferred from near-IR light curves and the inferred surface map of BDs.",

            "abstract": "The carbonate compensation depth (CCD), the ocean depth at which the calcium carbonate accumulation rate goes to zero, can provide valuable insight into climatic and weathering conditions over the Cenozoic. The paleoposition of the CCD can be inferred from sediment core data. As the carbonate accumulation rate decreases linearly with depth between the lysocline and CCD, the CCD can be calculated using a linear regression on multiple sediment cores with known carbonate accumulation rates and paleodepths. It is therefore vital to have well-constrained estimates of paleodepths. Paleodepths are typically calculated using models of thermal subsidence and sediment loading and compaction. However, viscous convection-related stresses in the mantle can warp the ocean floor by hundreds of meters over broad regions and can also vary significantly over millions of years. This contribution to paleobathymetry, termed dynamic topography, can be calculated by modeling mantle flow backwards in time. Herein, we demonstrate the effect dynamic topography has on the inference of the late Cenozoic CCD with an example from the equatorial Pacific, considering sites from IODP Expeditions 320/321. The equatorial Pacific, given its large size and high productivity, is closely tied to the global carbon cycle. Accordingly, long-term changes in the equatorial Pacific CCD can be considered to reflect global changes in weathering fluxes and the carbon cycle, in addition to more regional changes in productivity and thermohaline circulation. We find that, when the dynamic topography contribution to bathymetry is accounted for, the equatorial Pacific CCD is calculated to be appreciably shallower at 30 Ma than previous estimates would suggest, implying a greater deepening of the Pacific CCD over the late Cenozoic.",

Study of the WARS is complicated by the presence of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the Ross Ice Shelf, and the Ross Sea. Recent deployments of broadband seismographs in the POLENET project have allowed passive seismic techniques, such as receiver function analysis and surface wave dispersion, to be widely utilized to infer crustal and mantle velocity structure across much of the WARS and West Antarctica. However, a large sector of the WARS lies beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. In late 2014, 34 broadband seismographs were deployed atop the ice shelf to jointly study deep Earth structure and the dynamics of the ice shelf. Ice shelf conditions present strong challenges to broadband teleseismic imaging: 1) The presence of complicating signals in the microseism through long-period bands due to the influence of ocean gravity waves; 2) The strong velocity contrasts at the ice-water and water-sediment interfaces on either side of the water layer give rise to large amplitude reverberations; 3) The water layer screens S-waves or P-to-S phases originating from below the water layer.

            "abstract": "We use 168 Continuous Global Positioning System (CGPS) stations distributed in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Nepal from lengths of 2.5 to 14 years to estimate the present-day velocity field in this area, including the horizontal and vertical deformations under the frame ITRF2008. We estimate and remove common mode errors in regional GPS time series using the principal component analysis (PCA), obtaining a time series with high signal to noise ratio. Following the maximum estimation analysis, a power law plus white noise stochastic model are adopted to estimate the velocity field. The highlight of Tibetan region is the crust vertical deformation. GPS vertical time series present seasonal oscillations caused by temporal mass loads, hence GRACE data from CSR are used to study the mass loads change. After removing the mass load deformations from GPS vertical rates, the results are improved. Leveling data about 48 years in this region are also used to estimate the rates of vertical movements. Our study suggests that the boundary of south Nepal is still sinking due to the fact that the India plate is crashing into the Eurasian plate. The uplift rates from south to north of TP reduce gradually. Himalayas region and north Nepal uplift around 6 mm/yr in average. The uplift rate along East TP in Qinhai is around 2.7 mm/yr in average. In contrast, the southeast of Tibetan Plateau, south Yunnan and Tarim in Xinjiang sink with different magnitudes. Our observation results suggest complicated mechanism of the mass migration in TP.

            "abstract": "Rifted continental lithosphere subsides as a consequence of combined crustal thinning and mantle lithosphere cooling yet basins on some continental margins experience anomalous subsidence events that postdate active extension. Deep basins on the northern margin of the South China Sea, notably the Baiyun Sag, show basement subsidence accelerating after ~21 Ma, postdating extension by several million years. Similar subsidence events are seen after 5 Ma in the Song Hong Basin and after 11 Ma in the Qiongdongnan Basin. We combine geophysical observations and numerical forward modeling to show that loading of the offshore basins by increased sediment flux caused by faster onshore erosion following Early Miocene monsoon intensification is a viable trigger for ductile flow after the cessation of active extension. Loading works in conjunction with onshore uplift to drive flow of the lower crust away from the rift axis. As well as sediment supply rates distribution patterns and drainage capture can be significant in controlling crustal flow and thinning. This illustrates that offshore basin dynamics at continental margins with weak crust can be controlled by onshore surface processes in a newly recognized form of climate-tectonic coupling.",

            "abstract": "Primary eruptive vent areas for several lavas in the Imnaha and Grande Ronde Formations of the Columbia River Basalt exhibit phreatomagmatic character, due to the interaction of rising flood basalt magma with groundwater and/or surface water. Vent constructional forms range from extensive (>1 km) maar complexes with abundant basement lithics to small (<<1 km), lithic-poor low-angle cones. Phreatomagmatic tephra is lithified and variably palagonitized, but glassy basaltic lapilli can be recovered from many locations. Many lapilli have experienced variable degrees of Na leaching but preserve magmatic abundances of most other elements; nonetheless in many cases pristine, unmodified glass is amenable to analysis. In addition, phenocrysts in lapilli have fully glassy melt inclusions. Glassy lapilli have highly variable S contents between ~100 and ~1300 ppm. This is consistent with quenching before degassing was complete, a common feature of phreatomagmatic eruptions. Melt inclusions have ≤2900 ppm S, ≤3400 ppm CO2 and ≤2.6 wt% H2O, allowing estimates of atmospheric input from the main phase of Columbia River volcanism. In addition, the lithophile trace element contents, and petrogenetically significant ratios such as Ba/Nb, of glassy lapilli exhibit differ from those in the equivalent 'stony' lava flows by up to a factor of 2. This suggests that processes in the flow and crystallization of lava serve to modify trace element abundances, and may place limits on the petrogenetic significance of trace element data from crystalline lava samples.",

            "abstract": "Classical Milankovitch Theory suggests variance in the orbital cycles of precession (21 kyr) and obliquity (41 kyr) should have a profound influence on insolation and ice volume. However, the globally-integrated ice volume proxy record (benthic δ18O) during the Late Pliocene (3.0-2.6 Ma) is dominated by obliquity-paced cycles, and lacks a significant precession component. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, but paleoclimate records independent of the benthic δ18O record are required to test these. The Wanganui Basin, New Zealand, contains a shallow-marine Neogene sedimentary succession that is widely recognised as an important site for examining sea-level/ice volume changes at orbital frequencies. Here, we present a record of paleobathymetric changes at an orbital resolution from the Late Pliocene Mangaweka Mudstone outcrop succession. Modern analogue-calibrated water-depth proxies of grainsize and benthic foraminifera census data were used to evaluate paleobathymetric changes. An integrated magneto-, bio- and tephrostratigraphy was developed that constrains the outcrop succession to between ~3.0 Ma and 2.58 Ma. Nine distinct cycles spanning ~400,000 years are identified in the grainsize and benthic foraminifera assemblages. Within the uncertainty of the age model, the Mangaweka Mudstone grainsize cycles can be matched one-for-one to the δ18O cycles, as they display a similar pattern of frequency and amplitude. The frequency of these cycles (and the corresponding interval in the δ18O record) are dominated by the 41 kyr year obliquity cycle, but with a subordinate eccentricity component. Therefore, the fluctuations in the grainsize and benthic foraminifera proxies likely represent an indirect response to global sea-level fluctuations via their effect on continental shelf sediment transport mechanisms. The implications for the orbital theory of the ice ages are that during the Late Pliocene, global ice volume changes responded primarily to obliquity, and the precession influences were either too low amplitude to have influenced the grainsize and benthic foraminifera assemblages in the Mangaweka Mudstone depositional environment, or cancelled-out in global ice volume/sea-level changes because precession forcing is anti-phased between the hemispheres.",

Nonetheless, it is very challenging to achieve high accuracy location in the sparse seismic network. Recently ambient seismic noise has been demonstrated to be able to achieve 2km or better accuracy of earthquake location, using the noise cross-correlation function (NCF) between the stations near the epicenter and distant stations, where similar path between the epicenter and the corresponding station helps to reduce the location error caused by the velocity structure variation. This method is not systematically investigated yet, hence we have installed a portable seismic station around Suining earthquake, a ground truth event observed by InSAR, and applied the bootstraping method to investigate effects upon location accuracy due to number of stations, epicentral distance of station, azimuthal gap as well as seasonality of observation. Studies have indicated that ambient seismic noise location method can increase positioning accuracy with sparse network, and it is also helpful to study the historical earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The classical statistical theory predicts that an ergodic, weakly interacting system like charged particles in the presence of electromagnetic fields, performing Brownian motions (characterized by small range deviations in phase space and short-term microscopic memory), converges into the Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics. Observation of distributions with a kappa-power-law tails in homogeneous systems contradicts this prediction and necessitates a renewed analysis of the basic axioms of the diffusion process: characteristics of the transition probability density function (pdf) for a single interaction, with a possibility of non-Markovian process and non-local interaction. The non-local, Levy walk deviation is related to the non-extensive statistical framework. Particles bouncing along (solar) magnetic field with evolving pitch angles, phases and velocities, as they interact resonantly with waves, undergo energy changes at undetermined time intervals, satisfying these postulates. The dynamic evolution of a general continuous time random walk is determined by pdf of jumps and waiting times resulting in a fractional Fokker-Planck equation with non-integer derivatives whose solution is given by a Fox H-function. The resulting procedure involves the known, although not frequently used in physics fractional calculus, while the local, Markovian process recasts the evolution into the standard Fokker-Planck equation. Solution of the fractional Fokker-Planck equation with the help of Mellin transform and evaluation of its residues at the poles of its Gamma functions results in a slowly converging sum with power laws. It is suggested that these tails form the Kappa function. Gradual vs impulsive solar electron distributions serve as prototypes of this description.",

These data were used to determine the extent to which changes in canopy chemistry could be detected, quantified, and related to leaf and canopy traits that are indicators of physiological functioning (water content, Leaf Mass Area, total C, N, and pigments (chlorophyll a, b, and carotenoids). At the canopy scale we measured leaf area index, and for forests — species, height, canopy area, DBH, deciduous or evergreen, broadleaf or needleleaf, and gap size. Strong correlations between leaf and canopy traits were predictable and quantifiable from spectroscopy data. Key structural properties of canopy height, biomass and complexity, a measure of spatial and vertical heterogeneity, were predicted by AVIRIS and validated against LiDAR data. Our data supports the hypothesis that optical sensors provide more detailed information about the distribution and variability in leaf and canopy traits related to plant functionality than cPFTs.",

            "abstract": "This study investigated the immobilization of Mn(II) via homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation by air. A series of kinetic experiments were performed with stirred batch reactors equipped with air spargers. The reactions were initiated by adding Mn(II) stock solutions to pH-buffered solutions amended with dissolved Fe(II), Fe oxyhydroxides, or Mn oxides. Under experimental conditions, the homogeneous oxidation of Mn(II) itself was minimal over pH 6.5-8.5. However, when dissolved Fe(II) was present, the immobilization of Mn occurred, with the extent becoming greater at higher pH. By Mn-K edge XAS analysis, the Mn removal at pH 6.5 was due to the oxidation of labile Mn(II) into insoluble Mn(III) solids, which was catalyzed by the homogeneous oxidation of Fe(II). On the other hand, Mn(II) at pH 7.0-8.5 remained largely unoxidized; instead, it was immobilized by forming co-precipitates with Fe(III) oxyhydroxides. Goethite, HFO, Mn2O3, and MnO2 were added to mediate the heterogeneous oxidation of Mn(II). In the presence of goethite and HFO, dissolved Mn was initially quickly decreased, and later gradually decreased. In both batches, the initial removal was due to the surface complexation of Mn(II) with Fe oxyhydroxides. On the other hand, the later removal in goethite-amend batches resulted from the formation of co-precipitates with Fe(III) oxyhydroxides, whereas the later removal in HFO-amended batches was due to the heterogeneous oxidation of Mn(II) into Mn(III) solids. When Mn2O3 and MnO2 were used as heterogeneous catalysts, XAS analysis did not provide mechanistic insight into Mn removal. Nonetheless, Mn2O3 was found to immobilize Mn(II) under oxic conditions. Notably, MnO2 was far more effectively immobilize Mn(II) under both oxic and anoxic conditions, pointing to its superior oxidative capability.\nAcknowledgement: Financial support was provided by “R&D Project on Environmental Management of Geologic CO2 Storage” from the KEITI (Project Number: 2014001810003).",

Results identified a subset of 6 climate models among the CMIP5 ensembles that showed statistical consistency in features of trend and variability with the chosen variables. For a validation, a physically- based distributed hydrologic model was developed using Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) in Lehman Creek watershed. Runoff simulations were obtained by driving PRMS model with the products of these identified climate models, and were well validated with observed data. However, the magnitudes of CMIP5 precipitation were too low and could not adequately represent to the observed annual precipitation. Adjustment of precipitation will be needed and extra caution should be paid if these 6 model products are used in regional hydrologic processes simulation in future as well as water resources planning.",

            "abstract": "The mantle carbon reservoir is four orders of magnitude more massive than that of the atmosphere and ocean combined. The behaviour of carbon in the mantle, especially its transport and extraction, is thus of crucial importance to understanding the coupling between the deep interior and the surface environment of Earth. Laboratory experiments indicate that even small concentrations of carbon dioxide (and other volatiles like H2O) in the upper mantle significantly affect silicate melting [HK96,DH06] by stabilising carbon-rich melt at high pressure. The presence of carbon in the mantle substantially extends the region where partial melt is stable and has important consequences for the dynamics of magma transport and chemical differentiation [H10,DH10]. We have developed theory and numerical implementation to simulate thermo-chemically coupled magma/mantle dynamics in terms of a two-phase (rock+melt), three component (dunite+MORB+carbonated MORB) physical model. The fluid dynamics is based on McKenzie’s equations [McK84]. The thermo-chemical formulation of the system is represented by a novel, disequilibrium, multi-component melting model based on thermodynamic theory [RBS11]. This physical model is implemented as a parallel, two-dimensional, finite-volume code that leverages tools from the PETSc toolkit.\nFirst results show that carbon and other volatiles cause a qualitative difference to the style of melt transport, potentially enhancing its extraction efficiency – measured in the carbon mass flux arriving at the mid-ocean ridge axis – by at least an order of magnitude. The process that controls magma transport in our models is a volatile flux-induced reactive infiltration instability, causing carbonated melt to rise from depth in localized channels. These results add to our understanding of melt formation and transport at mid-ocean ridges (the most important magmatic system in the mantle) and may have important implications for subduction zones.\nREFERENCES\nHK96 Hirth & Kohlstedt (1996), EPSL\nDH06 Dasgupta & Hirschmann (2006), Nature\nH10 Hirschmann (2010), PEPI \nDH10 Dasgupta & Hirschmann (2010), EPSL\nMcK84 McKenzie (1984), J Pet\nKW12 Katz & Weatherley (2012), EPSL\nRBS11 Rudge, Bercovici & Spiegelman (2011), GJI",

Until the recent wide-scale implementation of dual-polarimetric radar, this second group of errors received relatively little attention, focusing predominantly on precipitation type-dependent Z-R and Z-k relations.\nThe current work accounts for the impact of variations of the drop size distribution (DSD) on the radar QPE performance. We propose to link the parameters of the Z-R and Z-k relations directly to those of the normalized gamma DSD. The benefit of this procedure is that it reduces the number of unknown parameters. In this work, the DSD parameters are obtained using 1) surface observations from a Parsivel and Thies LPM disdrometer, and 2) a Monte Carlo optimization procedure using surface rain gauge observations. The impact of both approaches for a given precipitation type is assessed for 45 days of summertime precipitation observed within The Netherlands.\nAccounting for DSD variations using disdrometer observations leads to an improved radar QPE product as compared to applying climatological Z-R and Z-k relations. However, overall precipitation intensities are still underestimated. This underestimation is expected to result from unaccounted errors (e.g. transmitter calibration, erroneous identification of precipitation as clutter, overshooting and small-scale variability).\nIn case the DSD parameters are optimized, the performance of the radar is further improved, resulting in the best performance of the radar QPE product. However, the resulting optimal Z-R and Z-k relations are considerably different from those obtained from disdrometer observations. As such, the best microphysical parameter set results in a minimization of the overall bias, which besides accounting for DSD variations also corrects for the impact of additional error sources.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic tremor and low frequency earthquakes (LFE) have been extensively studied in recent years in northern Washington and southern Vancouver Island (VI). However, far less attention has been directed to northern VI where the behavior of tremor and LFEs is less well documented. We investigate LFE properties in this latter region by assembling templates using data from the POLARIS-NVI and Sea-JADE experiments. The POLARIS-NVI experiment comprised 27 broadband seismometers arranged along two mutually perpendicular arms with an aperture of ~60 km centered near station WOS (lat. 50.16, lon. -126.57). It recorded two ETS events in June 2006 and May 2007, each with duration less than a week. For these two episodes, we constructed 68 independent, high signal to noise ratio LFE templates representing spatially distinct asperities on the plate boundary in NVI, along with a catalogue of more than 30 thousand detections. A second data set is being prepared for the complementary 2014 Sea-JADE data set. The precisely located LFE templates represent simple direct P-waves and S-waves at many stations thereby enabling magnitude estimation of individual detections. After correcting for radiation pattern, 1-D geometrical spreading, attenuation and free-surface magnification, we solve a large, sparse linear system for 3-D path corrections and LFE magnitudes for all detections corresponding to a single LFE template. LFE magnitudes range up to 2.54, and like southern VI are characterized by high b-values (b~8). In addition, we will quantify LFE moment-duration scaling and compare with southern Vancouver Island where LFE moments appear to be controlled by slip, largely independent of fault area.",

            "abstract": "East Asia is submitted to a strong seasonal monsoon system, with dry winters and wet summers. Each season can be submitted to extreme weather events such as long drought spells or extreme daily rainfall. Because this region is densely populated, the understanding and predictability of such events is a major subject of concern in the framework of global warming scenario.\nIn this study we investigate the occurrence of the two (above mentioned) extreme events. We focus on their variability and the large-scale atmospheric (+ STT) patterns associated with these events. We use APHRODITE and PERSIANN observation, along with outputs from 2 high resolution (0.5 degree) global climate model (GCM): HadGEM3-GC2 (MetOffice, UK; fully coupled with ORCA025) and HiRAM-C192 (GFDL, USA; forced by prescribed SST). We use different approaches (composites and correlation fields) to highlight the main patterns and mechanisms that control the variability of extremes.\nWe focus on the 1975-2005 historical period. Despite some biases, models can reproduce the signal of extreme events and their dynamical control. Results show a strong control of the land-sea heat contrast along with a significant impact of the monsoon winds system. The SST (which translate the moisture source) does not have a significant impact when considering short terms (monthly) variability but has stronger impact in terms of internannual variability.\nThis work is then extend to end of century projection with the two GCM to investigate the major changes in the large scale dynamics and how it can impact extreme weather events.",

            "abstract": "To examine the impact of wildfire on timing and magnitude of extreme hydrologic events, it is essential to quantify the degree of scale-dependency of post-fire hydro-geomorphic processes. Scaling of hydrologic processes has been shown to increase uncertainties unless they are known to have the same spatio-temporal scale or accurate methods of conversion. Hydrological responses at watershed-scale are linked to peak flows and total volume of overland flow hydrographs. At a burned hillslope, both flow generation and transport responsive to hydrographs dynamics, are determined by post-fire hydro-geomorphic factors and their interaction with rainfall events.\nA hierarchical monitoring approach consisting of paired rainfall-runoff plots and rainguages with different size from point to hillslope scale were installed on a dry eucalyptus hillslope, south east Australia, burned by wildfire January 2013.\nScaling effect of overland flow on the burned hillslope was studied with help of event- seasonal- and annual-based rainfall-runoff data in relation to travel distance, contributing area and rainfall patterns. A linear decrease in runoff ratio with slope length was observed for plots with the same width.\nHowever, the rate of runoff production declined exponentially for plots with narrower width. Further investigation of vegetation patches, soil moisture, water repellency, and macropores patterns showed no significant differences in soil-surface factors affecting initial infiltration in these plots comparing to the rest of compound. Thus initial infiltration in narrower plots was similar to the rest of plots; however initiated runoff had less chance to reach the outlet. This could be due to higher positive pore pressures in smaller bounded area per length result in higher macropores and matrix infiltration, overcoming water repellency. Measurement also showed that soil in narrower plots was less repellent in downslope, supporting higher transmission loss downslope in these plots.\nThe degree of scale-dependency was correlated with rainfalls total volume, duration, and their patterns. The rate of scale-dependency of produced runoff had a strong positive correlation with total volume of events while negatively correlated to durations. Thus higher scaling effects were associated with short intense events.",

The origins of garnets range from deep mantle to shallow continental crust. These garnets were delivered by kimberlitic diatreme of 30 Ma (Smith et al. 2004). We have classified the garnets into 10 groups (A to J, see figure) by naked eye observation, major chemistry, minor Na-Ti-P, inclusion/lamella mineralogy. Among them, groups A to D are of mantle origin, E to G of subducted oceanic crust origin, and H to J of continental crust origin.\nWe summarized results as in the followings.\nA: Cr and pyrope-rich garnet has Cr2O3(0.8-6.3 wt.%) and inclusions of Ol, Cpx, Opx, Ti-Chu/Chn and carbonates, indicating carbonated garnet lherzolites as host. Cr contents negatively correlates with Na-Ti-P contents and occurrence of exsolved Rt, Ilm and crichtonite. This indicates Cr-rich end-member is the most “primitive” mantle garnet before metasomatism.\nB: Pyrope-rich reddish brown garnet of peridotitic origins was subdivided into 4 subgroups (B1 to B4, see figure). Compositional range in Ca-Mg-Fe triangle expands to Fe-rich side from group A. Exsolved Na-bearing amphibole and inclusions of Ap, carbonates and fluid were identified. These indicate metasomatism of group A.\nC: Garnet megacryst is coarse-grained garnet (2-10 cm across) with crystal faces. This garnet has wide chemical variation plotted in the center area of Ca-Mg-Fe triangle.\nD: Garnet aggregate has similar chemistry of group C and is composed of several grains. Grain boundaries of garnet were recognized by Rt, Ilm and other minerals and oscillatory zonings of Ca, Mg, Fe and Na-Ti-P. Fluid inclusions of groups C and D suggest these garnets might crystalized from fluid.\nE: Garnet in eclogite and F: Garnet in metasomatized eclogite are xenolith samples (the Fallaron Plate origin?). Aggregate of Zo+Ab contained in group E indicates decomposed precursor lawsonite inclusion.\nG: Quartz lamella-bearing garnet (relatively high Na2O: 0.03-0.06 wt.%) contains inclusions of Omp and Zrn and oriented lamellae of Qtz, Rt and Ap. These suggest eclogitic origins deeper than groups E and F.\nAbove features in garnets from the Garnet Ridge constrain their formations by multistage and wide range intensity of metasomatisms underneath the Colorado Plateau.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonic reconstructions are an excellent tool for understanding the configuration and behaviour of continents through time on both global and regional scales, and are relatively well understood back to ~200 Ma. However, many of these models represent only relative motions between continents, providing little information of absolute tectonic motions and their relationship with the deep Earth. Significant issues exist in solving this problem, including how to combine constraints from multiple, diverse data into a unified model of absolute plate motions; and how to address uncertainties both in the available data, and in the assumptions involved in this process (e.g. hotspot motion, true polar wander). In deep time (pre-Pangea breakup), plate reconstructions rely more heavily on paleomagnetism, but these data often imply plate velocities much larger than those observed since the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea where plate velocities are constrained by the seafloor spreading record. Here we present two complementary techniques to address these issues, applying parallelized numerical methods to quantitatively investigate absolute plate motions through time. Firstly, we develop a data-fit optimized global absolute reference frame constrained by kinematic reconstruction data, hotspot-trail observations, and trench migration statistics. Secondly we calculate optimized paleomagnetic data-derived apparent polar wander paths (APWPs) for both the Phanerozoic and Precambrian. Paths are generated from raw pole data with optimal spatial and temporal pole configurations calculated using all known uncertainties and quality criteria to produce velocity-optimized absolute motion paths through deep time.",

It works in real time and uses outputs from multiple hydrologic models to compute the multimodel ensemble prediction of riverflow, i.e. the hydrograph. The system has been experimentally implemented for the upper Nysa Kłodzka river basin (SW Poland). We also integrated the system with the well-established hydrodynamic model, known as FloodMap, to forecast flood inundation (HydroProg computes hydrograph prediction and FloodMap maps the hydrograph prognosis into terrain). The HydroProg-FloodMap solution works at five sites. The real-time experimental forecasts are available at http://www.klodzko.hydroprog.uni.wroc.pl/.\nThe FloodMap model is calibrated at each site on a basis of the available Digital Elevation Model (DEM) or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and hydrograph data. However, since the launch of the HydroProg-FloodMap solution no true data on inundation has been available to check the model outputs against observation, and hence to redo the calibration if necessary. If we consider past events, which occurred before the launch of the system, there exists the observed inundation map for the Żelazno site. It was produced by geomorphological mapping of consequences of the flood in June 2009. The aim of the study is therefore to use this specific data set for a single site, calibrate the FloodMap model using inundation data, and identify the physical-geographical characteristics of terrain under which we are allowed to extrapolate the parameters to the other four sites.\nWe conducted a spatial analysis of land use (based on Polish national database of topographical objects) and topography (based on DEM/DSM from the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)) in order to identify similarities of the studied areas and hence to improve the estimates of the Manning’s roughness coefficient.",

Detecting and modeling finite-fault ruptures in real-time is thus essential to both earthquake early warning (EEW) and rapid emergency response. Following extensive real-time and offline testing, the finite-fault rupture detector algorithm, FinDer (Böse et al., 2012 & 2015), was successfully integrated into the California-wide ShakeAlert EEW demonstration system. Since April 2015, FinDer has been scanning real-time waveform data from approximately 420 strong-motion stations in California for peak ground acceleration (PGA) patterns indicative of earthquakes. FinDer analyzes strong-motion data by comparing spatial images of observed PGA with theoretical templates modeled from empirical ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs). If the correlation between the observed and theoretical PGA is sufficiently high, a report is sent to ShakeAlert including the estimated centroid position, length, and strike, and their uncertainties, of an ongoing fault rupture. Rupture estimates are continuously updated as new data arrives.\nAs part of a joint effort between USGS Menlo Park, ETH Zurich, and Caltech, we have rewritten FinDer in C++ to obtain a faster and more flexible implementation. One new feature of FinDer II is that multiple contour lines of high-frequency PGA are computed and correlated with templates, allowing the detection of both large earthquakes and much smaller (~ M3.5) events shortly after their nucleation. Unlike previous EEW algorithms, FinDer II thus provides a modeling approach for both small-magnitude point-source and larger-magnitude finite-fault ruptures with consistent error estimates for the entire event magnitude range.",

Previous models suggest these volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits accumulated in extensional basins that were later inverted during Miocene shortening. New mapping results and radiometric age data from the Río Tinguiririca region provide surprising new insights into long-term volcanic arc dynamics and upper crustal shortening history that challenge previous models of Cenozoic mountain building at this latitude. The Abanico Formation, exceeding ~3.6 km in local composite thickness, is composed of rhyolitic tuffs, intermediate to mafic lavas, and interbedded volcaniclastic deposits. 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb zircon age data from volcanic intervals span the Late Cretaceous through Miocene (~74-11 Ma). The lower Abanico Formation (~74-36 Ma) records the slow accumulation of volcanic deposits (~35 m/Myr) with little evidence for syndepositional faulting, suggesting strata did not accumulate in active, tectonically-controlled basins. In contrast, the upper Abanico Formation (~36-11 Ma) locally preserves growth strata recording contractional deformation that initiated by the late Eocene and continued through the late Miocene, coeval with continued volcanism. A system of dextral and sinistral oblique-slip faults locally displaces the Abanico Formation and older map units, revealing a previously unrecognized strike-slip component to faulting in this region. Results of this study greatly extend the age of the Abanico Formation into the Late Cretaceous, forcing significant revision to its long-accepted Oligo-Miocene age and associated arc volcanism. The data also significantly revise previous models of Miocene inversion tectonics, identifying an Eo-Miocene transpressive component to Andean orogenesis tied to oblique plate convergence near 35°S latitude.",

In this study, we have analyzed the propagation condition of an obliquely propagating coherent wave, and have developed a wave model with the whistler-mode dispersion relation. Solving the equations of motion of relativistic electrons interacting with the wave, we perform test particle simulations of energetic electrons along the Earth’s inner magnetosphere field line to reveal the interactions between oblique whistler-mode waves and energetic electrons. By confirming that the Poynting vector of oblique whistler-mode wave is nearly parallel to the background magnetic field, we apply gyro-averaging method, which just treat particle motion as its guiding center motion to simplify the complicated cyclotron motion and reduce the simulation system from 2 dimension to 1 dimension. This method was successfully exanimated in a recent study [1]. We can achieve higher numerical efficiency through this gyro-averaging method than the method which we directly solved the 2 dimensional equations of motion. In the simulation, the energetic electrons undergo multiple cyclotron resonances. The simulation result shows the validity of gyro-averaging method, how the waves trap and accelerate the energetic electrons, and how the waves develop after the interactions.\n",

Tomographic velocity model is used to calculate statics or further input to waveform inversion in exploration geophysics. In the traveltime tomography, Tikhonov regularization always produces a model with highly smooth structures. However, the real underground structure may not be smooth. Since traveltime tomography is an inverse problem which is often ill-posed and non-unique, it suffers from a multi-solution problem. Smoothing may help to reduce its non-uniqueness. To produce a velocity model that is reliable and also offers high resolution, we develop a new alternative edge-preserving traveltime tomography based on sparse model constraint. This new methodology is based on a hypothesis that velocity model can be represented sparsely in a known basis. In our synthetic and real data test, we choose orthogonal wavelet basis created by ‘symN’ as the sparse transform matrix. We provide two different alternative schemes, and one can choose one scheme or combine two schemes according to one’s request, like the sharpness degree of the inversion result. We estimate the effect of the new method by applying it to synthetic and real data respectively. The results show that this method can provide an image with sharper boundary in the same data fitting level comparing with the conventional traveltime tomography.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that satellites are always in danger in space and especially high-energy radiation damages them. One of the sources that cause them is the radiation belt (the Van Allen belt). It was thought to be static, but in the 1990s it rediscovered the radiation belt fluctuates greatly. There are some reasons to occur this phenomenon, but we have not understood a clear reason of this yet. On the other hand, it is well known that the energetic particle flux vary during geomagnetic disturbances and the relativistic electrons in the other radiation belt change with solar wind speed.\nNow we are trying to develop the satellite (ERG) to reveal this mechanism. ERG (Energization and Radiation in Geospace) satellite is the small space science platform for rapid investigation and test satellite of JAXA/ISAS. This satellite will be lanched in 2016. Our group is developing the instrument (the XEP-e) to measure high-energy electrons (400keV~20MeV), that is one of many ERG satellite instruments. The XEP-e (eXtremely high Energy Plasma/ particle sensor for electron) is consists of the 5 SSDs (Solid-State Silicon Detectors) and a GSO single crystal scintillator. It has one-way conic sight and an electric part is unified with a part of sensor that is covered with aluminum to protect from contaminationand and an anti-scintillator to detect it. The front part of the SSDs discriminate a radiation enters into the sensor and the back part of the plastic scintillator get the value of its energy. We can get the data of high-energy electron by using this sensor and it will be useful to reveal the detail of the radiation belt’s fluctuation.",

The Hg in wet deposition was measured over a 3-year period in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The volume-weighted mean (VWM) total Hg (HgT) concentration was somewhat lower than those reported in other regions of the Tibetan Plateau, but the VWM methyl-Hg concentration and deposition flux were among the highest globally reported values. The VWM HgT concentration was higher in the non-monsoon season than in the monsoon season, and wet HgT deposition was dominated by the precipitation amount rather than the scavenging of atmospheric Hg by precipitation. The dominant Hg species in precipitation was mainly in the form of dissolved Hg, which indicates the pivotal role of reactive gaseous Hg within-cloud scavenging of wet Hg deposition. Moreover, an increasing trend in the precipitation Hg concentrations was synchronous with the recent economic development in South Asia.",

The GlabTop model coupled with ArcGIS using Digital Elevation Model (DEM), glacier outline and branch lines relating with surface slope, elevation difference, shape factor and basal stress to estimate spatial ice thickness distribution, volume and approximation of bed topography on Mera Glacier in Hinku Valley, Solukhumbu district. The estimated ice thickness value is then compared with field data measured by ground penetrating radar which shows ± 25 % uncertainty in estimated ice thickness. The model is applied on three large glaciers in Khumbu region viz. Ngozumpa, Khumbu and Imja Glaciers. The ice thickness spatially distributed in three glaciers ranges from ~ 0 m at the glacier outline or moraine to ~ 360 m in the lower flat region of glacier valley at an elevation range of 4500 – 5500 m a.s.l. The bed topography reveals that there is no large deepening or possible sites for the formation of large lakes after glacier retreats except in Ngozumpa Glacier, whereas in Imja Glacier, existing glacier lake can further expand up to ~ 4 km in the Lhotse-Sar Glacier and ~ 2.5 km in the Imja Glacier. Sensitivity analysis is performed by modifying the two scaling parameters, shape factor and basal stress. The model performed very well when shape factor is 0.8 and basal stress is 150 kPa (1.5 bar) while comparing with field investigated ice thickness data.\nIn an another attempt thermal band of Landsat 8 satellite data and debris energy balance model are used to estimate debris thickness distribution on Lirung Glacier in Langtang Valley. With this new technique it is found that the debris thickness of Lirung Glacier varies from around 93 cm in the terminus and about 27 cm in the upper part of the glacier. Based on the debris thickness estimations, average daily melt is found 5.3 mm w.e. d-1 in the upper part and 1.2 mm w.e. d-1 near terminus of the glacier which are well corresponded with observed ice melt under corresponding debris thickness.",

            "abstract": "Principal component analysis is a well-established technique in paleomagnetism, and provides a means to estimate magnetic remanence directions from stepwise demagnetization data. Derived directions constrain past geomagnetic field behavior and form the foundation of chronological reconstructions. Principal component analysis does not, however, lend itself to the quantification of uncertainties associated with estimated directions. Thus, inferences drawn from paleomagnetic reconstructions suffer from an inability to propagate uncertainties from individual specimens to higher levels, such as mean directions and pole positions. Additionally, the relatively small number of demagnetization data points used to quantify remanence directions for an individual specimen can result in unstable or distorted principal component solutions. We will show how a probabilistic reformulation of principal component analysis can be used to rigorously quantify uncertainties associated with remanence directions estimated from demagnetization data. These uncertainties can be propagated readily through each step of a paleomagnetic reconstruction to provide rigorous quantification of uncertainties for all stages of the data interpretation sequence. Proper uncertainty determination helps to protect against spurious inferences being drawn from uncertain data.",

            "abstract": "Laboratory measurements of fault rock rheology are commonly performed on individual components of complex natural systems. Textural and structural inferences from outcrop observations provide one means to constrain the co-operative behaviour of multi-component natural fault systems. For example, the principal slip zone (PSZ) of New Zealand’s central Alpine Fault comprises a 1-10 cm thick sandwich of impermeable smectite-bearing ultracataclasite/gouge layers between higher permeability hanging wall cataclasite and footwall gravel (Boulton et al., 2012, doi: 10.1029/2011GC003872). Based solely on measured mechanical properties we expect earthquake ruptures to nucleate and propagate in the cataclasites rather than the PSZ. However, the PSZ gouge was preferentially comminuted so it must localise slip, and injection veins penetrate from it into the surrounding formation. This suggests that the gouge experiences coseismic pressurization and weakening, possible if slip is confined to one layer within the impermeable (thus undrained) gouge. On the southern Alpine Fault a clear PSZ is not well-developed; instead a wide shear zone crops out (Barth et al., 2013, doi: 10.1002/tect.20041). Mechanical data again demonstrate frictionally weak, velocity strengthening, low permeability materials, compatible with a creeping shear zone, but PSZ materials display velocity weakening behaviour at high slip rates if undrained, from which we infer seismic slip is possible in nature. Extensive paleoseismic records suggest the structure has accommodated regularly repeating earthquakes for the last 17 kyr (Berryman et al., 2013, doi: 10.1126/science.1218959). Our newly gathered geodetic datasets may resolve this apparent slip rate paradox. In situ measurements from active fault systems can also help interpret experimental data. For example, in material recovered from around the active slip zone of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, experiments suggest lower frictional strength for undrained than drained shear (Ujiie et al., 2013, doi: 10.1126/1243485). Perturbation of in situ thermal structure is consistent with the experimentally-measured friction in a partially undrained case, from which we infer that thermal pressurization also affects this fault in nature (Fulton et al., 2013, doi: 10.1126/1243641).",

            "abstract": "In this study we analyze the abundances of suprathermal heavy ions in 75 Corotating Interaction Region (CIR) events between January 1st 1995 and December 31st 2008. We correlate the heavy ion abundances in these CIRs with those measured in the solar wind and suprathermal populations upstream of these events. Our analysis reveals that the CIR suprathermal heavy ion abundances vary by nearly two orders of magnitude over the solar activity cycle, with higher abundances (e.g., Fe/O) occurring during solar maximum and depleted values occurring during solar minimum. The abundances are also energy dependent, with larger abundances at higher energies, particularly during solar maximum. Following the method used by Mason et al. 2008, we correlate the CIR abundances with the corresponding solar wind and suprathermal values measured during 6-hour intervals for upstream periods spanning 10 days prior to the start of each CIR event. This correlation reveals that suprathermal heavy ions are better correlated with upstream suprathermal abundances measured at the same energy compared with the solar wind heavy ion abundances. Using the 6-hour averaging method, we also identified timeframes of maximum correlation between the CIR and the upstream suprathermal abundances, and find that the time of maximum correlation depends on the energy of the suprathermal ions. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of previous studies of CIR and suprathermal particles, and CIR seed populations and acceleration mechanisms.",

Faculty development workshops have been conducted to prepare and educate a cadre of faculty from different disciplines in global climate science literacy. Following the workshops, the faculty participants have integrated climate literacy tenets into their existing curriculum. Follow up meetings have helped the faculty members to use specific content in their curriculum such as greenhouse gases, atmospheric CO2, sea level rise, etc. Additional training provided to the faculty participants in pedagogical methods of climate change instruction to identify common misconceptions and barriers to student understanding.\nSome pre-service teachers were engaged in summer internships and learned how to become messenger of climate change science by the state parks staff during the summer. Workshops were offered to other pre-service teachers to teach them specific climate change topics with enhanced hands-on laboratory activities. The participants were provided examples of lesson plans and guided to develop their own lesson plans and present them. Various pedagogical methods have been explored for teaching climate change content to the participants. The pre-service teachers found the climate content very challenging and confusing. Training activities were modified to focus on targeted topics and modeling of pedagogical techniques for the faculty and pre-service teachers. Program evaluation confirms that the workshop participant show improved understanding of the workshop materials by the participants if they were introduced few climate topics. Learning how to use hands-on learning tools and preparing lesson plans are two of the challenges successfully implemented by the pre-service teachers. Our next activity includes pre-service teachers to use their lesson plans to teach the climate change content in the middle school science classes. This will mutually help the middle school science teachers’ to learn and use the materials provided by the pre-service teachers and also pre-service teachers’ to improve their teaching skills on climate change content.",

In this study, we present a new turbulent dispersion model for large-scale dilute flows with suspended sediment. Three time scales are considered in the model: particle response time, fluid turbulence time scale, and Kolmogorov time scale. Two Stokes numbers are defined using these three time scales: one for large eddies and the other for small eddies. The new turbulent dispersion model considers the effects of both large-scale and small-scale (Kolmogorov-scale) eddies on turbulent dispersion by parametrizing Schmidt number using these two Stokes numbers. The new model is validated against experimental data available for flows with suspended sediment in open channels under a wide range of conditions for two-phase dilute flows.",

            "abstract": "Two key features of the lowermost Earth’s mantle are the presence of the large low shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs), which may be reservoirs of primordial, chemically distinct material, and the phase change from perovskite (pv) to post-perovskite (ppv), which may occur at lowermost mantle conditions. However, the influence of this phase change on the shape, dynamics, and stability of chemically distinct reservoirs are not well constrained. Here we performed numerical experiments of thermo-chemical convection in 2-D spherical annulus geometry to investigate the effects on thermo-chemical structure in the lower mantle of three parameters affecting the pPv phase change: the core-mantle (CMB) temperature, the viscosity ratio between pv and pPv, and the Clapeyron slope of the pPv phase transition. Our results indicate that increasing CMB temperature increases the wavelength of the primordial reservoirs by preventing the phase transition from pv to pPv to occur. Furthermore, a high CMB temperature promotes the development of plumes outside the reservoirs of primordial material. High CMB temperature and large Clapeyron slope both favor the formation of pPv patches and of a double-crossing of the phase boundary, thus preventing the formation of continuous layer of pPv above the CMB. Combined with a low CMB temperature and/or a low Clapeyron slope of the pPv phase transition, a full layer of weak pPv above CMB strongly enhances the mixing efficiency of primordial material with ambient regular mantle material, which may not allow the generation of large reservoirs. Based on our experiments, we conclude that the models of convection best describing the Earth’s mantle dynamics include a large pPv Clapeyron slope (typically in the range of 13-16 MPa/K), and a moderate CMB temperature (around 3750 K). We also find that the phase change from pv to pPv may occur within the large reservoirs in the form of small discontinuous patches at the base when using critical values of CMB temperature a little bit above the low bound, which need to be examined by high-resolution seismological observations.",

            "abstract": "The fore-arc mantle above a subducting slab is a unique site where complex partial melting, melt/fluid–rock interaction, and deformation of mantle rocks occur. To constrain these processes, we analyzed the deformation microstructures, crystal preferred orientations (CPO), and water content in natural harzburgites that occur as exhumed massifs in the North Qilian suture zone, NW China. These harzburgites are very fresh, and have mineral assemblages of olivine (~81‒87 vol.%), orthopyroxene (~11‒17 vol.%), clinopyroxene (~1‒2 vol. %), and spinel (~1 vol.%). Detailed analyses of mineral textures, CPO patterns, and rotation axis distributions suggested that the plastic deformation of olivine and pyroxene were accommodated by activating a series of slip systems of dislocation. The olivine (A-/D-type fabric) showed dominant (010)[100] and/or (001)[100] slip systems, as well as other minor [100]-glide, {0kl}[100], and [001]-glide slip systems. The orthopyroxene showed dominant (100)[001] and subordinate (010)[001] slip systems, with minor (100)[010], (100)[0vw] slip systems. The water content was extremely low in the orthopyroxene (38‒44 wt. ppm), equilibrated olivine (4‒7 wt. ppm), and bulk-rock samples (9‒14 wt. ppm). Integrated with the previously reported refractory mineral and whole-rock compositions (Song et al., 2009), as well as the estimated low pressure (~1‒2 GPa), high temperature (~1100‒1300 °C), low stress (~1‒4 MPa), and water-poor conditions of deformation, it is concluded that these harzburgites represent a remnant of a fossil fore-arc lithospheric mantle which was probably both formed and deformed in a young and warm fore-arc mantle setting (i.e. infant subduction zone). Based on these results, a refined schematic model of olivine fabric distributions in subduction zones was proposed. In this model, the opposing polarizing directions of A-/D-type olivine fabrics (prevalent in the fore-arc lithospheric mantle) with other underlying anisotropic sources in a mantle wedge (e.g., B-type olivine fabrics) may weaken the trench-parallel fast S-wave anisotropy contributed by the deformed fore-arc mantle, and thus provide an alternative explanation for the short or nearly null delay times of local shear-wave splitting that have been detected in some fore-arc regions.",

            "abstract": "During the last century, many large irrigation projects have been initiated in arid lands worldwide. Despite a tremendous increase in food production, a common problem when characterizing these zones is land degradation in form of waterlogging. As results, large volumes of water are lost due to surplus irrigation in regions where water availability is extremely challenging for both population survival and economic development. The Nubariya depression, Western Desert (Egypt), is a clear example of this mechanism. Following the reclamation of desert lands for agricultural production, an artificial brackish and contaminated lake developed in the area in the late 1990s and presently extends for about 2.5 km2. Available data provide evidence of a simultaneous general deterioration of the groundwater system. With the main objectives of understanding the hydrological evolution of the area, characterizing the hydrogeological setting and developing scenarios for artificial aquifer remediation and recharge, an extensive hydrogeophysical investigation was carried out in this challenging environment using Magnetic Resonance Sounding (MRS, also called surface NMR) and ground-based Transient EM (TEM). The integrated interpretation of the geophysical surveys, properly calibrated with a number of boreholes, provides a clear hydrogeological picture of the upper 100 m sedimentary structure, in terms of both lithology and groundwater quality. The information is then used to set up a regional groundwater flow and a local density-dependent flow and transport numerical model to reproduce the past evolution of the aquifer system and develop a few scenarios for artificial aquifer recharge using the treated waters provided by a nearby waste-water treatment plant. The research outcomes point the hydrological challenges that emerge for an effective management of water resources in reclaimed desert areas and highlight the effectiveness of integrating advanced geophysical and modeling methodologies.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics over glaciers are of great interest as they can modify the response of glacier mass balance to large scale climate forcing. A key feature of the glacier ABL is formation of katabatic winds driven by turbulent sensible heat exchange with a cooler underlying ice surface. These winds can markedly alter the spatio-temporal distribution of air temperature over glacier surfaces from the environmental lapse rate, which in turn affects the distribution of melt. An intensive field campaign was conducted over 13 days in June 2015 at Athabasca Glacier, an outlet of Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains of Canada. Multiple automatic weather stations, eddy covariance systems, distributed temperature sensors, SODAR and kite profiling systems were used to characterise how the glacier ABL evolved spatially and temporally, how the differences in glacier ABL properties were related to valley and regional circulation and what effect these differences had on surface lapse rates. In general strong daytime down-glacier winds were observed over the glacier. These winds extended well beyond the glacier into the proglacial area and through the depth of lower ice-free valley. On most days wind speed was consistent or increasing through to the top of the above-glacier profiles (100 to 200 m), indicating a quite well mixed surface boundary layer. A wind speed maximum in the lowest few metres above the glacier surface, characteristic of a katabatic wind, was only observed on one day. The dominant circulation within the valley appears to be what could be termed an ‘icefield breeze’; strong down-glacier winds driven by mesoscale pressure gradients that are set up by differential suface heating over the non-glaciated valleys and much the larger Columbia Icefield upstream of the glacier. The effect of the different circulations on lapse rates will be explored with a view to developing variable lapse rates for modelling glacier mass balance.",

Analysis of \"end-member\" areas known to be dominated by human-induced earthquakes (the Geyser geothermal field in northern California and TauTona gold mine in South Africa) and regular tectonic activity (the San Jacinto fault zone in southern California and Coso region excluding the Coso geothermal field in eastern central California) reveals several distinguishing characteristics. Induced seismicity is shown to have (i) higher rate of background events (both absolute and relative to the total rate), (ii) faster temporal offspring decay, (iii) higher intensity of repeating events, (iv) larger proportion of small clusters, and (v) larger spatial separation between parent and offspring, compared to regular tectonic activity.

            "abstract": "Human activities in urban regions are the largest contributors to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, and CO2 is the dominant species emitted, creating large variations that are easily observed. As governments continue to sign treaties limiting emissions in order to curb global warming, they must understand the temporal distribution of the signals. Bottom-up inventories account for emissions at all times of day from various sectors but are based only on economic data, with no observational confirmation. Top-down observations from satellites generally record variations at one time of day only a few times per month for any given location. Therefore we must use long-term in situ measurements to develop higher temporal resolution data sets. Attributing the observed emissions to different sources requires modeling using bottom-up emission data products and/or isotopic and tracer/tracer ratio measurements. Here we report results of two years (June 2013 – June 2015) of hourly average measurements of CO, CO2, and δ13C from Pasadena, CA, to examine diurnal and seasonal variations in emissions from the biosphere and from natural gas and petroleum combustion. COxs/CO2xs (excess over background) values can be used to determine the amount of fossil fuel-derived CO2 relative to that from the biosphere. We calibrate this with mid-afternoon data using radiocarbon. We then use continuous measurements of ð13C to differentiate between petroleum and natural gas combustion, which are characterized by distinct isotopic compositions. The results of this study show that the relative amounts of emissions of the three sources are different at different times of day as well as different times of year.",

Using an absorbing-generating boundary condition developed by Van Dongeren and Svendsen(1997), model coupling and integration is achieved. Characteristic variables(i.e., Riemann invariants) in MOST are converted to non-characteristic variables for Boussinesq solver without any loss of physical consistency. Established modelling system has been validated through typical test problems to realistic tsunami events. Simulated results reveal good performance of developed modelling system. Since coupled modelling system provides advantageous flexibility feature during implementation, great efficiencies and accuracies are expected to be gained through spot-focusing application of Boussinesq model inside the entire domain of tsunami propagation.",

            "abstract": "Coesite (space group C2/c) is a high-pressure polymorph of quartz. The behavior of coesite under pressure has long been of interest due to its abundance in the Earth’s crust and mantle, and its relative simple chemistry but rich polymorphisms under elevated pressure and/or temperature conditions. A most recent Raman spectroscopy study reported two pressure-induced phase transitions at ~23 (coesite-II) and ~35 GPa, respectively. To further understand the properties of these pressure-induced phase transitions, we conducted X-ray diffraction experiments starting with coesite powder in a diamond anvil cell up to 31 GPa, and performed first-principle calculations on coesite, coesite-II (space group P21/n), and stishovite at 0 K up to 45 GPa. X-ray diffraction data show the formation of coesite-II at pressures above 20 GPa, which is consistent with first principles calculations that the enthalpy of coesite-II becomes lower than that of coesite above 21.4 GPa. Coesite is very anisotropic with the a-axis twice more compressible than the b- and c-axis. By comparison, coesite-II is less anisotropic, with a similar compressibility in a-, b-, and c-axis. As analyzed by a third-order Eulerian finite strain equation of state, the bulk modulus of coesite at 21.4 GPa is 180.6 GPa, and that of coesite-II is 140.8 GPa, indicating that coesite-II is much more compressible than coesite. If coesite-coesite-II transition occurs in cold subduction zones, it will change the elasticity as well as anisotropic properties of the subducted MORB, due to the different compressional behavior between coesite and coesite-II.",

            "abstract": "Forest inventory has evolved from standard stem diameter-height relationships, to coarse canopy metrics, to more involved ecologically-meaningful variables, such as leaf area index (LAI) and even canopy radiative transfer as a function of canopy gaps, leaf clumping, and leaf angle distributions. Accurate and precise measurement of the latter set of variables presents a challenge to the ecological and modeling communities; however, relatively novel remote sensing modalities, e.g., waveform lidar (wlidar) and terrestrial lidar systems (TLS), have the potential to adress this challenge. Research teams at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) have been collaborating with the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) to assess vegetation canopy structure and variation at the University of Michigan Biological Research Station and the NEON Northeast domain (Harvard Forest, MA). Airborne small-footprint wlidar data, in-situ TLS data, and first-principles, physics-based simulation tools are being used to study (i) the impact of vegetation canopy geometric elements on wlidar signals (twigs and petioles have been deemed negligible), (ii) the analysis of airborne wlidar data for top-down assessment of canopy metrics such as LAI, and (iii) our ability to extract “bottom-up” canopy structure from TLS using scans registered to each other using a novel marker-free registration approach (e.g., basal area: R2=0.82, RMSE=7.43 m2/ha). Such studies indicate that we can potentially assess radiative transfer through vegetation canopies remotely using a vertically-stratified approach with wlidar, and augment such an approach via rapid-scan TLS technology to gain a better understanding of fine-scale variation in canopy structure. This in turn is key to quantifying and modeling radiative transfer based on understanding of forest canopy structural change as a function of ecosystem development, climate, and anthropogenic drivers.",

            "abstract": "Glyoxal and methylglyoxal are good tracers to evaluate the chemistry of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere and are important precursors for the production of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in aqueous phase. Here we report seasonal and interannual variations of aerosol-phase glyoxal and methylglyoxal over sub-decadal scale (2001-2008) in ambient aerosols collected at Gosan, Jeju Island in the East China Sea. Glyoxal concentrations ranged from 0.06 to 106 ng m-3, with a peak in January. Concentrations of methylglyoxal ranged from 0.05 to 110 ng m-3 with a peak in April. The glyoxal peak is related with carbon monoxide and levoglucosan whereas methylglyoxal peak aligns with ozone. These results suggest an elevated combustion sources of glyoxal in January and secondary sources of methylglyoxal in April. A pronounced seasonal variation was observed for methylglyoxal to glyoxal ratios with maximum in summer followed by spring, autumn and winter, suggesting methyglyoxal to glyoxal ratio is an effective proxy to evaluate the strength of biogenic versus anthropogenic sources of organic aerosol in East Asia. Overall, concentrations of glyoxal from 2001 to 2008 increased by at least 29% per year in winter and 83% per year in spring, being consistent with the increase of ozone, carbon monoxide, and biogenic and anthropogenic VOCs in East Asia. We propose that the increased glyoxal and methylglyoxal could be related to an enhanced SOA production by their reactive uptake in aqueous phase over East Asia.",

A better understanding of the variability of flooded resting and feeding sites is needed over the large areas traveled by these birds, particularly in inland areas subject to cyclical droughts. We analyzed habitat availability patterns in the Sacramento Valley, an internationally important shorebird stopover site, using low cloud cover scenes during spring migration (February – June) from the 30-year Landsat Climate Data Record. We found that a simple band 5 threshold efficiently delineated open water over the past thirty years of surface reflectance data (Landsat 4-8). A random forest model for flooded and non-flooded regions (AUC = 0.9997444) and ROC optimization were used to determine the best threshold for the analysis. Using the time series of classifications, we assessed historical flooded habitat availability within each two week period during spring over the past 30 years. Flood irrigated agriculture on private lands represents the largest potential habitat area and consistently provides habitat at the early and late stages of migration. Rice alone represents five times the area of herbaceous wetlands and has a comparable probability of inundation as this wetland type in early spring (0.3). Flood extent is most restricted during the peak of spring migration when birds most need the habitat, which is limited primarily to federal and state managed lands (average 0.78 probability of inundation). The timing of drying and reflooding in agricultural fields could strongly influence habitat availability in the valley during the spring.",

In recent years, besides the growth of conventional hydrocarbon resources being rapidly utilized, the exploration of unconventional deposits is getting more and more important. Since Taiwan has a strong energy demand and still highly relied on imported fossil fuel, the development of unconventional gas resources needs to be considered. This research discussed the relationship among characteristics and thermal maturity of different organic material versus their hydrocarbon potential. In order to compare the compositional effects from different organic material, torbanites from Huangxian basin, China and Miocene humic coal from Chuhuangkeng Anticline (one of the most productive oil and gas fields), Taiwan were examined and compared. Torbanites from China had relatively low maturation with vitrinite reflectance 0.38~0.51%, whereas the maturation of humic coal from Chuhuangkeng Anticline are a little bit higher with vitrinite reflectance 0.55~0.6%, plus some methane explored. Methods of study include petrographic analysis, vitrinite reflectance measurement (Ro%), Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and other geochemical parameters. The conclusions were derived after comparing experimental results and the regional geologic information of samples studied. In conclude, sample from China is type I kerogen, and its organic matter is mostly algae, whereas the humic coal sample from Taiwan belongs to type III kerogen. The analytic results indicate that the characteristics organic matters affect their maturity. Even though the thermal history and depositional environments are different in Taiwan and China, their organic micelles still exhibit a similar trend in the process of coalification. The role of maceral composition played in HC potential needs to be considered in future shale gas exploration.",

            "abstract": "Since energy demand is still increasing in the world, the exploration of unconventional fossil fuel becomes more and more important today. Miaoli area of the NW Western Foothill Belt, Taiwan, had been a major oil and gas producing field in the past, important oil/gas producing structures include Tiechenshen, Chinshui and Chuhuangkeng anticline. The reservoir rocks of unconventional resources need to be examined to illustrate the remaining hydrocarbon potential of Chuhuangkeng anticline. A standard evaluation procedure for assessing integrated geochemical parameters can thus be established. In this study, we combine various geochemical parameters including TOC, porosity, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, vitrinite reflectance measurement to assess the HC potential of shale gas reservoirs. The results show that Wuchishan and Mushan Formations possess the best hydrocarbon potential in Chuhuangkeng anticline. The maturation of Wuchishan and Mushan Formations are both in oil window (Ro of Wuchishan formation =1.7% , Ro of Mushan =1.01~1.53% ). The maturation of Shitih Formation barely reached oil window, however the shallower depth and less exploration cost are the advantages of Shitih Formation. Moreover, Wuchishan Formation is a dry gas field and Mushan Formation is a condensate gas field. The results of porosity show that there are secondary porosity existed in Mushan Formation which provides the extra storage space for hydrocarbon. Additionally, Piling Shale is a good cap rock on top of Mushan formation, it further benefits the conservation of oil and gas in Mushan Formation. In conclude, Mushan Formation is the most potential HC target in future shale gas exploration.",

            "abstract": "The teleseismic receiver function is defined as the radial component of P wave being deconvoluted from the vertical component of the earthquakes with magnitude larger than 5.5 at teleseismic distances. It has successfully been applied in resolving the structure of the crust and upper mantle in many regions. The receiver function can also be used to determine the thickness of sedimentary basin. However the corner frequency of the P waves from the teleseismic events (M>5.5) is relatively low and the high frequency content in the teleseismic P waves is attenuated, thus, the teleseismic receiver function is usually not sufficient to reveal details of sedimentary basin structure. Instead, local small earthquake (~ M3) generates P waves of short duration waveforms with high frequency content, which can be used to calculate receiver functions (called local receiver function). As a case study, we study waveform data from local earthquakes in Oklahoma. We first explore feasibility of local receiver function for different magnitude, focal depth, epicentral distance, filtering band and time window length. After local receiver functions are computed, we search the best velocity model to fit the local receiver function waveforms with the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm which is a global optimization method. We invert the sedimentary basin structure in Oklahoma and find that this method is suitable for other area for the sedimentary basin structure where local seismic waveforms are available.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric transport and mixing plays an important role in the global energy balance and the distribution of health-related chemical constituents. Previous studies suggest a close linkage between large-scale transport and Rossby wave breaking (RWB). In this work, we use the GFDL spectral dynamical core to investigate this relationship and study the response of RWB-related transport in different climate scenarios.\nIn a standard control run, we quantify the contribution of RWB to the total transport and mixing of an idealized tracer. In addition, we divide the contribution further into the two types of RWB – anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) and cyclonic wave breaking (CWB) -- and contrast their efficiency at transport and mixing. Our results are compared to a previous study in which the transport ability of the two types of RWB is studied for individual baroclinic wave life-cycles.\nIn a series of sensitivity runs, we study the response of RWB-related transport and mixing to various states of the jet streams. The responses of the mean strength, frequency, and the efficiency of RWB-related transport are documented and the implications for the transport and mixing in a warmer climate are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Geochemistry observations typically follow a complex preparation process after sample retrieval from the field. Description of these are required to allow readers and other data users to assess the reliability of the data produced, and to ensure reproducibility. While laboratory notebooks are used for private record-keeping, and laboratory information systems (LIMS) on a facility basis, this data is not generally published, and there are no standard formats for transfer. And while there is some standardization of workflows, this is often scoped to a lab, or an instrument. New procedures and workflows are being developed continually - in fact this is a key expectation in the development of the science. Thus formalization of the description of sample preparation and observations must be both rigorous and flexible.\nWe have been exploring the use of the W3C Provenance model (PROV) to capture complete traces, including both the real world things and the data generated. PROV has a core data model that distinguishes between entities, agents and activities involved in producing a piece of data or thing in the world. While the design of PROV was primarily conditioned by stories concerning information resources, application is not restricted to the production of digital or information assets. PROV allowing a comprehensive trace of predecessor entities and transformations at any level of detail. In this paper we demonstrate the use of PROV for describing specimens managed for scientific observations. Two examples are considered: a geological sample which undergoes a typical preparation process for measurements of the concentration of a particular chemical substance, and the collection, taxonomic classification and eventual publication of an insect specimen.\nPROV enables the material that goes into the instrument to be linked back to the sample retrieved in the field. This complements the IGSN system, which focuses on registration of field sample identity to support the correlation of results from different investigations on the same samples. Together with the sampling model from OGC O&M these provide a rigorous and flexible system for formalizing geochemistry observation metadata.",

            "abstract": "In 2014, IODP Expedition 350 drilled a 1806.5 m deep hole at Site U1437 in the Izu Bonin rear arc. The Site presents an unusual deep methanogenesis zone because of a release of sulfate below the sulfate reduction zone (27-83 mbsf) which may buffer methanogenesis by anaerobic methanogens. Methane abundance gradually increases with depth, with significant abundance at ~750-1459 mbsf with a maximum value at 920 mbsf.\nThe rock magnetic study carried out in Hole U1437D from ~775 to ~1000 mbsf shows a drastic change of the magnetic properties at ~850 mbsf coincidently with a stronger release of methane from < 60 ppm at 841 mbsf to ~300 ppm at 854 mbsf. That also corresponds to a depth interval where no core was recovered (~846-854 mbsf). For the sake of clarity, we call hereafter zone A the depth interval above this non-recovered interval (775-846 mbsf) and zone B the interval below (854-1000 mbsf). Both belong to the same lithostratigraphic unit composed of tuffaceous mudstones intercalated with volcanoclastics. In the zone A, NRM, magnetic susceptibility, ARM, SIRM, HIRM display high values. In the zone B, these parameters show much lower values of one order of magnitude less, except for the interval 936-950 mbsf that corresponds to a local maximum (but still lower values than the zone A). Besides, the rock magnetic parameters for grain size and coercivity, such as ARM/χ, S-ratio and Bcr do not show any variations throughout the entire studied interval, although S-ratio displays slightly lower values from ~850 to ~930 mbsf. Grains are low coercivity pseudo-single domain sized.\nAccording to the present data, two preliminary hypotheses can be proposed to explain the observations. 1) The non-recovered interval between the zones A and B can be caused by the presence of a sedimentary hiatus and/or a fault, which may be consistent with the observed change in sedimentation rate. 2) No hiatus in the sedimentation. The changes in the magnetic properties can be explained by a decreasing content of the ferrimagnetic minerals. The observation of iron sulfides in the zone B (mainly pyrite) suggests pyritization with the transformation of the detrital ferrimagnetic minerals into pyrite, driven by a deep AOM (anaerobic oxidation of methane) reaction. We will discuss the details of the geochemical interpretation together with the rock magnetic results.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) inputs to the landscape have been linked previously to N loads exported from watersheds at the national scale; however, stream N concentration is arguably more relevant than N load for drinking water quality, freshwater biological responses and establishment of nutrient criteria. In this study, we combine national-scale anthropogenic N input data, including synthetic fertilizer, crop biological N fixation, manure applied to farmland, atmospheric N deposition, and point source inputs, with data from the 2008-09 National Rivers and Streams Assessment to quantify the relationship between N inputs and in-stream concentrations of total N (TN), dissolved inorganic N (DIN), and total organic N (TON) (calculated as TN – DIN). In conjunction with simple linear regression, we use multiple regression to understand how watershed and stream reach attributes modify the effect of N inputs on N concentrations. Median TN was 0.50 mg N L-1 with a maximum of 25.8 mg N L-1. Total N inputs ranged from less than 1 to 196 kg N ha-1 y-1, with a median of 14.4 kg N ha-1 y-1. Atmospheric N deposition was the single largest anthropogenic N source in the majority of sites, but agricultural sources generally dominate total N inputs in sites with elevated N concentrations. The sum of all N inputs were positively correlated with concentrations of all forms of N [r2 = 0.44, 0.43, and 0.18 for TN, DIN, and TON, respectively (all log-transformed), n = 1112], indicating that watershed N inputs are strongly related to stream N concentrations during the summer, despite this being a biologically active and N-retentive period. Additionally, model results suggest that watershed characteristics like wetland area, riparian disturbance and forest cover moderate the effects of watershed N loading on in-stream N concentrations, and different forms of N are likely to respond differently to increasing agricultural and atmospheric N inputs depending on local watershed characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Recent high-resolution geodetic observations revealed the occurrence of various slow slip events (SSEs) along the Hikurangi subduction plate interfaces. Long-term SSEs with a duration of 1.5 years (e.g., Manawatu SSEs) occur at the deeper portion of the Hikurangi subduction zone, and shallow short-term SSEs with a duration of 1–3 weeks occur along the northern and central parts of the subduction zone. Wallace et al. (2012) reported a sequence of simultaneous short-term and long-term SSEs along the Hikurangi subduction zone during 2010–2011. In the present study, we perform quasi-dynamic modeling on short-term and long-term SSEs along the Hikurangi subduction zone using a rate- and state-dependent friction law, while assigning realistic configurations of the plate interface. Based on the study of interseismic coupling by Wallace et al. (2009), we set the seismogenic zone where a-b is negative. We reproduce the long-term Manawatu SSEs and short-term shallow SSEs by setting the effective stress of these zones at 2.56 MPa and 0.48–0.64 MPa, respectively. The effective stress of the Manawatu SSE zone is approximately five times larger than that of the short-term SSE zones. However, the ratio of effective stress to critical displacement of the Manawatu SSE zone is smaller than that of the short-term SSE zones. A sequence of simultaneous short-term SSEs and the long-term Manawatu SSE can be reproduced as observed by Wallace et al. (2012). Long-term SSEs often trigger short-term SSEs that are located at the shallower extension of the Manawatu SSE zone. We also investigate the interaction between the SSEs and large earthquakes. A large earthquake nucleates at the southern segment and propagates to the northern narrow seismic zones. Slips occur even at the SSE zones, and these slips contribute to the size of the earthquake. The occurrence of the various slip processes suggests heterogeneous distributions of constitutive law parameters along the Hikurangi subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "From 80’ surface runoff decreased systematically in main Sardinian basins with dramatic consequences on water resources system. Indeed, Sardinian water resources system is regulated by more than 50 main dams, which accumulate runoff during the rainy seasons (Autumn and Winter). The effect is that in last years the water levels in the reservoirs decreased significantly and systematically.\nIn this sense an analysis of the precipitation, temperature and runoff regimes for the whole Sardinia has been performed. We collect an innovative database of rainfall, temperature and runoff observations from 1918 to 2011, including data of more than 400 rain stations, 30 discharge stations and 180 thermometric stations. Hystorical trends are detected using the Mann Kendall, with a significance level of 5%, showing a decrease of the rainfall in the winter period and, more marked, of the runoff, for the whole Sardinia generally, with dramatic consequences for agriculture and water availability. Interestingly, the decrease is more marked for the rain and discharge stations of the Sardinian west coast, exposed to the west european climate dynamics.\nIn this sense, several studies have shown a significant correlation between the main meteorological variables and indices related to fluctuations in global scale, for example NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation). A negative NAO brings to an increased storm activity and rainfall to southern Europe and North Africa.\nWe found high negative correlations between NAO and precipitation and runoff during the winter season, and the correlations decrease with the increase of rain station longitudes. The results show a strong negative correlation at the stations and basins of the Sardinian west coast, which is due to the exposure to the mistral winds and the storm track dynamics. Instead a less negative correlation has been estimated for the east coast stations, due to the impact of the horography that attenuate the large scale atmospheric dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The Ancestral Rocky Mountains (ARM) encompass multiple crustal provinces with characteristic crystallization ages across the central and western US. Two driving mechanisms have been proposed to explain ARM deformation. (1) Ouachita-Marathon collision SE of the ARM uplifts has been linked to an E-to-W sequence of uplift and is consistent with proposed disruption of a larger Paradox-Central Colorado Trough Basin by exhumation of the Uncompahgre Uplift. Initial exhumation of the Amarillo-Wichita Uplift to the east would provide a unique ~530 Ma signal absent from source areas to the SW, and result in initial exhumation of the Ancestral Front Range. (2) Alternatively, deformation due to flat slab subduction along a hypothesized plate boundary to the SW suggests a SW-to-NE younging of exhumation. This hypothesis suggests a SW-derived Grenville signature, and would trigger uplift of the Uncompahgre first.\nWe analyzed depositional environments, sediment dispersal patterns, and sediment and basement zircon U-Pb and (U-Th)/He ages in 3 locations in the Paradox Basin and Central Colorado Trough (CCT). The Paradox Basin exhibits an up-section transition in fluvial style that suggests a decrease in overbank stability and increased lateral migration. Similarly, the CCT records a long-term progradation of depositional environments from marginal marine to fluvial, indicating that sediment supply in both basins outpaced accommodation. Preliminary provenance results indicate little to no input from the Amarillo-Wichita uplift in either basin despite uniformly westward sediment dispersal systems in both basins. Results also show that the Uncompahgre Uplift was the source for sediment throughout Paradox Basin deposition. These observations are inconsistent with the predictions of scenario 1 above. Rather, they suggest either a synchronous response to tectonic stress across the ARM provinces or an SW-to-NE pattern of deformation.",

            "abstract": "Fukushima Dai-ichi NPP accident has resulted in release into the environment of large amounts of 134Cs and 137Cs and in radioactive contamination of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In Fukushima prefecture up to 2/3 of the most contaminated territory is covered with forests, and understanding of its further fate in the forest ecosystems is essential for elaboration of the long-term forestry strategy. At the early stage, radiocesium was intercepted by the trees’ canopies. Numerous studies reported redistribution of the initial fallout in Fukushima forests in the followed period due to litterfall and leaching of radiocesium from the foliage with precipitations. By now these processes have transported the major part of deposited radiocesium to litter and soil compartments. Future levels of radiocesium activities in the aboveground biomass will depend on relative efficiencies of the radiocesium root uptake and its return to the soil surface with litterfall and precipitations. Radiocesium soil-to-plant transfer factors for typical tree species, soil types and landscape conditions of Fukushima prefecture have not been studied well; moreover, they may change in time with approaching to the equilibrium between radioactive and stable cesium isotopes in the ecosystem.\nThe present paper reports the results of several ongoing projects carried out by Institute of Environmental Radioactivity of Fukushima University at the experimental sites in Fukushima prefecture. For typical Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) forest, we determined distributions of radiocesium in the ecosystem and in the aboveground biomass compartments by the end of 2014; available results for 2015 are presented, too, as well as the results of test application of D-shuttle dosimeters for characterization of seasonal variations of radiocesium activity in wood. Based on the radiocesium activities in biomass we derived the upper estimates of its incorporation and root uptake fluxes, 0.7% and 3% of the total inventory in the ecosystem. Measurements of stable cesium concentrations in the biomass compartments enabled obtaining the more precise estimates. Return fluxes of both radioactive and stable cesium also were quantified, which forms the basis for modelling of the long-term redistribution of radiocesium in the studied ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "In recent years the development of dense seismic networks in Japan has enabled high quality observations of instrumental intensities. However, the distribution of intensities of historical earthquakes can only be retrieved by the damage reports on historical documents. Their epicenter and magnitude can be roughly estimated from the intensity distribution, assuming that seismic intensity decays with distance. This approximation is not always accurate, since the amplitude of short period ground motion decays with focal distance and is affected by the 3D attenuation structure along the path and in addition displays frequency dependence. In order to estimate the location and size of a large historical earthquake, we need to accurately simulate the seismic intensity distribution, accounting for non linear attenuation of seismic waves along the path. The instrumental seismic intensities inside the Kanto basin observed at the Tokyo Metropolitan Seismic Observation network (MeSO-net) and Hi-net stations display unusual distribution patterns, with peak intensities observed several km away from the epicenter rather than at the stations closer to it. In order to understand the source of this intensity distribution, we estimated the theoretical instrumental intensities using a 3D attenuation structure and compare it to the observed intensity distribution. We first estimated a 3D attenuation structure using the spectral decay of seismic waves, by fitting the observed seismic wave spectrum to a theoretical spectrum using an ω2 model. The obtained model suggests Qs values of 50˜100 inside the Kanto basin and low Qs values < 300 in the area where the Philippine Sea plate meets the upper part of the Pacific plate. We then use an ω2 model in order to estimate the source acceleration spectrum of several earthquakes occurring below the Kanto basin at depths ranging 30~80 km. Our simulation shows that earthquakes occurring on the Pacific plate pass through the low Qs area inside the Philippine Sea plate and are attenuated significantly. The estimated instrumental intensity distribution at the MeSO-net stations for these earthquakes largely coincides with the observed seismic wave intensity distribution. The implementation of our findings could help towards a better understanding of the damage area of historical earthquakes.",

Least mean square fit method is applied to detect the trends and their magnitudes for each selected regions and stations. Eleven-year MODIS measurements show generally increasing trends in both AOD (1.18 % yr-1) and Ångström exponent (0.98 % yr-1), especially over the east coastal industrialized region in China. Monthly variation of AOD show maximum value at April-July, which were related to the progress of summer monsoon rain band and stationary continental air mass on the northeast of Asia. Increasing trends of AOD were found for eight cites in China (0.80 % yr-1) and Seoul site, Korea (0.40 % yr-1), whereas no significant change were shown in Gosan background site (0.04 % yr-1) and decreasing trend at five background sites in Japan (-0.42 % yr-1). Contrasting to AOD trend, all fifteen sites in China (-1.28 % yr-1), Korea (-2.77 % yr-1), and Japan (-2.03 % yr-1) showed decreasing trend of PM10 mass concentration. Also, PM2.5 mass concentration at Beijing, Seoul, Rishiri, and Oki show significant decreasing trend of -1.16 % yr-1. To further discuss the opposite trend of surface PM mass concentration and column AOD, we investigate vertical aerosol profile from lidar measurements. AOD estimated for planetary boundary layer (surface~1.5 km altitude; AODPBL) from CALIOP measurements over East China show decreasing trend of -1.71 % yr-1 over the period of 2007-2014, wherever AOD estimated for free troposphere (1.5 km~5 km altitude; AODFT) show increasing trend of 2.92 % yr-1. In addition, ground-level lidar measurements in Seoul show decreasing AODPBL trend of -2.57 % yr-1, whereas, AODFT show no significant change (-0.44 % yr-1) between 2007 and 2014. This significant decreasing AODPBL and increasing AODFT trend is attributable to the relative contribution of complex processes that may include decrease of coarse particles near surface following the implementation of numerous air pollution control and changes in meteorological factors (convection, precipitation, etc.).",

Establishing a high-resolution chronostratigraphic framework is a prerequisite for integrating the Songliao record with the global marine Cretaceous. We present high-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology by the chemical abrasion isotope dilution thermal-ionization mass spectrometry method from multiple bentonite core samples from the Late Cretaceous Qingshankou Formation in order to assess the astrochronological model for the Songliao Basin cyclostratigraphy. Our results from the SK-Is core present major improvements in precision and accuracy over the previously published geochronology and allow a cycle-level calibration of the cyclostratigraphy. The resulting choronostratigraphy suggest a good first-order agreement between the radioisotope geochronology and the established astrochronological time scale over the corresponding interval.\nThe dated bentonite beds near the 1780 m depth straddle a prominent oil shale layer of the Qingshankou Formation, which records a basin-wide lake anoxic event (LAE1), providing a direct age constraint for the LAE1.

This paper utilized 3D seismic data, well-log and the principles methods associated with structural geology, sedimentology and geochemistry, to analyze the drowning unconformity and discuss the origins of drowning unconformity in Dongying Sag in Bohai Bay Basin.Researching on it is not only important for a better understanding of tectonic evolution, palaeogeography and sedimentation of hydrocarbon source rocks, but also a vital guiding significance for the exploration of beach-bar sandstone reservoirs and shale oil.\n1. The concept of drowning unconformity of lacustrine rift basins is defined. With the consequences of rapid tectonic subsidence in basin, the sharp rise of lake-level and the increased rate of accommodation(A) in basin exceeded the rate of sediment supply(S),namely A>>S, the basin suddenly transformed into deep-water settings from shallow-water settings with sudden change of sediment transport and sediment dispersal patterns.\n2.The sequence surface between Sha4 and Sha3 Member of Shahejie Formation is the drowning unconformity(43.5Ma). There are the sedimentary association of the reefs in shallow lacustrine, beach-bar sandstones and glutenite fan bodies under the surface. By contrast, there are the sedimentary association of deep-lake oil shales and shales over the surface. The drowning unconformity in Dongying Sag is a tectonic revolution surface which is changed from extensional tectonics to transtensional tectonics and it is also the surface of discontinuity from shallow lacustrine to deep lacustrine. The responses to sudden changes appeared in the parameters of geophysics, geochemistry and paleontology.\n 3. With the penetration of India into Asia plate in NNE trending,the subduction zones of Pacific Plate retreated. It caused the rapid downwelling of asthenospheric mantle, followed by the extensive drowning unconformity.",

            "abstract": "Deep-sea polymetallic nodules are valuable for their high abundance of metals, such as manganese, nickel, cobalt and copper. Microorganisms were known involved in the formation of nodules. Yet it is poorly understood what kinds of microorganisms are involved in the geochemical formation of nodules. To better understand the relationships between metals and microbial communities in deep-sea polymetallic nodules and surrounding sediments, we investigated samples of 20 deep-sea polymetallic nodules and 9 surrounding sediments from the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. The results of metal composition showed that manganese, cobalt, copper, and nickel are much more abundant in the nodules than those in the surrounding sediments. Some metals have significant high correlation, such as 0.96 (p-value<0.001) between copper and nickel. Relative abundance of taxa in the microbial communities was investigated by using culture-independent high-throughput sequencing, followed by classification and statistic analysis. Principal component analysis showed the microbial communities in the nodules are significantly different from those in surrounding sediments. Correlation-based network analysis was performed, which helped us obtain a comprehensive understanding of relationships between metals and microorganisms. The order Rhizobiales, to which some Mn(II)-oxidizing microorganisms belong, shows high correlation (r>0.6, p-value<0.001) with manganese, nickel and copper. The order Solirubrobacterales shows high correlation (r>0.6, p-value<0.001) with manganese and cobalt. The results suggest that the microorganisms belonging to these two orders may play important roles in the geochemical formation of nodules. This study shed light on further studies concerning the formation of the deep-sea polymetallic nodules and isolation of the uncultured microorganisms involved in this geochemical process.",

            "abstract": "The science community has come a long way from traditional, 2D imaging approaches to the assessment of ecosystem structure, function and composition. For example, waveform- (wlidar) and terrestrial lidar systems (TLS) present us with exciting opportunities for detailed, accurate and precise, and scalable structural characterization of vegetation. wlidar and TLS generally can be regarded as complementary i.e., airborne wlidar typically digitizes the entire backscattered energy profile at high spatial and vertical resolutions, while TLS samples dense 3D point clouds of the bottom-up vegetation structure. Research teams at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) have been collaborating with the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) to assess vegetation structure and variation in the Pacific-Southwest (San Joaquin Experimental Range and Soaproot Saddle sites, CA) and Northeast (Harvard Forest, MA) domains. The teams collected airborne small-footprint wlidar data and in-situ TLS data for these sites and is taking a two-tiered (top-down and bottom-up) approach to forest structural assessment. We will present our work where we (i) studied wlidar signal attenuation throughout the canopy in a simulation environment - the attenuation correction factor was linearly proportional to the sum of the area under the proceeding Gaussians - and (ii) used the fine-scale stem structure extracted via TLS to reconstruct complex, but realistic, 3D forest environments for refined simulation studies. These studies indicate that we can potentially assess vegetation canopies remotely using a vertically-stratified approach with wlidar and use rapid-scan TLS technology to calibrate models predicated upon synoptic airborne systems. Other outputs of our approaches can be used for typical forest inventory, ecological parameter extraction, and new algorithm validation.",

            "abstract": "Understanding soil moisture processes in the subsurface is a requirement to solve a variety of hydrologic problems. Traditionally, the water retention curve is measured in the laboratory under equilibrium conditions, and it is generally assumed that the estimated hydraulic properties can be used to model transient water flow under field conditions. However, recent theories have indicated that the hydraulic characteristics are flow rate-dependent and the dynamic effects should be considered. In this study, a series of laboratory experiments were performed in a homogeneous column to investigate the significance of dynamic effects. The experimental set-up consists of a cylinder of 30 cm in diameter and 70 cm in height filled with the field sand and quartz sand, and equips with the time domain reflectometry (TDR) and tensiometer to measure the moisture content and capillary pressure, respectively. Through a continuous cycle of drainage and imbibition, the dynamic retention curves are established and the magnitude of dynamic coefficient (τ) is quantified. Experimental results show that the water saturation and capillary pressure are affected by the flow rate and produce different water retention curves. At a given pressure, more water is retained in the sand for the transient flow case than for the static equilibrium case during the drainage, but the result is opposite during the imbibition. The measured τ varies with saturation, generally increased with decreasing saturation during the drainage. The measured τ is also dependent on porous media mean grain size, and its value increased in the finer sand. Although the mechanisms of dynamic effects are not clear, their effects on the water retention curve cannot be ignored when quantifying the hydraulic properties.\nKeywords: unsaturated zone, water retention curve, dynamic effect, capillary pressure, experiment",

This concept is well fitted for the ocean, but oversimplified for the land. How the climate change causes the complex patterns of the continental dryness change is one of challenging questions. Here we investigate the observed dryness changes of the land surface by examining the quantitative influence of several climate parameters on the background aridity changes over East Asia, containing various climate regimes from cold-arid to warm-humid regions, using observations of 189 stations covering the period from 1961 to 2010. Overall mean aridity trend is changed from negative to positive around early 1990s. The turning of dryness trend is largely influenced by sharp increase in atmospheric water demands, regardless of the background climate. The warming induced increase in water demands is larger in warm-humid regions than in cold-arid region due to the Clausius-Clapeyron relation between air temperature and saturation vapor pressure. The results show the drying of anthropogenic warming already begins and influences on the patterns of dryness change over the land surface.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, satellite radar altimetry has shown its ability to revolutionize our understanding of the ocean and climate. These advances were mainly limited to ice-free regions, leaving aside large portions of Polar Regions. Launched in 2010, the polar-orbiting CryoSat Satellite was designed to measure the changes in the thickness of polar sea ice and the elevation of the ice sheets and mountain glaciers. To reach this goal, the CryoSat products have to meet the highest performance, through constant improvements of the associated Instrument Processing Facility. Since April 2015, the CryoSat ice products are generated with the Baseline C; which represents a major processor upgrade. Several improvements have been implemented belong this new Baseline, such as SAR retracker optimized for Freeboard retrieval and a coarse slant correction, which is applied directly on the stack data in conjunction with the window delay alignment. The resulting waveforms show more power and the trailing edge is modified, leading to improved L2 geophysical parameters. This paper provides an overview of the CryoSat data characteristics, assessment and exploitation over Polar Regions. In this respect, new science-oriented diagnostics have been implemented to thoroughly understand the signatures within the altimeter signals over sea-ice and land ice areas, to validate the data and therefore propose potential \nway of improvements for next CryoSat processing Baselines.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the direct S and Sdiff waveforms of earthquakes in Papua New Guinea region recorded by seismographs in Northern America are distorted due to sampling slow shear velocity anomalies at the base of the mantle. The emergence of postcursours to the S/Sdiff waves and the travel time anomalies have been reasonably explained by placing a ultra low velocity zone (ULVZ) in southwest of Hawaii. In this study, we focused on the amplitude anomalies of the S/Sdiff waveforms. The direct S phase show very low amplitude at stations in Southern California, at the distance and azimuth around 90 and 55 degrees from the earthquake. The amplitude is as low as 10% of the synthetic amplitude of a standard 1D model, especially at higher frequency range above 0.025 Hz. We first checked and confirmed that the anomalies are not due to errors in the focal mechanism, which is used to calculate the reference synthetic waveforms. Also we checked that the amplitude anomalies are unlikely to be caused by the structures near the earthquake or near the stations, by looking at the amplitude of the depth phases or waveforms of other earthquakes. We assumed that the anomalies are produced by the focusing and defocusing effect of sampling 3D heterogeneous at the base of the mantle, and searched for the causal structures. Full 3D synthetic waveforms are calculated down to 8 seconds for tens of structural models with slow anomalies of different size and velocity reduction placed on the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The result shows that existing tomographic models do not fully explain the observed amplitude anomalies. Stronger shear velocity anomalies are required. The previously proposed thin large ULVZ placed on the CMB southwest of Hawaii partly explains the observed amplitude reduction, even at the distance as short as 90 degrees from the earthquake. This result indicates the significance of finite frequency effect of the ULVZ structure to the S waves, since the ray theoretical bottoming point of the phase of the interest is predicted to be more than 200km above the ULVZ. The observed S wave amplitudes are better explained by lowering the shear velocity of the slow regions, which are imaged in tomographic models, close to the event region in Western Pacific at the base of the mantle.",

VHF band sensor sensors can observe lightning discharge process in detail but its observation coverage is limited. On the other hand, LF band sensor can observe lightning at much great distances. Therefore, LF sensors are well adapted to observe lightning throughout a thunderstorm’s life cycle.\nOur research group has been designing and developing the Broadband Observation network for Lightning and Thunderstorm (BOLT), which locates radiation sources associated with lightning discharge in three spatial dimensions. BOLT consists of 11 LF band sensors which detect lightning pulses wide frequency range from 5 kHz to 500 kHz. We have been operating BOLT in Kansai area of Japan, locating both cloud-to-ground and intracloud discharges. Currently, the BOLT system observes about 100 to 1000 lightning pulses per flash, but we are striving to improve both the detection efficiency and the location accuracy.\nPreliminary investigation show that the number of sources located, increases dramatically when only the highest portion of the BLOT frequency band is used far location. So, our research group has proposed improving a new “DDT” antenna sensor design to improve the high frequency sensitivity of the antenna. The DDT antenna consists of a modified charge amplifier circuit. In this research, we present a comparison of the DDT antenna and show the advantages of the DDT antenna.",

            "abstract": "Parameter estimation is generally required for land surface models (LSMs) and hydrologic models to reproduce observed water and energy fluxes in different watersheds. Using soil moisture observations for parameter estimation in addition to discharge and land surface temperature observations can improve the prediction of land surface and subsurface processes. Due to their representativity, point measurements cannot capture the watershed-scale soil moisture conditions and may lead to notable bias in watershed soil moisture predictions if used for model calibration. The intermediate-scale cosmic-ray soil moisture observing system (COSMOS) provides average soil water content measurement over a footprint of 0.34 m2 and depths up to 50 cm, and may provide better calibration data for low-order watersheds. In this study, we will test using COSMOS observations for Flux-PIHM parameter and state estimation via the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Flux-PIHM is a physically-based land surface hydrologic model that couples the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) with the Noah land surface model. Synthetic data experiments will be performed at the Shale Hills watershed (area: 0.08 km2, smaller than COSMOS footprint) and the Garner Run watershed (1.34 km2, larger than COSMOS footprint) in the Shale Hills Susquehanna Critical Zone Observatory in central Pennsylvania. COSMOS observations will be assimilated into Flux-PIHM using the EnKF, in addition to discharge and land surface temperature (LST) observations. The accuracy of EnKF estimated parameters and water and energy flux predictions will be evaluated. In addition, the results will be compared with assimilating point soil moisture measurement (in addition to discharge and LST), to assess the effects of using different scales of soil moisture observations for parameter estimation. The results at Shale Hills and Garner Run will be compared to test whether performance of COSMOS data assimilation is affected by the size of watershed.",

            "abstract": "In snowy cold regions, the snowmelt water stored in dams in early spring meets the water demand for the summer season. Thus, snowmelt water serves as an important water resource. However, snowmelt water also can cause snowmelt floods. Therefore, it’s necessary to estimate snow water equivalent in a dam basin as accurately as possible. For this reason, the dam operation offices in Hokkaido, Japan conduct snow surveys every March to estimate snow water equivalent in the dam basin. In estimating, we generally apply a relationship between elevation and snow water equivalent. But above the forest line, snow surveys are generally conducted along ridges due to the risk of avalanches or other hazards. As a result, snow water equivalent above the forest line is significantly underestimated. In this study, we conducted airborne laser scanning to measure snow depth in the high elevation area including above the forest line twice in the same target area (in 2012 and 2015) and analyzed the relationships of snow depth above the forest line and some indicators of terrain.\nOur target area was the Chubetsu dam basin. It’s located in central Hokkaido, a high elevation area in a mountainous region. Hokkaido is a northernmost island of Japan. Therefore it’s a cold and snowy region. The target range for airborne laser scanning was 10km2. About 60% of the target range was above the forest line.\nFirst, we analyzed the relationship between elevation and snow depth. Below the forest line, the snow depth increased linearly with elevation increase. On the other hand, above the forest line, the snow depth varied greatly.\nSecond, we analyzed the relationship between overground-openness and snow depth above the forest line. Overground-openness is an indicator quantifying how far a target point is above or below the surrounding surface. As a result, a simple relationship was clarified. Snow depth decreased linearly as overground-openness increases. This means that areas with heavy snow cover are distributed in valleys and that of light cover are on ridges.\nLastly we compared the result of 2012 and that of 2015. The same characteristic of snow depth, above mentioned, was found. However, regression coefficients of linear equations were different according to the weather conditions of each year.",

Denitrification is an important process that not only accounts for the significant loss of nitrogen fertilizers from soils but also leads to NO, N2O and CO2 emissions, which are important greenhouse gas species. In this study, denitrification was investigated in Columbia River sediments, focusing on the dynamic linkages between functional genes/enzymes and biogeochemical reaction rates of nitrate and its reduction products. NO3-, NO2- and N2O were assayed in different incubation time. DNA was extracted from the sediments and functional genes were quantified as a function of time during the denitrification. Functional enzymes were extracted from the sediments and measured using a newly developed, targeted protein method. The biogeochemical, functional gene, and enzyme data were collectively used to establish the dynamic correlation of functional genes/enzymes and biogeochemical reaction rates. The results provide fundamental insights regarding the dynamic regulation of functional genes and enzymes in the processes of denitrification and greenhouse gas production, and also provide experimental data critical for the development of biogeochemical reaction models that incorporate genome-scale insights and describe macroscopic biogeochemical reaction rates in ecosystems.",

Relationships between climatic variability and wood cellular features allow for a more complete understanding of the physiological mechanisms that control the climatic response of trees. Given the increasing importance of wood anatomy as a source of dendroecological information, such studies are now starting in the US. We analyzed 10 cores of bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva D.K. Bailey) from a high-elevation site included in the Nevada Climate-ecohydrological Assessment Network (NevCAN). Century-long chronologies (1870-2013) of wood anatomical parameters (lumen area, cell diameter, cell wall thickness) can be developed by capturing strongly contrasted microscopic images using a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope, and then measuring cellular parameters with task-specific software. Measures of empirical signal strength were used to test the strength of the environmental information embedded in wood anatomy. Correlation functions between ring-width, cellular features, and PRISM climatic variables were produced for the period 1926-2013.\nTime series of anatomical features present lower autocorrelation compared to ring widths, highlighting the role of environmental conditions occurring at the time of cell formation. Mean chronologies of radial lumen length and cell diameter carry a stronger climatic signal compared to cell wall thickness, and are significantly correlated with climatic variables (maximum temperature and total precipitation) in spring (Mar-Apr) and during the growing season (Jun-Sep), whereas ring widths show weaker or no correlation. Wood anatomy holds great potential to refine dendroclimatic reconstructions at higher temporal resolution, providing better estimates of hydroclimatic variability and plant physiological adaptations in the southwest US.",

However, previous simulations have either failed to account for 3D flow or\nused the infinite strain axis (ISA) approximation for LPO, which is known to be\ninaccurate in complex flow fields. Additionally, both the slab depth and shape of the\nRyukyu slab are contentious.

            "abstract": "Modeling of gas phase flow in porous media is relevant as it is present in a wide variety of applications ranging from nanofluidic systems to subsurface contaminant transport. In this work, we derive a macroscopic model to study slightly compressible gas flow in porous media for conditions in which the tangential fluid velocity undergoes a slip at the solid interface due to Knudsen effects and to mass diffusion in binary conditions. To this end, we use the method of volume averaging to derive the governing equations at the Darcy scale for both mass and momentum transport. The momentum transport model consists on a modification to Darcy’s law due to mass dispersion and to total density gradients. For mass transport, the resulting model is the conventional convection-dispersion equation with two correction terms, one affecting convective transport and the second one affecting mass dispersion due to gas compressibility. The macroscopic model reduces to the one reported by Altevogt et al. (2003) for the case in which gas slip is only due to a concentration gradient and to the one by Lasseux et al. (2014) under Knudsen slip conditions. The model is written in terms of effective-medium coefficients that can be predicted from solving the associated closure problems in representative unit cells. For conditions in which the Péclet number is much greater than one and when the Knudsen number is not exceedingly small compared to the unity, our computations show that the predictions of the longitudinal dispersion may reach an error as high as 60% compared to the predictions obtained by ignoring gas slip.\nAltevogt A.S., Rolston D.E., Whitaker S.

We used NASA airborne AVIRIS imagery and field surveys to determine the impact and recovery of three ecologically and hydrologically diverse ecosystems after the oil spill using data acquired in 2010, 2011 and 2012. This was the largest campaign attempted at that time, collecting 456 AVIRIS flightlines between 6 May and 4 Oct., 2010, many covering the coastal region impacted by the oil spill. We investigated Barataria Bay (an intertidal saltmarsh ecosystem, predominantly a Spartina-Juncus meadow), East Bird’s Foot (the most botanically diverse wetland, is an intermediate/freshwater marsh, fed by the Mississippi River), and Chandeleur Islands (barrier islands surrounded by tidal mangrove shrublands). A comparison of the three sites showed variable impacts from the oil and differential ecosystem recoveries. Mangroves around the Chanderleur Islands were the most adversely affected by the oil spill and showed the least recovery after a year, based on spectral changes characteristic of stressed vegetation. East Bird’s Foot freshwater marshes were minimally affected by the spill and it is likely that the Mississippi outflow resulted in little crude oil reaching these shorelines. A zonal analysis of Barataria Bay revealed that oil primarily impacted the intertidal zone along shorelines that faced the Gulf, with little impact of the oil after an average distance of 20m inland, approximately the height of the highest high tides. Although recovery of the saltgrass meadow was robust during the first year after the spill, it was also variable, with the 5m zone immediately inland from the shoreline showing the least recovery. Hurricane Isaac in 2012, although a mild category 1 hurricane, adversely impacted the saltgrass meadows along the shorelines that were recovering from the oil spill, which after the hurricane showed reduced growth compared to shorelines that were not damaged by the 2010 oil spill.",

            "abstract": "Soil's potential as a carbon sink for atmospheric CO2 has been widely discussed. Studies of soil organic carbon (SOC) controls, and the subsequent models derived from their findings, have focussed mainly on North American and European regions, and more recently, in regions such as China. In Australia, agricultural practices have led to losses in SOC. This implies that Australian soils have a large potential for increased sequestration of SOC. Building on previous work, here we examine the spatial and temporal variation in soil organic carbon (SOC) and its controlling factors controls across a large catchment of approximately 650 km2 in the Upper Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia, using data collected from two sampling campaigns, (April 2006 and June-July 2014). The 2006 data represented a period of long-term drought which effectively ended in 2007 with average and above average subsequent rainfall. In 2007 and 2010 there were a series of extreme rainfall events. 137-Cesium and SOC concentrations were obtained from the sampled soils. Remote sensing using Landsat (30m) and MODIS (250m) NDVI was used to determine if catchment SOC could be predicted using both low and high resolution remote sensing. Relationships between SOC and 137-Cesium for both sampling periods were also quantified. Results indicate that, although moderate resolution (250 m) allows for reasonable prediction of the spatial distribution of SOC, the higher resolution (30 m) improved the strength of the SOC-NDVI relationship. Mean 137-Cesium concentrations were observed to show an increase in deposition at the sample sites over the 8 years between samplings. The relationship between SOC and 137-Cesium, as a surrogate for the erosion and deposition of SOC, suggested that sediment transport and deposition influences the distribution of SOC within the catchment. The increase in 137-Cesium also suggests that increased rainfall and extreme storm events, resulting from climate change, may increase the movement of SOC.",

            "abstract": "Archaeomagnetic study is an effective way to understand the variation of the geomagnetic field over periods of hundreds to thousands of years. We have carried out archaeointensity studies on archaeological artifacts, including pottery fragments, bricks and baked clay, collected from several sites covering the middle to eastern part of China spanning the past ~6 kyr. We designed detailed rock magnetic and archaeointensity experiments in this study. Rock magnetic results indicate that the main magnetic carriers of these samples are stable magnetite or titanomagnetite with mainly fine particles of SD and SP. About 40% of the specimens in the paleointensity experiment pass the strict selection criteria and are considered to record robust intensity values. The virtual axial dipole moments (VADMs) of our sites range from ~2.5×1022 to ~15.8×1022 Am2. We record three low intensity values with VADMs of less than 3×1022 Am2, two of them comparable to the one reported by Cai et al. (2015) at ~3000 BCE while the other one comparable to those reported by Cai et al. (2014) at ~2200 BCE, which supply further evidence for the existence of ‘DIPs’ (decreases in paleoinetnsity) in China during the period of ~3000-2000 BCE. A high intensity value of ~16×1022 Am2 is recorded by our new data at ~1300 BCE, which may represent a new spike at this time period. The low and high values recorded by our new data update the six-fold variation between ~2200 BCE and ~1300 BCE discussed in Cai et al. (2014) to eight-fold, which may indicate a stronger geodynamic process during this period. Our new data are generally in good agreement with the published data in China, Japan and Korea at similar time periods, except the extreme low and high values discussed above, which will improve the Eastern Asian model greatly. The new data together with the published data suggest severe fluctuation of the geomagnetic field in Eastern Asia during the last 6 kyr. Vast quantities of reliable data are needed to further constrain the detailed variation of the field. When comparing with the global models, the new data fit well to the ARCH3k.1 model generally, but deviate from the CALS3k.4 and CALS10k.1b models at certain time periods (especially at ages older than ~3 ka), which make them significant for future improvements of the models.",

            "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) of carbon dioxide emissions generated by production or combustion of fossil fuels is a technologically viable means to reduce the build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere and oceans. On a fundamental level, capillary trapping of scCO2 is a pore-scale process that shares mechanisms that are relevant, for example in oil recovery and remediation of NAPL-contaminated aquifers. Capillary trapping of scCO2 differs rather significantly from trapping of oil recovery and NAPL remediation in that the goal is to maximize the amount of NWP storage, whereas the objective of the other applications is to minimize the amount of residual NWP. This difference makes research into capillary trapping of scCO2 unique, but also complex because scCO2 phase properties (e.g. viscosity, density, and interfacial tension) exhibit large shifts with pressure and temperature which can strongly alter the trapping potential and efficiency. In this presentation we compare direct pore-scale observations of the Brine-CO2 drainage and imbibition process with lattice Boltzmann model simulations. The observations were conducted with the synchrotron-based x-ray microtomography facility at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory using a novel x-ray compatible, high-pressure, elevated temperature setup. The “large” volumes (~1200 mm3; 6.3 mm diameter and 40 mm in length) were segmented into solid phase (Bentheimer Sandstone), Brine (KI, 1140 kg/m3) and scCO2. We will present LB simulations of small (64^3 voxels) and large sections of the scanned cores with a simple Shan-Chen-type model and a more advanced Equation of State-type model and compare model results to pressure and CO2 saturation levels that were observed for the CO2 invasion and Brine re-imbibition process. We will present results for the smaller sections under multiple drainage and imbibition cycles to investigate whether this will lead to enhanced trapping of scCO2 as found in earlier research.",

It is often used to produce empirical prediction models of several space environmental parameters. One operational model (Nakamura, 2008) used K-index input to predict foF2 variations and storms above Tokyo. It was expected that the prediction at the disturbed situation would become more accurate when solar wind parameters are used to the inputs. Recently the availability of solar wind parameters from the Advanced Composition Explorer became longer enough to overlap one solar activity. In this study, solar wind proton velocity and IMF are used to the input to predict the foF2 disturbances above Tokyo (SW input model). The K-index input model (Nakamura, 2008) was also recreated using the same data term as the SW input model. The SW input model tends to predict better the negative disturbances, and it predicted daytime quick variations more accurate than the K-index input model. Statistical comparison of the prediction ability of those models will be discussed, and the contribution of the solar wind input parameters to the foF2 will be tested using an artificial input.",

During the main phase of the storm, optical instruments installed at Rikubetsu, Hokkaido, Japan (geomagnetic altitude: 36.5 degs), such as all-sky CCD camera, wide field of view digital camera and meridian scanning photometer, registered auroral emissions during 15 to 19 UT (corresponding to 00 to 04 LT) on March 17. In addition, both the SuperDARN Hokkaido East and West radars succeeded in obtaining unprecedented set of high-time-resolution ionospheric convection data associated with the low latitude aurora up to below 50 degs geomagnetic latitude. It is found that the initial stage of the low latitude aurora appearance (before 1630 UT) was associated with equatorward convective flow, and later there was sheared flow structure, consisting of westward flow (about 500 m/s) equatorward of eastward flow (1000 m/s), with the equatorward boundary of auroral emission embedded in the westward flow region.

            "abstract": "A climate models ability to reproduce observed historical warming is sometimes viewed as a measure of quality. Yet, for practical reasons historical warming cannot be considered a purely empirical result of the modelling efforts because the desired result is known in advance and so is a potential target of tuning.\nHere we explain how the latest edition of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM1.2) atmospheric model (ECHAM6.3) had its climate sensitivity systematically tuned to about 3 K; the MPI model to be used during CMIP6. This was deliberately done in order to improve the match to observed 20th Century warming over the previous model generation (MPI-ESM, ECHAM6.1) which warmed too much and had a sensitivity of 3.5 K. In the process we identified several controls on model cloud feedback that confirm recently proposed hypotheses concerning trade-wind cumulus and high-latitude mixed-phase clouds. We then evaluate the model fidelity with centennial global warming and discuss the relative importance of climate sensitivity, forcing and ocean heat uptake efficiency in determining the response as well as possible systematic biases.\nThe activity of targeting historical warming during model development is polarizing the modeling community with 35 percent of modelers stating that 20th Century warming was rated very important to decisive, whereas 30 percent would not consider it at all. Likewise, opinions diverge as to which measures are legitimate means for improving the model match to observed warming. These results are from a survey conducted in conjunction with the first WCRP Workshop on Model Tuning in fall 2014 answered by 23 modelers.\nWe argue that tuning or constructing models to match observed warming to some extent is practically unavoidable, and as such, in many cases might as well be done explicitly. For modeling groups that have the capability to tune both their aerosol forcing and climate sensitivity there is now a unique opportunity to explore the bounds of our understanding – a low sensitivity model could be sustained by weak aerosol forcing, and a highly sensitive model could potentially be constructed to match observed warming by strong compensating aerosol cooling. This next natural step could constitute a new paradigm in climate modeling.",

However, the physicochemical process for the color transition accompanied with seismic slip has not yet been fully understood. On the other hand, determination of the peak temperature during slip is crucial to identify the faulting mechanism during an earthquake, so that various temperature proxies have been proposed. For example, 1) magnetite formation at high temperature of ≥400 °C, 2) anomalies in the concentrations of fluid-mobile trace elements (Sr, Cs, Rb, and Li) and in the Sr isotope ratios, indicating presence of high-temperature fluid of ≥350 °C, 3) dehydroxylation of clay minerals, 4) thermal decomposition of carbonate minerals, and 5) thermal maturation of carbonaceous material examined by vitrinite reflectance measurement and by infrared and Raman spectroscopies. However, these proxies required high-level analyses in laboratory, so easy method to detect the record of high temperature preliminarily on field would be expected. In this study, we reproduced the blackening of synthetic fault sample by using high-velocity friction apparatus, thermogravimetric, and milling machine, and evaluated the color transition and organic chemical property of the samples by using UV-visible/NIR spectrophotometer and pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. We discuss the process of the blackening taking comminution and pyrolysis of carbonaceous materials into consideration.",

On the other hand, these ultrafine particles might dissolve in the pore water and then disappear, because amorphous fine minerals have generally high water solubility. This indicates that the preserved ultrafine particles have potential as a proxy for identifying the slip zone of the most recent earthquake along a fault. However, the occurrence in the active faults has not been fully reported.

            "abstract": "A statistical study using a large data set of Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) observations is conducted for transient ionospheric plasma flows associated with sudden impulses (SI) recorded on ground magnetic field. The global structure of twin vortex-like ionospheric flows is found to be consistent with the twin vortices of ionospheric Hall current deduced by the past geomagnetic field observations. An interesting feature, which is focused on in this study, is that the flow structures show a dawn-dusk asymmetry. One is the difference in flow magnitude of the lower-latitude portion of the flow vortices, which is much clearer for positive SIs. The sunward flow perturbation on the dusk side is significantly larger than that on dawn side. A set of global MHD simulation runs performed by the present study have successfully reproduced the similar asymmetry of the lower-latitude transient flows. The result suggests that ionospheric conductance plays an important role in reproducing this dawn-dusk asymmetry. Another dawn-dusk asymmetry is found for the higher-latitude portion of flow vortices in which a larger flow appears either of dawn or dusk depending on the combination of the polarity of SI and IMF-By. Detailed statistics of the SuperDARN observations reveals that the dawn-dusk asymmetry of flow vortices due to IMF-By appear more clearly during negative SIs, while the flow vortices are more or less symmetric during positive SIs, regardless of IMF-By polarity. On the basis of the upstream observations, we suggest that this particular dawn-dusk asymmetry is caused by the interaction between the pre-existing round convection cell and a pair of the transient convection vortices associated with SIs. The combination of the two convection cell systems has also been reproduced by our MHD simulations.",

            "abstract": "Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycle feedbacks under climate change. Soil carbon turnover times provide information about the sensitivity of carbon pools to changes in inputs and warming. The spatial and vertical distribution of soil carbon turnover times emerges from the interplay between climate, vegetation, and soil properties. Radiocarbon levels of soil organic matter can be used to estimate soil carbon turnover using models that take into account radioactive decay over centuries to millennia and inputs of 14C from atmospheric weapons testing (“bomb carbon”) during the second half of the 20th century. By synthesizing more than 200 soil radiocarbon profiles from all major biomes and soil orders, we 1) explored the major controlling factors for soil carbon turnover times of surface and deeper soil layers; 2) developed predictive models (tree-based regression, support vector regression and linear regression models) of ∆14C that depends on depth, climate, vegetation, and soil types; and 3) extrapolated the predictive model to produce the first global distribution of soil carbon turnover times to the depth of 1m.\nPreliminary results indicated that climate and depth were primary controls of the vertical distribution of ∆14C, contributing to about 70% of the variability in our model. Vegetation and soil order exerted similar level of controls (about 15% each). The predictive model performed reasonably well with an R2 of 0.81 and RMSE (root-mean-squared error) of about 50‰ for topsoil and 100‰ for subsoil, as estimated using cross-validation. Extrapolation of the predictive model to the globe in combination with existing soil carbon information (e.g., Harmonized World Soil Database) indicated that more than half of the global total soil carbon in the top 1m had a turnover time of less than 500 years. Subsoils (30-100cm) had millennium-scale turnover times, with the majority (70%) turning over between 1000 and 5000 years. This study provides a data-constrained estimate of the global distribution of soil carbon turnover times and may help to constrain the performance of Earth system models used to evaluate future scenarios of change.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor depressions covering an area of >20,000 km2 on the Chatham Rise, south east of New Zealand, have been interpreted as pockmarks which are related to past fluid releases. It is proposed that the seafloor depressions were caused by sudden escape of overpressured gas generated by gas hydrate dissociation during glacial sea-level lowering. We are attempting to simulate the evolution of the gas hydrate system through glacial-interglacial cycles in the study area using TOUGH-Hydrate. The Chatham Rise offers a unique opportunity for studying the effect of depressurization from sealevel lowering to gas hydrate systems because it is a bathymetric barrier preventing the Subtropical Front separating subtropical and subantarctic waters from migrating during glacial-interglacial cycles. Hence, bottom-water temperatures can be assumed to remain constant. Recent results from paleoceanographic studies however, indicate that bottom-temperature may have varied locally. These temperature changes may have a more significant effect on the shallow gas hydrate system in the study area than the relatively gradual decrease of pressure associated with sealevel lowering.",

Fluctuations with right-handed polarization at scales larger than ion inertial length are applied as an initial condition of the simulation, which satisfy a dispersion relation of whistler waves in cold-magnetized plasma. The particle-in-cell simulation, which includes full kinetic properties of electrons and ions in collisionless plasma, demonstrates turbulent cascade and dissipation of fluctuation energy self-consistently. Discussion will focus on properties of decaying whistler turbulence at ion scales, such as the power-law index, wavenumber anisotropy, and plasma heating. Comparison of properties of whistler turbulence at ion scales with electron scales will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Ecuadorian segment of the Nazca/South America subduction zone is an outstanding laboratory to study the seismic cycle. Central Ecuador where the Carnegie ridge enters the subduction marks a transition between a highly coupled segment that hosted one of the largest seismic sequence during the 20thcentury and a ~1200-km long weakly coupled segment encompassing southern Ecuador and northern Peru. A shallow dipping subduction interface and a short trench-coast line distance ranging from 45 to 80 km, together with La Plata Island located only 33 km from the trench axis, allow to document subduction processes in the near field with an exceptional resolution.\nSince 2000, a close cooperation between the Institute of Geophysics (Quito), INOCAR (Oceanographic Institute of the Ecuadorian Navy) with French groups allowed us to conduct up to 6 marine geophysics cruises to survey the convergent margin and jointly develop dense GPS and seismological networks. This fruitful collaboration now takes place in the framework of an International Joint Laboratory “Earthquakes and Volcanoes in the Northern Andes” (LMI SVAN), which eases coordinating research projects and exchanges of Ecuadorian and French scientists and students.\nThis long-term investigation has already provided a unique view on the structure of the margin, which exhibits a highly variable subduction channel along strike. It allowed us to evidence the contrast between creeping and coupled segments of subduction at various scale, and the existence of large continental slivers whose motion accommodates the obliquity of the Nazca/South America convergence. Finally, we could evidence the first Slow Slip Events (SSE) that oppositely to most SSE documented so far, are accompanied with intense micro-seismicity.\nThe recent support of the French National Research Agency and the Ecuadorian Agency for Sciences and Technology (Senescyt) will enable us to integrate the already obtained results, in an attempt to develop an earthquake forecast model for Ecuador.",

            "abstract": "Spatial variations in the stress drop for 1726 intermediate-depth intraslab earthquakes in the subducting Pacific plate beneath Hokkaido were examined, using precisely relocated hypocenters, the corner frequencies of events, and detailed determined geometry of the upper interface of the Pacific plate. The analysis results show that median stress drop for intraslab earthquakes generally increases with an increase in depth from 10 to 157 Mpa at depths of 70–300 km. Median stress drops for events in the oceanic crust decrease (9.9–6.8 MPa) at depths of 70–120 km and increase (6.8–17 MPa) at depths of 120– 170 km, whereas median stress drop for events in the oceanic mantle decrease (21.6–14.0 MPa) at depths of 70–170 km, where the geometry of the Pacific plate is well determined. The increase in stress drop with depth in the oceanic crust at depths of 120–170 km can be explained by a lithofacies change (increases in velocity and density and a decrease in the water content) due to the phase change with dehydration in the oceanic crust. At depths of 70–110 km, the decrease in the median stress drop in the oceanic crust would also be explained by that the temperature-induced rigidity decrease would be larger than that of the rigidity increase caused by lithofacies change and water content. Stress drops for events in the oceanic mantle were larger than those for events in the oceanic crust at depths of 70–120 km. Differences in both the rigidity of　the rock types and in the rupture mechanisms for events between the oceanic crust and mantle could be causes for the stress drop differences within a slab. These analysis results can help clarify the nature of intraslab earthquakes and provide information useful for the prediction of strong motion associated with earthquakes in the slab at intermediate depths.",

            "abstract": "A precise hydraulic pressure measurement is important in order to obtain geophysical knowledge associated with the occurrence of large interplate earthquakes. However, pressure measurements contain instrumental drift in a sensor in addition to the pressure changes related to a crustal deformations. Therefore a correction of the drift using an absolute calibration system is necessary. We developed a mobile pressure gauge. The mobile pressure gauge has a quartz water pressure meter (Paroscientific Inc. 410K) as a pressure sensor with pressure holding system due to heating of a pressure piping. The system enables us to maintain a constant pressure of a target field pressure from a laboratory to a seafloor in order to eliminate effects of pressure hysteresis of the sensor. Laboratory experiments showed a temperature characteristics and hysteresis of the sensor in addition to the pressure hysteresis. Because a temperature of the sensor is affected by an outside temperature which ranges from 2 degrees (at the bottom of the sea) to room temperature, we need to calibrate outputs values of the sensor using calibration values estimated by laboratory experiments. These procedure would improve the measurement accuracy and contribute to obtaining a small amount of crustal deformations related to occurrence of large interplate earthquakes.\nIn the Nankai trough, we deployed a long-term borehole monitoring system with pressure gauges into the C0002 boreholes. Because the data are available in a real time, the observatory is good target for the calibration study. During the KY15-05 cruise, we deployed the mobile pressure gauge on the C0002 observatory using a ROV twice. A repeatability measurements between two dives indicates 2.55 hPa, which is equivalent to 2.55 cm converted into cm. And a repeatability measurements before and after the cruise indicates 3.56 hPa. In the presentation, we examine the calibration results with consideration of a characteristics of the pressure sensor based on laboratory experiments.",

We drew from the conceptual change and risk analysis literatures to find the factors that determine how much people will care about future risks. Questions derived from these factors were then asked about many hypothesized consequences of climate change. These consequences were drawn from an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report (IPCC, 2012) and, in the third study, additionally from the IPCC AR5 (IPCC, 2014). The first two studies, using undergraduate students, demonstrated that some consequences were indeed considerably more engaging than others. The third study used a more representative sample of American adults, drawn from Amazon Mechanical Turk and used the Global Warming's Six Americas Screening Tool (Maibach, Leiserowitz, Roser-Renouf, Mertz, & Akerlof, 2011) in a large screening survey to find 20 participants in each of the six audiences defined by this tool. These participants were then asked about the potential consequences of climate change. Results again showed that some consequences are considered more engaging than others, and also showed the ways in which members of these six audiences perceive the consequences of climate change differently.",

            "abstract": "In 1970’s, the agriculture and aquaculture were rapidly developed at Pingtung coastal area in southern Taiwan. The groundwater aquifers were over-pumped and caused the seawater intrusion. In order to remedy the contaminated groundwater and find the best strategies of groundwater usage, a management model to search the optimal groundwater operational strategies is developed in this study. The objective function is to minimize the total amount of injection water and a set of constraints are applied to ensure the groundwater levels and concentrations are satisfied. A three-dimension density-dependent flow and transport simulation model, called SEAWAT developed by U.S. Geological Survey, is selected to simulate the phenomenon of seawater intrusion. The simulation model is well calibrated by the field measurements and replaced by the surrogate model of trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to reduce the computational time. The ANNs are embedded in the management model to link the simulation and optimization models, and the global optimizer of differential evolution (DE) is applied for solving the management model. The optimal results show that the fully trained ANNs could substitute the original simulation model and reduce much computational time. Under appropriate setting of objective function and constraints, DE can find the optimal injection rates at predefined barriers. The concentrations at the target locations could decrease more than 50 percent within the planning horizon of 20 years.\nKeywords : Seawater intrusion, groundwater management, numerical model, artificial neural networks, differential evolution",

With over 250 peer-reviewed papers and the underlying philosophy that the regional research it undertakes engages at least two developing countries, the 3rd strategic phase is not only improving the research capabilities of nations in the region, but is engaging the developing country community in underpinning policy-relevant research. The extent to which science is contributing to policy is further evident in that 69% of the activities conducted had some form of science-policy mechanism built in to the project activities.\nThe period of the 3rd Strategic Phase has been witness to significant changes in the make-up of the “conventional” global change arena, with the transition of some global change programmes into the new “Future Earth” initiative. At the same time, major events such as the Rio+20 Summit, the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, the establishment of an IPCC-related platform for biodiversity, i.e. IPBES, and the evolving engagement of science and policy communities has kept the APN busy at what it does best – networking and partnering with the international community. The APN has embraced these changes through its dynamism, allowing the APN to meet not only the needs of the scientists and decision makers its serves in the region but those of the international science communities as well. The challenge for the APN in its next two decades will be to ensure alignment with the transforming global change arena.\nWith key phrases such as “policy-relevant science” and “science-policy interactions” being adopted broadly by the community at large these days, the APN’s niche in the global community has received considerable recognition, particularly as other institutions strive to adopt similar practices that the APN has built over the last 20 years.",

            "abstract": "Seismic anisotropy has been found in many subduction zones. During subduction of slab, the oceanic crust changes to blueschist and eclogite. Since minerals in blueschist are very anisotropic elastically, seismic properties in the subducting slab can be attributed to the lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of these minerals. We studied microstructures and seismic properties of blueschist and eclogite from Ring Mt. and Jenner in California. Blueschist samples are mainly composed of glaucophane, epidote and phengite. Eclogite samples are mostly composed of omphacite, glaucophane, epidote and garnet. We determined LPOs of minerals using SEM/EBSD technique and calculated seismic properties of minerals and whole rocks.\nLPOs of glaucophane showed [001] axes are aligned subparallel to lineation, and both (110) poles and [100] axes subnormal to foliation. Glaucophane in samples from Jenner, however, exhibited [001] axes forming a girdle subparallel to lineation. Seismic anisotropy of glaucophane was stronger in samples from Ring Mt. than those from Jenner. Epidote showed [001] axes are aligned subnormal to foliation and (110) and (010) poles subparallel to lineation. LPOs of phengite were characterized by a maximum of [001] axes normal to foliation, with (110) and (010) poles and [100] axes aligning in a weak girdle parallel to foliation. Phengite showed the strongest seismic anisotropy among major minerals. LPOs of omphacite showed [001] axes are aligned subparallel to lineation and [010] axes subnormal to foliation. Seismic anisotropy of omphacite was very weak. Blueschist from Ring Mt. showed stronger seismic anisotropy than those from Jenner. Especially, blueschist including abundant phengite showed very strong seismic anisotropy (AVP=30%, max.AVS=23%). Eclogite showed much weaker seismic anisotropy (AVP=7%, max.AVS=6%) than blueschist (AVP=12-30%, max.AVS=9-23%).

            "abstract": "Current climate models exhibit equilibrium climate sensitivities to a doubling of CO2 of 2.0-4.6 K and a weak increase of global mean precipitation. But inferences from the observational record place climate sensitivity near the lower end of the range, and indicate that models underestimate changes in certain aspects of the hydrological cycle under warming.\nHere we show that both these discrepancies can be explained by a controversial hypothesis of missing negative tropical feedbacks in climate models, known as the iris-effect: Expanding dry and clear regions in a warming climate yield a negative feedback as more infrared radiation can escape to space through this metaphorical opening iris. At the same time the additional infrared cooling of the atmosphere must be balanced by latent heat release thereby accelerating the hydrological cycle. Alternative suggestions of too little aerosol cooling, missing volcanic eruptions, or insufficient ocean heat uptake in models may explain a slow observed transient warming, but are not able to explain the observed enhanced hydrological cycle.\nWe propose that a temperature-dependency of the extent to which precipitating convective clouds cluster or aggregate into larger clouds constitutes a plausible physical mechanism for the iris-effect. On a large scale, organized convective states are dryer than disorganized convection and therefore radiate more in the longwave to space. Thus, if a warmer atmosphere can host more organized convection, then this represents one possible mechanism for an iris-effect. The challenges in modeling, understanding and possibly quantifying a temperature-dependency of convection are, however, substantial.",

We describe experiments & simulations of convective excitation of internal waves in water, exploiting its density maximum at 4C. The simulations show that waves are excited within the bulk of the convection zone, opposed to at the interface between the convective and stably stratified regions.

            "abstract": "The Handan-Xingtai district in the North China craton (NCC) is one of the most important concentrations of iron skarn deposits in China. The iron mineralization occurs predominantly along contact zones between early Cretaceous intrusions and Middle Ordovician marine carbonates. We present textural features and LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating results of hydrothermal zircon to constrain on the time of iron mineralization. Zircon grains from mineralized skarns are subhedral crystals and euhedral tetragonal bipyramids, which are closely intergrown with skarn minerals. They contain abundant inclusions of skarn minerals and daughter mineral-rich (mostly magnetite, halite, and sylvite) fluid inclusions, and have variable Th (518-17477 ppm) and U (109-25610 ppm) contents, with Th/U ratios of 0.01-5.23. These features indicate their hydrothermal origin.\nThe hydrothermal zircon grains from 5 deposits yield concordant U-Pb ages ranging from 133.6 ± 0.9 to 128.5 ± 1.4 Ma (2σ). These ages are consistent with U-Pb ages (134.1 ± 1.2 to 128.5 ± 0.9 Ma; 2σ) of magmatic zircon grains, confirming the reliability of hydrothermal zircon U-Pb ages. Our new geochronological data indicate that iron mineralization and associated magmatism in the Handan-Xingtai district occurred mainly at the ca. 137-133 and 131-128 Ma intervals. These iron skarn deposits represent as the only known giant Mesozoic iron skarn province in a cratonic block on the Earth. Their formation time coincided with lithospheric thinning or destruction of the NCC, strongly suggesting a causal link between the two processes. Our work provides a valuable approach to date iron skarn mineralization by using U-Pb geochronology of hydrothermal zircon and highlights its potential for similar studies.\nKeywords: Hydrothermal zircon; LA-ICPMS; U-Pb geochronology, iron skarn deposits; North China craton",

            "abstract": "To successfully deal with responses from the elastic earth, imaging techniques need to incorporate the elastic wave equation. Elastic Reverse-Time Migration (ERTM) with separating-while-imaging approach is capable of yielding physically meaningful PP, PS, SP, and SS images from multicomponent data. Even in PP images, ERTM has brought enhancements comparing to those from acoustic RTM because ERTM can handle converted waves. Converted-wave images, core results of ERTM, however, have two major problems related to characteristics of S-waves. First, polarity reversals according to propagation directions of S-waves cause destructive effect to final PS and SP images while each migrated result is stacked over the shots. In addition, non-existent spurious events which are produced by crosscorrelating downgoing S-waves in source wavefields and reflections associated with downgoing P-waves in receiver wavefields lead masking effects over true reflection events in SP and SS images. In this study, we adopt a wavefield decomposition method to solve the polarity problems and derive a new converted-wave imaging condition for SP and SS images to alleviate the generation of spurious events. The acceleration vector wavefield decomposition method used in our ERTM has advantages over the conventional wavefield separation method based on the Helmholtz decomposition because the wavefield decomposition can automatically compensate polarity changes in PS and SP images when the zero-lag crosscorrelation for vector wavefields is applied. To suppress spurious events in SP and SS images, our imaging condition is designed to make images only where S- and converted P-waves from source wavefields are coexisted with decomposed wavefields from receiver wavefields at reflection boundaries. To verify our new imaging condition, we tested our algorithm with OBC (Ocean Bottom Cable) data from elastic Marmousi-II model and compared the migrated images with those from ERTM with the zero-lag crosscorrelation imaging condition. The results evidently show that (c) SP and (d) SS images from our new imaging condition provide much clearer images without masking effects caused by spurious events than (a) SP and (b) SS images from the conventional imaging condition.",

            "abstract": "Classical biogeographical observations tell us that ecosystems (vegetation and soils) strongly respond to climate variation in terms of their structure and function. On the other hand the influence of vegetation function on climate via exchange of matter and energy with the atmosphere has become evident in the last decades via observational and modeling studies. Recent continuous observations of this exchange of CO2, H2O and sensible heat within the global observation network FLUXNET have enabled us to quantify ecosystem function in response to large eco-climatological spatio-temporal variability of climate. We see that ecosystem function co-varies strongly with climate, but that climate alone does not suffice to explain the variation in total. Instead vegetation biophysical and structural parameters co-determine the exchange of carbon, water and energy between the ecosystem and the atmosphere. By combining ecosystem level observation and information of spatial meteorological and vegetation remote sensing covariates we can infer global patterns of ecosystem atmosphere fluxes and derive key ecosystem functional properties globally. While this approach is powerful and meteorological and vegetation structural predictors explain more than 70% of the spatial variation of monthly fluxes at FLUXNET sites, it ignores the effect of ecophysiological vegetation properties, which is expected from plant physiological leaf or whole-plant studies. Hence, future research has to more strongly link the organismic trait information with ecosystem functional properties. For this we propose a framework that involves 1) the correlation of community aggregated traits with flux-derived ecosystem properties across a range of ecosystems, 2) the up-scaling of vegetation traits using spatially distributed geo-ecological co-variates and the comparison with global ecosystem functional properties and their co-variation with climate, 3) the use of vegetation traits instead of vegetation classes for empirical up-scaling of ecosystem-atmosphere fluxes from ecosystem to globe. I hypothesize that these studies will emphasize the superiority of a trait based approach for modeling global ecosystem functioning, but will also highlight the scale-emergent properties , which cannot be explained by plant traits alone.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice, prevailing in the polar region and characterized by distinct seasonal and interannual variability, plays a pivotal role in Earth’s climate system (Thomas and Dieckmann, 2010). In order to understand processes controlling the recent dramatic reduction in Arctic sea-ice cover, it is essential to determine temporal changes in sea-ice occurrence and its natural variability in the past. The North Icelandic shelf, bordering a marginal area of the Arctic Ocean, is located at the present-day boundary between the cold polar currents and warm Atlantic water masses, very sensitive to the changes in sea-ice cover, ice sheet and oceanic circulation patterns (Knudsen and Eiriksson, 2002). All these processes have been recorded in the marine shelf-sediment cores. We determined the concentrations of sea-ice diatom-derived biomarker “IP25” (monoene highly-branched isoprenoid with 25 carbon atom; Belt et al., 2007), phytoplankton-derived biomarkers (brassicasterol and dinosterol) and terrigenous biomarkers (campesterol and ß-sitosterol) in a sediment core from the North Icelandic shelf to reconstruct the Late Quaternary sea-ice conditions and related surface-water processes. The sea-ice cover reached its maximum during the cold period (i.e., Last Glacial Maximum and Younger dryas), while an open ocean environment existed during less severe periods (e.g. Bølling-Allerød and 8.2 ka event) in the study area. The biomarker records from this sediment core give insights into the variability in sea ice and circulation patterns as well as primary productivity in the Arctic marginal area during the Late Quaternary.\n",

            "abstract": "Lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of olivine is one of the key to interpret seismic anisotropy and to deduce flow pattern of the upper mantle. Although olivine is thought to account for most of seismic anisotropy of the upper mantle, a deformed peridotite under water-rich environment may include hydrous phases that develop LPO that can considerably contribute to the seismic anisotropy. Hydrous phases such as amphibole and chlorite are known to be elastically very anisotropic. Thus, LPOs of olivine as well as amphibole and chlorite in hydrated mantle peridotites from Bjørkedalen, southwestern Norway were investigated using SEM/EBSD system. Seismic velocity and seismic anisotropy of the three minerals were calculated on the basis of their measured LPOs. Olivine showed type-A and -B LPO, and a mixed LPO between type-A and type-B. Amphibole LPOs showed that [001] axes are aligned subparallel to lineation and [100] axes subnormal to foliation. Chlorite LPOs showed that [100] axes are aligned subparallel to lineation and [001] axes subnormal to foliation. Numerous hydrous inclusions found in olivine and orthopyroxene indicate that olivine fabric may have changed from type-A to type-B due to high water content under high stress. It is found that seismic anisotropy of both amphibole and chlorite is much higher than that of olivine. In addition, it is also found that amphibole and chlorite can lead to strong trench-parallel seismic anisotropy depending on flow geometry. Amphibole produced trench-parallel polarization direction of the fast S-wave from the dipping angle of 45° while chlorite showed the same characteristics from the dipping angle of 50°. This study suggests that the existence of the LPO of amphibole and chlorite in a hydrated peridotite can change the seismic anisotropy of the whole rock significantly.",

We interpreted these vortices as resulting from the Kelvin Helmholtz (K-H) instability. The resolution of simulation is an important parameter for the formation of vortices and turbulent convection as it is necessary to capture the small changes in convection which can trigger of vortex formation. Recent developments in computer technology have enabled us to run simulations with much higher resolution (0.06RS) then was previously possible. In this study we perform simulations of the Kronian magnetosphere for various IMF orientations to determine the conditions under which vortices form.\nIn this study we determine the minimum component of BZ for vortex formation and present a physical model showing how the combination of the IMF, Saturn’s rotating flows and reconnection determine when vortices form. From the detailed analysis of plasma convection in the magnetosheath and magnetosphere, there are important differences in the flow due to the tail reconnection and it affects the condition for K-H instability and vorticity in the overall magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Icing can cause a significant structural damage to aircraft during flight, resulting in various aviation accidents. Icing studies have been typically performed using two approaches: one is a numerical model-based approach and the other is a remote sensing-based approach. The model based approach diagnoses aircraft icing using numerical atmospheric parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and vertical thermodynamic structure. This approach tends to over-estimate icing according to the literature. The remote sensing-based approach typically uses meteorological satellite/ground sensor data such as Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and Dual-Polarization radar data. This approach detects icing areas by applying thresholds to parameters such as liquid water path and cloud optical thickness derived from remote sensing data. In this study, we propose an aircraft icing detection approach which optimizes thresholds for L1B bands and/or Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) from Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite-Meteorological Imager (COMS MI) and newly launched Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) over East Asia. The proposed approach uses machine learning algorithms including decision trees (DT) and random forest (RF) for optimizing thresholds of L1B data and/or COT. Pilot Reports (PIREPs) from South Korea and Japan were used as icing reference data. Results show that RF produced a lower false alarm rate (1.5%) and a higher overall accuracy (98.8%) than DT (8.5% and 75.3%), respectively. The RF-based approach was also compared with the existing COMS MI and GOES-R icing mask algorithms. The agreements of the proposed approach with the existing two algorithms were 89.2% and 45.5%, respectively. The lower agreement with the GOES-R algorithm was possibly due to the high uncertainty of the cloud phase product from COMS MI.",

            "abstract": "Near surface geophysical exploration for the purpose of engineering design or construction，For this reason, geophysical imaging demands a higher resolution and a better quantitative interpretation. Seismic travel time tomography and direct current resistivity tomography are two main methods for the near surface survey. Because of the limited coverage of observation system and the complex physical relationship between physical parameters and observations, individual geophysical method suffers issues of non-uniqueness and resolution limitation to some degree.\nWe have developed a joint inversion method to combine seismic travel time tomography and full channel resistivity tomography. For the full channel resistivity survey, it uses two electrodes for power supply and all the other electrodes for recording. Compared with the traditional resistivity method, it collects more data and has a better model converge. Our joint inversion strategy relies on the structure constraint enforced through minimizing cross gradients between seismic velocity and resistivity models (Gallardo, 2003). For resistivity tomography, sensitivity kernels are obtained through the adjoint method by solving the electrostatic field equation with the finite-difference method. For seismic travel time tomography, ray paths and travel times are calculated using the fast marching method.\nWe have tested our joint inversion method for a 2D cross-hole problem where two small zones with high and low velocity/resistivity anomalies. Seismic/electrical sources/receivers are installed in two boreholes. For separate seismic inversion, the smearing effect is evident and two anomaly zones are distorted and misplaced. For separate electric resistivity inversion, although two anomaly zones are positioned correctly their values are not accurate. By joint inversion, two velocity anomaly zones are clearly imaged and the smearing effect is greatly reduced. In comparison, for the resistivity model, the two anomaly zones have more accurate resistivity values but their structures are only slightly changed. Compared to separate inversions, joint inversion actually produces two models that better fit their respective data and at the same time are more similar in structure.",

            "abstract": "Broad coseismic deformation due to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, Japan, was detected by over 1200 land based GPS stations and several seafloor stations. Using these observations as constraints, we investigate how elastic structure under Japan influences coseismic deformation using finite element models incorporating geometry of the regional plate boundaries and elastic structures. Effects of elastic structures are examined by comparing analyses of following three structure models: (a) homogeneous half-space model, (b) two-layered model considering crust-mantle structure (rigidity of 35 and 65 GPa, respectively), (c) crust-mantle model with cold slab (85 GPa). The patterns of inverted slip distribution are basically similar for all three models, but taking a closer look, we can see the amount of maximum slip is not simply related to average rigidity of structure models: it increases from 37 m in homogeneous model to 40 m in two-layered model and then falls to 38 m in slab model. These characteristics can be understood by separately observing the behavior of the onshore (far field) and offshore (near field) displacements. We found the following two contradicting effects: (1) In the far field, relatively lower rigidity in the shallow part decreases the amount of displacement for the same slip. This can be explained by the decrease in seismic moment. (2) In the near field or just above the thrust, relatively lower rigidity in the shallow part increases the amount of displacement for the same slip amount. This is because the stiffer (less deformable) footwall requires more movement of the hanging wall to accommodate the slip. Comparing the computed displacements with three structure models, we found that crust-mantle layering is more effective on far field while slab effect is more prominent in the near field.",

            "abstract": "It has been a common and long lasting view that old-growth forests are carbon neutral, i.e., the uptake of CO2 by gross photosynthesis is equal to the release of the same amount through ecosystem respiration. This hypothesis was originally developed by Odum based on theoretical reasoning on the balance between stability and diversity in ecosystems and how this relationship shifted with succession over time. At that time, the theory was underpinned by a relatively scarce empirical material but later supported by the observed decline in net primary productivity (NPP) with increasing stand age. More recently, based on direct measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) Luyssaert et al. showed that old-growth forests still were significant sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide thus challenging the hypothesis that old forests are in balance with respect to uptake and emission of CO2. Most of the forests in Luyssaert et al. analyses were temperate and semi-arid boreal forests and only few were located in the humid boreal zone. In order to shed light on this issue we initiated in 2011 carbon exchange studies in an old (>200 years) undisturbed humid boreal forest in Northern Sweden using EC measurements of NEE and chamber measurements of soil effluxes. The results indicate that the forest is a small sink of CO2 in the order of 20 g C m-2 y-1. The forest floor vegetation contributes significantly to GPP, in the order of 25-40%, depending on time of season. The nighttime ecosystem respiration showed a weak increase with air temperature up to about 15 ºC and then it started to decrease. The reason for this decrease that occurred at a relatively low temperature is still unclear. The small annual sink of -20 g C m-2 observed here is similar in magnitude to changes in soil carbon content on nearby much older forests located on small islands which has not been disturbed for several hundreds of years. Our study thus confirms that old forests can continue to take up carbon although of relatively minor magnitude.",

This experiment was carried out in Fuke (19.5ºN, 109.1ºE), Hainan province, China. The Hainan VHF radar was used to observe the E-region field-aligned irregularities (FAIs) and the Hainan Digisonde was operated in the drift mode to record the drift velocities of the plasma blobs in the Es-layer. The QP echoes and the drift data of the whole year of 2013 were analyzed and compared. A surprising consistency between the striation tilt of the QP echoes and the drift direction of the plasma blobs was discovered. When the measured drift direction of the plasma blobs was southward, the negative echo striation of the QP FAIs was recorded, and vice versa. Furthermore, the phase of the echo trace was continuous, while the QP striation changed from negative to positive, or in contrary. Thus, a conclusion can be reached that the morphology of the QP echoes may be controlled by the background wind fields in the E-region. The northward/ southward drifting striated FAIs in the observing region of a coherent scatter radar possibly induce the positive/ negative QP echo striation in the range-time-intensity plots.",

Of significant scientific interest, yet remaining largely unexplored, accessing and sampling these environments presents several challenges to existing drilling technologies. With over half of the ice sheet believed to be resting on a wet bed, much of it part of a hydrological drainage network, accessing of this environment must conform to international environmental contamination protocols. This makes hot water drilling the most viable option for clean, fast, access through thick ice. After two decades of planning, involving the development of drilling techniques for subglacial access, instrument design and logistics set up, significant progress has been made in attempts to directly access, measure, and sample subglacial lakes and sediments. Combining the experiences from the notable setbacks and successes, as well as recent field testing for this drilling technique, the most practical technical options and operational procedures for future clean entry into Subglacial Lake Ellsworth and other deep (>3000 m) access targets will be presented.",

The basin has steep topography and high mountains to the northern side. The 40% of the basin is dominated by forest land while other land cover are: grass land, bare rocky land etc. About 2% of the areas in basin is covered by permanent glacier apart from that about 12% of basin has the snow and ice cover.

A process oriented distributed J2000 hydrologial model has been applied to understand the hydrological system dynamics.\nThe model application provides distributed output of various hydrological components. The J2000 model applies Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) as a modelling entity. With 6861 HRU and 1010 reaches, the model was calibrated (1981-1999) and validated (2000-2004) at a daily scale using split-sample test. The model is able to capture the overall hydrological dynamics well. The rising limbs and recession limbs are simulated equally and with satisfactory ground water conditions. Based on the graphical and statistical evaluation of the model performance the model is able to simulate hydrological processes fairly well. Calibration shows that Nash Sutcliffe efficiency is 0.91, coefficient of determination is 0.92 Initial observation shows that during the pre-monsoon season(March to May) the glacial runoff is 25% of the total discharge while in the monsoon(June to September) season it is only 13%. The surface runoff contributed about 40%, 20% in subsurface while there is about 13% in the base flow. For better understanding and interpretation of the area there is still need of further coherent research and analysis for land use change and future climate change impact in the glaciered alpine catchment of Himalayan region.",

            "abstract": "The Korean Peninsula which is located in an intraplate area is known as seismically inactive region. However there were unusual several offshore earthquakes occurred around the southwestern Korean Peninsula in 2013. In addition, a small earthquake (Ml 3.5) occurred on 23 September 2014 around Gyeongju close to a nuclear power plant and many people felt a shock of the earthquake. Concerns over the safety of nuclear power plants were rising and therefore seismicity in this region was investigated. There were 61 earthquakes with local magnitude (Ml) greater than 1.7 occurred around Gyeongju since 1994 by KIGAM (Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources) catalog. These events were relocated and calculated focal mechanisms. Also, I analyzed using continuous waveform data within 7 days before and after the mainshock recorded at HDB station with the epicentral distance of about 9 km, to find smaller events of the 2014 Gyeongju earthquake. 84 foreshocks and 108 aftershocks were identified and I located events with a minimum of 5 phases (4 P and 1 S). According to the relocated results, I may classify seismicity roughly into two groups. One group is aligned along right-hand side of the Ulsan Fault and the other is located near by the Bomunho. 13 quakes occurred from 1999 to 2003 close by artificial lake called Bomunho created in the late 1970s may be triggered microearthquakes by artificial water reservoirs but further research is needed to find causes of the events.",

            "abstract": "Landslide erosion is a key driver of sediment yield at the watershed scale. In snowy cold region, landslide is active especially in snowmelt season, leading to increase in lateral erosion during snowmelt floods. Then, snowmelt flood in spring season is crucial for water, sediment and nutrient cycles from mountain to coast. Common hydrological models such as SWAT and WEPP are useful tools to evaluate and/or predict hydrology and sediment dynamics at watershed scale in snowy cold region, but not include the landslide erosion process. To develop the SWAT model for modeling water and suspended sediment discharge in snowmelt-dependent watersheds, we investigated the suspended sediment yield using fingerprinting technique, and correlated with landslide distribution using GIS. Suspended sediment yield was determined and found to be varied with each lithological group in the watersheds, showing the highest sediment yield in the metamorphic rock area represented by serpentine rock. From this result, the suspended sediment yield at sub-basin scale was estimated according to the geological composition and correlated with landslide density. The correlation analysis showed that the suspended sediment yield increases in respond to the landslide area along the stream channel. To incorporate the landslide erosion process into the SWAT model, the parameter associated with channel bank erosion was weighted with landslide density along main channel, assuming the lateral erosion as a key driver of landslide erosion. In result of calibration for sediment discharge, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient was improved for the landslide-incorporated model from for the model with default parameter set.",

            "abstract": "The COSC-1 scientific borehole was drilled in the summer of 2014 to ~2.5 km depth to study the structure and composition of the Middle Allochthon of the Central Scandinavian Caledonides. It crosscuts the amphibolite-grade lower part of the Seve nappe and intersects a mylonite zone in the lower 800 m of the borehole. We selected six core samples representing the primary lithologies in the COSC-1 borehole for laboratory investigation of elastic properties. The cores consisted of two amphibolites with differing grain sizes, a calc-silicate gneiss, a felsic gneiss, a coarse grained amphibole bearing gneiss, and a garnet bearing mylonitic schist from the basal shear zone.\nBoth P- and S-waves were measured at ultrasonic frequency (1 MHz), and room temperature hydrostatic pressure conditions up to 260 MPa. Measurements were made along three mutually perpendicular directions, one perpendicular to foliation and two parallel to the foliation with one aligned with mineral lineation. Vp and Vs, anisotropy, and elastic properties are reported as an extrapolation of the high-pressure portion of the ultrasonic measurements back to the intersection with the zero pressure axis. The Vp and Vs in the direction perpendicular to foliation ranges from 5.51-6.67 km/s and 3.18-4.13 km/s, respectively. In the direction parallel to foliation the Vp and Vs ranges from 6.31-7.25 km/s and 3.52-4.35 km/s, respectively. Vp anisotropy ranges from 3% in the calc-silicate gneiss to 18% in mylonitic schist. Acoustic impedance estimations at lithostatic pressure conditions at base of the borehole (70 MPa) show that acoustic impedance contrast generating reflection coefficients between the basal shear zone and overlying units are significant enough to cause seismic reflections. Above the mylonite zone/shear zone, the reflectivity within the lower Seve nappe is due to the impedance contrast between the felsic gneiss and the amphibolite. This result fits with 3D seismic reflection imaging in the area of the borehole. Layered anisotropic mica-schists of metasedimentary origin are suitable candidates for reflections in the middle crust of orogens.",

            "abstract": "Many regions within SE Asia have as great a density of active seismic structures as does the western US – Sumatra, Myanmar, Bangladesh, New Guinea and the Philippines come first to mind. Much of Earth’s release of seismic energy in the current millennium has, in fact, come from these regions, with great losses of life and livelihoods. Unfortunately, the scientific progress upon which seismic-risk reduction in SE Asia ultimately depends has been and continues to be slow. Last year at AGU, for example, I counted 57 talks about the M6 Napa earthquake. In contrast, I can’t recall hearing any talk on a SE Asian M6 earthquake at any venue in the past many years. In fact, even M7+ earthquakes often go unstudied.\nNot uncommonly, the region’s earthquake scientists face high financial and political impediments to conducting earthquake research. Their slow speed in the development of scientific knowledge doesn’t bode well for speedy progress in the science of seismic hazards, the sine qua non for substantially reducing seismic risk.\nThere are two basic necessities for the region to evolve significantly from the current state of affairs. Both involve the development of regional infrastructure: 1) Data: Robust and accessible geophysical monitoring systems would need to be installed, maintained and utilized by the region’s earth scientists and their results shared internationally. Concomitantly, geological mapping (sensu lato) would need to be undertaken. 2) People: The training, employment, and enduring support of a new, young, international corps of earth scientists would need to accelerate markedly.\nThe United States could play an important role in achieving the goal of significant seismic risk reduction in the most seismically active countries of SE Asia by taking the lead in establishing a coalition to robustly fund a multi-decadal program that supports scientists and their research institutions to work alongside local expertise.",

            "abstract": "Solar wind dynamic pressure pulse (DPP) structures, across which the dynamic pressure abruptly changes over timescales from a few seconds to several minutes, are often observed in the near-Earth space environment. In this investigation, we first present a statistical study on the properties of strong dynamic pressure pulses in the solar wind during solar cycle 23. It is found that overwhelming majority of DPPs are associated with the solar wind disturbances including the CME-related flows, the corotating interaction regions, as well as the complex ejecta. The annual variations of the averaged occurrence rate of DPPs are roughly in phase with the solar activities. Although the variabilities of geosynchronous magnetic fields (GMFs) due to the impact of positive DPPs have been well established, there appears no systematic investigations on the response of GMFs to negative DPPs. Here we also study the decompression/compression effects of very strong negative/positive DPPs on GMFs under northward IMFs. In response to the decompression of strong negative DPPs, GMFs on dayside, near the dawn and dusk on nightside are generally depressed. But near the midnight region, the responses of GMF are very diverse, being either positive or negative. For part of events when GOES is located at the midnight sector, GMF is found to abnormally increase as the result of magnetospheric decompression caused by negative DPPs. It is known that on certain conditions magnetic depression of nightside GMFs can be caused by the impact of positive DPPs. Here we found that, a stronger pressure enhancement may have a higher probability of producing the exceptional depression of GMF at midnight region. Statistically, both the decompression effect of strong negative DPPs and the compression effect of strong positive DPPs depend on the magnetic local time, being stronger at the noon sector.",

            "abstract": "There are many large basins in southern Africa that are mostly ungauged but may have some streamflow observations either on the main river or on tributaries. Many of the streamflow records are, however, of poor quality or impacted by largely unquantified and non-stationary development impacts. All water resources assessments are therefore uncertain and model setups are difficult to validate in traditional ways. The paper presents a method for practical uncertainty assessment using a semi-distributed (sub-basin) model. The method uses a 2-stage approach where the first stage involves obtaining ‘behavioural’ parameter sets to represent the incremental natural streamflow for each sub-basin. The criteria for ‘behavioural’ are based on a series of constraints on model output that can be developed from the available gauged data or from regional assessments of natural hydrological functioning. The second stage simulates the whole basin based on sampling the ‘behavioural’ incremental flow parameter sets, as well as samples of additional individual parameter values representing downstream routing parts of the model and development impacts. One of the perceived advantage of the method is that all the ensembles at the total basin outlet are made up of behavioural inputs for all sub-basins. The method is also flexible in terms of the uncertainty range of the constraints, which might be expected to be narrow (low uncertainty) in well gauged sub-basins, or areas where our understanding of flow regime characteristics is good, but much wider (higher uncertainty) in other parts of the basin. The paper briefly explains the approach and discusses some of the issues associated with its application using examples from southern Africa.",

We hypothesized that Narea should be sum of a structural component proportional to leaf mass per area (LMA) and a metabolic component, predicted by optimality considerations to be proportional to irradiance while decreasing with air-to-leaf carbon dioxide drawdown (ci:ca) and temperature. The significant partial environmental and LMA effects on Narea that are both qualitatively and quantitatively supported this hypothesis by using LMA, leaf δ13C and Narea measurements on transcontinental transect in Australia. Trait gradient analysis revealed ci:ca to be perfectly plastic, while species turnover contributed about half the variation in LMA and Narea, consistent with a strong contribution of species turnover to the variation of these traits with environment.

In order to quantify CH4 fluxes at temperate forest at various spatiotemporal scales, we have continuously measured CH4 fluxes at two upland forests based on the micrometeorological hyperbolic relaxed eddy accumulation (HREA) and automated dynamic closed chamber methods.\nThe measurements have been conducted at Teshio experimental forest (TSE) since September 2013 and Yamashiro forest meteorology research site (YMS) since November 2014. Three automated chambers were installed on each site. Our system can measure CH4 flux by the micrometeorological HREA, vertical concentration profile at four heights, and chamber measurements by a laser-based gas analyzer (FGGA-24r-EP, Los Gatos Research Inc., USA).\nSeasonal variations of canopy-scale CH4 fluxes were different in each site. CH4 was consumed during the summer, but was emitted during the fall and winter in TSE; consequently, the site acted as a net annual CH4 source. CH4 was steadily consumed during the winter, but CH4 fluxes fluctuated between absorption and emission during the spring and summer in YMS. YMS acted as a net annual CH4 sink.\n CH4 uptake at the canopy scale generally decreased with rising soil temperature and increased with drying condition for both sites. CH4 flux measured by most of chambers showed the consistent sensitivity examined for the canopy scale to the environmental variables. CH4 fluxes from a few chambers located at a wet condition were independent of variations in soil temperature and moisture at both sites. Magnitude of soil CH4 uptake was higher than the canopy-scale CH4 uptake. Our results showed that the canopy-scale CH4 fluxes were totally different with the plot-scale CH4 fluxes by chambers, suggesting the considerable spatial heterogeneity in CH4 flux at the temperate forests.",

            "abstract": "In efforts to facilitate nitrate removal, a variety of coating materials and mineral additives were assessed for their effects on the nitrate reduction by zerovalent iron (ZVI). Coated ZVIs were prepared by reacting Fe particles with Cr(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and S(-II) solutions under anoxic conditions, with the resultant materials named Cr/Fe, Co/Fe, Ni/Fe, Cu/Fe, and FeS/Fe, respectively. The mineral additives used, synthesized or purchased, included goethite, magnetite, and hydrous ferric oxide (HFO). Kinetic experiments were performed using air-tight serum vials containing 1.0 g Fe (uncoated or coated forms) in 15 mL of 100 mg NO3×N/L solutions with pH buffered at 7.0. To monitor the reaction progress, the solution phase was analyzed for NO3-, NO2-, and NH4+ on an ion chromatography, while the headspace was analyzed for H2, N2, and O2 on a gas chromatography. By uncoated Fe, ca. 60% of nitrate was reductively transformed for 3.6 h, with NH4+ being the predominant product. Compared with uncoated one, Cr/Fe, Co/Fe, and Cu/Fe showed faster removal rates of nitrate. The observed reactivity enhancement was thought to result from additional reduction of nitrate by H atoms adsorbed on the surface of Cr, Co, or Cu metal. In contrast, both Ni/Fe and FeS/Fe showed slower removal of nitrate than uncoated Fe. In both cases, the coating, which highly disfavors the adsorption of nitrate, would form on the Fe surface. When goethite, HFO, and magnetite were amended, the nitrate reduction by Fe was significantly increased, with the effect being most evident with HFO. Although not capable of reducing nitrate, the mineral additives would serve as crystal nuclei for the corrosion products of Fe, thus making the development of passivation layers on the Fe surface less. In the future, we will perform a kinetic modeling of the experimental data to assess the relative contribution of multiple reaction paths in the nitrate reduction by Fe.",

However, the representations of BC and BrC in state-of-the-art climate models remain highly uncertain, in part due to the poor understanding of their microphysical and optical properties. Direct observations and characterizations of the mixing state and absorption enhancement of ambient aerosols could provide invaluable constraints for current model representations of aerosol radiative effects.\nHere, we will discuss results from measurements of aerosol light absorption and absorption enhancement (Eabs), using a thermodenuder-absorption method, made during two recent field studies in central and southern California. The winter study took place in Dec/Jan of 2014/2015 in Fresno, CA. This region is severely impacted by particulate matter from local and regional residential biomass burning. The summer study took place in July 2015 in Fontana, CA, a region ~80 km downwind of Los Angeles and strongly impacted by vehicular emissions, and thus provides a sharp contrast to the Fresno study. Eabs of BC particles due to the “lensing” effect from coatings to BC core and/or the presence of BrC will be quantified and compared between the two studies. Additionally, the chemical composition of bulk and the BC-containing particles are determined via a HR-ToF-AMS and a SP-AMS, respectively. Variations in the composition and mixing state of the ambient particles and how these affect the observed Eabs will be examined. The overall measurements suggest a relatively small role for lensing-induced absorption enhancements for ambient particles in these regions.",

            "abstract": "One of the clearest differences among major vegetation types is allocation to woody biomass. Whether and to what extent plants invest in this long-lived tissue has a major impact on carbon storage and can have important feedbacks to the rising CO2 in the atmosphere. Wood is a multifaceted structure. It can allow plants to escape from ground fires, the pressure of herbivores, and perhaps most importantly competition with other plants for light. Understanding the result of this final pressure requires an incorporation of individual-based interactions among plants. This can be a particularly difficult because of both high computational demands and errors in implementation and understanding of such complex models. We have made progress on both difficulties for understanding allocation to woody biomass among trees in forests. Across gradients in resource availability within forests, we find a significant influence of individual-based competition on dominant plant allocation to woody biomass. In model predictions and observed differences among forests globally major tradeoffs occur in allocation to woody biomass versus allocation to fine roots. This is driven by shifting importance of individual-based competition for light versus shared resources belowground, in particular water and nitrogen. Moving beyond forests to biome boundaries, transitions between grassland, savanna, and forest we see again that competition can play an important role. In these zones of rapid change however, population dynamics is not as simple as a steady-state closed-canopy forest. Disturbance dynamics including response to fire and drought stress are also important pressures on dominant plant strategies. Here I show progress in incorporating disturbance dynamics with individual based competition to predict and understand dominant plant strategies including allocation to woody biomass. Results indicate that the influence of competition varies with disturbance regime. With stochastic disturbance regimes we find coexistence among strategies should be common and lead to diverse communities that are less vulnerable to the sudden changes in disturbance regime that may accompany climate change than communities with a history of a steady or predictable environment.",

Measurements in ridges located in the Antarctica are practically challenged by harsh conditions such as extensive and moving sea ice cover and stiff seafloor composed of diatomaceous sediments. We planned heat flow measurements across the Adare Trough, north of the Ross Sea, during the recent Korean icebreaker R/V Araon’s Antarctic expedition (ANA05B; Dec 12th 2014-Feb 25th 2015) to get thermal information which is a missing piece in terms of geophysical data in this region to describe its asymmetric activity in spreading rate. Finally, we collected information only at three stations across the eastern flank of the Adare Trough over 70 km along with NBP9702 seismic line because of various limitations above. It is a preliminary result that observed heat flow seems significantly higher than estimated one from known magnetic anomaly age using a global age-heat flow curve. In order to conclude some suggestion, we need further studies regarding identification of ‘real’ heat flow from lithosphere, and increase of the number of data. More heat flow measurements will be carried out again on the eastern flank in the next Araon’s Antarctic expedition (tentatively ANA06C; March 2016) to supplement the small number of data.",

            "abstract": "Farmland is the most basic material conditions for guaranteeing rural livelihoods and national food security, and exploring management strategies that take both of the sustainable rural livelihoods and sustainable farmland use into account has vital significance of theory and practice. Farmland is a complex and self-adaptive system that couples human and natural systems together, and natural factors and social factors that are related to its changing process need to be considered when modeling farmland changing process. This paper takes Qianjingou Town in Inner Mongolia farming-pastoral zone as study area. From the perspective of the relationship between households’ livelihoods and farmland use, this study builds the process mechanism of farmland use change based on questionnaires data, and constructs multi-agent simulation model of farmland use change with the help of Eclipse and Repast toolbox. Through simulating the relationship between natural factors (with geographical location) and households’ behaviors, this paper systematically simulates households’ renting and abandoning farmland behaviors, and truly describes dynamic interactions between households’ livelihoods and factors related to farmland use change. These factors include natural factors (net primary productivity, road accessibility, slope and relief amplitude) and social factors (households’ family structures, economic development and government policies). In the end, this study scientifically predicts farmland use change trend in the future 30 years. The simulation results show that, the number of abandoned and sublet farmland plots has a gradually increasing trend, the number of non-farm households and pure-outwork households has a remarkable increasing trend, and the number of part-farm households and pure-farm households shows a decreasing trend. Households’ livelihoods sustainability in the study area is confronted with increasing pressure, and households’ nonfarm employment has an increasing trend, while regional appropriate-scale agricultural management can be maintained. The research results establish the theory foundation and basic method for developing sustainable farmland use managements that can both meet households’ willing and guarantee grain and ecology security.",

While temperature, precipitation and dynamic processes are key drivers of glacial change, deposition of light absorbing impurities such as mineral dust and black carbon can lead to accelerated melting through surface albedo reduction. Here, we discuss the origin of deposited mineral dust and black carbon and their impacts on albedo change and radiative forcing (RF).\n218 snow samples were taken from 13 snow pits on 4 glaciers, Abramov (Pamir), Suek, Glacier No. 354 and Golubin (Tien Shan), representing deposition between summer 2012 and 2014. They were analyzed for elemental and organic carbon by a thermo-optical method, mineral dust by gravimetry, and iron by ICP-MS. Back trajectory ensembles were released every 6 hours with the Lagranto model for the covered period at all sites. Boundary layer “footprints” were calculated to estimate general source regions and combined with MODIS fire counts for potential fire contributions. Albedo reduction due to black carbon and mineral dust was calculated with the Snow-Ice-Aerosol-Radiative model (SNICAR), and surface spectral irradiances were derived from atmospheric radiative transfer calculations to determine the RF under clear-sky and all sky conditions using local radiation measurements.\nDust contributions came from Central Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, the Sahara and partly the Taklimakan. Fire contributions were higher in 2014 and generally came from the West and North. We find that EC exerts roughly 3 times more RF than mineral dust in fresh and relatively fresh snow (~5 W/m2) and up to 6 times more in snow that experienced melting (> 10 W/m2) even though EC concentrations (average per snow pit from 90 to 700 ng/g) were up to two orders of magnitude lower than mineral dust (10 to 140 µg/g).",

            "abstract": "The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) is one of the most important food and fibre regions in Australia, producing one-third of the national food supply and exporting produce to many other countries. In total, the Basin contains about 40% of Australia’s farms and 70% of Australia’s irrigated land area. However, the MDB is also one of the most spatially and temporally variable river systems in the world, with severe droughts a regular occurrence over the ~100 years of instrumental record and decadal-scale droughts (e.g. “Federation” (~1895-1902), “World War II” (~1937-1945) and “Millennium” or “Big Dry” (~1997-2010) droughts) matched by flood dominated epochs (e.g. 1950s, 1970s). The accurate estimation of drought risk in the MDB is hampered by relatively short instrumental records and also by the complexity of the region’s climate teleconnections with several large-scale ocean-atmospheric processes in the Pacific (El Niño Southern Oscillation, Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation), the Indian (Indian Ocean Dipole) and Southern Oceans (Southern Annular Mode). Climate-sensitive paleoclimate records provide an opportunity to resolve hydroclimatic variability over long time periods prior to the availability of instrumental records and therefore offer the potential for improved quantification of risks associated with hydroclimatic extremes. However, the MDB, as with many regions in Australia, currently lacks suitable in situ proxies necessary to do this.\nTherefore, remote paleoclimate rainfall proxies in the Australasian region spanning are used to develop new reconstructions of MDB rainfall over the Common Era (CE) (i.e. approximately the past 2000 years). The nature of MDB dry epochs from 749BCE to 1981CE are then compared with the frequency and duration of droughts recorded in instrumental records (i.e. approximately the past 100 years). Importantly, the results show that the probability of decadal scale droughts is three times greater than instrumental records suggest.",

            "abstract": "Climate warming triggers the release of permafrost organic carbon (OC) via permafrost thaw and erosion, exporting large amounts of terrestrial C to aquatic environments and making previously frozen OC from a range of soil depths available for microbial processing. It is estimated 210-476 Pg C is stored in deep, ice-rich loess-dominated soils referred to as yedoma. Yedoma is extensive in NE Siberia and Alaska, where it underlies an area of over 1,000,000 km2 and averages 25 m in thickness. Recent research suggests ancient (Pleistocene-aged) permafrost OC, such as yedoma OC, is rapidly and preferentially utilized by microbial communities in Arctic headwater streams. We utilized a combination of short-term laboratory incubations and a whole-stream approach to examine permafrost-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) uptake, processing, and transport rates in a small stream which drains yedoma uplands in Cherskii, NE Siberia. Short-term incubations were conducted on permafrost leachates mixed with stream water to quantify microbial processing rates of permafrost-derived DOC from leachates made with surface (0-15 cm), shallow (70-100 cm), and deep (<2 m) yedoma sediments. In addition, we conducted whole-stream DOC release experiments to quantify permafrost DOC uptake length, rate, and velocity. DOC composition from samples collected during both the incubations and the nutrient-release experiments was characterized using absorbance measurements (SUVA254 and SR) and florescence spectrometry (EEMs) to quantify how DOC composition correlates to and changes with permafrost DOC bioavailability and processing parameters. Preliminary results suggest DOC processing rates may be highest in leachates made from surface sediments, which receive fresh OC input from modern ecosystems, and from deep sediments, which contain ancient, previously immobile OC. Shallow permafrost OC, which experiences degradation from annual freeze-thaw cycles without receiving fresh OC input, may have the lowest DOC processing rates.",

            "abstract": "The Marcellus Shale is currently the largest shale gas formation in play across the world. The low-permeability formation requires hydraulic fracturing to be produced. In this process, millions of gallons of water are blended with chemical additives and pumped into each well to fracture the reservoir rock. Although additives account for less than 2% of the fracking fluid mixture, they amount to hundreds of tons per frack job. The environmental properties of some of these additives have been studied, but their behavior under downhole conditions is not widely reported in the peer-reviewed literature. These compounds and their reaction products may return to the surface as produced or waste water. In the event of a spill or release, this water has the potential to contaminate surface soil and water.\nOf these additives, biocides may present a formidable challenge to water quality. Biocides are toxic compounds (by design), typically added to the Marcellus Shale to control bacteria in the well. An assessment of the most frequently used biocides indicated a need to study the chemical dazomet under reservoir conditions. The Marcellus Shale contains significant deposits of pyrite. This is a ubiquitous mineral within black shales that is known to react with organic compounds in both oxic and anoxic settings. Thus, the objective of our study was to determine the effect of pyrite on the hydrolysis of dazomet. Liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QQQ) was used to calculate the loss rate of aqueous dazomet. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify the reaction products.\nOur experiments show that in water, dazomet rapidly hydrolyses in water to form organic and inorganic transformation products. This reaction rate was unaffected when performed under anoxic conditions. However, with pyrite we found an appreciable increase in the removal rate of dazomet. This was accompanied by a corresponding change in the distribution of observed reaction products. Our results indicate the need to determine specific mineral-additive interactions to evaluate the potential risks of chemical use in hydraulic fracturing.",

            "abstract": "Transmitted wave occurs as fast p-wave and slow p-wave in certain conditions when seismic waves travel through inhomogeneous layers. Energy of slow p-waves is strongest at some frequency band, but rather weak at both high frequency band and low frequency band, called scattering resonance. For practical seismic exploration, the frequency of slow p-wave occurs is below 10Hz, which cannot be explained by Biot’s theory which predicts existence of the slow p-wave at ultrasonic band in the porous media. The slow p-wave equation have been derived, but which only adapted to explaining slow p-wave in the ultrasonic band. Experimental observations exhibit that slow p-wave also exists in nonporous media but with enormous low-velocity interbeds. When vertical incidence, elastic wave is simplified as compressing wave, the generation of slow waves is independent on shear wave. In the case of flat interbed and gas bubble, Liu (2006) has studied the transmission of acoustic waves, and found that the slow waves below the 10Hz frequency band can be explained. In the case of general elastic anisotropy medium, the tiheoretical research on the generation of slow waves is insufficient. Aiming at this problem, this paper presents an exponential mapping method based on transmitted wave (Magnus 1954), which can successfully explain the generation of the slow wave transmission in that case. Using the prediction operator (Claerbout 1985) to represent the transmission wave, this can be derived as first order partial differential equation. Using expansions in the frequency domain and the wave number domain, we find that the solutions have different expressions in the case of weak scattering and strong scattering. Besides, the method of combining the prediction operator and the exponential map is needed to extend to the elastic wave equation. Using the equation (Frazer and Fryer 1984, 1987), we derive the exponential mapping solution for the prediction operator of the general elastic medium. Using quaternion and Pfaffian(Dyson 1970) techniques, the matrix’s exponential mapping solution is further solved as the hyperbolic trigonometric functions or trigonometric matrix elements. Using the Fourier transform, slow wave’s Airy-like function can be obtained. This study shows that slow waves only occur in the case of strong scattering.",

The feature of simulation has an advanced robustness to strong solar wind case because a triangular grid is used, which is able to calculate in the uniform accuracy over the whole region. Therefore we can simulate extreme event such as the Bastille day storm. The resolution is 7682 grids in the horizontal direction and 240 grids in the radial direction. The inner boundary of the simulation box is set at 2.6 Re. We investigate the reproduction of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling simulation in strong solar wind case. Therefore we compared the simulation results with the observation of the Bastille day storm event (2000/7/15), in which the solar wind velocity is above 1000 km/s and the value of Bz reached -60 nT. Especially, we focus the cross polar cap potential (CPCP) saturation and time variation because the CPCP represents the value of magnetospheric - ionospheric convection strength via region 1 current. The CPCP depends on solar wind electric field, dynamic pressure and ionospheric conductivity [Siscoe et al., 2002; Kivelson et al., 2008]. The model of Kivelson et al. [2008] shows a good reproduction to the CPCP variation. However their study assumes that the ionospheric conductivity is constant. The conductivity in our simulation of the Bastille day event is varied by the auroral activity. In this lecture, we discuss the effect of both the auroral conductance and solar EUV-driven conductance to CPCP saturation.",

This study presents the estimation of daily discharge of Tamor River basin located in eastern Nepal with relative contribution of snow and ice melt using this approach, which is based on the relation that the melting of snow or ice during any particular period is proportional to the positive temperature linked by positive degree day factor. The study basin is one of the sub-basins of Koshi River basin that lies in the Himalayan region and has an area of 4001.2 km2 with approximately 9.4 % of the total basin covered by glaciers (debris covered and clean ice type) and approximately 21.5 % of the area lying above 5000 m a.s.l. The model is calibrated from 2001 to 2005 and validated from 2007 to 2010. The model efficiency assessments show good results with Nash – Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients and volume differences as 0.80 and 4.8 %, respectively in calibration and 0.83 and 1.1 %, respectively in validation periods. The average discharges during these periods are 237.95 m3/s and 231.49 m3/s with 43.3 % and 40.7 % of average snow and ice melt contributions, respectively. The model is also used to project river discharge from 2020 to 2050 with meteorological input data (i.e., temperature and precipitation) projected from Regional Climate Model using Weather Research and Forecasting (V3.5) model of 12 km resolution and boundary conditions from NorESM, which is bias corrected to the basin scale for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios. The model projection shows increase in river discharge by 0.24 m3/s per year with decreasing snow and ice contribution by 0.03 m3/s per year under RCP 4.5 scenario, whereas it shows decrease in total river discharge and snow and ice contribution as well by 0.29 m3/s and 0.28 m3/s per year, respectively under RCP 8.5 scenario. The study indicates that this model can provide valuable insights into the glacio-hydrological study, especially in the Himalayan regions with less input data and can be very useful tool for present and future water resource management.",

The poor representation of convection is the source of many model biases, especially over the Maritime Continent in the Tropics. We simulate low-level convergence lines over north-eastern Australia using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model (version 3.7). The simulations are events from September-October 2002 driven by sea breeze circulations. Cloud lines associated with bore-waves that form along the low-level convergence lines are thoroughly investigated in this study with comparisons from satellite and surface observations. Initial simulations for a series of cloud lines observed on 4th October, 2002 over the Gulf of Carpentaria showed greater agreement in the timing and propagation of the disturbance and the low-level convergence, however the cloud lines or streets of roll clouds were not properly captured by the model. Results from a number of WRF simulations with different microphysics, cumulus and planetary boundary layer schemes, resolution and boundary conditions will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "In order to measure and understand the relationship between water and landslides in tropical environment we studied the correlation between annual rainfall and ‘Mare à Poule d’Eau‘landslide located in the Salazie erosion basin in the Island of La Reunion. This island is characterized by annual cumulative rainfall locally exceeding 7m. Among the three major techniques used to measure landslide displacement (GNSS measurements, InSAR techniques and image correlation), we chose correlation of SPOT5 images acquired between 2002 and 2014 which gives a synoptic view of landslide displacements on a period of several months to years combined with GNSS measurements. The combination of these two techniques avoids the smoothing of the temporal signal produced by image correlation only and preserves a synoptic view of the landslide displacement. We used 10 panchromatic SPOT 5 images acquired with similar incidence angles and ortho-rectified by CNES (French spatial agency) at a spatial resolution of 2.5m. The dates of these images are 02/2002, 07/2003, 05/2004, 06/2005, 06/2006, 05/2008, 02/2010, 08/2012, 01/2014, 05/2014. The correlation, realized with a precision of 0.1pixel, was realized using MicMac open source software (IGN–French geographical institute). Every pixel was correlated with a correlation window of 9 px. The GNSS data were acquired by the BRGM since 2003 at a daily period. The rainfall data have been acquired by Meteo France on 7 stations located among the Salazie erosion basin. The first results of this study shows that the maximum displacement of the landslide measured by image correlation is 1.70 m.y-1 and also that there is a large spatial variability among the landslide. These values match well with GNSS data. There is not a good correlation between averaged yearly rainfall values and landslide displacement; however there is a significant correlation between intense meteorological events and displacement. In 2007, the tropical cyclone GAMEDE (02/2007) produced intense rainfalls. The velocity of the landslide was the largest of this study (1.70m.y-1). When the rainfall was less intense (between 10/2002 and 07/2003, when no intense event happened) the maximum velocity decreased to 0.50m.y-1. This dataset shows a good correlation between punctual intense rainfalls and landslide displacement.",

            "abstract": "Landscape Evolution Models are now at the stage of development where if calibrated, they can provide meaningful and useful results. However, these models are largely calibrated with parameter values determined from present, or comparatively recent surface conditions which are themselves product of much longer-term geology-soil-climate-vegetation interactions. A significant issue for numerically based Landscape Evolution Models (LEMs) is their calibration/parameterisation and validation of any results. Before use, each LEM requires a set of data and parameter values for it to run reliably and most importantly produce results with some measure of precision and accuracy. Here we examine the reliability of a LEM to predict catchment form over geological time (here 500 000 years) for a potential rehabilitated mine landform using defensible parameters derived from field plots. The findings here demonstrate that there is no equifinality in landscape form. The employment of different parameter sets produce geomorphically and hydrologically unique landscapes throughout their entire evolution. Therefore parameterisation does matter at geological time scales. While at relatively short (<10 000 years) time scales the differences in hillslope form are minimal (as described by the hypsometric curve, area-slope and cumulative area distribution) there are large differences in sediment output. Therefore obtaining reliable and defensible parameters for input to LEMs is essential.",

Unfortunately urbanization and climate change can compromise hydrological services. In this paper, we consider the impacts of both land-use change and climate change on hydrological services. Our study area includes the entire extent of the Datuan river watershed, which is located in the northern part of Taiwan. We used CLUE-s model to predict future land-use change. We then used the InVEST model to calculate hydrological services, such as water yield, nitrogen retention, phosphorus retention, and sediment retention. Finally, we analyzed the impacts of land use change and climate change on hydrological services. We used the IPCC fifth assessment report (AR5) scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 as a component of near future land-use changes and future precipitation regimes. The results indicate that while water yields will be significantly affected by climate change, nitrogen retention and phosphorus retention will be significantly affected by land use change. Whereas both projected land-use change and climate change will have little impact on projected sediment retention. All in all, impact analysis indicates that both land-use and climate change will not only have huge impacts on overall hydrological services, particularly water yield, but also the distribution of such services.",

It is also one of the key sites of the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC-806) “Our way to Europe” aiming at the reconstruction of environmental conditions in the source region of modern man (H. sapiens). It is suggested that a changing environment could have triggered the mobility and dispersal of modern man. The oldest known fossils of anatomical modern humans (~195 ka BP) were found in the Omo basin, not more than 90km westwards of our drill site.\nThe deposits in the tectonic basin of Chew Bahir in southern Ethiopia were cored in Nov. 2014 in two boreholes down to 280 m and 260 m below surface respectively. The overlapping long cores (drilled ~20 m apart from each other), were opened, scanned, described and sampled in low resolution in April 2015. The recovered sediments mostly contain green-greyish to light coloured and brown to reddish clays and silty clays, interbedded with some laminated mica-rich sand layers and occurrences of carbonate concretions and nodules, which decrease upcore. Here we will present a first set of results on the composite core, comprising mainly lithology and magnetic susceptibility (MS). Based on known sedimentation rates from pre-studies performed on short cores across the basin, we anticipate the deep drilled cores to cover at least 500 ka BP. Moreover, new insights into the role of post-depositional alteration, especially of clay minerals and zeolites, will be presented as a contribution to an improved understanding of formation processes. The results support the identification of wet and dry climate periods in the past. Those pronounced variations of moisture availability, are thought to have influenced the evolution and mobility of Homo sapiens sapiens.",

            "abstract": "Land surface models are moving to more detailed vegetation canopy descriptions in order to better represent certain key processes, such as Carbon dynamics and snowpack evolution. Since such models are usually applied within coupled numerical weather prediction or spatially distributed hydrological models, these improvements must strike a balance between computational cost and complexity. The consequences of simplified or composite canopy approaches can be manifested in terms of increased errors with respect to soil temperatures, estimates of the diurnal cycle of the turbulent fluxes or snow canopy interception and melt.\nVegetated areas and particularly forests are modeled in a quite simplified manner in the ISBA land surface model. However, continuous developments of surface processes now require a more accurate description of the canopy. A new version of the the model now includes a multi energy balance (MEB) option to explicitly represent the canopy and the forest floor. It will be shown that certain newly included processes such as the shading effect of the vegetation, the explicit heat capacity of the canopy, and the insulating effect of the forest floor turn out to be essential.\nA detailed study has been done for four French forested sites. It was found that the MEB option significantly improves the ground heat flux (RMSE decrease from 50W/m2 to 10W/m2 on average) and soil temperatures when compared against measurements. Also the sensible heat flux calculation was improved primarily owing to a better phasing with the solar insulation owing to a lower vegetation heat capacity. However, the total latent heat flux is less modified compared to the classical ISBA simulation since it is more related to water uptake and the formulation of the stomatal resistance (which are unchanged). Next, a benchmark over 40 Fluxnet sites (116 cumulated years) was performed and compared with results from the default composite soil-vegetation version of ISBA. The results show consistency with the local study (100 years have better correlation with sensible heat flux and 74 a better RMSE ) and demonstrate the ability of the MEB option to model fluxes over a large range of forest types and climates.",

            "abstract": "This study examines autoconversion schemes in warm rain, which are commonly used in general circulation models. The model used in this study is an aerosol climate model, MIROC-SPRINTARS, which is employed for sensitivity experiments in a single-model framework to preclude biases from different treatments of the aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction. The results show that both micro- and macrophysical parameters (e.g., cloud effective radius, and liquid water path (LWP)) are highly sensitive to the schemes. The ratio of accretion to autoconversion (Acc/Aut ratio), also shows a high sensitivity depending on the schemes. The Acc/Aut ratio monotonically increases with increasing LWP, however, Kessler-type schemes with autoconversion threshold tend to predict the ratio significantly lower than model-based schemes without autoconversion threshold. The potential uncertainty in the warm rain process is still large, but a significant improvement of cloud radiative effect cannot be expected by changing just the auto-conversion scheme. This means that more fundamental errors are still left in other processes of the model. We currently plan to apply the prognostic precipitation including drizzle in the MIROC-SPRINTARS to overcome this issue.\nThis study was supported by Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Research Fellows (15J05544), for Scientific Research (15K12190), and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-12-3) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.",

A warm period in the Late Pliocene (3.264 to 3.025 million years before present) can serve as a potential analogue for projected future climates. Although Pliocene ice locations and extents are still poorly constrained, a significant contribution to sea-level rise should be expected from both the Greenland ice sheet and the West and East Antarctic ice sheets based on palaeo sea-level reconstructions and geological evidence\nFollowing a five year international project PLISMIP (Pliocene Ice Sheet Modeling Intercomparison Project) we present the final set of results which quantify uncertainty in climate model-based predictions of the Antarctic ice sheet. In this study we use an ensemble of climate model forcings within a multi-ice sheet model framework to assess the climate (model) dependency of large scale features of the Antarctic ice sheet. Seven coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models are used to derive surface temperature, precipitation and oceanic forcing that drive three ice sheet models (over the grounded and floating domain).\nSimilar to results presented over Greenland, we show that the reconstruction of the Antarctic ice sheet is sensitive to which climate model is used to provide the forcing field. Key areas of uncertainty include West Antarctica, the large subglacial basins of East Antarctica and the overall thickness of the continental interior of East Antarctica. We relate the results back to geological proxy data, such as those relating to exposure rates which provide information on potential ice sheet thickness. Finally we discuss as to whether the choice of modelling framework (i.e. climate model and ice sheet model used) or the choice of boundary conditions causes the greatest uncertainty in ice sheet reconstructions of the warm Pliocene.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial fill terraces record changes in past sediment to water discharge ratios. Across the world, fill terrace formation in glaciated catchments has been linked to variable sediment production and river discharge over glacial–interglacial cycles. However, pronounced fill terraces far from major glaciers and ice sheets have the potential to record a different set of climate forcings.\nSo far, little is known about how changes in global climate on multi-millenial timescales affected the rainfall patterns in the interior of South America, or how those changes might be reflected in the landscape. Nonetheless, several studies in the Central Andes have linked terrace formation to precessionally-controlled changes in precipitation. In this study, we investigate the timing of fluvial fill terrace planation and abandonment in the Quebrada del Toro, an intermontane basin located in the Eastern Cordillera of the southern-central Andes in NW Argentina. Fluvial fills in the valley reach more than 100 m above the current river level. Within the fills, we observe a minimum of 5 terrace levels with pronounced differences in their extent and preservation. These fills document successive episodes of incision, punctuated by periods of lateral planation and possible partial re-filling. The filling and re-incision has previously been associated with tectonic activity in the basin, but the potential superposed role of climate cycles in forming terraces has not been considered.\nWe sampled four CRN (10Be) depth profiles to date the abandonment of the broadest terrace surfaces, least affected by later overwash and erosion. The ages fall within the late Pleistocene (~ 80 ka to 400 ka). While the presence of inflationary soils beneath desert pavements make precise age determinations difficult, our preliminary calculations suggest a potential link to orbital eccentricity (~100 kyr) cycles, pointing to a different timescale of landscape response to climate forcing compared to previous studies.",

We have established a greenhouse gas monitoring station in northern Rwanda that will be part of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE), a global network of high frequency long-term remote atmospheric measurement stations. Using a Picarro G2401 cavity ring-down analyzer, continuous measurements of CO2, CH4, and CO at a frequency of five seconds are being captured at this equatorial East African site. The measurement site is located near the Virunga mountains, a volcanic range in North-West Rwanda, on the summit of Mt. Mugogo (2507 m above sea level). Mt. Mugogo is located in a rural area 70km away from Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, and about 13km from the nearest town. From HYSPLIT 7-day back-trajectory calculations, we have determined that the station measures air masses originating from East and Central Africa, the Indian Ocean and occasionally from Southern Asia. Depending on the wind direction and local boundary layer height, measurements taken at Mt Mugogo are occasionally influenced by local sources, including emissions from the nearby city and wood fires from small rural settlements around the station.

            "abstract": "The chert-hosted manganese deposits have been known to occur in the Triassic to Jurassic chert or chert-greenstone complex within a Jurassic accretionary complex in Japan. In order to reveal the origin of these manganese deposits, we investigated the stratigraphy, age and geochemistry of manganese deposits from the Triassic to Jurassic bedded chert succession of the Chichibu Belt, defined as a Jurassic subduction-generated accretionary complex in Southwest Japan. The Triassic to Jurassic bedded cherts in the Chichibu Belt are considered to be deep-sea sediments that accumulated in an open-ocean realm of the Panthalassa Ocean. Our biostratigraphic analysis of radiolarians reveals that the stratiform manganese deposits intercalated in the bedded cherts were deposited in the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic. Upper Triassic manganese deposit occurs associated with the massive cherts which appear to have been formed by hydrothermal activity. The red bedded chert above the manganese deposit yields radiolarian fossils, including Trialatus longicornutus and Poulpus carcharus. These radiolarians indicate that age of manganese deposits can be correlated with the late Carnian age. Lower Jurassic manganese deposit occurs intercalated within the gray to dark gray bedded cherts. Detailed biostratigraphic analysis of radiolarians reveals that manganese deposit is embedded in the upper Pliensbachian to Toarcian (Trillus elkhornensis Zone). Chemical compositions of Upper Triassic deposits are characterized by enrichments in Mn and depletion of Co, Ni and Zn. These geochemical features are similar to those of modern submarine hydrothermal manganese deposits from hydrothermal activity. In contrast, lower Jurassic manganese deposits were triggered by an influx of warm, saline and oxic water into a stagnant deep ocean floor basin. It is likely that the deposits are considered to have formed by oceanic anoxic event.",

            "abstract": "The Swiss Atlas of PHYsical properties of Rocks (SAPHYR) is a multi-year project, aiming to compile a comprehensive data set on physical properties of rocks exposed in Switzerland and surrounding areas. The ultimate goal of SAPHYR is to make these data accessible to an open and wide public, such as industrial, engineering, land and resource planning companies, as well as academic institutions.\nSince the early sixties worldwide geophysicists, petrologists, and engineers, focused their work on laboratory measurements of rocks physical properties, and their relations with microstructures, mineralogical compositions and other rock parameters, in the effort to constrain the geological interpretation of geophysical surveys. In combination with efforts to investigate deep structure of the continental crust by controlled source seismology, laboratories capable to reproduce pressure and temperature conditions to depth of 50km and more collected measurements of various parameters on a wide variety of rock types. In recent years, the increasing interest on non-traditional energy supply, (deep geothermal energy, shale gas) and CO2 storage renovated the interests in physical characterization of the deep underground.\nThe idea to organize those laboratory data into a geographically referenced database (GIS) is supported by the Swiss Commission for Geophysics. The data refer to density and porosity, seismic, magnetic, thermal properties, permeability and electrical properties. An effort has been placed on collecting samples and measuring the physical properties of lithologies that are poorly documented in literature. The phase of laboratory measurements is still in progress. At present SAPHYR focuses towards developing a 3-D physical properties model of the Swiss subsurface, using the structure of the exposed geology, boreholes data and seismic surveys, combined with lab determined pressure and temperature derivatives. An early version of the final product is presented here.",

Due to the lack of detailed information and the inherent spatial heterogeneity, geological properties can be treated as random variables. Hydrogeological property is assumed to be a multivariate distribution with spatial correlations. By sampling random numbers from a given statistical distribution and assigning a value to each grid, a random field for modeling can be completed. Therefore, statistics sampling plays an important role in the efficiency of modeling procedure. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is a stratified random sampling procedure that provides an efficient way to sample variables from their multivariate distributions. This study combines the the stratified random procedure from LHS and the simulation by using LU decomposition to form LULHS. Both conditional and unconditional simulations of LULHS were develpoed. The simulation efficiency and spatial correlation of LULHS are compared to the other three different simulation methods. The results show that for the conditional simulation and unconditional simulation, LULHS method is more efficient in terms of computational effort. Less realizations are required to achieve the required statistical accuracy and spatial correlation.",

A regression model is established so that the combination of weight of GCMs reflects the characteristics of the variation of observations at each grid point. Cross validation is conducted to select GCMs and to evaluate the regression model. Large warm biases of the surface air temperature of GCMs from CMIP3 and CMIP5 are successfully corrected by this method. The biases are much smaller than those of dynamically downscaled temperature in the present climate. When it is compared to one of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) based bias correction, it shows a comparable performance in estimating mean value of the present climate. Furthermore, this method generates probabilistic information in the future projection, such as exceedance probability of the temperature increase and several percentile values. Regarding the monthly mean of the surface air temperature, the dependency of future changes in the mean value and the standard deviation on the emission scenario are investigated. This probabilistic climate projection based on the statistical method can be expected to bring important information on the impact study and risk assessment.",

            "abstract": "Power can be performed by a system driven by a potential difference. From a given potential difference, the power that can be subtracted is constraint by the Carnot limit, which follows from the first and second laws of thermodynamics. If the system is such that the flux producing power (with power being the flux times its driving potential difference) also influences the potential difference, a maximum in power can be obtained as a result of the trade-off between the flux and the potential difference. This is referred to as the maximum power principle.\nIt has already been shown that the atmosphere operates close to this maximum power limit when it comes to heat transport from the Equator to the poles, or vertically, from the surface to the atmospheric boundary layer. To reach this state of maximum power, the effective thermal conductivity of the atmosphere is adapted by the creation of convection cells.\nThe aim of this study is to test if the soil’s effective hydraulic conductivity also adapts in such a way that it produces maximum power. However, the soil’s hydraulic conductivity adapts differently; for example by the creation of preferential flow paths. Here, this process is simulated in a lab experiment, which focuses on preferential flow paths created by piping.\nIn the lab, we created a hydrological analogue to the atmospheric model dealing with heat transport between Equator and poles, with the aim to test if the effective hydraulic conductivity of the sand bed can be predicted with the maximum power principle. The experimental setup consists of two freely draining reservoir connected with each other by a confined aquifer. By adding water to only one reservoir, a potential difference will build up until a steady state is reached. The results will indicate whether the maximum power principle does apply for groundwater flow and how it should be applied. Because of the different way of adaptation of flow conductivity, the results differ from that of the atmosphere.",

We apply this model to examine the potential trade-offs and synergies in the supply of CO2 sequestration and water flow services in mature Mediterranean forest, considering two alternative forest management settings. A forest restoration scenario through investments in facilitating forest regeneration, and a forestry activity abandonment scenario as result of unprofitable forest regeneration investment. The analysis is performed for different discount rates and price settings for carbon and water.\nThe model is applied at the farm level in a group of 567 private silvopastoral farms across Andalusia (Spain), considering the main forest species in this region: Quercus ilex, Q. suber, Pinus pinea, P. halepensis, P. pinaster and Eucalyptus sp., as well as for tree-less shrubland and pastures. The results of this research are provided by forest land unit, vegetation, farm and for the group of municipalities where the farms are located.\nOur results draw attention to the spatial variability of CO2 and water flow regulation services, and point towards a trade-off between those services. The pattern of economic benefits associated to water and carbon services fluctuates according to the assumptions regarding price levels and discounting rates, as well as in connection to the expected forest management and tree growth models, and to spatially-explicit forest attributes such as existing tree and shrubs inventories, the quality of the sites for growing different tree species, soil structure or the climatic characteristics. The assumptions made regarding the inter-temporal preferences and relative prices have a large effect on the estimated economic value of carbon and water services. These results highlight the uncertainties over the provision of forest ecosistem services under changing economic conditions and social preferences.",

            "abstract": "Salt dynamics in estuarine tidal marshes are strongly associated with their intrinsic hydrological processes and ecological behaviors, which are not well understood. Numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the transport and distribution of pore water and salt in a vertical cross section perpendicular to the tidal creek that subjects to spring-neap tide and evaporation. Vaporizing pore water from unsaturated soil surface with salt left in soils, the time-variant actual evaporation is affected by aerodynamic factors as well as soil conditions, including pore-water saturation, solute concentration and the thickness of salt precipitation above the soil surface (efflorescence). Different simulation cases were performed by adjusting the tidal signal, marsh platform slope and soil properties. The simulation analysis indicates that, the tide-averaged soil salinity increases with the reduction of inundation period in a spring-neap tide cycle. As the salt accumulated by evaporation could leave soil from seepage back to seawater during ebbtide, the pore-water salinity at the surface within the tidal range remains close to that of seawater. With the presence of hyper-saline soil and efflorescence, salt flat develops only in the area where capillary connection between evaporating surface and water-saturated soil is maintained while tidal inundation absent. On the contrary, the sandy supratidal marsh where hydrological connections are disrupted keeps a relatively low soil salinity (40-60 ppt) and pore-water saturation as evaporation remains low throughout the tidal cycles.",

The data set taken over East Asia was analyzed to estimate linear trends on national and grid bases for two periods of 2005-2011 and 2011-2014. The most striking features are leveling-off or decreasing trends seen in NO2 VCDs over China for 2011-2014 after continuous increases for 2005-2011. In particular, a significant reduction by ~14% occurred from 2013 through 2014, attaining to the level of 2009. The grid-basis trend analysis implies that the turnaround seen in the trends occurred on a province or larger spatial scale and was likely due mainly to the technical improvement such as the widespread use of de-NOx units. Another prominent features are seen in Japan, where NO2 VCDs decreased at a rate of ~4% per year from 2005 to 2011. The rate was almost unchanged between the two periods 2005-2011 and 2011-2014, while the significant power substitution of thermal power generation for the nuclear power generation took place in Japan after 2011, when a massive earthquake occurred off the Pacific coast of northern Japan.

To model capillarity in granular porous media, one needs to go beyond current models which simulate either two-phase flow in porous media or mechanical behaviour in granular media. Current pore-scale models for two-phase flow such as pore-network models are tailored for rigid pore-skeletons, even though in many applications, namely hydro-mechanical coupling in soils, printing, and hygienic products, the porous structure does change during two-phase flow. On the other hand, models such as Discrete Element Method (DEM), which simulate the deformable porous media, have mostly been employed for dry or saturated granular media.\nHere, the effects of porosity change and swelling on the retention properties was studied, for swelling granular materials. A pore-unit model that was capable to construct the capillary pressure – saturation curve was coupled to DEM. Such that the capillary pressure – saturation curve could be constructed for varying porosities and amounts of absorbed water. The study material was super absorbent polymer particles, which are capable to absorb water 10’s to 200 times their initial weight. We have simulated quasi-static primary imbibition for different porosities and amounts of absorbed water. The results reveal a 3 dimensional surface between capillary pressure, saturation, and porosity, which can be normalized by means of the entry pressure and the effective water saturation to a unique curve.",

REEs are more common in the Earth’s crust than precious metals like gold or platinum, but are not commonly concentrated in economically viable ore deposits. For over a decade, China has been the world’s leading supplier of REEs. Recent export restrictions from China have necessitated the search for new deposits. Determining basic material properties such as phase equilibria and the equation of state for bastnaesite helps in understanding the processes that form REE ore deposits and thereby assist in locating new deposits.\nFor this study we focus on the lanthanum-fluoride variant of bastnaesite (LaCO3F) since it can be easily synthesized in the laboratory. Previous work by others determined that in both open and closed systems at atmospheric pressure bastnaesite decomposes to lanthanum oxyfluoride and carbon dioxide (LaOF + CO2) above 325°C; at 100 MPa bastnaesite decomposes above 860°C (Hsu, 1992).\nUsing a Griggs-type modified piston cylinder apparatus, we pressurized samples of synthetic bastnaesite-(La) to conditions ranging from 250 MPa to 1.2 GPa, and then subjected each sample to constant temperatures ranging from 700°C to 1050°C for a minimum of five hours. We then analyzed the samples with X-ray powder diffraction to identify phases present and determined that bastnaesite-(La) is stable at 250 MPa up to approximately 800°C and at 1.0 GPa up to approximately 900°C. Reversal experiments are underway.\nIn order to develop an equation of state for bastnaesite-(La), we studied single crystals via monochromatic synchrotron X-ray diffraction in the diamond anvil cell at HPCAT (Sector 16), Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. Measurements were made at pressures ranging from ambient to nearly 4 GPa. From these diffraction patterns, we determine the structure of bastnaesite-(La), and the change in unit cell volume as a function of pressure can be fit to a Birch-Murnaghan equation of state with V0 = 507.25 Å3 and K0 = 115.57.",

            "abstract": "Future projections of the frequencies and amplitudes of the Eastern-Pacific (EP) and Central-Pacific (CP) types of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as well as their associated tropical precipitation variability, have been studied based on historical runs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) and model simulations for the 21st century corresponding to the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5. EP- and CP-El Niño events, as well as their related tropical circulation anomalies, were identified based on empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). Results from the historical runs indicate that while the majority of CMIP5 models are able to capture the EP-ENSO SST anomalies pattern, only a handful of models can reproduce that associated with CP-ENSO. Based on their performance in capturing the tropical Pacific SST variability, the best models for simulating the 2 types of ENSO were selected, and their projections for the 21st century climate state were further examined. There is evidence that SST anomalies associated with EP-ENSO will become weaker in the future climate; on the other hand, there seems to be no significant change in the CP-ENSO-related SST. There also exists no consensus on how the relative frequency of CP to EP El Niño may change in the future. However, the rainfall response to EP-El Niño (CP-El Niño) was found to be enhanced over the central-to-eastern (central-to-western) equatorial Pacific, consistent with the fact that the mean hydrological cycle will become stronger under a warmer background climate. Walker circulation anomalies associated with the two types of El Niño are also modified. The relationship between these circulation changes related to ENSO and those in the basic state due to a warmer climate will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Since its first demonstration in 1991, Atomic Interferometry (AI) has shown to be an extremely performing probe of inertial forces. More recently, AI has revealed sensitivities to acceleration or rotation competing with or even beating state-of-the art sensors based on other technologies. The high stability and accuracy of AI sensors relying on cold atoms is at the basis of several applications ranging from fundamental physics (e.g. tests of general relativity and measurements of fundamental constants), geophysics (gravimetry, gradiometry) and inertial navigation.\nWe are currently building a large scale matter-wave detector which will open new applications in geoscience and fundamental physics. In contrast to standard AI based sensors, our matter-wave laser interferometer gravitation antenna (MIGA) exploits the superb seismic environment of a low noise underground laboratory. This new infrastructure is embedded into the LSBB underground laboratory, in France, ideally located away from major anthropogenic disturbances and benefitting from very low background noise. MIGA combines atom and laser interferometry techniques, manipulating an array of atomic ensembles distributed along the antenna to simultanously read out seismic effects, inertial effects and eventually the passage of a gravity wave. The first version uses a set of three atomic sensors placed along an optical cavity. The spatial resolution obtained with this configuration will enable the separation of the seismic, inertial and GW contributions. This technique will bring unprecedented sensitivities to gravity gradients variations and open new perspectives for sub Hertz gravity wave and geodesic detection. MIGA will provide measurements of gravity gradients variations limited only by the AI shot noise, which will allow sensitivities of about 10−13 s−2Hz−1/2@ 2Hz. This instrument will then be capable to spatially resolve 1 m3 of water a distances of about 100 m, which opens important potential applications in geosciences.\nIn this paper we will first present the design of the antenna and its installation at Rustrel. We will also present details about the measurement strategy and the sensitivity inertial signals.\nMIGA is an Equipement d'Excellence of the french gouvernement. The MIGA consortium is formed by 18 partners.",

Historic records during the last 2000 years in the area indicate the earthquake with magnitude 6.7 caused damages of human life and property in 779. During the period of modern instrumental seismic records, the area also experienced numerous small- and moderate-magnitude earthquakes. For example, an earthquake with magnitude 4.3 occurring in 1997 provided a chance for nationwide evaluations of earthquake safety and the renewal of earthquake monitoring system in Korea. The area is still experiencing small earthquakes including magnitude 3.5 in September 2014. We applied waveform correlation detector to continuously recorded seismic data from July 2014 to December 2014 to identify any repeating earthquakes. Detected waveforms are carefully inspected and more than 230 potential events are identified. Eighty three earthquakes among them have been selected for precise determination of earthquake hypocenters. Focal mechanism solutions for representative events were also determined. We further compared the results with those obtained using earthquakes prior to 2013. It has been confirmed the earthquakes in the area are clustered in space. Similar waveforms, earthquake locations, and focal mechanism solutions identified in the study indicates an active faults in the area. Since the area hosts many critical infra-structures, micro-seismicity in the area requires extensive study to address earthquake hazard issues.",

            "abstract": "With growing considerations for sustainable forest management, examining thinning effects on forest ecosystems becomes one of the principal research focuses. Soil microbial biomass and inorganic nitrogen (N) have, particularly, received increasing attentions, as they are the relevant indices for N availability in forests. Here, we investigated the influences of thinning on soil microbial biomass N (MBN) and inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) in two Pinus densiflora forests, central Korea. The thinning from below with different intensities based on stand density (site 1: control, 20%, and 30% thinning; site 2: control, 39%, and 74% thinning) was applied in 2008, and MBN, NH4+, and NO3- at 0–10 cm depth were measured seven years after thinning. The MBN, NH4+, and NO3- concentrations (mg kg-1) of the site 1 were 69.8, 9.8, and 6.3 in the control, 94.6, 9.3, and 4.0 in the 20% thinning plot, and 97.2, 8.4, and 5.2 in the 30% thinning plot, respectively. On the other hand, those of the site 2 were 34.5, 5.4, and 6.3 in the control, 37.3, 4.7, and 7.8 in the 39% thinning plot, and 44.4, 4.4, and 9.2 in the 74% thinning plot, respectively. The MBN of the thinning plots tended to be higher compared to those of the controls, although the analysis of variance reported the significant difference only for the MBN in the site 1 (P<0.05). This might be attributed to the incorporation of organic matter from the introduced thinning residues and from the increased understory vegetation following thinning. However, no significant difference was found for the NH4+ and NO3- (P>0.05). The results of the present study show that the application of thinning could differently affect MBN and inorganic N; accordingly, this difference might alter N availability of the study sites.\nThis study was supported by Forest Practice Research Center, Korea Forest Research Institute.",

            "abstract": "Retrieval of aerosol properties for satellite instruments without shortwave-IR spectral information, multi-viewing, polarization and/or high-temporal observation ability is a challenging problem for spaceborne aerosol remote sensing. However, space based instruments like the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the successor, Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) with high calibration accuracy and high spatial resolution provide unique abilities for obtaining valuable aerosol information for a better understanding of the impact of aerosols on climate, which is still one of the largest uncertainties of global climate change evaluation.\nIn this study, a new Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) retrieval algorithm (XBAER: eXtensible Bremen AErosol Retrieval) is presented. XBAER utilizes the global surface spectral library database for the determination of surface properties while the MODIS collection 6 aerosol type treatment is adapted for the aerosol type selection. In order to take the surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) effect into account for the MERIS reduce resolution (1km) retrieval, a modified Ross-Li mode is used. The AOT is determined in the algorithm using lookup tables including polarization created using Radiative Transfer Model SCIATRAN3.4, by minimizing the difference between atmospheric corrected surface reflectance with given AOT and the surface reflectance calculated from the spectral library. The global comparison with operational MODIS C6 product, Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) product, Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) aerosol product and the validation using AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) show promising results. The current XBAER algorithm is only valid for aerosol remote sensing over land and a similar method will be extended to ocean later.",

            "abstract": "Time-lapse gravimetry is known to be a powerful tool to monitor mass redistributions near the Earth’s surface and hence is of interest in various fields (volcanology, hydrology, glaciology, geothermics, C02 sequestration). Hybrid gravimetry relies on the combined use of different types of instruments measuring the earth’s gravity changes i.e. relative spring gravimeters (RG) and superconducting gravimeters (SG), as well as ballistic absolute gravimeters (AG) in a specific study.\nWe show here that hybrid gravimetry is able to provide new constraints on underground water storage changes. We will focus on two special cases in West Africa which were investigated in the frame of the GHYRAF (Gravity and Hydrology in Africa) project: one is located in the semi-arid Sahelian zone in Wankama (Niger) and another one in Djougou (Benin) in the humid, hard-rock basement zone.\nIn Wankama, both time-lapse AG and RG are available. In an innovative field survey during 3 months of the rainy season in 2009, we merged relative microgravimetry on a network of 12 stations, magnetic resonance soundings, and hydrological measurements to evaluate both surface and subsurface water storage variations. We show that most of the gravity variations originate from heterogeneities in the vadose zone highlighting the potential of time lapse microgravity surveys for detecting intraseasonal water storage variations in the critical zone.\nIn Djougou, we will present the hydrology results coming from the use of the hybrid gravimetry approach based on a continuous record of a GWR SG installed since 2010 complemented with FG5 AG episodic measurements (4 times a year between 2008 and 2011 then yearly). In addition we also set up repeated micro-gravimetric measurements with a Scintrex CG5 RG on a dense network (more than 100 surveys and 15 stations) around the base station. The continuous SG record allows to bring additional insight on the space and time variable gravity (and hence water storage changes) in the investigated zone which is retrieved by EOF (Empirical orthogonal function) decomposition of the gravity field as well as the hydrology measurements (neutron probes, piezometers).\nWe show the link existing between our local surface gravity measurements and the larger scale integrated observations from GRACE satellite gravimetry in West Africa.",

Samples were directly transported to the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University and have been analyzed for monoterpene- and isoprene-SOA tracers using gas chromatograph (GC; HP 6890) and mass spectrometry system (GC/MS; Agilent). Ice core collected from mountain glacier has not been explored for SOA yet. We found significantly high concentrations of these tracers (e.g., pinic, pinonic, and 2-methylglyceric acids, 2-methylthreitol and 2-methylrythritol), which show historical trends with good correlation with each other since 1665-2008. They show positive correlations with sugar compounds (e.g., mannitol, glucose, fructose, inositol, and sucrose), and anti-correlations with diacids (e.g., C9), w-oxocarboxylic (wC4-wC9), a-dicarbonyls and low molecular weight fatty acids (LFAs) (e.g., C18:1). LFAs show strong correlations with MSA- and nss-SO42- in the same ice core. These results suggest source regions of SOA tracers and ice core chemistry of Alaska.\nConcentrations of C5-alkene triols (e.g., 3-methyl-2,3,4-trihydroxy-1-butene, cis-2-methyl 1,3,4-trihydroxy-1-butene and trans-2-methyl-1,3,4-trihydroxy-1-butene) have increased in the ice core after the Great Pacific Climate Shift (late 1970’s). They show positive correlations with a-dicarbonyls and LFAs (e.g., C18:1) in the ice core, suggesting that enhanced oceanic emissions of biogenic organic compounds through the surface microlayer are recorded in the ice core. Photochemical oxidation processes for these monoterpene- and isoprene-/sesquiterpene-SOA tracers are suggested to be linked with the periodicity of multi-decadal climate oscillations (e.g., North Pacific Index) and we can look at a whole range of environmental parameters in parallel with the robust reconstructed temperature changes in the Northern Hemisphere.",

Aerosol number concentration, size distribution and chemical composition are also analyzed to derive further key variables such as the hygroscopicity parameter kappa and the activation diameters at several supersaturations (SS). The sites cover a large area allowing for temporal and spatial characterization of CCN variability in different atmospheric regimes such as marine, continental, boreal, Arctic and Mediterranean environments, boundary layer and free tropospheric conditions. Additionally, autocorrelation analysis is performed to investigate the persistence of variables over different timescales and to explore meaningful averaging periods for global modelling of CCN.\nThe aerosol populations and their activation behavior show significant differences at the stations. While peak concentrations of CCN are observed in summer at the high altitude sites, in the Arctic the highest concentrations occur during the Haze period in spring. The rural-marine and rural-continental sites exhibit similar CCN concentration characteristics with a relatively flat annual cycle. At some stations, e.g. in the boreal environment, the annual cycle is more pronounced for higher SS. Geometric mean diameters of aerosol populations as well as the activation ratios on the basis of particles > 50 nm vary strongly among sites and throughout the seasons.\nIn terms of CCN persistence, there are three different regimes: At some sites the autocorrelation drops within a week and shows little seasonal pattern, while at others it remains relatively high for 7 or more days exhibiting also seasonal patterns, and in the third group it has a high correlation for two days and then drops rapidly. Several but not all sites show diurnal cycles.",

            "abstract": "Mediterranean, as one of the global climate change “hot spots”, was faced with severe drought over the recent decades. Investigation of regional paleo-hydroclimate evolution helps improve climate projection and adaption strategy. Here, we present a new decadal-resolved record documenting hydroclimate in the central Mediterranean from an Italian stalagmite since 6500 years ago. Eighty high-precision absolute U-Th dates with 2-sigma uncertainty better than ±20 years and 560 oxygen isotopic ratio data show several abrupt drying events with an average of 600 mm precipitation decrease in less than 80 years since the mid-Holocene. North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) could dominantly govern the centennial–scale hydroclimate variability, especially for a period of 4500 to 2000 years ago. Total solar irradiance (TSI) also partially affected this regional precipitation. The obscure relationship between stalagmite and global/local mean surface temperature sequences, in contradict to previous studies, implies complex internal feedback of global warming and atmospheric circulation in the Mediterranean. Our result suggests that the twenty-first century Mediterranean drying trend is significant but not unprecedented in the past six thousand years.",

            "abstract": "Disasters stimulate research activity by creating comparatively rare post-disaster data, while also increasing the urgency of agency demand for scientific evidence. In the wake of the 2011 Christchurch Earthquake disaster, New Zealand, post-disaster research activity was coordinated by a national Natural Hazards Research Platform, in collaboration with response agencies. The focus was on research support for responding agencies, with an emphasis on creating high quality scientific outcomes. This coordinated research effort did not include independent research activity, which escalated steeply in the weeks after the event. The risks this increased research pressure posed to response operations and impacted populations informed the declaration of a moratorium on research not deemed relevant to the needs of response agencies. This presentation summarizes communication issues that made it difficult to disseminate the moratorium, and to establish the relevance of this decision where it might have been most effective in diminishing these risks: within national and international natural hazard and disaster research communities, other national research communities, across responding agencies and organisations, and among impacted organizations and communities.",

            "abstract": "Over the last 5 years we have created a community collaboratory Vhub.org [Palma et al, J. App. Volc. 3:2 doi:10.1186/2191-5040-3-2] as a place to find volcanology-related resources, and a venue for users to disseminate tools, teaching resources, data, and an online platform to support collaborative efforts. As the community (current active users > 6000 from an estimated community of comparable size) embeds the tools in the collaboratory into educational and research workflows it became imperative to:\na) redesign tools into robust, open source reusable software for online and offline usage/enhancement;\nb) share large datasets with remote collaborators and other users seamlessly with security;\nc) support complex workflows for uncertainty analysis, validation and verification and data assimilation with large data.\nThe focus on tool development/redevelopment has been twofold – firstly to use best practices in software engineering and new hardware like multi-core and graphic processing units. Secondly we wish to enhance capabilities to support inverse modeling, uncertainty quantification using large ensembles and design of experiments, calibration, validation. Among software engineering practices we practice are open source facilitating community contributions, modularity and reusability. Our initial targets are four popular tools on Vhub – TITAN2D, TEPHRA2, PUFF and LAVA. Use of tools like these requires many observation driven data sets e.g. digital elevation models of topography, satellite imagery, field observations on deposits etc. These data are often maintained in private repositories that are privately shared by “sneaker-net”. As a partial solution to this we tested mechanisms using irods software for online sharing of private data with public metadata and access limits. Finally, we adapted use of workflow engines (e.g. Pegasus) to support the complex data and computing workflows needed for usage like uncertainty quantification for hazard analysis using physical models.",

In this study, we aimed to determine the quantitative relationship between sterols and biomass in three species of marine diatoms under different temperature (15℃, 20℃ and25℃) and different nutrient supply (N:P=10:1, 24:1 and 63:1). Brassicasterol is the major sterol in Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohli, an important species in marginal seas. The effects of temperature on the cellular concentration of brassicasterol is minimum, with values of 1.01×10 -4 ng cell-1 at 15℃, 1.07×10 -4 ng cell-1 at 20℃ and 1.17×10 -4 ng cell-1 at 25℃. Work is underway to evaluate the effects of nutrients on the cellular concentration of brassicasterol. Our preliminary results suggest that brassicasterol could be used to quantitatively reconstruct diatom productivity, and we will report the results of its application in several sediment cores.",

            "abstract": "The incoming surface solar radiation has been defined as an essential climate variable by GCOS. It is mandatory to monitor this part of the earth’s energy balance, and thus gain insights on the state and variability of the climate system. In addition, data sets of surface solar radiation have received increased attention over the recent years as an important source of information for solar energy applications.\nThe EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) is deriving surface solar radiation from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite instruments. While CM SAF is focusing on high-quality long-term climate data records, operational data is also provided with a short time latency within about 2 weeks.\nHere we present the SARAH data set (Solar Surface Radiation Dataset – Heliosat) based on Meteosat satellite observations. SARAH provides hourly, daily- and monthly-averaged data of the effective cloud albedo (CAL), the direct normalized solar radiation (DNI) and the solar irradiance (SIS) from 1983 to 2013 for the full view of the Meteosat satellite (i.e, Europe, Africa, parts of South America, and the Atlantic ocean). The data sets are generated with a high spatial resolution of 0.05 deg allowing for detailed regional studies, and are available in netcdf-format at no cost without restrictions at www.cmsaf.eu.\nThe mean absolute bias (i.e., the accuracy) of the SARAH data set as compared to surface reference observations has been determined to be 5.5 W/m2 for SIS and 8.2 W/m2 for DNI, i.e., within the accuracy of the ground-based measurements. The interannual and decadal variability of the SARAH SIS data are comparable to surface observations in Europe, although with a tendency to underestimate the mean increase in surface solar radiation (1.65 W/m2/dec compared to 3.3 W/m2/dec). Substantial temporal and spatial variability in the overall increase in surface solar radiation is found in the SARAH data set.\nTemporal changes in the frequency of Großwetterlagen (GWL) can cause trends in surface solar radiation. A cluster analysis technique has been applied to identify 11 regions in Europe with similar day-to-day variability in solar radiation. This result can be used to assess the impact of changes in GWL frequency on regional trends in the surface solar radiation.",

            "abstract": "Recently, damages due to landslides have increased in Republic of Korea. Extreme weathers like typhoon, heavy rainfall related to climate change are the main factor of the damages. Especially, Inje-gun, Gangwon-do had severe landslide damages in 2006 and 2007. In Inje-gun, 91% areas are forest, therefore, many land covers related to human activities were adjacent to forest land. Thus, establishment of adaptation plans to landslides was urgently needed. Landslide risk assessment can serve as a good information to policy makers. The objective of this study was assessing landslide risk areas to support establishment of adaptation plans to reduce landslide damages. Statistical distribution models (SDMs) were used to evaluate probability of landslide occurrence. Various SDMs were used to make landslide probability maps considering uncertainty of SDMs. The types of land cover were classified into 5 grades considering vulnerable level to landslide. The landslide probability maps were overlaid with land cover map to calculate landslide risk. As a result of overlay analysis, landslide risk areas were derived. Especially agricultural areas and transportation areas showed high risk and large areas in the risk map. In conclusion, policy makers in Inje-gun must consider the landslide risk map to establish adaptation plans effectively.",

            "abstract": "Eight continental scale aerosol plumes exist each year as the enclosed image shows. Apparitions of seven plumes only exist for a few months in the same season each year whilst the East Asian Plume is visible all year. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) of all the plumes varies enormously interannually with two studies showing the surface radiative forcing of the South East Asian Plume (SEAP) as -150W/m2 and -286W/m2/AOD.\nI show that the SEAP, created by volcanic aerosols (natural) and biomass burning and gas flares in the oil industry (anthropogenic), is the sole cause of all El Nino events, the greatest interannual perturbation of the atmospheric circulation system. The SEAP creates an El Nino by absorbing solar radiation at the top of the plume which heats the upper atmosphere and cools the surface. This creates a temperature inversion compared to periods without the plume and reduces convection. With reduced convection in SE Asia, the Maritime Continent, the Trade Winds blowing across the Pacific are forced to relax as their exit into the Hadley and Walker Cells is constrained and the reduced Trade Wind speed causes the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) to rise in the central tropical Pacific Ocean as there is a strong negative correlation between wind speed and SST. The warmer SST in the central Pacific creates convection in the region which further reduces the Trade Wind speed and causes the Walker Cell to reverse – a classic El Nino.\nHaving established the ability of such extreme aerosol plumes to create El Nino events I will then show how the South American, West African, Middle East and SEAP plumes create drought in the Amazon, Spain, Darfur and Australia as well as causing the extremely warm autumn and winter in Europe in 2006-07.\nAll these effects are created by the plumes reducing convection in the region of the plume which forces the regional Hadley Cells into anomalous positions thereby creating persistent high pressure cells in the mid latitudes. This perturbs the mid latitude storm tracks and creates persistent high and low pressure regions around the World at those latitudes giving rise to extreme events by causing the regional winds to blow persistently from one direction.\nFinally I will suggest which plumes may be causing the high pressure ridge in the NE Pacific which is causing the severe drought in California.",

We derived 2009-2014 interseismic GPS velocity field and strain rate, implicate to seismic activity of 2005-2014. Data collected by 281 sites of Taiwan Continuous GPS (cGPS) Array and processed with GAMIT/GLOBK software. Stacking of power spectral densities from cGPS data in Taiwan, we found the errors type can be described as a combination of white noise and flicker noise. The common errors are removed by stacking 50 cGPS sites with data period larger than 5 years. By removing the common errors, the precision of GPS data has been further improved to 2.3 mm, 1.9 mm, and 6.9 mm in the E, N, U components, respectively.\nAfter strictly data quality control, time series analysis and noise analysis, we derive an interseismic ITRF2008 velocity field from 2009 to 2014 in the Taiwan area. The general pattern is quite similar with previous studies, but the station density is much larger and spatial coverage better. Based on this interseismic velocity field, we estimate the crustal strain rate in Taiwan area. Approximately half of plate convergence strain rate is accommodated on the fold and thrust belt of western Taiwan and another half is taken up in the Longitudinal Valley and the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan. The maximum dilatation rates is about -0.75～-0.9 μstrain/yr in WNW-ESE direction. The velocities in western Taiwan generally show a fan-shaped pattern, consistent with the direction of maximum compression tectonic stress. Extension in the E-W direction is observed at the Central Range area, the focal mechanism results also indicate the earthquake type here most are normal faults. In northern Taiwan, the velocity vectors reveal clockwise rotation, indicating the on-going extensional deformation related to the back-arc extension of the Okinawa Trough. In southern Taiwan, the horizontal velocity increases from about 40 mm/yr at Chianan to 55 mm/yr in the Kaoping area with a counterclockwise rotation. The 2005-2014 seismicity in Kaoping area presents very low activity but with very high strain rate and active crustal deformation. It could be aseismic slip which caused by the widespread soft sediments and mudstone resulting in plastic deformation in southwestern Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "Cities and the surrounding areas play an important role in altering and/or contributing to the natural processes of the Earth system. Specifically, cities affect the amount and partitioning of energy fluxes, as well as the carbon budget. It is recognized that increased greenhouse gases (GHG) concentration (mainly carbon dioxide) and air temperature values are typically experienced by cities, due to their structural and morphological characteristics and to human activities in urban areas (such as traffic, domestic heating/cooling, etc.). This will impact the urban climate.\nReducing the impact of urbanization on climate requires the knowledge of the interactions and links between human activities and the land-atmosphere system. Each city has different characteristics and conditions, so planning strategies helping in reducing carbon emissions should take into account local features. In this contest, monitoring activities are crucial to study the exchange of energy, water, and carbon over the city, evaluate their impact on human livability, and understand the role of the city on climate.\nA research activity is carried out in the Mediterranean city of Sassari, in the North of Sardinia island (Italy) to monitor urban fluxes and distinguish the main sources of GHG emissions, which could help the municipality to identify possible actions for reducing them.\nAn Eddy Covariance tower was set up in the city center to directly monitor energy and carbon exchanges at half-hourly time step. Even if the measurement period only consists of few months, the daily trend of urban fluxes clearly shows that traffic is one of the main carbon emission sources, while the contribution of vegetation in sequestering carbon is low due to the reduced amount of green areas in the measurements footprint (< 20%). In addition, differences between working days and holiday periods can be distinguished.",

            "abstract": "We present results from analysis of lake sediments and peat deposits from two basins on Nightingale Island (37°S), in the Tristan da Cunha archipelago, South Atlantic. The studies were focused on the time period 16.2-10.0 cal ka BP. A wide variety of proxies were used, including pollen and diatom analyzes, biogenic silica content, bulk C and N content, stable isotopes (13C and 15N), elemental concentrations and magnetic susceptibility measurements, to detect environmental changes that can be related to shifts of the circulation belts of the Southern Ocean. We find that the sediments are underlain by a >2 cal ka BP long hiatus, possibly representing a dried-out lake bed. Climate simulations corroborate that the area might have been exposed to arid conditions as a consequence of the Heinrich 1 event in the north and a southward displacement of the ITCZ. We interpret the results as being related to the position of the Subtropical Front (STF) and the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies (SHW). During 16.2-14.75 cal ka BP the SHW and STF were situated south of Tristan da Cunha. The data indicates moderate variability ending with a humidity peak and cooler conditions. The conditions during 14.7-14.1 cal ka BP were more stable with cool and arid conditions implying that the STF and SHW were both north of the islands during the first part of the Antarctic Cold Reversal. The period 14.1-12.7 cal ka BP indicates incessant latitudinal shifts of the zonal circulation, perhaps related the bipolar seesaw mechanisms. At 12.7 cal ka BP the Holocene warming began with a gradually drier and warmer climate as a result of a dampened AMOC during the Younger Dryas cooling in the north with ITCZ, STF and SHW being displaced southwards. Peak warming seems to have occurred in the earliest part of the Holocene, but this period was also characterized by humidity shifts, possibly an effect of retraction and expansion phases of SHW during AMOC variations in the north.",

The discharge simultaneously transports heat energy to the ocean. Under Arctic warming, the increased river discharge likely results in more heat flux to the Arctic Ocean. Interestingly, river discharge shows the peak in the spring season when Arctic sea ice begins to melt. At that time, the discharging heat flux may further contribute to sea ice retreat. A land surface model (CHANGE), coupled a river routing discharge model that combines river ice and water temperature models, simulated positive trends of pan-Arctic river discharge and water temperature, consequently enhanced heat flux to the Arctic Ocean. The increases were significant in Eurasian rivers and especially in the spring season. The model estimated cumulative heat flux to July was compared with the loss rate of sea ice concentration in Arctic coastal areas, revealing significantly higher correlation at Laptev and East Siberian seas where sea depth is shallower and the sea slope is not steep.

            "abstract": "Nam Co (Heavenly Lake) not only responds sensitively to climate change, but also provides significant influences on climate change. Lake effects impact lake processes that respond to and influence climate change. Lake effects from the North American Great Lakes have been shown to respond to and to provide important impacts on climate changes in their nearby regions. Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau occupy over 47,000 km2 and have recently shown rapid expansions. However, how the lakes’ behaviors impact climate changes on the Tibetan Plateau remain unknown. Analyses of the spatial distribution of precipitation in the Nam Co Basin during July-August and November-December show that lake effects impact the spatial distribution of precipitation in the Lake basin. The lake cooling effect during July-August and lake heating effect during November-December result in significant spatial differences of precipitation within the Nam Co Basin. These effects generally cause more precipitation in the south than in the north during July-August, and more precipitation in the east than in the west during November-December. Weaker monsoon and climate warming lead to an increased north-south precipitation difference in the Nam Co Basin. However, the precipitation differences between the west and east during November-December decreased with climate warming. The intensification of the westerlies is responsible for the particular phenomenon.",

            "abstract": "While climate events in the climatically important Indo-Pacific have been captured in Porites geochemical proxies, very few of these records extend more than 100 years, thus preventing reconstruction of multi-centennial climate variability. Century scale paleoclimate records may be stored in Diploastrea heliopora, a massive slow-growing long-lived coral prevalent in the region. Thus far, Diploastrea’s δ18O has revealed multi-decadal to multi-century long records in the region. However, since δ18O is a combined proxy for sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity, an independent SST proxy would be more advantageous. To evaluate the geochemistry of Diploastrea, adjacent Porites and Diploastrea cores were collected from Palaui Island, Philippines, and analyzed for Sr/Ca. An offset of about 0.20 mmol/mol is observed between the colonies, likely due to the greater Sr uptake of the slow-growing coral. Least-squares linear regressions of monthly Diploastrea and Porites Sr/Ca to SST reveal significant correlations (p-values < 0.0001). The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is one of the climatically important processes impacting SST in the region. Winter Sr/Ca for both corals significantly correlates with PDO (p-values = 0.02) indicating promise for Diploastrea as a climate archive, particularly in the absence of multi-century long records from Porites.",

Whole effluent toxicity tests are used to monitor toxicity by unknown toxic chemicals as well as conventional pollutants from industrial effluent discharges. This study describes the application of TIE (toxicity identification evaluation) procedures to an acutely toxic effluent from a wastewater treatment plant in industrial complex which was toxic to Daphnia magna. In TIE phase I (characterization step), the toxic effects by heavy metals, organic compounds, oxidants, volatile organic compounds, suspended solids and ammonia were screened and revealed that the source of toxicity is far from these toxicants group. Chemical analysis (TIE phase II) on TDS showed that the concentration of chloride ion (6,900 mg/L) was substantially higher than that predicted from EC50 for D. magna. In confirmation step (TIE phase III), chloride ion was demonstrated to be main toxicant in this effluent by the spiking approach, species sensitivity approach and deletion approach. Calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, fluorine, sulfate ion concentration (450, 100, 80, 5,300, 0.66, 2,200mg/L) was not shown toxicity from D. magna. Finally, we concluded that chloride was the most contributing toxicant in the waste water treatment plant.\nFurther research activities are needed for technical support of toxicity identification and evaluation on the various types of wastewater treatment plant discharge in Korea.\nKeywords : TIE, D. magna, Industrial waste water\n Acknowledgement\nThis research was supported by a grant (15IFIP-B089908-02) from Plant Research Program funded by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korean government",

            "abstract": "Seismic anisotropy in the Earth’s upper mantle is mainly due to preferred orientation of anisotropic minerals such as olivine, caused by plastic deformation due to shear stress and strain in the lithosphere and asthenosphere. Large-scale azimuthal anisotropy can be observed seismologically e.g., by using core-refracted shear waves (SKS, SKKS) for splitting measurements. They provide constrains on the strength and the orientation of S-wave anisotropy in the upper mantle beneath a recording station. However, the depth resolution is generally poor, and results are often interpreted under the assumption of a single anisotropic layer. In order so resolve multiple-layer anisotropic structures, measurements from different backazimuths are necessary. For many regions on Earth, well-recorded SKS- or SKKS-phase observations are not available at least for different backazimuths, due to missing earthquake recordings at the required distance range or due to a too low signal-to-noise ratio.\nWe propose a new method, which allows the simultaneous inversion of several SKS splitting measurements from different earthquakes of the same source region, measured at a single seismic station. The individual SKS waveforms are concatenated to form one new waveform, which is then inverted with the Silver & Chan method to determine the splitting parameters dt and phi. We apply our method to recordings at the stations of the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR). Our results demonstrate that this stacking method allows us a stable determination of splitting results even for regions with low-amplitude, or noisy signals.",

            "abstract": "Immiscible displacements in porous media involve a complex sequence of pore-scale events, from the smooth, reversible displacement of interfaces to abrupt interfacial reconfigurations and rapid pore invasion cascades. Discontinuous changes in pressure or saturation have been referred to as Haines jumps, and they emerge as a key mechanism to understand the origin of hysteresis in porous media flow. Hysteresis persists at the many-pore scale: when multiple cycles of drainage and imbibition of a porous sample are conducted, a dense hysteresis diagram emerges. The interpretation of hysteresis as a consequence of irreversible transitions and multistability is at the heart of early hysteresis models, and in recent experiments, and points to an inherently non-equilibrium behavior. For a given volume fraction of fluids occupying the pore space, many stable configurations are possible, due to the tortuous network of nonuniform pores and throats that compose the porous medium, and to complex wetting and capillary transitions. Multistability indicates that porous media systems exhibit rugged energy landscapes, where the system may remain pinned at local energy minima for long times.\nWe address the question of developing a zero-dimensional model that inherits the path-dependence and `'bursty'' behavior of immiscible displacements, and propose a discrete-domain model that captures the role of metastability and local equilibria in the origin of hysteresis. We describe the porous medium and fluid system as a discrete set of weakly connected, multistable compartments, charaterized by a unique free energy function. This description does not depend explicitly on past saturations, turning points, or drainage/imbibition labels. The system behaves hysteretically, and we rationalize its behavior as sweeping a complex metastability diagram, with dissipation arising from discrete switches among metastable branches. The hysteretic behavior of the pressure-saturation curve is controlled by the topography of the energy landscape, through the number of metastable regions of the compartments and characteristic height of the energy barriers separating the different basins. Our model opens the door to fully explore the interplay between hysteresis and fluctuations in multiphase displacements in porous media.",

In general, discharge information can be obtained from hydrologic stations. However, either uneven distribution or lack of hydrologic stations in mountain river basins leads to significant difficulties in obtaining discharge information. In this research, a disaggregation method based on the GRDC data has been used to estimate discharge based on the geometric relationship between the basin area and discharge. The more accurate basin area is, the higher precision discharge is. An efficient drainage network extraction method with high accuracy proposed from the Tsinghua University has been used to facilitate obtaining accurate basin area. Utilizing the estimated discharge and vertical section information obtained from drainage network extraction, the hydropower potential can be evaluated. The proposed methodology has been applied to a river basin where a reservoir with 500,000 KW capacity is located . The results indicate that the proposed methodology can supply useful discharge information in mountain river basins for hydropower resources evaluation and exploitation.",

Some of the remote sounders in orbit can be used to derive information on the deuterium isotopic ratio, δD, with the great advantage to be able to provide global data. The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) operational since 2007 for a 15 to 20 years period can provide δD estimates in the free troposphere at high spatio-temporal resolution, allowing for unprecedented daily analyses of the isotopic variations in the troposphere. After a summary of IASI capabilities to retrieve vertical profile of δD - which is mainly sensitive in the free troposphere - we present newly available δD distributions derived from IASI and explore how they can contribute to improve our understanding of several aspects of the hydrological cycle.\nAmong the different hydrological processes seen with IASI we emphasis on the role of the convection. In the tropics, we noticed that the isotopic composition in the free troposphere is sensitive to the height of convection: regions where the convection is the highest show depleted δD values while regions associated to shallow convection are more enriched. This finding could help to evaluate the representation of deep and shallow convection in GCMs (General Circulation Model) which has been suggested to be in a great part associated with the climate sensitivity uncertainty.\nThe interest of IASI measurements is further illustrated with examples of enriched water vapour above and around the tropical continents that indicate an important contribution of the evapotranspiration on the water budget.

            "abstract": "Contaminant release history identification has received considerable attention in the literature over the past several decades. In our review of this subject suggests that improvements are needed in terms of a reliable procedure, one that is easy to implement, with only few hyperparameters to estimate, and is able to evaluate confidence intervals. The purpose of this work is to propose an empirical Bayesian approach combined with the Akaike’s Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC) to estimate the contaminant release history starting from concentration observations in time or space. From the Bayesian point of view, the ABIC considers prior information on the unknown function, such as the prior distribution (assumed Gaussian) and the covariance function. The unknown statistical quantities, such as the noise variance and the covariance function parameters, are computed through the process; moreover the method also quantifies the estimation error through confidence intervals.\nWe successfully test the method out on three test cases: the classic Skaggs and Kabala (1994) source, a “midnight dump” example that consists of three delta-like sources and lastly a laboratory dataset, consisting of two measurement points spatially but with synoptic observations. This experiment reproduces the response of a 2-D unconfined aquifer. The performance of the inverse method was tested with two different covariance functions (Gaussian and exponential) and also with large measurement error. Results show an excellent recovery of all sources used in the examples. Lastly, the obtained results were discussed and compared to the geostatistical approach of Kitanidis (1995).",

            "abstract": "Hydrological extremes regularly occur in all regions of the world and as such are globally relevant phenomena with large impacts on society. Seasonal and sub-seasonal predictions could increase the preparedness to these extreme events. We investigated the skill of five seasonal forecast models from the NMME-II ensemble for the period 1982-2012 at a range of temporal and spatial scales. A canonical event analysis is used to enable a model validation beyond the ¨single¨ temporal and spatial scale. The model predictions are compared to two reference datasets on the seasonal and sub-seasonal scale. We evaluate their capability to reproduce observed daily precipitation and temperature. It is shown that the skill of the models is largely dependent on the temporal aggregation and the lead time. Longer temporal aggregation increases the forecast skill of both precipitation and temperature. Seasonal precipitation forecasts show no skill beyond lead time of 6 months, while seasonal temperature forecasts skill does extent beyond the 6 months. Overall the highest skill can be found over South-America and Australia, whereas the skill over Europe and North-America is relatively low for both variables. On the sub-seasonal scale (two week aggregation) we find a strong decrease in prediction skill after the first 2 weeks of initialization. However, the models retain skill up to 1-2 months for precipitation and 3-4 months for temperature. Their skill is highest in South-America, Asia and Oceania at the sub-seasonal level. The skill amongst models differs greatly for both the sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasts, indicating that a (weighted) multi-model ensemble is preferred over single model forecasts. This work shows that an analysis at multiple temporal and spatial scales can enhance our understanding of the added value of (sub-) seasonal forecast models and their applicability, which is important when these models are applied to forecasting of (hydrological) extremes.",

            "abstract": "Advances in single-grain and micro- and nano-analytical techniques in recent years have been particularly important to the study of highly siderophile elements (HSE) and have contributed significantly to our knowledge and understanding of their host phases and behaviour. Furthermore, whole-rock- to nano-scale studies provide new perspectives for investigation of HSE isotope systematics. Recent multi-scale 187Re-187Os and 190Pt-186Os studies facilitate comparison, to a previously unattainable degree, of the differing responses of these two decay systems to magmatic and post-magmatic processes. It is well established that mafic-ultramafic melts are sensitive to disturbance of their Re-Os isotope systematics by crustal assimilation, due to the incompatibility and resulting enrichment of Re in crustal lithologies. In contrast the very long half-life and extremely low atomic abundance of 190Pt, combined with relatively low Pt concentrations in crustal rocks, generally render the Pt-Os isotope system insensitive to modification during assimilation. However, using new single chromite grain data (Coggon et al., 2015) from the >3.811 Ga Ujaragssuit nunât layered ultramafic body, Greenland, we show that it is possible to distinguish two distinct episodes of 187Os/188Os modification; Country rock contamination of the parent melt was followed by later metamorphic disturbance of the isotope system. The Pt-Os data (Coggon et al., 2013) from the same samples show no evidence of crustal assimilation, but preserve signatures of mantle melting at ~4.1 Ga as well as disturbance during metamorphism. Macro- to micro-petrographic study clearly demonstrates that Pt, Re and Os are hosted by different mineral phases, of different origins, in these samples. This, together with the physical parameters of the decay systems reported above, leads to the dissimilar behaviour and response of the 187Re-187Os and 190Pt-186Os isotope systems during both magmatic and post-magmatic processes and consequently the facility for the two decay systems collectively to record a more complete geological history than can be gleaned from one alone, or from study at only one scale.",

Recently, a collaboration between New Mexico Tech and Osaka University resulted in the development of the NMT INTF. All of these interferometric lightning mapping systems have added greatly to our understanding of lightning physics. The next generation of digital broadband VHF interferometer is now being developed in Osaka, called the Lightning Imaging via VHF Emission (LIVE) interferometer. LIVE is capable of mapping lightning in real-time with sub-millisecond time resolution, or through post processing with sub-microsecond time resolution. Near-field corrections have been developed, so that sources very close to the array can be located accurately, and so that the baselines can lengthened for improved angular resolution. LIVE is capable of locating lighting over more than a 75 dB range of brightnesses, allowing the system to be extremely sensitive, and the long baselines allow for location uncertainties as low as tens of meters. Presented are observations of lightning recorded in the Kasai area of Japan, as well as the Pengerang region of Malaysia showing the capabilities of the LIVE interferometer.",

We suggest that the subduction of the Burmese slab extend down across the 410 km discontinuity and then stagnates in the MTZ. The stagnant slab in the MTZ may penetrate into the lower mantle. Beneath the Tengchong volcano, the hot material upwelling from the dehydration of the subducted slab originates in the MTZ, which affect the topography of the 410 km discontinuity.",

            "abstract": "Geological sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the feasible plans to control greenhouse gas emissions. In order to be more perfect, the plan has to prove that the injected CO2 gas will not be leaking. Even if CO2 leaking happens, we should possess a technique which provides information on specific aquifer system before critical effect to ground and subsurface environments. Many parameters have been utilized for early detection before risk to environments by sensing CO2 gas concentration, electric conductivity, pH, and ion analysis. However, these are not enough to all CCS sites for leakage detection. For example, the importance of gas leaking path is emphasized because finding the dominant gas flow path can reduce risk and provide a quick estimation. Herein, we investigate dissolved solute degassing and vertical flow from saturated zone to unsaturated zone in shallow depth aquifer. Especially we focused on the water table fluctuation effect. Based on field data and basic parameters, we perform a pilot scale gas injection test and calculate gas flow saturation with STOMP simulator. The CO2 gas concentrations at different depth levels according to amount of injected CO2 infused water, CO2 gas saturation in vadose zone have different concentration values. If we estimate this phenomenon in vadose zone by using CO2 gas detection method, we could presume that the CO2 dissolved in shallow groundwater is degassing and flow upward into vadose zone. However, the concentration level and change patterns are not same and will be changed according to the pattern of water table fluctuation. This study could be usefully applied to strategic CCS environmental monitoring of CO2 leakage.\nAcknowledgement: Financial support was provided by the \"R&D Project on Environmental Management of Geologic CO2 Storage\" from the KEITI (Project Number: 2014001810003).",

            "abstract": "It has been found that ozone radiative feedback acts to reduce the climate sensitivity in global warming simulations including interactive atmospheric chemistry, if the radiative forcing origins from CO2 increase. The effect can be traced to a negative feedback from stratospheric ozone changes and it is amplified by a reduced positive feedback from stratospheric water vapor.\nThese findings cannot be simply transferred to simulations in which the warming is driven by a non-CO2 radiative forcing. Using a perturbation of surface NOx and CO emissions as an example, we demonstrate that a tropospheric ozone feedback may have significant impacts on physical feedbacks. These interactions can act to an extent that the effect of a negative ozone feedback can be reversed by changes in other feedbacks, thus increasing the climate sensitivity instead of reducing it. We also address some conceptual issues showing up as chemical feedbacks are added to set of physical feedbacks in simulation with interactive chemistry.",

            "abstract": "An interplanetary (IP) shock has a large impact on magnetosphereic ions. Cluster satellite observations have shown that, soon after arrival of the IP shock, overall intensity of trapped ions rapidly increases and multiple energy dispersion appears in an energy-time spectrogram of ions with small equatorial pitch angles [Zong et al., 2012]. We have investigated the impact on the trapped ions and its dependence on the pitch angle. We have performed test particle simulation under the electric and magnetic fields provided by the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation. The solar wind speed is increased from 372 to 500 km/s in order to reproduce the IP shock. The number density in the solar wind was set to a constant to be 5 cm-3, and the Z component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was turned from +5 to -5 nT. Just after the arrival of the IP shock, a fast mode wave propagates tailward in the magnetosphere. The amplitude of the electric field exceeds 20 mV/m. To reconstruct an energy-time spectrogram of the oxygen ions at (7, 0, 0) Re in the GSM coordinates, we started to trace trajectories of ions the backward in time starting at (7, 0, 0) Re just after arrival of the fast mode wave. Knowing initial and final positions in 6-dimensional space, we mapped phase space density f, according to Liouville’s theorem. The phase space density f’ before the arrival shock is assumed to be isotropic Maxwellian. The result shows that a multiple energy-time dispersion appears in the simulated spectrogram of the ions with small equatorial pitch angles. The multiple energy-time dispersion is not present in the spectrogram of the ions with equatorial pitch angle of 90 deg. This is consistent with the Cluster satellite observations. We will discuss the generation mechanism of the multiple dispersion in terms of gyro-betatron and drift-betatron acceleration.",

Geodiversity, as a platform, provides diverse habitats; however when a city is developed, threatened and vulnerable species are seen as important components of conservation but geodiversity is not. This study analyzes the components of geodiversity in cities that developed rapidly, and identifies which characteristics of geodiversity were related to this development.\nWe estimated the components of geodiversity through the use of land cover maps and digital elevation maps (DEMs) in South Korean cities that developed rapidly between the 1980s and early-2010s, such as Yong-in and Namyangju. The relationships between land use changes and geodiversity components were analyzed and a factor analysis for land use changes was conducted using geodiversity components.\nResults show that even though adjacent rivers and streams, low elevation, and flat surfaces have high geodiversity, these areas were mainly converted into built-up areas and agricultural areas. As such, it can be stated that urban development in these cities has lowered geodiversity. Other geodiversity components related to urban development, such as slope, upslope contributing areas, streams, and lithology, were also identified.\nTo conclude, this study showed how geodiversity components related to urban development has been affected by this growth and how they are intimately connected to each other. Identifying geodiversity in future development sites could help to estimate the most sensitive areas regarding the planned development; therefore, we need to view urban development from a geodiversity perspective.",

However, less attention has been paid to the influence of deforestation locations on teleconnection patterns. In this study, we propose the existence of hotspot regions, where deforestation forcing produces larger responses in the specific teleconnection patterns. To identify these hotspot regions and understand the teleconnection mechanisms, a series of experiments are conducted using the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) coupled to a slab ocean model.

Especially in Myanmar, the pressure to develop natural forest is growing rapidly after the change from socialism to capitalism in 2010. As the initial step of the forest conservation, the aboveground biomass(AGB) of South Zarmani Reserved Forest in Bago Yoma region were estimated using Landsat 8 OLI after the evaluation with 100 sample plot measurements. Multiple linear regression (MLR) model of band values and their principal component analysis (PCA) model were developed to estimate the AGB using the spectral reflectance from Landsat images and elevation as the input variables. The MLR model had r2 = 0.43, RMSE = 60.2 tons/ha, relative RMSE = 70.1%, Bias = -9.1 tons/ha, Bias (%) = -10.6%, and p < 0.0001, while the PCA model showed r2 = 0.45, RMSE = 55.1 tons/ha, relative RMSE = 64.1%, Bias = -8.3 tons/ha, Bias (%) = -9.7%, and p < 0.0001. The AGB maps of the study area were generated based on both MLR and PCA models. The estimated mean AGB values were 74.74±22.3 tons/ha and 73.04±17.6 tons/ha and the total AGB of the study area are about 5.7 and 5.6 million tons from MLR and PCA, respectively. Then, Landsat 7 ETM+ image acquired on 2000 was also used to compare the changing of AGB between year 2000 and 2014. The estimated mean AGB value generated from the Landsat 7 ETM+ image was 78.9±16.9 tons/ha, which is substantially decreased about 7.5% compared to year 2014. The reduction of AGB increased with closeness to village, however AGB in distant areas showed steady increases. In conclusion, we were able to generate solid regression models from Landsat 8 OLI image after ground truth and two regression models gave us very similar AGB estimation (less than 2%) of the study area. We were also able to estimate the changing of AGB from year 2000 to 2014 of South Zarmani Reserved Forest, Bago Yoma, Myanmar.",

            "abstract": "The post-cratonisation history of the Yilgarn craton is somewhat fragmentary due to the paucity or absence of a stratigraphic record. Previously reported Rb-Sr biotite cooling ages suggest that the western craton margin was subjected to late ‘Pan-African’ tectonism (~400-600 Ma) and E-W compression, resulting in tectonic sedimentary loading. We report 40Ar/39Ar results on muscovite and single biotite grains from well-documented sample sites broadly comparable to those sampled for Rb-Sr biotite analysis. Muscovites record consistent ages between ~2400 and 2200 Ma. Coexisting single-grain biotite results, however, reveal significant age variations, showing similar ages of ~2500 Ma across much of the craton but decreasing abruptly to ~620-1000 Ma over a ~50-100 km wide belt at the western margin. Petrographic and chemical studies indicate that biotites are distinctly different in origin, i.e. magmatic to the east versus hydrothermal to the west. The more scattered biotite ages along the western margin are therefore unlikely to represent cooling ages, but rather indicate probable fluid-induced partial or complete biotite recrystallization at ~620 Ma. This age is in agreement with palaeomagnetic reconstructions suggesting oblique collision between Great India and Australian during Gondwana amalgamation. Complementary zircon He data from low radiation damage grains ([eU] <900 ppm), yield consistent ages 256 ±13 Ma, whereas those with [eU] values of 900-2000 ppm are negatively correlated with younger ages (~ 40-200 Ma). Coexisting apatite fission track ages are similar in range to zircon He ages, whereas apatite He ages are younger (227 ±18 Ma). These data confirm that much of the Yilgarn craton experienced extremely slow cooling (<0.1 ºС/Myr) from the Late Archean to Permian times. However, during the Late Permian to Triassic, the craton apparently experienced accelerated cooling (>4 ºС/Myr), possibly related to earliest rifting between Great India and Western Australia during Gondwana break-up or a response to the termination of the large scale Permo-Carboniferous glaciation of Western Australia.",

            "abstract": "A new algorithm has been developed to track westward travelling mixed-Rossby gravity waves (MRG) waves in the western Pacific based on the theoretical meridional wind structure stated in the shallow water equation (SWE) solutions. Applied to space-time filtered (period=3 to 8 days and wavenumber =-20 to 0), asymmetric meridional wind data at the 850hPa level from the NCEP CFS reanalysis, the algorithm finds locations with Gaussian-shaped meridional wind structure stated in SWE solutions through space and time.\nTwo groups of MRG waves were found: one with higher wavenumber (11) and another one with lower-wavenumber (6). Moreover, the MRG waves show very different dispersive properties and occurrence behavior in the western and eastern equatorial Pacific. While both groups appear in the western Pacific, mainly 6 waves were found in the eastern Pacific. The fact that both 6 and 11 waves appear in the western Pacific agrees with past discussions on the co-existence of MRG waves and tropical-disturbance type (TD-type) waves. Also, the high wavenumber wave activities mainly appear west of the dateline, meaning that some triggering process may have taken place there.\nNorthwestward wave train movement was found west of 140E in the low-level wind composites. On the other hand, negative correlation between meridional wind and temperature (negative) found in the vertical composites indicates downward vertical wave activity flux prior to the occurrences of MRG waves. Finally, in the western Pacific, kinetic energy energetics suggests that energy source of transient eddies is from the confluent background flow and also the zonal wind shear terms in the western Pacific.\nOverall, our method provides a way to identify the MRG waves instantaneously; in contrast, most of the methods employed in the past (e.g., spectral analysis or lag correlation/regression) are based on aggregates of data and they can only examine wave properties averaged over a certain period of time. Since MRG waves can serve as precusors for tropical cyclone formation, recording the space-time properties of MRG waves in an instantaneous sense should be useful for studying possible formation mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "For a long time, sea ice was considered to act as a lid over seawater preventing CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and ocean. Recent observations suggest that sea ice can be an active source or a sink for CO2, although its magnitude is not very clear. The direct measurements on CO2 flux based on the chamber method and eddy covariance often do not agree with each other. It is therefore important to measure the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) stock in sea ice precisely in order to better understand the CO2 flux through sea ice.\nThe challenges in sea ice DIC sampling is how to melt the ice core without being exposed to the air gaining or losing CO2. A common practice is to seal the ice core in a self-prepared gas-tight plastic bag and suck the air out of the bag gently using a syringe (together with a needle) through a valve mounted on one side of the bag. However, this method is time consuming (takes up to several minutes to suck the air out) and very often there is large headspace found in the bag after the ice melts due to the imperfect bag-preparation, which might affect the DIC concentration in melt ice-water.\nWe developed a new technique by using a commercially available plastic bag with a vacuum sealer to seal the ice core. In comparison to syringe-based method, this technique is fast and easy to operate; it takes less than 10 seconds to vacuum and seal the bag all in one button with no headspace left in the bag. Experimental tests with replicate ice cores sealed by those two methods showed that there is no difference in the DIC concentration measured after these two methods, suggesting that there is no loss of DIC during the course of vacuum sealing. In addition, a time series experiment on DIC in melt ice-water stored in the new bag shows that when the samples were not poisoned, the DIC concentration remains unchanged for at least 3 days in the bag; while poisoned by HgCl2, there is no change in DIC for at least 21 days, indicating that this new bag is impermeable to CO2. Therefore, this new technique offers a convenient yet reliable method for DIC sampling of sea ice.",

In seismic prospecting the long array has shot-receiver offset over several kilometers. Its trace interval and shot interval is about some decameters, while the dominant frequency is tens of hertz. Its penetration depth is thousands of meters. Its order of resolution in vertical and horizontal is meters to decameters. Ultrahigh resolution shallow profile prospecting data is used at well site and later for risk assessment with sonar data. We need its vertical and horizontal resolution come to at least decimeter level. Its frequency is about thousands hertz and penetration depth is about decameters. Small-interval, short array, high resolution multichannel seismic prospecting has compromise effect between long array multichannel seismic prospecting and ultrahigh resolution shallow profile prospecting. We can use this to link up long array multichannel seismic prospecting and ultrahigh resolution shallow profile prospecting vertically.\nBy mixing these different frequency seismic data one can maximize the advantages of these data. Since different seismic data can only achieve certain level of accuracy and quality in seismic imaging, there is no perfect method to process these data in vertical direction. Here, we propose to mix those data and achieve the integrated seismic processing. Base on mixing different seismic data, the cooperative process can take the advantage of mixing data to image different target layers. With this method we can lay bare mysteries of ocean bottom and deeper layer, provide assistance to find oil and gas, and provide services for oil-gas field sustainable exploration in different waters.\nFrom the above, studying mixed high resolution data in different waters that acquired by different method is very important to exploring and developing.",

            "abstract": "Global glaciers and ice caps loose mass through calving, while existing models are currently not equipped to realistically predict dynamic ice loss. This is mainly because long-term continuous calving records, that would help to better understand fine scale processes and key climatic-dynamic feedbacks between calving, climate, terminus evolution and marine conditions, do not exist. Combined passive seismic/acoustic strategies are the only technique able to capture rapid calving events continuously, independent of daylight or meteorological conditions. We have produced such a continuous calving record for Kronebreen, a tidewater glacier in Svalbard, using data from permanent seismic stations between 2001 and 2014. However, currently no method has been established in cryo-seismology to quantify the calving ice loss directly from seismic data. Independent calibration data is required to derive 1) a realistic estimation of the dynamic ice loss unobserved due to seismic noise and 2) a robust scaling of seismic calving signals to ice volumes. Here, we analyze the seismic calving record at Kronebreen and independent calving data in a first attempt to quantify ice loss directly from seismic records. We make use of a) calving flux data with weekly to monthly resolution obtained from satellite remote sensing and GPS data between 2007 and 2013, and b) direct, visual calving observations in two weeks in 2009 and 2010. Furthermore, the magnitude-scaling property of seismic calving events is analyzed. We derive and discuss an empirical relation between seismic calving events and calving flux which for the first time allows to estimate a time series of calving volumes more than one decade back in time. Improving our model requires to incorporate more precise, high-resolution calibration data. A new field campaign will combine innovative, multi-disciplinary monitoring techniques to measure calving ice volumes and dynamic ice-ocean interactions simultaneously with terrestrial laser scanning and a temporary seismic/underwater-acoustic network.",

Recently, we have started similar observation campaigns in the Hikurangi subduction zone, off the North Island of New Zealand since 2013. As a result of the observations, we have observed an uplift of 5 m due to the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Ito et al., 2011) and transient crustal deformations accompanied by slow slip events preceding the earthquake (Ito et al., 2013). Precision thermometer, usually used for temperature compensation of the pressure readings, occasionally recorded strange temperature changes related to occurrence of submarine earthquakes or tsunamis. Arai et al. (2013) interpreted noticeable temperature changes observed after the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and interpreted it as the result of the turbidity current induced by massive tsunami. Inazu et al. (2015) pointed out a possibility that the temperature disturbance recorded just after the Tohoku-Oki earthquake above the large coseismic slip zone was due to the discharged of submarine groundwater associated with the earthquake. In order to describe these strange temperature signals more quantitatively, we started trial observations allowing investigation of water temperature field on the deep seafloor. In this study, we installed two precision temperature loggers top and bottom of the ocean bottom pressure recorders, with ~ 60 cm in height, to measure vertical gradients of seawater temperature as well as the ocean bottom pressures. Here, we report about 1-year continuous records retrieved from the Japan Trench and off New Zealand. During the observation off New Zealand, an evident slow slip event was identified by the onshore geodetic observations near the locations of our seafloor pressure-temperature monitoring. We are now exploring possible thermal and pressure signals associated with the slow slip event.",

The four global and regional modeling groups have participated in the campaign and have produced 7-day forecasts of hourly PM10, PM2.5, and O3 concentrations over East Asia for May 18 - June 12, 2015. All models have used the same CREATE anthropogenic emissions over East Asia, but used their own natural emissions from soil and vegetation. Three regional models were driven by meteorological fields from the WRF model with the same initial and boundary meteorological conditions from the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS). The global model is a fully coupled on-line chemistry-weather model and used the same initial meteorological condition from the GFS. The 26-day observational data are compared with the four participating model results and the multi-model ensemble of the model results. Each model forecast shows relatively a wide range of temporal and spatial variation compared to the observations such that the correlation coefficients between the simulated and observed daily PM10 concentrations in surface air vary from 0.24 to 0.83. In general, we find that the multi-model ensemble forecast shows a relatively better performance than individual models. Detailed examination of the model performance and a possible cause for the discrepancy will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Karst aquifers are an important source of drinking water in many regions of the world, but their resources are likely to be affected by changes in climate and land use. In fact, climate characteristics control the supply of water to karst systems and the evaporative demand, while land use characteristics control the actual evapotranspiration losses. Understanding karst hydrology and estimating karst groundwater resources at a large-scale is critical for preventing threats to water supply in a changing world. Hartmann et al. (2015, Geosci. Model Dev.) introduced a parsimonious karst recharge model, called VarKarst-R, which allows for large-scale simulations of groundwater recharge while explicitly taking into account karst heterogeneities, i.e. preferential flow paths. The first objective of the present study is to introduce vegetation processes into the VarKarst-R model to better estimate evapotranspiration losses depending on the land use characteristics. Secondly, the VarKarst-R model so modified will be used to assess the relative influence of changes in climate and land use on aquifer recharge. We establish a sensitivity analysis framework to analyse the interactions between climate descriptors (e.g. mean precipitation, precipitation seasonality), vegetation parameters (e.g. canopy storage capacity, rooting depth) and soil parameters (e.g. soil storage).",

            "abstract": "Frictional strength at seismic slip rates is a key to evaluate fault weakening and rupture propagation during earthquakes. The Japan Trench First Drilling Project (JFAST) drilled through the shallow plate-boundary thrust, where huge displacements of ~50 m occurred during the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. To determine the downhole frictional strength at drilled site (Site C0019), we analyzed surface drilling data. The equivalent slip rate estimated from the rotation rate and inner and outer radiuses of the drill bit ranges from 0.8 to 1.3 m/s. The measured torque includes the frictional torque between the drilling string and borehole wall, the viscous torque between the drilling string and seawater/drilling fluid, and the drilling torque between the drill bit and sediments. We subtracted the former two from the measured torque using the torque data during bottom-up rotating operations at several depths. Then, the shear stress was calculated from the drilling torque taking the configuration of the drill bit into consideration. The normal stress was estimated from the weight on bit data and the projected area of the drill bit. Assuming negligible cohesion, the frictional strength was obtained by dividing shear stress by normal stress. The results show a clear contrast in high-velocity frictional strength across the plate-boundary thrust: the friction coefficient of frontal prism sediments (hemipelagic mudstones) in hanging wall is 0.1–0.2, while that in subducting sediments (hemipelagic to pelagic mudstones and chert) in footwall increases to 0.2–0.4. The friction coefficient of smectite-rich pelagic clay in the plate-boundary thrust is ~0.1, which is consistent with that obtained from high-velocity (1.3 m/s) friction experiments and temperature measurements. We conclude that surface drilling torque provides useful data to obtain a continuous downhole frictional strength.",

While the most notable difference concerns the dominance of low-Ti (TiO2 < 2.0 wt.%) and high-Ti types in the southern and northern part of the province, respectively, detailed analyses of lava flow sequences sampled mostly in drill cores allowed definition of six main groups of chemically distinct flow units. The chemical and possible age differences among these units were then used to define the global time-related evolution of Paranà basaltic magmatism and involvement of distinct mantle-source components.\nNewly sampled outcropping lava flow sequences from the southern Paranà do however only partially support this picture. Our new major and trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data show that high- and low-Ti basaltic flows are interlayered. In particular, Pitanga type high-Ti basalts are interlayered with Gramado and Esmeralda low-Ti basalts (these latter being present both towards the base and the top of the sequence) in Paranà State, while in Santa Caterina State Gramado flows are interlayered with Urubici-type high-Ti basalts. The interlayering of distinct basaltic magma type requires near-synchronous eruption of chemically strongly different magma types generated from clearly heterogeneous mantle sources and erupted through separated magma plumbing systems, without apparent interaction (mixing) among the distinct basalts.\nIn conclusion, the relative timing of low- and high-Ti magma types seems to be much more complicated than previously thought, as for example Esmeralda or Pitanga basalts, previously considered as quite late and postdating Gramado basalts, are indeed synchronous with them.",

In this context, measurements of the total sink of OH, referred as total OH reactivity, can provide a critical test to assess the completeness of trace gas measurements during field campaigns. This can be done by comparing the measured total OH reactivity to values calculated from trace gas measurements. Indeed, large discrepancies are usually found between measured and calculated OH reactivity values revealing the presence of important unmeasured reactive species, which have yet to be identified.\nA Comparative Reactivity Method (CRM) instrument has been setup at Mines Douai to allow sequential measurements of VOCs and OH reactivity using the same Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer. This approach aims at identifying unmeasured reactive VOCs based on a method proposed by Kato et al. (Atmos. Environ., 2011), taking advantage of VOC oxidations occurring in the CRM sampling reactor. MD-CRM has been deployed at an urban site in Dunkirk (France) during July 2014 to test this new approach. During this campaign, a large fraction of the OH reactivity was not explained by collocated measurements of trace gases (67% on average). In this presentation, we will first describe the approach that was implemented in the CRM instrument to identify part of the observed missing OH reactivity and we will then discuss the OH reactivity budget regarding the origin of air masses reaching the measurement site.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies on the source process of the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake have revealed its large coseismic slip along a shallow plate interface to the Japan Trench axis. In order to further understand the complex rupture propagation along the plate interface, it is essential to elucidate recovery process of interplate coupling in the source area after the Tohoku earthquake. Estimating changes in b-values for interplate earthquakes before and after the Tohoku event is one of the available approaches to answer the above issue.\nTo start with, we attempt to automatically detect and determine the location of interplate earthquakes using extensive seafloor aftershock observation data. We used mainly short-period pop-up type ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) [Shinohara et al., 2011, 2012]. We applied a semblance-based method [Nakatani et al., 2015] to 23 OBSs deployed off Fukushima. A seismic tomography result [Matsubara and Obara, 2011] is used for calculation of P wave traveltimes between OBS stations and given grids along the plate interface.\nTo confirm the validity of our method, we conducted synthetic tests by using a Ricker wavelet with several different sets of signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and focal depths. As the results, semblance values of earthquakes with focal depths relative to the plate interface of 5 km are comparable to noise level, regardless of S/N ratio. On the other hand, earthquakes along the plate interface have significant peak semblance values. Therefore, our method is effective for detection of interplate earthquakes.\nWe, then, applied the method to several waveforms of interplate events listed in the JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency) catalog and identified epicenters by backprojecting semblance values. We compared our resulted epicenters to those of Shinohara et al. (2011, 2012) which precisely relocated the JMA ones using P- and S-wave arrival times and maximum-likelihood estimate technique. The results show good coincidence between them. In addition, we introduced a neighborhood algorithm [Sambridge, 1999] into the semblance-based method in order to reduce computational time. We develop our method so that we determine interplate earthquakes including small ones using continuous waveform data.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of potential health benefits of reductions in air pollution on the local scale is becoming increasingly important. The aim of this study is to conduct health impact assessment (HIA) by utilizing regionally and spatially specific data in order to assess the influence of future emission scenarios on human health. In the first stage of this investigation, a modeling study was carried out using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry to estimate ambient concentrations of air pollutants for the baseline year 2009, and for the future emission scenarios in southern Germany. Anthropogenic emissions for the baseline year 2009 are derived from the emission inventory provided by the Netherlands Organization of Applied Scientific Research (TNO) (Denier van der Gon et al., 2010). For Germany, the TNO emissions were replaced by gridded emission data with a high spatial resolution of 1/64 x 1/64 degrees. Future air quality simulations are carried out under different emission scenarios, which reflect possible energy and climate measures in year 2030. The model set-up included a nesting approach, where three domains with horizontal resolution of 18 km, 6 km and 2 km were defined. The simulation results for the baseline year 2009 are used to quantify present-day health burdens. Concentration-response functions (CRFs) for PM2.5 and NO2 from the WHO Health risks of air Pollution in Europe (HRAPIE) project were applied to population-weighted mean concentrations to estimate relative risks and hence to determine numbers of attributable deaths and associated life-years lost. In the next step, future health impacts of projected concentrations were calculated taking into account different emissions scenarios. The health benefits that we assume with air pollution reductions can be used to provide options for future policy decisions to protect public health.",

            "abstract": "Sheared rocks are thought to explain electrical anomalies in a deformed uppermost mantle as their high electrical conductivity and anisotropy reproduce electromagnetic data. Although it has been suggested that melt is required to reproduce asthenospheric electrical anisotropy, the electrical properties of the sheared polycrystalline matrix and its contribution to bulk electrical anisotropy at upper mantle conditions are not fully understood and require further investigation. We present a systematic experimental investigation of the effect of shear deformation on the electrical conductivity of polycrystalline olivine (Fo90). Starting samples were sheared at 1200°C and 0.3GPa in a gas-medium apparatus to a strain of up to 7.3. Electrical conductivity and anisotropy of the samples were measured at 3GPa over the temperature range ~700-1300°C in a multi-anvil apparatus using a two-electrode technique.\nWe observe that shear deformation increases electrical conductivity and that conductivity is highest in the direction of shear, with the sample deformed to the highest strain being the most conductive. Electrical anisotropy is higher at low temperature than at high temperature. For a similar shear strain, comparison with previous work on melt-bearing sheared samples shows that melt increases bulk conductivity but that melt-free samples deformed to high strain are more conductive than melt-bearing samples deformed to low strain. The role of grain boundaries on conduction mechanisms is investigated based on textural analyses and comparison with electrical data on olivine single crystals and undeformed polycrystalline olivine. Application of our results to field data indicates that, even in melt-bearing contexts, electrical anomalies in the asthenosphere can be solely explained by the electrical properties of the sheared solid matrix.",

            "abstract": "In July of 2014, offshore drillings on Iheya-North Knoll, Okinawa Trough, was executed as part of Next-generation technology for ocean resources survey, which is a research program in Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP). In this expedition, logging-while- drilling (LWD) and measuring-while-drilling (MWD) were inserted into 6 holes (C9011 – C9016) to investigate spatial distribution of hydrothermal deposit and geothermal fluid reservoir. Both of these tools included annular pressure-while-drilling (APWD). Annular pressure and temperature were monitored by the APWD to detect possible exceedingly-high-temperature geofluid. In addition, drilling fluid was continuously circulated at sufficient flow rate to protect LWD tools against high temperature (non-stop driller system).\nAt C9012 and C9016, the LWD tool clearly detected pressure and temperature anomaly at 234 meter below the seafloor (mbsf) and 80 mbsf, respectively. Annular pressure and temperature quickly increases at that depth and it would reflect the injection of high-temperature fluid. During the drilling, however, drilling water was continuously circulated at high flow-rate (2600L/min) and the measured temperature is not exactly in-situ temperature.\nTo investigate the detail of the heat source, such as in-situ temperature and quantity of heat, we performed numerical analyses of thermal fluid and energy-balance assuming injection of high-temperature fluid. We combined pressure loss theory of double cylinders and temperature equation to replicate the fluid flow and its temperature between borehole wall and drilling pipe during the thermofluid injection. As the result, we estimated the temperature and the volume of injected fluid to be 115oC~ and 17.3 m3, respectively (at C9012) from the calculation. This temperature is lower than that of a hydrothermall vent which had been found near the hole (300oC).",

            "abstract": "Geological storage of CO2 can only be realistically modeled by taking into account reactive fluid-rock interactions. After supercritical CO2 is injected underground, it partially dissolves into the resident brine and increases its acidity. This increase in acidity combined with high underground temperatures stimulates geochemical reactions that can dramatically alter rock properties, such as porosity and permeability, as well as the capability of brine to dissolve more mobile supercritical CO2. Combining these geochemical reactions with reactive transport simulations is then essential for understanding the long-term fate of injected CO2 and estimating carbon trapping via solubility and mineral precipitation mechanisms.\nIn this talk we present efficient and versatile computational methods for modeling fluid-rock interactions. The talk starts with an overview of common methodologies based on the solution of the law of mass-action equations for calculating equilibria between aqueous, gaseous, and mineral species. This is followed by a discussion of the deficiencies and drawbacks of these methods. We then present alternative approaches based on the minimization of Gibbs energy that resolves the disadvantages of the former methods, and show how the new algorithms can be used for modeling chemical kinetics and multiphase reactive transport under partial equilibrium assumptions (e.g., aqueous and gaseous species in equilibrium, minerals controlled by either kinetics or equilibrium). We demonstrate the efficiency of these novel equilibrium methods in large-scale reactive transport simulations of geological storage of CO2, where thousands to millions of equilibrium calculations are performed during each time step. All these methods for equilibrium, kinetics, and reactive transport calculations are available in Reaktoro (www.reaktoro.org), a unified framework for modeling chemically reactive systems.",

            "abstract": "The Yingmailai granitic intrusion is located in the middle part of the southern Tianshan. It consists predominantly of biotite K-feldspar granite with minor two-mica K-feldspar granite. They have similar whole-rock geochemical characteristics, but distinct mineralogy. Opaque minerals in biotite K-feldspar granite are ilmenite, whereas they are magnetite in two-mica K-feldspar granite. Primary muscovite has been recognized in two-mica K-feldspar granite, which is characterized by high Mg/Fe in biotite, An contents of plagioclase and Ab contents of perthite. According to Ishihara’s classification(1977), biotite K-feldspar granite can undoubtedly be classified to ilmenite-series. For instance, opaque oxide minerals are less than 1 vol%, in which ilmenite is unique recognized; Fe-rich biotite (high FeO+Fe2O3) and low MgO, high FeO+Fe2O3/ FeO+Fe2O3+MgO ratio (0.957~0.980), low Mg numbers (<0.6), mostly Fe2+>1.1, and low Fe3+/（Fe3++Fe2+）. Although some characteristics, e.g., presence of magnetite and Mg-rich biotite, suggest magnetite-series, it should be noted that the magnetite in two-mica K-feldspar granite is formed by post magmatism. In combination with low Fe3+/（Fe3++Fe2+）ratio and presence of indicating mineral—muscovite, it can be inferred that it also belongs to ilmenite-series. The factors which control the appearance of secondary magnetite are sudden change of fO2, pressure, temperature during magma emplacement rather than their source. In addition, Yingmailai granitic intrusion’s characteristics, such as mineralogy, CaO(wt%)<3.7, w(Na2O)/w(K2O)<1, high SiO2 and (87Sr/86Sr)t, low temperature during the process of forming, indicate S type granitoids, suggesting that ilmenite-series defined by Ishihara (1977) correspond to S-type granite in the south Tienshan. This research also suggests that the south Tianshan had not experienced within plate during early Permian.",

            "abstract": "Surface heterogeneity and complex terrain invalidate to a certain extent basic assumptions behind the classical turbulence theory. One important classical concept is Townsend’s hypothesis, which postulates that outer layer scale and inner layer scale turbulence do not interact. However, there is little knowledge to what extent large-scale eddies can affect near-surface fluxes. We shall investigate the relevance of large-eddy transport in the surface layer by an integrated approach combining field measurements and numerical simulations.\nDoppler lidar and tower-based turbulence measurements were conducted at the Yatir forest in Israel, which is surrounded by semi-arid shrubland. Vertical profiles of vertical and horizontal wind speed and direction were determined from Doppler lidar data. Eddy-covariance measurements were conducted at two sites. In addition, idealized large-eddy simulations (LES) were performed. A virtual control volume method allowed us to disentangle all components of the total surface flux.\nThe daytime sensible heat flux over the forest was almost twice as large as over the surrounding shrubland. These very large differences in surface heating generated a secondary circulation, which was detected by the Doppler lidar measurements. Persistent updrafts were detected above the forest. Tower measurements at the shrubland site showed generally larger low-frequency contributions in spectra and co-spectra, and the energy balance ratio over the forest was 1.00, while it was only 0.81 at the shrubland site. LES results indicate that advection is the main cause for the lack of energy balance closure at the shrubland site. Over the forest, an equally large advective flux (in the opposite direction as over the shrubland) is almost completely balanced by horizontal flux divergence.\nWe conclude that secondary circulations indeed exist over the Yatir forest, and that they can be detected from Doppler lidar data. Against the prediction of Townsend’s hypothesis, the corresponding large-scale eddies contribute to the energy transport in the surface layer. This results in considerable horizontal flux contributions that cannot be captured by eddy-covariance measurements in the usual one-dimensional framework. In-situ energy flux measurements may therefore exhibit a lack of energy balance closure.",

Although forest inventory data can provide accurate statistical information about forest type, such data do not give the specific spatial distribution. Remote sensing data provide accurate spatial information, and vegetation indices provide measures of land surface vegetation cover and growth conditions. By fusing these two sources of data, specific information about the spatial distribution of different types of forest can be obtained. Here, in a case study of Heilongjiang Province, we obtained forest dominant species area from the sixth and seventh national forest inventories and MODIS composite remote sensing data for the same periods to study forest cover by developing a spatialization method. Based on pixel features (such as NDVI and near-infrared reflectance) and their relationships with forest types, thresholds between different forest types in the remote sensing information were set according to the statistical data, which allowed the two sets of data to be fused. As a result, we generated forest cover maps for 2000 and 2005 that show the distribution of four forest types. Taking vegetation map of China as reference data, an error matrix analysis shows that the overall classification consistency reaches 76.7%, but only 70% for evergreen needleleaf forest and mixed forest. This study paves the way for further research on improving the accuracy of forest cover classification accuracy, on expanding the spatial and temporal scales of interest, and on quantifying forest dynamics",

            "abstract": "Droughts studies are scarce in Central America, a region frequently affected by droughts that cause significant socio-economic and environmental problems. Drought characterisation is important for water management and planning and can be done with the help of drought indices. Many indices have been developed in the last decades but their ability to suitably characterise droughts depends on the region of application. In Central America, comprehensive and high-quality observational networks of meteorological and hydrological data are not available. This limits the choice of drought indices and denotes the need to evaluate the quality of the data used in their calculation. This paper aimed to find which combination(s) of drought index and meteorological database are most suitable for characterising droughts in Central America. The drought indices evaluated were the standardised precipitation index (SPI), deciles (DI), the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the effective drought index (EDI). These were calculated using precipitation data from the Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with station (CHIRPS), CRN073, the Climate Research Unit (CRU), ERA-Interim and station databases, and temperature data from the CRU database. All the indices were calculated at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month accumulation times. As a first step, the large-scale meteorological precipitation datasets were compared to have an overview of the level of agreement between them and find possible quality problems. Then, the performance of all the combinations of drought indices and meteorological datasets were evaluated against independent river discharge data, in form of the standardised streamflow index (SSI). Results revealed the large disagreement between the precipitation datasets; we found the selection of database to be more important than the selection of drought index. We found that the best combinations of meteorological drought index and database were obtained using the SPI and DI, calculated with CHIRPS and station data.",

            "abstract": "Soils of the northern high latitudes store carbon over millennial timescales and contain almost double the carbon stock of the atmosphere. The exposure and decomposition of aged organic matter in these soils is a carbon dioxide (CO2) source to the atmosphere. Permafrost thaw over the coming century may result in a significant CO2 release. However, some of this soil organic carbon in permafrost zones can be eroded and input to rivers. If it escapes degradation during river transport and is buried in ocean sediments, it instead contributes to a longer-term (>104 yr), geological CO2sink.\nDespite this recognition, the erosional flux and fate of particulate organic carbon (POC) in large rivers draining permafrost zones remains poorly constrained. We quantify POC source, flux and fate in the Mackenzie River Basin, the main sediment supplier to the Arctic Ocean, using radiocarbon, stable carbon isotopes and element ratios to correct for rock-derived POC. The eroded biospheric POC has resided in the basin for millennia, with a mean radiocarbon age of 5800±800 yr. Rivers eroding continuous permafrost zones contribute the oldest biospheric POC. Based on the measured biospheric POC content and annual sediment flux, we calculate a biospheric POC flux of 2.2 (+1.3/-0.9) TgC yr-1 from the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean, three times the CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering. Offshore we find evidence for efficient terrestrial carbon burial over the Holocene period. Our findings demonstrate how erosion of organic carbon-rich, high latitude soils can result in a significant geological CO2sink.\nWe postulate that this geological CO2 sink is sensitive to climate conditions in the Arctic. The transfer can operate when high latitudes host carbon stocks in soil, and while rivers can erode and transfer sediments to the Arctic Ocean. Over the last 1Ma, the erosional transfer was likely to have been enhanced during interglacials. We propose that erosion of biospheric carbon by large rivers in the Arctic could play an important role in long-term CO2 drawdown, coupling the carbon cycle to climatic conditions at high latitudes.",

            "abstract": "The energy balance closure problem is a well-known issue of eddy-covariance measurements. However, the underlying mechanisms are still under debate. Recent evidence suggests that organized low-frequency motion contributes significantly to the energy balance residual, because the associated transport cannot be captured by a point measurement.\nIn this study, we carry out virtual measurements using a PArallelized Large-Eddy Simulation Model (PALM). In order to represent specific measurement days of the field campaign “High definition clouds and precipitation for advancing climate prediction” (HD(CP)²), which was part of the project “High Definition Clouds and Precipitation for Advancing Climate Prediction”(HOPE) in 2013, the simulations were driven by synoptic-scale COSMO-DE reanalysis data. Planet boundary layer height, the vertical profiles of variance and skewness of vertical wind were analyzed and a comparison with Doppler-lidar observations shows good agreement. Furthermore, simulated energy imbalances were compared with real-world imbalances from two eddy-covariance stations in the model domain. Particularly poor energy balance closure was found for a day with cellular organized structures in the surface layer, while the energy balance closure was better on other days with roll-like structures. This finding might be one explanation why the energy balance closure generally tends to improve with increasing friction velocity, since roll-like structures are typically associated with higher wind speeds. In order to gain insight into the partitioning of the energy balance residual between the sensible and latent heat fluxes, we further employed a control volume method within the numerical simulation. Hence, advection and storage terms were identified as the most important causes for the lack of energy balance closure by the eddy-covariance method. The results of the virtual measurements indicate that the “missing” part of the surface energy mainly comes from the sensible heat, which means the underestimation of the sensible heat flux is the major reason for the unclosed energy balance.",

            "abstract": "Few models exist that predict the Omori's Law of aftershock rate decay, with rate-state friction the only physically-based model. ETAS is a probabilistic model of cascading failures, and is sometimes used to infer rate-state frictional properties. However, the (perhaps dominant) role of fluids in the earthquake process is being increasingly realised, so a fluid-based physical model for Omori's Law should be available. In this talk, I present an hypothesis for a fluid-driven earthquake cycle where dehydration and decarbonization at depth provides continuous sources of buoyant high pressure fluids that must eventually make their way back to the surface. The natural pathway for fluid escape is along plate boundaries, where in the ductile regime high pressure fluids likely play an integral role in episodic tremor and slow slip earthquakes. At shallower levels, high pressure fluids pool at the base of seismogenic zones, with the reservoir expanding in scale through the earthquake cycle. Late in the cycle, these fluids can invade and degrade the strength of the brittle crust and contribute to earthquake nucleation. The mainshock opens permeable networks that provide escape pathways for high pressure fluids and generate aftershocks along these flow paths, while creating new pathways by the aftershocks themselves. Thermally activated precipitation then seals up these pathways, returning the system to a low-permeability environment and effective seal during the subsequent tectonic stress buildup. I find that the multiplicative effect of an exponential dependence of permeability on the effective normal stress coupled with an Arrhenius-type, thermally activated exponential reduction in permeability results in Omori's Law. I simulate this scenario using a very simple model that combines non-linear diffusion and a step-wise increase in permeability when a Mohr Coulomb failure condition is met, and allow permeability to decrease as an exponential function in time. I show very strong spatial correlations of the simulated evolved permeability and fluid pressure field with aftershock hypocenters from this 1992 Landers and 1994 Northridge aftershock sequences, and reproduce the observed aftershock decay rates. Controls on the decay rates (p-value) will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Fluid flow can play an important role in fault failure, due to the influence of pore pressure on effective confining stress and through chemical and thermal alteration of the fault zone. Rocks of the Alpine Fault Zone, both exposed at the surface and recovered in cores, show evidence for significant alteration by fluids. However, the fluid flow regime in the region is poorly constrained and its relationship with the behaviour of the fault is uncertain. In 2014 the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) drilled the DFDP-2B borehole, penetrating 893 m into the hanging-wall of the Alpine Fault. Prior to drilling, a set of hydrogeological models for the Whataroa Valley region, encompassing the DFDP-2B drill site, were constructed using the modelling software FEFLOW. Models were constructed for a range of plausible hydraulic conductivity structures for the region. They predicted strongly artesian hydraulic heads of 50-150 m above surface elevation and temperatures exceeding 100 °C within 1 km depth in bedrock beneath the DFDP-2 drill site, with the exact hydraulic and thermal gradients dependent on the hydraulic conductivity structure chosen. During the drilling project hydraulic and thermal data from the borehole was collected. This included 33 slug test datasets, carried out at a range of borehole depths throughout the project. Estimates for hydraulic conductivity were obtained by analysis of slug test data. Steady state hydraulic heads for the borehole, across a range of depths, were estimated from the slug test measurements. Depth profiles of hydraulic head show rapid increases in hydraulic head with depth, in line with model predictions. Results show fluid pressures greatly exceeding hydrostatic pressure in the shallow crust, reflecting significant upward flow of groundwater beneath the Whataroa Valley. Hydraulic conductivity estimates provide constraints on the hydraulic conductivity structure of the region. All hydraulic conductivity structures modelled thus far suggest continued increases in hydraulic head beneath the drilled region. If this regime persists to the depths of earthquake nucleation, high fluid pressures may contribute significantly to weakening of the Alpine Fault.",

We demonstrate quantitative analyses of warming trend in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) winters, using 7 different reanalysis datasets (JRA-55, JRA-55C, JRA-55AMIP, ERA-interim, CFSR, JRA-25, NCEP-NCAR).\nHemispheric total cold air mass amount in the NH winter exhibit a statistically significant decreasing trend in all reanalysis datasets at a rate about -1.37 to -0.77% per decade over the period 1959-2012 and at a rate about -1.57 to -0.82% per decade over 1980-2012. There is no statistically significant trend in the equatorward cold air mass flux across latitude of 45N, which is an indicator for hemispheric-scale cold air outbreak, over the period 1980-2012 except for NCEP-NCAR reanalysis dataset which shows substantial decreasing trend of about -3.28% per decade. The spatial distribution of the long-term trend of cold air mass amount in the NH winter is almost consistent among reanalysis datasets except for JRA-55AMIP over the period 1980-2012. Cold air mass amount increases over Central Siberia, Kamchatka peninsula, and Bering Sea, while it decreases over Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Greenland, Canada, Northern part of United States, and East Asia.\nIn the SH winter, on the other hand, there is a large discrepancy in hemispheric total cold air mass amount and equatorward cold air mass flux across latitude of 50S over the period 1980-2010 among reanalysis datasets. This result indicate that there is a large uncertainty in the long-term trend of cold air mass amount in the SH winter.",

            "abstract": "Carbonyl Sulfide (COS) is a promising new tracer that can be used to partition the Net Ecosystem Exchange into gross primary production (GPP) and respiration. COS and CO2 vegetation fluxes are closely related as these gases share the same diffusion pathway into stomata, which makes COS a potentially powerful tracer for GPP. While vegetative uptake is the largest sink of COS, the environmental drivers are poorly understood, and soil fluxes represent an important but relatively unconstrained component. Therefore, the realization of the COS tracer method requires proper characterization of both soil and ecosystem fluxes. A campaign to provide better constrained soil and ecosystem COS flux data for boreal forests took place in the summer of 2015 at the SMEAR II site in Hyytiälä, Finland. Eddy covariance flux measurements were made above the forest canopy on an Aerodyne continuous-wave quantum cascade laser (QCL) system that is capable of measuring COS, CO2, CO and H2O. Soil COS fluxes were obtained using modified LI-COR LI-8100 chambers together with high accuracy concentration measurements from another Aerodyne QCL instrument. The same instrument alternately measured concentrations in and above the canopy on a cycle through 4 heights, which will be used to calculate ecosystem fluxes using the Radon-tracer method, providing ecosystem fluxes under low-turbulent conditions. We will compare ecosystem fluxes from both eddy covariance and profile measurements and show estimates of the fraction of ecosystem fluxes attributed to the soil component. With the better understanding of ecosystem and soil COS fluxes, as obtained with this dataset, we will be able to derive COS-based GPP estimates for the Hyytiälä site.",

            "abstract": "The recent spreading of renewable energy across Europe and the associated production variability and uncertainty are emerging challenges for hydropower system operation. Widely distributed and highly intermittent solar and wind power generation systems, along with feed-in-tariffs, at which they are remunerated, are threating the operation of traditional hydropower systems. For instance, in countries where the transition to a larger production by means of renewable power systems is a novel process, e.g. Switzerland, many hydropower companies are operating their reservoirs with low or no profits, claiming for a revision of the entire energy market system. This situation goes along with the problem of ensuring energy supply both nowadays and in the future, with changing energy demand and available water resources. In this work, we focus on a hydropower system in the Swiss Alps to explore how different operating policies can cope with both adequate energy supply and profitable operation under current and future climate and socio-economic conditions. We investigate the operation of the Mattmark reservoir in South-West Switzerland. Mattmark is a pumped reservoir of 98 106 m3 fed by a natural catchment of 37 km2 and contributing catchments, summing up to 51 km2, connected by several diversion channels. The hydrological regime, snow- and ice-melt dominated, has already experienced changes in the last decades due to glacier retreat and is expected to be strongly impacted by climate change in the future. We use Multi-Objective optimization techniques to explore current tradeoffs between profitability and secure supply. We then investigate how tradeoffs may evolve in time under different climate change projections and energy market scenarios. Results inform on the co-evolution of climate- and socio-economic induced variations, thus unveiling potential co-benefit situations to hydropower generation and providing insights to future energy market design.",

            "abstract": "Early in the history of terrestrial planets, heat of accretion, radioactive decay or core-mantle segregation may have significantly melted the silicate mantle. Magma ocean evolution depends both on the physical properties of solid and liquid materials at relevant P-T conditions and on the complex dynamics of a convecting crystallizing mantle. Present deep Earth mantle structures such as ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs) or low-shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) might be directly linked to the crystallization of a potential magma ocean. \nWe propose a complete thermodynamic model of the solid-liquid equilibrium in the MgO-FeO-SiO2 system at HP/HT (Boukaré et al, 2015, in press). It synthesizes various data (observed and computed equations of state, melting curves, Mg/Fe partitioning). The present study confirms previous findings that, at similar compositions, melts are lighter than solids throughout the mantle. However, at thermodynamic equilibrium, the first solids that crystallize in the deep mantle are lighter than the liquid as they are more Mg-rich. This further enriches the melt in iron and this residual melt becomes much denser than the solid phase. Both the anti-freeze effect of iron and its high density suggest a mantle crystallization scenario similar to that described in Labrosse et al. [2007] where the ULVZ are iron rich and very fusible remnants of a primordial basal ocean. \nWe also present the development of a multiphase convection code accounting for solid-liquid phase change, compaction and fractional crystallization. We discuss the effects of various temperature profiles and solid liquid density crossovers on the dynamics of a crystallizing mantle. Using this mechanical model, we also investigate the dynamics of upper mantle overturn following magma ocean crystallization. Indeed, current models of magma ocean evolution predict that fractional crystallization of the mantle leads to unstable chemical stratification of the upper mantle.",

To investigate the dependence of bacteria on particles in the air, we enumerated bacterial cells in size-segregated airborne particle samples that were collected at a rural seaside site on the southwestern coast of Japan during dust and non-dust periods in the spring of 2013–2014. Proportion of particle-attached bacteria was 75–84% of total airborne bacterial concentration during dust periods and 27–76% during non-dust periods, both of which were equal to approximately 12% of >1 µm aerosol particle concentrations. The concentration of particle-attached bacteria was 3.2 times higher during dust periods, compared with that during non-dust periods. The viability, which is referring to the ratio of viable cells to total cells, of particle-attached bacteria was 33–82% during dust periods and 45–98% during non-dust periods. The predominance of particle-associated viable/non-viable bacteria during dust periods demonstrates a potential of bacteria to cooperate with dust in influencing the climate, ecosystems, and health where they arrive.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zones are dynamic convergent plate boundaries associated with arc volcanism and earthquakes, which are believed to be controlled by fluids released during devolatilization reactions from the downgoing slab. The high-pressure breakdown of antigorite serpentinite to prograde chlorite-harzburgite is considered to be the most significant source of water in subduction zones. The Cerro del Almirez ultramafic massif (Betic Cordillera, SE Spain) is a unique exhumed subduction terrane that preserves this dehydration reaction as a sharp front. Chl-harzburgite in this massif displays two differentiated textures–granofels and spinifex-like– indicating that antigorite breakdown occurred at different overstepping of the dehydration reaction. Detailed mapping of textural variations in chl-harzburgite unveils a network of granofels and spinifex-like lenses. These lenses have triaxial ellipsoid shapes with average axial ratios of 16:7:1 and 19:8:1, respectively, with the shorter axis nearly perpendicular to the serpentine-out isograd, and the longest axis ranging from 23 to 190 meters. We calculated the volume of water release per lens using the modal amount of olivine according to the model reaction 1Atg = 4Clin + 6Fo + 6En + 15H2O. The growth time and water flux per lens was computed using experimental olivine growth rates for granular and dendritic, spinifex-like olivine. Preliminary results show that formation of spinifex and granofels lenses imply temporal variations of the volumetric water fluxes ranging from 0.12 to 0.02 m3m-2yr-1, respectively. If the time of formation of lenses is inversely proportional to its relative distance to the dehydration front, the 52m thick, chl-harzburgite lens network in Almirez records ca. 315 yrs of antigorite dehydration. Our results show that antigorite dehydration in subduction zones occurs in a highly non-steady regime with yearly to decadal variations of water fluxes that record variations in the dynamics of slab and fluid expulsion mechanisms.",

The aim of the current study is to analyze spatio-temporal soil moisture patterns of 11 datasets from the Rur catchment (Western Germany) with a total area of 2364 km2, consisting of a low mountain range (forest and grassland) and a loess plain dominated by arable land. Data was acquired across a variety of land use types, on different spatial scales (plot to mesoscale catchment) and with different methods (field measurements, remote sensing, and modelling).\nIn a geostatistical analysis we found three main groups of sill and range values of the theoretical variogram with similar characteristics in the autocorrelation structure: (i) modelled and measured datasets from a forest sub-catchment (influenced by soil properties and topography), (ii) remotely sensed datasets from the cropped part of the total catchment (influenced by the land-use structure of the cropped area), and (iii) modelled datasets from the cropped part of the Rur catchment (influenced by large scale variability of soil properties).\nThe fractal analysis revealed that all analyzed soil moisture patterns show a multi-fractal behavior (varying fractal dimensions, that are only self-similar over certain ranges of scales), with at least one scale break and generally high fractal dimensions (high spatial variability). Corresponding scale breaks were found in various datasets and the factors explaining these scale breaks are consistent with the findings of the geostatistical analysis.\nThe joined analysis of the different datasets showed that small differences in soil moisture dynamics, especially at maximum porosity and wilting point in the soils, can have a large influence on the soil moisture patterns and their autocorrelation structure. Depending on the prevalent type of land use and the time of year, vegetation can cause a decrease or an increase of spatial variability in the soil moisture pattern.",

The aim of the baseline coronal model is to produce realistic plasma conditions at the interface radius r = 0.1 AU between the two models thus providing the necessary input to the time-dependent, three-dimensional MHD heliosphere model. It uses GONG synoptic line-of-sight magnetograms as input for a potential (PFSS) field extrapolation of the low-coronal magnetic field coupled to a current sheet (CS) model of the extended coronal magnetic field. The plasma variables at the interface radius are determined by employing semi-empirical considerations based on the properties of the PFSS+CS field such as the flux tube expansion factor and distance to nearest coronal hole. The heliosphere model computes the time-dependent evolution of the MHD variables from the interface radius typically up to 2 AU. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are injected at the interface radius using a hydrodynamic cone-like model using parameters constrained from fits to coronal imaging observations. In order to account for the modification of the heliosphere due to the presence of earlier CMEs, the standard run scenario includes CMEs launched five days prior to the start of the forecast, while the duration of the forecast extends up to seven days.\nIn addition to presenting results of the modeling, we will highlight our on-going efforts to advance beyond the baseline in the forecasting pipeline. In particular we discuss our path towards using magnetized CMEs, application of a time-dependent coronal model as well as modeling the transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the heliosphere.",

            "abstract": "The meridional transport of heat from the tropics to the poles, where it can be radiated out to space, is a vital component for maintaining the Earth’s climate. Understanding the decadal to multi-decadal changes of these transports provides an insight into the natural variability of the climate system and into the flow of heat into the Arctic. Jacob Bjerknes proposed that the total energy transported by the climate system should remain approximately constant if the ocean heat storage and fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere were unchanging [Bjerknes, 1964]. Since heat is transported by the atmosphere and ocean, any large anomalies in the atmospheric heat transport should be balanced by opposing variations in the ocean heat transport, and vice versa; a process that has since been named Bjerknes Compensation.\nBjerknes compensation has been identified in the 600-year control run of the Bergen Climate Model by examining the anomalies of the implied meridional heat transports in both the ocean and atmosphere (Figure 1). These anomalies show strong anti-correlation (r = -0.72, p ≤ 0.05), and a multi-decadal variability with a period of approximately 60-80 years. Spatial patterns associated with this multi-decadal variability highlight part of the underlying mechanism which occurs through changes in the sea-ice cover in the Arctic, which lead to strong ocean-atmosphere fluxes and the formation of a thermal low that changes the large scale flow over the Northern Hemisphere. The anomalies in atmospheric heat transport are not only found to be well correlated to the anomalies in Arctic sea-ice, but also to the strength of the sub-polar gyre, suggesting a possible feedback of the atmosphere to the ocean on multi-decadal timescales. Bjerknes Compensation has also been identified in the NorESM model, a member of the CMIP5 archive.\nFigure 1: Meridional heat transport anomalies at 67N in the atmosphere (solid) and ocean (dashed), for the 600 year control run of the Bergen Climate Model.

            "abstract": "A new cloud-resolving model setup for studying aerosol-cloud interactions, with a special emphasis on partitioning and wet deposition of semi-volatile aerosol species, is presented. The model is based on modified versions of two well-established model components: the Large-Eddy Simulator (LES) UCLALES, and the sectional aerosol model SALSA, previously employed in the ECHAM climate model family.\nImplementation of the UCLALES-SALSA is described in detail. As the basis for this work, SALSA has been extended to include a sectional representation of the size distributions of cloud droplets and precipitation. Microphysical processes operating on clouds and precipitation have also been added. Given our main motivation, the cloud droplet size bins are defined according to the dry particle diameter. The droplet wet diameter is solved dynamically through condensation equations, but represents an average droplet diameter inside each size bin. This approach allows for accurate tracking of the aerosol properties inside clouds, but minimizes the computational cost. Since the actual cloud droplet diameter is not fully resolved inside the size bins, processes such as precipitation formation rely on parameterizations. For realistic growth of drizzle drops to rain, which is critical for the aerosol wet deposition, the precipitation size bins are defined according to the actual drop size. With these additions, the implementation of the SALSA model replaces most of the microphysical and thermodynamical components within the LES.\nThe cloud properties and aerosol-cloud interactions simulated by the model are analysed and evaluated against detailed cloud microphysical boxmodel results and in-situ aerosol-cloud interaction observations from the Puijo measurement station in Kuopio, Finland. The ability of the model to reproduce the impacts of wet deposition on the aerosol population is demonstrated.",

            "abstract": "Rockfall activity in steep alpine landscapes is often difficult to survey due to its infrequent nature. Classical approaches are limited by temporal and spatial resolution. In contrast, seismic monitoring provides access to catchment-wide analysis of activity patterns in rockfall-dominated environments. The deglaciated U-shaped Lauterbrunnen Valley in the Bernese Oberland, Switzerland, is a perfect example of such landscapes. It was instrumented with up to six broadband seismometers (capable of detecting volumes down to individual clasts) and repeatedly surveyed by terrestrial LiDAR (few weeks lapse time) to provide independent validation of the seismic data. During August-October 2014 and April-June 2015 more than 23 (LiDAR) to hundred (seismic) rockfall and icefall events were detected. Their volumes range from 0.1 to 5.80 m3 as detected by LiDAR. At the beginning of April 2015, increased activity was detected with more than 40 ice- or rockfalls in less than two hours. The evolution of these individual events (i.e., precursor activity, detachment, falling phase, impact, talus cone activity) is quantified in terms of location (within less than 200 m uncertainty) and duration. For events that consist of single detachments rather than a series of releases, volume scaling relationships are presented. Rockfall activity is linked to meteorological patterns at different temporal cycles. Seismic monitoring approaches are well-suited for studying not only the rockfall process but also for understanding the geomorphic framework and boundary conditions that control such processes in a comprehensive way. Taken together, the combined LiDAR and seismic monitoring approach provides high fidelity spatial and temporal resolution of individual events.",

            "abstract": "Water temperature plays an important role in stream ecosystem functioning; however, water temperature dynamics in high Arctic environments have received relatively little attention. Given that global climate is predicted to change most at high latitudes, it is vital we broaden our knowledge of space-time variability in Arctic river temperature to understand controlling processes and potential consequences of climate change.\nTo address this gap, our research aims: (1) to characterise seasonal and diel patterns of variability over three summer and two winter seasons with contrasting hydrometeorological conditions, (2) to unravel the key drivers influencing thermal regimes and (3) to place these results in the context of other snow/ glacier-melt dominated environments.\nFieldwork was undertaken in July-September 2013, 2014 and 2015 close to the Zackenberg Research Station in Northeast Greenland - an area of continuous permafrost with a mean July air temperature of 6 °C. Five streams were chosen that drain different water source contributions (glacier melt, snow melt, groundwater). Data were collected at 30 minute intervals using micro-dataloggers. Air temperature data were collected within 7km by the Greenland Survey.\n Weather conditions were highly variable between field campaigns, with 2013 experiencing below average, and 2014 and 2015 above average, snowfall. Summer water temperatures appear to be high in comparison to some Arctic streams in Alaska and in Svalbard. Winter snowfall extent decreases stream water temperature; and water temperature increases with atmospheric exposure time (distance from source) – illustrating the intertwined controls of water and heat fluxes. These Greenland streams are most strongly influenced by snowmelt, but groundwater contributions could increase with a changing climate due to increased active layer thickness, which may result in increased river temperature with implications for aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",

The contamination level and air-dose rate behavior at present and in future are significant concern for the people used to live nearby. Most dominant radioactive material is 137Cs at present and its migration is considered to be driven by soil erosion and subsequent transport. To estimate the amount of soil sedimentation and the 137Cs migration, a three-dimensional hydrological model of the catchment was developed focused on the Ogi-no-sawa catchment, located 15 km southwest of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant. Base on the developed hydrological model, top soil transport and resulting radio-cesium movement was simulated. For the modeling and simulation, physics based code the General-purpose terrestrial fluid-flow simulator GETFLOWS model, which is one of the tools for watershed modeling, was applied. The simulation results were compared with monitored data of the amount of water discharge and concentration of suspended solids for model testing. As a result of the study, the soil and 137Cs redistribution patterns at various scales of flood events could be predicted based on the results of modeling and simulation.",

            "abstract": "Six analogue models were systematically run on real geological conditions to evaluate whether the Wulagen paleo-uplift controlled the deformation in the Wupoer fold-and-thrust belt, NE Pamir. Our analogue results demonstrate that in a fold-and-thrust belt where paleo-uplift is covered by a ductile décollement such as a gypsum layer, the paleo-topography of paleo-uplift plays an important role in the deformation mechanism. The results indicate that the front thrust fault slides along the ductile décollement and thrusts upwards preferentially to the surface in the foreland area where the paleo-uplift exits, forming a piggyback basin in the hanging wall. The results also suggest that the distribution range of the paleo-uplift is an influential factor in the formation of an arc-shaped fold-and-thrust belt. The laterally inhomogenous distribution of the paleo-uplift in the foreland area indicates that, the front thrust fault would be initially thrust to the surface on the same side as paleo-uplift occurrence and then gradually propagate towards the side without paleo-uplift occurrence, resulting in an arc-shaped distribution of a fold-and-thrust belt. This kinematic process is the cause of the vertical displacement of the front thrust fault in the area with paleo-uplift occurrence was much greater compared with the area where paleo-uplift was absent. Based on the analysis of experimental results, we suspect that the deformation of the Wupoer fold-and-thrust belt is largely controlled by the Wulagen paleo-uplift located in the NW of the thrust belt. Our finding suggest that the front thrust fault of the belt, the Pamir Front Thrust (PFT), developed preferentially in the western area with the Wulagen paleo-uplift and then propagated towards the east, forming an arc-shaped fold-and-thrust belt. The vertical displacement of the western part of the PFT was larger than that of the eastern part, resulting in the western part being thrust to the surface, while the eastern part became concealed underground.",

Two Class A evaporation pans, one in the original galvanized metal color and the other painted white, are placed in the same meteorological station for eighteen months. Since the wind speed, air temperature and vapor pressure deficit are the same for both pans, the color and the resulting net radiation are the only causes for the difference in the evaporation rate. The results reveal that the average net radiation of the white pan is about 90% that of the metal-colored pan. This leads to the annual evaporation rate of the white pan (1041 mm/year) being only 75% of the evaporation rate (1392 mm/year) of the metal-colored pan. In addition, the prediction error of the daily evaporation rates by the energy budget method is lower than that of the Penman-Monteith type models. The differences between the measured evaporation rates of the two pans are analyzed to examine the role of irradiance on the pan evaporation rate. The results indicate that the irradiance absorbed by the pan wall can affect the energy budget and evaporation rate of the pan.",

The seasonal variations of hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of groundwaters (δ18O=-5.9 ‰, δD= -28.4‰) are significant different from that of surface water. This indicates that it takes a significant period of time to have the rain water mixed with groundwater. The main recharge season of groundwater in the northern Cising Mountain is winter while summer is the main recharge season of groundwater in the south of the mountain. Therefore the isotope composition of groundwater in northern watershed are generally more enriched than that of the southern watershed.",

            "abstract": "To assess the accuracy of remote sensing product (RSP) requires well designed and carefully implemented validation effort. However, validation is not a straightforward task. On the contrary, it is generally recognized as a challenging issue due to the inconsistence of resolutions and extents associated with various products, strong spatial and temporal variations of surface parameters and, the essential heterogeneity of land surfaces. Thus, to develop, design and conduct reasonable validation schemes and activities to acquire ground truth at pixel scale over heterogeneous land surfaces is\nurgently needed. This contains,\nfrom the perspective of measurement, to integrate various ground observations collected at multi-scale, in order to validating different RSPs from site to network, especially for those land surface variables with strong spatial-temporal variations. To this end, a dedicated validation initiative has been launched in China since 2011. The main scientific objectives and research contents of this project are to develop mathematical approaches for in situ sampling design to acquire ground truth at pixel scale over heterogeneous land surfaces, to form a series of recognized and practicable technical\nspecifications to guide users to validate various RSPs, and to establish a prototype of national validation network and a RSP evaluation system. Specific validation activities, such as the HiWATER, were conducted from site to network, through multi-scale observations collected from multi-platform and multi-source, to experimentally examine those proposed methodologies and guidelines. Corresponding research outcomes on the development of sampling design, scale method and validation of land surface variables have already yielded. This enables validation efforts to be more effective for heterogeneous land surfaces and applicable for other validation tasks beyond local and regional scale. Following the experience of these validation exercises, we are coordinating a Chinese validation network to use standardized and recognized technical specifications in implementing future validation attempts, aiming to extend validation exercises from point scale to regional scale and to national scale across different zones.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forest conversion to agricultural land leads to strong decrease of soil organic matter (SOM). Nonetheless, the magnitude of SOM losses and their impacts on soil fertility in oil palm and rubber plantations remain unclear, despite the large scale extension of such land-use types. We quantified SOM losses, and estimated soil erosion and changes in SOM turnover using SOM δ13C values in forest, oil palm plantations, extensive rubber plantations and rubber monocultures on Sumatra Island (Indonesia). Further, we assessed the response of biological (basal respiration, microbial biomass, acid phosphatase) and chemical fertility indicators (light fraction, DOC, total N, available P) to SOM losses. We used a new approach based on (non-)linear regressions between SOM losses and the indices standardized to natural ecosystem. Carbon contents in the Ah horizon under oil palm and rubber plantations were strongly reduced: up to 70% and 62%, respectively. The decrease was lower under extensive rubber (41%). The estimated erosion was the strongest in oil palm (35±8 cm) and rubber (33±10 cm) plantations. The SOM 13C enrichment used as a proxy of its turnover indicates a decrease of SOM turnover under oil palm after forest conversion. The negative impact of land-use changes on all measured indicators increased in the following sequence: forest > extensive rubber > rubber > oil palm. The basal respiration, microbial biomass and nutrients were comparatively resistant to SOM losses, whereas the light fraction was lost faster than the SOM. The resistance of the microbial activity to SOM losses is an indication that the microbial functions sustain SOM losses. However, responses of basal respiration and microbial biomass to SOM losses were non-linear. Below 2.7 % C content, the relationship was reversed. The basal respiration decreased faster than the SOM, resulting in a stronger drop of microbial activity under oil palm compared to rubber despite small difference in C content. We conclude that the new approach allows a quantitative assessment of the sensitivity and threshold of various soil functions to land-use changes and consequently, can be used to assess resilience of agroecosystem of gradual use intensity.",

            "abstract": "In traditional methods of pipeline leak location, geophones must be located on the pipe wall. If the exact location of the pipeline is unknown, the leaks cannot be identified accurately. To solve this problem, taking into account the characteristics of the pipeline leak, we propose a continuous random seismic source model and construct geological models to investigate the proposed method for locating underground pipeline leaks. Based on two dimensional (2D) viscoacoustic equations and the staggered grid finite-difference (FD) algorithm, the microseismic wave field generated by a leaking pipe is modeled. Cross-correlation analysis and the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm were utilized to obtain the time difference and the leak location. We also analyze and discuss the effect of the number of recorded traces, the survey layout, and the offset and interval of the traces on the accuracy of the estimated location. The preliminary results of the simulation and data field experiment indicate that (1) a continuous random source can realistically represent the leak microseismic wave field in a simulation using 2D visco-acoustic equations and a staggered grid FD algorithm. (2) The cross-correlation method is effective for calculating the time difference of the direct wave relative to the reference trace. However, outside the refraction blind zone, the accuracy of the time difference is reduced by the effects of the refracted wave. (3) The acquisition method of time difference based on the microseismic theory and SA algorithm has a great potential for locating leaks from underground pipelines from an array located on the ground surface.\nKeywords: Viscoacoustic finite-difference simulation; continuous random source; simulated annealing algorithm; pipeline leak location",

            "abstract": "Since 1999 Chinese government has invested more than 800 million Yuan to reforest the southern and the northern mountains surrounding urban Lanzhou - a typical semi-arid city located in a river valley, Northwestern China. Until 2009 obvious land use change occurred, with 69.2% of the reforested area been changed from grasslands, croplands, barren or sparsely vegetated land to closed shrublands and 20.6% been changed from closed shrublands, grasslands, and croplands to forests. This study assesses the impact of these changes on local climate and environment in winter using WRF (Weather Research & Forecasting) model incorporated with high-resolution remotely sensed land cover data for 1999 and 2009 and the FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART) dispersion model. Results indicate that the changes in albedo, surface exchange coefficient and surface soil heat conductivity related to the reforestation led to the changes in surface net radiation and the surface energy partitioning, which in turn affected the meteorology fields and enhanced the mountain-valley wind circulation. The amount of air exchanged between the valley and the outside increased after reforestation during the day, with the largest increase of 10 %, while it changed little during the night on winter sunny day with no snow cover. The sensitivity analysis using FLEXPART-WRF model indicates that the reforestation affected the spatial distribution of pollutants and slightly improved the urban air quality in winter. And the greening program of Lanzhou has special reference to other valley urbans.",

            "abstract": "The isotopic composition of nitrous oxide (N2O) provides important information on N2O sources, because microbial processes exhibit characteristic isotopic signatures [\n1\n]. Therefore, quasi-continuous measurements of ambient N2O concentration and isotopic composition in combination with atmospheric modelling can be used to identify local and regional emission hotspots and disentangle production pathways [\n2\n]. Quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS) in combination with preconcentration allows simultaneous and high-precision analysis of the four main stable N2O isotopologues (14N14N16O, 14N15N16O, 15N14N16O and 14N14N18O) at ambient mixing ratios [\n3\n].\nIn the presented project, we will initiate quasi-continuous measurements of N2O isotopologues at the Beromünster tall tower in Central Switzerland [4]. For the two inlet heights 12 and 212 m, maximum changes in the N2O mixing ratios of 50 and 10 ppb are anticipated, which would result in delta value changes in the order of 3 and 0.6 ‰, assuming a 20 ‰ depletion in delta values for the main source processes. To resolve differences in N2O isotopic composition at the highest inlet the repeatability of delta value measurements has to be improved to < 0.1 ‰. In an ongoing laboratory phase we significantly enhanced the long-term stability of the laser spectrometer by reducing the dependency of cell temperature on ambient temperature changes from 100 mK K-1 to 10 mK K-1. Thereby, the required precision level is maintained for a 10 times longer period, which results in an accuracy of < 0.1‰ for the targeted isotope ratios. In addition, a novel preconcentration device [5] was set up and optimized with respect to temporal resolution. First results from the Beromünster tall tower, which are anticipated for fall 2015, will be presented and followed by atmospheric transport simulations and a biogeochemical soil model developed at IMK-IFU to simulate N2O isotopomer surface fluxes.\n",

Important principles are also valid for science data, such as Open Data by Default, Quality and Quantity, Useable by All, Releasing Data for Improved Governance, Releasing Data for Innovation. There is also an explicit relationship to such areas of high values as earth observation, education and geospatial data. The European union implementation plan of the Open Data Charta identifies among other things objectives such as making data available in an open format, enabling semantic interoperability, ensuring quality, documentation and where appropriate reconciliation across different data sources, implementing software solutionsallowing easy management, publication or visualization of datasets and simplifying clearance of intellectual property rights.Open Science is not just a list of already for a longer time known principles but stands for a lot of initiatives and projects around a better handling of scientific data and openly shared scientific knowledge. It is also about transparency in methodology and collection of data, availability and reuse of scientific data, public accessibility to scientific communication and using of social media to facility scientific collaboration. Some projects are concentrating on open sharing of free and open source software and even further hardware in kind of processing capabilities. In addition question about the mashup of data and publication and an open peer review process are addressed.\nFollowing the principles of open data and open science the newest results of the collaboration efforts in mashing up the data servers related to the Japanese IUGONET, the European Union ESPAS and the GFZ ISDC semantic Web projects will be presented here. The semantic Web based approach for the mashup is focusing on the design and implementation of a common but still distributed data catalog based on semantical interoperability including the transparent access to data in relational data bases.\n",

            "abstract": "In order to predict the effects of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) on Earth, it is important to know the properties of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Of special interest is the southward component (Bz) of the IMF, acting as a main driver for geomagnetic storms. We are working on a proof-of-concept for predicting the strength of geomagnetic storms caused by ICMEs by using in situ data from spacecraft in the inner heliosphere. Our prediction includes the arrival time and speed of the ICME at Earth, the IMF's Bz component and the resulting disturbance storm time index (Dst), which is a prime indicator of geomagnetic activity.\nFor Dst forecasting, the two well established models Burton et al. (1975) and O'Brien & McPherron (2000) are used. Necessary parameters for those models are the ICME speed and the Bz component of the IMF at 1 AU. We obtain the ICME speed using a drag-based model, and the IMF's Bz component is predicted based on a power law from the in situ data. Additionally, the ENLIL/WSA model provides the solar wind background speed for the drag-based model.\nAn advantage of our method is the use of the in situ spacecraft as a reference point for the drag based-model, leading to a more precise arrival speed of the ICME at Earth, and an improved arrival time. Investigation of an ICME in June 2012 shows already very promising results for the Dst index, as well as for the ICME arrival speed. The main advantage of this method is the prediction lead time of ~21 hours compared to only ~40-60 minutes, using an L1 located spacecraft. Furthermore, the feasibility of this method can be studied with any in situ spacecraft temporarily located between the Sun and Earth, like Helios, Solar Orbiter or Solar Probe Plus, and also works for radial spacecraft alignments. The techniques we develop could be routinely applied to a mission that forms an artificial Lagrange point along the Sun-Earth line, e.g. for a Sunjammer or Heliostorm mission.",

A rapid increase of Nd recovery from 0.06 to 23.6 mg g-1 was observed when the solution pH adjusted from 2.01 to 8.18 at 298 K. A maxima Nd adsorption capacity was estimated to be 25.02 mg g-1 at 308 K and 8.18 pH. A negative change in standard free energy (ΔGo = -5.87, -6.69, -7.68 kJ mol-1 at 288, 298, and 308 K, respectively) suggests that Nd adsorption is spontaneous. The positive ΔHo value (2.42 kJ mol-1) supports its endothermic nature of the adsorption and <span\">agrees with the observed enhanced Nd adsorption at high temperatures. Besides, the positive ΔSo (10.84 J mol-1 K-1) displays that the randomness increase at the solid-solution interface during Nd adsorption. More importantly, we observed that the Nd adsorption only decreased slightly while the NaCl ionic strength increased from 0.001 to 1.0 N, implying the involvement of inner-sphere mechanism. These data indicated that the adsorbent of ferrite has a great potential in selective and fast recovery of spiked Nd from seawater matrix.",

            "abstract": "Titanite has great potential as a petrogenetic indicator and mineral geochronometer as it can host high trace element concentrations and it occurs in a wide range of rock types. Here, we describe a potential new titanite standard for calibration of the chemical and isotopic composition of titanite of varying age and origin. Through comprehensive bulk analysis of mm-size crystal fragments and in-situ microanalysis, we show that the titanite, labeled MKED1, is largely free of inclusions and is homogenous at the level of analytical precision for major element, U-Pb isotope and Sm-Nd isotope composition. Some minor zoning in trace element composition is recognized using backscatter electron imaging, although the trace element concentrations of each of these zones are also very homogenous. MKED1 has high contents of REE, Th, U, and radiogenic Pb, but very low levels of common Pb. U-Pb isotope data (ID-TIMS and LA-ICP-MS) show MKED1 to be concordant with an age of ca. 1518 Ma. Cross calibration with other titanite standards demonstrates that MKED1 can be used as a primary standard for determining U-Pb ages of titanite ranging in age from Precambrian to Neogene. We also show that MKED1 is suitable as a Sm-Nd isotope standard due to its high REE concentrations and homogenous 147Sm/144Nd and 143Nd/144Nd content.\nWe suggest MKED1 can be employed as a trace element, U-Pb isotope and Sm-Nd isotope standard for in situ or bulk analytical methods, including techniques that allow simultaneous collection of multiple elemental and/or isotopic data sets in situ. We present two case studies to demonstrate the potential of titanite analysis for resolving geological problems: The first examines the genesis of Cu-REE skarn mineralization from the Mt Isa Inlier, Australia, and the second study investigates the timing and origin of volcanism and sedimentation in the Western Branch of the East African Rift.",

Therefore, quantitatively studying the impact of the water level on rock resistivity is important to analyze and classify strata, investigate the underground structures. In this research, we proposed a feasible research on building electric property rock formation models with different porosity and water saturation based on theories of two-phase media. The propagation of audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) waves is simulated by using finite-difference (FD) scheme, and theoretic resistivity distribution is calculated on account of the response of AMT. According to a sequence of synthetic examples, through comparing and analyzing the simulated results with various porosity and water saturation respectively, we discuss the impact on layers resistivity while porosity and water saturation of rock stratum are changing. The results shows the extent that the mentioned factors can have impact on the propagation of AMT waves.\nKey words: audio-magnetotelluric modeling, two-phase media, porosity, water saturation, finite-difference",

It reveals that the surface fluxes and radiative heating contribute to the maintenance of the amplitude of column-integrated MSE anomaly, and thus to the intensity of the MJO. The vertical and horizontal advection terms contribute to the phase progression and possibly eastward propagation of MJO. The contribution of the vertical advection is mainly due to lower-tropospheric decent after the precipitation and MSE maxima, presumably associated with rain re-evaporation, while that of the horizontal advection is due to so-called dry intrusion.\nWe also argue impact of several assumptions used in recent idealized models of the MJO on the MSE budget. The assumptions we examined include (1) the column-integrated radiative heating anomaly is taken proportional to the column water vapor, and (2) the anomaly in vertical advection of MSE is taken proportional to that of dry static energy (in other words, the normalized gross moist stability is taken constant). We demonstrate that the assumption 1 tends to speed up the phase progression, while the assumption 2 tends to slow it down.",

Crack patterns can be observed at multi-scales from millimeters in rocks to several kilometers on planetary surface. The mechanisms of cracking usually result from differential shrinkage stress (due to a drying process or temperature change). A large variety of crack morphologies is involved depending on both the microstructure and the thickness of the layer : crack can form isolated junctions or interact each other. In last case cracks can divide the plane hierarchically leading to broken or connected network of cracks, or grow in-depth resulting in the well ordered basalt columns. In particular, crack patterns strongly depend on both the mechanical properties and the thickness of the layer.\nTo understand the physical process involved, the geometrical characteristics of the crack pattern (crack spacing, crack aperture or crack depth) are analyzed by laboratory testing procedures. In this way, crack patterns can be modeled by the drying layers of aqueous suspensions of nanoparticles (silica particles). During the drying process, advection towards the evaporation surface accumulates particles and leads to a porous structure filled of water. The mechanical properties of the layer are related to the structure of the layer and are measured using indentation testing. Depending on the accumulation rate, solid layers exhibit non-homogeneous mechanical properties in depth. This affect the crack formation and stability of crack propagation.",

Dependencies of an effective pressure Pe on a fracture permeability should be examined, because Pe conditions of mudstone layers may change in some cases such as tectonic subsidence and uplifting, or CO2 injection at geological storage processes. The purpose of this study is to reveal how a fracture permeability in mudstone changes at Pe increasing and decreasing processes, and how the features depend on yield stress condition of the rock. This study conducted water permeability tests with Neogene-Quaternary siltstones from the Kazusa Group, Japan; siltstones from the Ohara Formation (OHR3) and the Kiwada Formation (KWD2), of which the yield stress conditions are different from each other. A tensile fracture was artificially made in these cylinder rock specimens, and permeability was measured under several Pe compression-and-decompression cycles with increasing the maximum Pe (2-21 MPa).\nAll results had two characteristic Pe cycles; a cycle at which differences in permeability between process of compression and decompression become clear (a cycle Y), and a cycle at which the permeability becomes almost the same as the intact rock permeability (a cycle C). The maximum Pe of the cycles C is 5-9 MPa for OHR3 and 17-21 MPa for KWD2, and the maximum Pe of the cycles Y is 5 MPa for OHR3 and 3-9 MPa for KWD2. The maximum Pe conditions for the cycles C almost equal the yield conditions of the intact rocks obtained by isotropic compressional test. While, the cycles Y tend to appear lower pressure conditions than the yield conditions of the intact rocks, which may be because stress at real contact areas is larger than Pe: that is, conditions for fracture closure depend on the yield condition of rock, while conditions for initiation of fracture surface yielding also depend on conditions of fracture occlusion.",

            "abstract": "The problem of streamflow age has received increased interest in watershed studies, particularly where surface waters have been monitored to provide accurate measures of mass fluxes released by catchments. Discharge, however, is just one of the two main catchment exits and evapotranspiration can easily account for a major part of the water balance, especially during the warm seasons. While a large body of literature deals with the travel time distributions of discharge waters, few studies explicitly addressed the problem of the age of evapotranspiration and its impact on the catchment-scale mass balance. Several modeling tools can be used to hypothesize how plants remove water of different ages from the catchment storage, but the difficulty of collecting representative samples is still a challenge to the validation of such hypotheses. Here, we illustrate different modeling assumptions on the “age selection” mechanisms that may be expected from vegetation, and we present experimental results from a large vegetated lysimeter.",

            "abstract": "Foliar nitrogen is a critical factor for plant growth, and plays an important role in terrestrial ecosystem processes. Hyperspectral remote sensing serves as an effective tool for estimating foliar nitrogen using a variety of empirical techniques. Vegetation indices (VIs) are the most popular and simplest means of retrieving nitrogen, however, limited test has been performed over a mixed forest including both broadleaf and needle leaf species. This study tested the performance of 26 commonly used vegetation indices for estimating foliar nitrogen using airborne hyperspectral data. The vegetation indices were divided into four categories: pigment-related, physiological, structural and nitrogen-related indices. Broadleaf, coniferous and mixed stands were chosen for representing different species and canopy structure. Results showed that the Boochs2 index gave the most accurate estimation of foliar nitrogen (RCV2 = 0.78, RMSECV = 0.22). Comparable estimation accuracy was obtained by a nitrogen-related index NDNI (RCV2 = 0.76, RMSECV = 0.23). The best performing VIs provided consistent results for the sub plots of LAI between 3 and 4, which minimized the variation of canopy structure. Our findings indicated the feasibility of hyperspectral vegetation indices of foliar nitrogen in a mixed forest regardless of the canopy structure effects.",

            "abstract": "The University of Houston is in the process of developing a flexible program that offers children an in-depth educational experience culminating in the design and construction of their own model Mars rover. The program is called the Mars Rover Model Celebration (MRC). It focuses on students, teachers in grades 3-8. Students design and build a model of a Mars rover to carry out a student selected science mission on Mars. A total of 195 Mars Rover teachers from the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015 cohorts were invited to complete the Mars Rover Teacher Evaluation Survey. The survey was administered online and could be taken at the convenience of the participant. A total of 1300 students from the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 cohort wereinvited to submit self-assessments of their participation in the program. Teachers were asked to rate their current level of confidence in their ability to teach specific topics within the Earth and Life Science realms, as well as their confidence in their ability to implement teaching strategies with their students. The majority of teachers (81-90%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively teach concepts related to earth and life sciences to their students. In addition, many of the teachers felt that their confidence in teaching these concepts increased somewhat to quite a bit as a result of their participation in the MRC program (54-88%). The most striking increase in this area was the reported 48% of teachers who felt their confidence in teaching “Earth and the solar system and universe” increased “Quite a bit” as a result of their participation in the MRC program. The vast majority of teachers (86-100%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively implement all of the listed teaching strategies. The most striking increases were the percentage of teachers who felt their confidence increased “Quite a bit” as a result of their participation in the MRC program in the following areas: “Getting students interested in and curious about science” (63%); “Teaching science as a co-inquirer with students” (56%); and “Continually find better ways to teach science” (59%). A key finding is that 354/365 responding students in the 2014-2015 cohort report substantial increase in science excitement owing to participation in the program.",

            "abstract": "To reduce the vulnerability of the surface water supply system from extreme drought, groundwater withdrawal has always been considered as an additional source for water supply. Since surface water process and groundwater are inter-connected, groundwater withdrawal reduces the amount of streamflow resulting in depletion downstream. Hence, a conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater resources is important to support the sustainable use of water resources. We propose a modeling framework that captures the conjunctive management on surface and groundwater resources for promoting freshwater sustainability.\nA fully coupled hydrologic model, Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), has been applied to assess the effects of groundwater pumping on streamflow. The impact of groundwater pumping on streamflow during historic drought events has been evaluated to quantify the resiliency and vulnerability of the target watershed, the Haw (located in NC) and Verde River basin (located in AZ). Further, the groundwater pumping model is combined with a reservoir, Lake Jordan, model for developing optimal pumping strategies during droughts. The proposed conjunctive management model could also be used for assessing instream water quality due to pumping in local watersheds",

            "abstract": "Subsurface environments span the planet but remain little understood from the perspective of the capacity of the resident organisms to fix CO2. Here we investigated the autotrophic capacity of microbial communities in range of a high-CO2 subsurface environments via analysis of 250 near-complete microbial genomes (151 of them from distinct species) that represent the most abundant organisms over a subsurface depth transect. More than one third of the genomes belonged to the so-called candidate phyla radiation (CPR), which have limited metabolic capabilities. Approximately 30% of the community members are autotrophs that comprise 70% of the microbiome with metabolism likely supported by sulfur and nitrogen respiration. Of the carbon fixation pathways, the Calvin Benson Basham Cycle was most common, but the Wood-Ljungdhal pathway was present in the greatest phylogenetic diversity of organisms. Unexpectedly, one organism from a novel phylum sibling to the CPR is predicted to fix carbon by the reverse TCA cycle. The genome of the most abundant organism, an archaeon designated “Candidatus Altiarchaeum hamiconexum”, was also found in subsurface samples from other continents including Europe and Asia. The archaeon was proven to be a carbon fixer using a novel reductive acetyl-CoA pathway. These results provide evidence that carbon dioxide is the major carbon source in these environments and suggest that autotrophy in the subsurface represents a substantial carbon dioxide sink affecting the global carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "The redistribution of the ocean’s heat content generated by internal variability likely plays an important role for the observed slowdown in the rate of global warming since 1998. So far, the importance of the Equatorial Pacific was highlighted, with periods of frequent and/or intense La Niña phases having been identified as periods of intensified ocean heat uptake, keeping the rate of global mean warming low. Here we challenge this view by examining changes in the oceanic heat and carbon content during periods with particularly low (and high) trends in global mean surface temperature (GMST) in a 30-member ensemble simulation with the coupled carbon-climate Earth System Model GFDL ESM2M under a historical/RCP8.5 scenario over 1950-2100.\nBetween 2005 and 2024, we identified 41 (out of 330 possible) hiati, i.e., running decades with a linear decadal GMST trend of zero or lower. While decadal hiati are relatively frequent in our ensemble, the probability of a hiatus lasting 15 years or longer is only 2%. During an average hiatus event, only 37% of the global vertical heat redistribution in the ocean above 110m occurs in the Equatorial Pacific between 20°N and 20°S caused by increased upwelling associated with stronger trade winds. While the Atlantic north of 30°S contributes another 30% to the global anomaly in ocean heat content above 110m, the heat anomaly in the upper 110m of the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean is small. Many individual hiati are even less dominated by the Tropical Pacific than the average hiatus: In 4 out of 41 Hiatus decades, the SST anomaly in the ENSO3.4 region is zero or positive. This finding challenges the popular view of the Equatorial Pacific being the single most important region and indicates that the surface warming pattern may be very different during future Hiatus decades. The changes in ocean carbon uptake and content and similarities to ocean heat content changes during Hiatus periods will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The removal of pollutants and greenhouse gases in the troposphere is dominated by reactions with the hydroxyl radical (OH), which is closely coupled to the hydroperoxy radical (HO2). Comparisons of the levels of OH and HO2 observed during field campaigns to the results of detailed chemical box models serve as a vital tool to assess our understanding of the underlying chemical mechanisms involved in tropospheric oxidation. Recent measurements of OH and HO2 radicals are significantly higher than those predicted by models for some instruments measuring in certain environments, especially those influenced by high emissions of biogenic compounds such as isoprene, prompting intense laboratory research to account for such discrepancies. While current chemical mechanisms are likely incomplete, it is also possible that, at least in part, these elevated radical observations have been influenced by instrumental biases from interfering species.\nRecent studies have suggested that fluorescence assay by gas expansion (FAGE) instruments may be susceptible to an unknown interference in the measurement of OH. This hypothesis can be tested through the implementation of an alternative method to determine the OH background signal, whereby OH is removed by the addition of a chemical scavenger prior to sampling by FAGE. The Leeds FAGE instrument was modified to facilitate this method by the construction of an inlet pre-injector (IPI), where OH is removed through reaction with propane. The modified Leeds FAGE instrument was deployed at a coastal location in southeast England during summer 2015 as part of the ICOZA (Integrated Chemistry of OZone in the Atmosphere) project. Measurements of OH made using both background methods will be presented, alongside results from laboratory characterisation experiments and details of the IPI design.",

Four warm periods (ad 650–750, ad 1000–1100, ad 1190–1290, and ad 1900–2000) and five cold periods (ad 440–540, ad 780–920, ad 1390–1460, ad 1600–1700, and ad 1800–1900) were selected on a centennial timescale, referring to the synthesized temperature changes over China and Northern Hemisphere. The regional differences in precipitation were analyzed and compared using a data set consisting of the grades in severity of floods and droughts as derived from Chinese historical documents. The results showed that there has been no fixed spatial pattern of precipitation anomalies during either cold or warm periods in eastern China over the past 2000 years. For the most of warm periods, there existed coherence of spatial pattern with dry condition only occurred over north of the Yangtze River, and the consistent spatial patterns were found between the periods 650-750 and 1190-1290, 650-750 and 1000-1100. For the cold periods, the precipitation showed various spatial patterns, and similarities were only presented in the two periods of 1600-1700 and 1800-1900 featured by meridional distribution. Comparing the spatial patterns between cold and warm periods, inverse pattern of 440-540 and 1900-2000 over the most study area can be detected, but similar pattern was also found between the periods 1800-1900 and 1900-2000, and 1600-1700 and 1900-2000. Our results implicated that the relationship between temperature and spatial pattern of precipitation anomaly has high complexity, which would be of significance to understanding the spatial pattern of precipitation in the future climate change study.",

This has been attributed to the ingress of meteoric water, which oxidizes sulfide, removing sulfur as soluble sulfate, while volatilizing Os to its more mobile OsO4 form[1].\nSelenium is considered to be less mobile than S under oxidizing conditions[2]. This assumption was challenged recently when peridotite xenoliths from Kilbourne Hole were analysed for bulk-rock PGE-S-Se-Te-Re abundances[3]. The sulfides they contained had clearly experienced varying degrees of oxidation to Fe-oxyhydroxides, but yielded chondritic bulk-rock Se/S, consistent with values found in massif peridotites. This requires that Se is mobile during supergene weathering, otherwise supra-chondritic Se/S would be generated.\nHere, we present the results of a LA-ICP-MS investigation into the highly siderophile element (HSE) and chalcophile element abundances of ca. 20 BMS grains from one of the same Kilbourne Hole xenoliths of the former bulk-rock study[3]. Osmium abundance and Os/Ir (where not fractionated by high temperature processes involving sulfide) are well correlated with both Se and S across a wide range of oxidation. Other platinum group elements (Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd) show no obvious signs of mobility with decreasing S (or Se) abundance. The positive co-variation between S and Se for a wide range of S abundance adds credence to the theory that Se may also be mobile during the oxidative breakdown of peridotite- hosted sulfides. Using Se as a proxy for S abundance in peridotite xenoliths should therefore be used with care. Moreover, the attribution of chondritic Se/S in peridotites to bulk-earth compositions may not preclude the loss of both S and Se resulting from sulfide weathering.\nRefs: [1]Lorand et al.

            "abstract": "Our knowledge about the melting properties of the shallow Earth's mantle is based on few high-pressure experiments performed using the cook-and-look technique. It provided major informations, including reliable solid-liquid partition coefficients for a number of elements. This technique, however, has major drawbacks. One of them is a poor sensibility to low degrees of partial melting, because small pockets of melt can be extremely difficult to evidence, if not impossible, due to melt recrystallization in quenched samples. For this reason, we studied the melting properties of a chondritic mantle in situ in the multi-anvil press, by (i) X-ray diffraction and (ii) electrical conductivity, at pressures up to 30 GPa, which corresponds to ~800 km depth. Both techniques allow detection of small degrees of partial melting and the monitoring of the melting behaviour during the experiments. Both types of measurement suggest that previous studies overestimated by ~300 K the solidus temperature.\nThere are two major implications for such a low solidus temperature at upper mantle P-T conditions. The first concerns the crystallisation processes in the early magma ocean. Upon decrease with time of the surface potential temperature, due to magma-ocean cooling, partial melting has remained a dominant process in the upper mantle until a thick solid-crust could dump the temperature profile significantly below mantle adiabat at depth as deep as a couple hundred kilometres below the Earth's surface. A second implication concerns the current mantle state. Seismic observations highlighted the presence of low velocity zones atop the 410 km discontinuity. These regions show significant reduction in shear wave velocity, compatible with the presence of partial melting. We combined our new solidus curve with the expected melting temperature depletion due to water, in order to discuss the presence and role of water in the asthenosphere. Our wet melting curves happen to be well compatible with the depth of the seismic anomalies, for a water content of 400-800 ppm in the upper mantle",

            "abstract": "In some environments, models of atmospheric chemistry calculate values of ambient OH concentrations that reasonably (within a factor of 2) agree with measured OH concentrations. However, it has been found in forested environments (low [NOx], high [BVOC]) that models have been less successful in calculating OH concentrations, with measured to modeled ratios of up to 10 reported. Enhanced measured to modelled OH concentrations (a factor of 4) have also been observed in more anthropogenically influenced environments with low concentrations of NOx. These discrepancies suggest the presence of an unknown source of OH. Two candidates for this source are the production of OH following the fast isomerization of organic peroxy (RO2) radicals and the reaction of RO2 with hydroperoxy radicals.\nThe photolysis of RO2 radicals at ambient wavelengths to yield OH is another possible source of OH that has not been investigated. This process can be quantified by the absorption cross-section of RO2 radicals for OH production (σRO2, OH), which is the product of the total absorption cross-section and the quantum yield of OH. In experiments using a three-laser flash photolysis setup, we have measured σRO2, OH for RO2 derived from isoprene, ethylene, and methacrolein at wavelengths in the near UV (λ=300–360 nm). The measured values of σRO2, OH (ranging from 0.05–1.00 x 10-19 cm-2) over this wavelength range suggest that RO2 photolysis is a significant pathway for OH production. To determine the impact of the OH production from RO2 photolysis on ambient OH concentrations, OH concentrations were calculated with a box model, constrained to the conditions of the OP-3 field campaign in Borneo, that incorporates RO2 photolysis rates derived from measurements of σRO2, OH. It was found that RO2 photolysis increased OH concentrations by approximately 10% over base model chemistry at midday. Measured values of σRO2, OH and the impact on ambient OH concentrations derived from the modeling will be presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "All across the world information about natural hazards such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunami is shared and communicated using maps that show which locations are potentially exposed to hazards of varying intensities. Unlike earthquakes and tsunami, which typically produce one dominant hazardous phenomenon (ground shaking and inundation, respectively) volcanic eruptions can produce a wide variety of phenomena that range from near-vent (e.g. pyroclastic flows, ground shaking) to distal (e.g. volcanic ash, inundation via tsunami), and that vary in intensity depending on the type and location of the volcano. This complexity poses challenges in depicting volcanic hazard on a map, and to date there has been no consistent approach, with a wide range of hazard maps produced and little evaluation of their relative efficacy. Moreover, in traditional hazard mapping practice, scientists analyse data about a hazard, and then display the results on a map that is then presented to stakeholders. This one-way, top-down approach to hazard communication does not necessarily translate into effective hazard education, or, as tragically demonstrated by Nevado del Ruiz, Columbia in 1985, its use in risk mitigation by civil authorities. Furthermore, messages taken away from a hazard map can be strongly influenced by its visual design. Thus, hazard maps are more likely to be useful, usable and used if relevant stakeholders are engaged during the hazard map process to ensure a) the map is designed in a relevant way and b) the map takes into account how users interpret and read different map features and designs. The IAVCEI Commission on Volcanic Hazards and Risk has recently launched a Hazard Mapping Working Group to collate some of these experiences in graphically depicting volcanic hazard from around the world, including Latin America and the Caribbean, with the aim of preparing some Considerations for Producing Volcanic Hazard Maps that may help map makers in the future.",

            "abstract": "Mineralogy is considered one of the cornerstone subjects of geoscience curriculum. It provides the basic information from which we can understand the composition and behaviour of Earth and planetary materials, yet many students struggle to obtain adequate comprehension and knowledge of mineralogy during tertiary degree programs. Here, I introduce a new card game called “Mineral Supertrumps” that can be used to assist teaching of mineralogy at secondary and tertiary level. The card game is easy to learn and play, and is designed to promote active learning in a group environment. The game involves 3 to 6 people, and is similar to the “Top Trumps™” card games. The pack consists of 54 mineral cards, and 6 supertrump cards. Each mineral card includes information about the mineral such as the generic chemical formula, the classification, crystal system, the geological environment where the mineral is commonly found or formed, as well as information in the five playing categories (or trumps) of Hardness, Specific Gravity, Cleavage, Crustal Abundance, and Economic Value. The first three playing categories relate to distinct physical properties of the mineral, while last two categories rate the importance of the mineral in terms of abundance in the Earth’s crust and value to modern societies.\nResults of a formal evaluation of the game by students in the second year of a tertiary geology program indicate that the game has clear benefits for learning about mineralogy. The majority of students enjoyed playing the game and considered it to be effective for enhancing learning about mineral properties and their application to other Earth Science disciplines. Therefore, inclusion of “Mineral Supertrumps” into Earth Science curriculum at secondary or tertiary level has the potential to redress the difficulties students face in learning of mineralogy, while requiring little to no adjustment to existing teaching programs.",

Coordination of the configuration of three Swarm spacecraft configurations with the constellation of the four Cluster spacecraft is possible; providing a set of distributed, multi-point measurements covering this region.

We report here preliminary results of joint signatures of R1 and R2 FACs and demonstrate the use and application of new analysis techniques derived from the calculation of curl B and magnetic gradients to compare estimates of the current distributions. Multi-spacecraft analysis can access perpendicular currents associated with the FAC signatures at the Swam locations. We also show preliminary statistical results of FAC correlations between Swarm spacecraft to reveal local time behaviour. For context, we identify the associated auroral boundaries determine from FAC intensity gradients in order to help interpret and resolve the R1 and R2 FACs.

Push-pull test is very simple to design, and perform. The test is also convenient to set a duration of experiment period based on the background ground-water velocity. In this study, SF6 and Chloride were used as tracers known as non-reactive tracers. The performed push-pull tests were consisted of 3 phases: 1) solution injection phase; 2) rest phase; and 3) pumping phase. We used a portable multi-level packer to isolate the injection interval. Samples were obtained during pumping phase at every 2 minutes. LTC level-logger was installed to record real-time water level, temperature, and electric conductivity before and during the experiment. A breakthrough curve was obtained by analyzing LTC level-logger data and tracer concentration of water samples. The values of ground water velocity and effective porosity from two tracers came out similar values. SF6 and chloride did not show intervening effect and display similar transport behavior. It seems that both tracers can be applied independently or together to perform tracer tests for estimation of transport behaviors of dissolved volatile components.  \nAcknowledgement: Financial support was provided by the \"R&D Project on Environmental Management of Geologic CO2 Storage\" from the KEITI (Project Number: 2014001810003) and Korea Ministry of Environment as \"The GAIA project(2014000540010)\"",

            "abstract": "Recent insights shed light on the global mechanisms involved in the abrupt oscillations of the Earth climate for the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM) to Holocene period (Zhang et al., 2014; Banderas et al., 2015). Yet the concomitant patterns of regional climate reorganization on continental areas are for now poorly documented. Particularly, few attempts have been made to propose temporal reconstructions of the regional climate variables in the High Tropical Andes, a region under the direct influence of the upper part of the troposphere.\nWe present new glacial chronologies from the Zongo (16.3°S - 68.1°W, Bolivia) and Wara-Wara (17.3°S - 66.1°W, Bolivia) valleys based on Cosmic Ray Exposure dating (CRE) from an exceptional suite of recessive moraines. These new data permitted to refine existing chronologies (Smith et al., 2005 ; Zech et al., 2010): the Zongo valley is characterized by an older local last glacial maximum than the Wara Wara valley. Both sites however exhibit similar glacier behaviours, with a progressive regression between 18 ka and the Holocene.\nIn both sites, glaciers recorded stillstand episodes synchronous with the cold events of the Norther Hemisphere (Henrich 1 event, Younger Dryas). Since the nearby Altiplano basin registered lake level variations over the same period, we were able to apply a joint modelling of glaciers Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) and lake budget. This permits to derive a temporal evolution of temperature and precipitation for both sites.\nThese new reconstructions show for both sites that glaciers of the Eastern Tropical Andes were both influenced by the major climatic events of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. However, precipitation variability is more influenced by the Northern Atlantic events. This observation is in good agreement with the theories suggesting that North Hemisphere cold events are coeval with an important southward deflexion of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) due to the inter-hemispheric temperature gradient (Schneider et al., 2014). Such a southward shift would lead to an increased moist supply of the subequatorial Amazonian basin (Montade et al., 2015) and thus an increased easterly driven moist transport over the Altiplano.",

            "abstract": "The concept of effective discharge is widespread in geomorphology and river engineering and restoration. For example, it is used to design the most stable channel configuration, to estimate sedimentation rate and lifespan of reservoirs and to characterize the hydrologic forcing in models studying long-term evolution of rivers. Accordingly, the effective discharge has been the focus of countless empirical, theoretical and numerical studies, which found it to vary among catchments as a function of climate, landscape and river morphology, type of transport (dissolved, suspended or bedload), and of streamflow variability. The heterogeneity of the effective discharge values observed in different catchments challenges a thorough understanding of its pivotal drivers, and a consistent framework which explains observations carried out in different geographic areas is still lacking.\nIn the present work, the observed diversity is explained in terms of the underlying heterogeneity of river flow regimes, by linking effective discharge to attributes of the sediment rating curve and to streamflow variability, as resulting from climatic and landscape drivers. An analytic expression of the effective ratio (i.e. the ratio between effective discharge and mean streamflow) is provided, which captures observed values of effective discharge for suspended sediment transport in a set of catchments of the continental United States. The framework disentangles hydrologic and landscape controls on effective discharge, and highlights distinct effective ratios of persistent and erratic hydrologic regimes (respectively characterized by low and high flow variability), attributable to intrinsically different streamflow dynamics. Clusters of river catchments characterized by similar streamflow dynamics can be identified. The framework provides an opportunity for first-order estimates of effective discharge in rivers belonging to different areas, based on the type of flow regime.",

            "abstract": "Shales comprise more than 60% of sedimentary rocks and form natural seals above hydrocarbon reservoirs. Their sealing capacity is also used for storage of nuclear wastes. Shales are notorious for their strong elastic anisotropy, so-called, vertical transverse isotropy or VTI. This VTI anisotropy is of practical importance as it is required for correct surface seismic data interpretation, seismic to well tie and azimuth versus offset analysis. A number of competing factors are responsible for VTI anisotropy in shales, namely, (1) micro-scale elastic anisotropy of clay particles, (2) anisotropic orientation distribution function of clay particles, (3) anisotropic orientation of pores and organic matter. On the contrary, silt (non-clay mineralogy grains with size between 0.06 -0.002 mm) is known to reduce elastic anisotropy of shales. Methods developed for calculations of anisotropy in polycrystalline materials can be used to estimate elastic anisotropy of shales from orientation distribution function (ODF) of clay platelets if elastic properties of individual clay platelets are known. Unfortunately, elastic properties of individual clay platelets cannot be directly measured. Recently, elastic properties of properties of individual clay platelets with different mineralogy were calculated from first principles based on density functional theory. In this work we use these elastic properties of individual platelets of muscovite, illite-smectite and kaolinite to obtain correlations between elastic anisotropy and Legendre coefficients W200 and W400 of different ODFs. Comparison of the Legendre coefficients calculated for more than 800 shales from depths 0 - 6 km (\nwww.rockphysicists.org/data\n) with those of compaction ODFs shows that compaction has no first order effect on elastic anisotropy. Thus, elastic anisotropy is to large extent determined by factors other than compaction processes, such as depositional environment, chemical composition of fluid, silt fraction, etc.",

An important factor for determining the biological impact of the Martian surface radiation is the specific contribution of neutrons, which possess a high biological effectiveness. In contrast to charged particles, neutrons and gamma rays are generally only measured indirectly, requiring the transfer of kinetic energy from neutral to one or more charged particles. Therefore, the measurement is the result of a complex convolution of the incident particle spectrum with the measurement process. We apply an inversion method to calculate the gamma/neutron spectra from RAD neutral particle measurements. Here we show first measurements of the gamma/neutron spectra during transit and on Mars and compare them to theoretical predictions. Measuring the neutron spectra in transit to Mars and on the Martian surface is an essential step for determining radiation hazard for future human exploration, including shielding designs of potential spacecraft and habitats. The relative contribution of neutrons to the dose equivalent increases considerably with shielding thickness, so our quantitative measurements provide an important baseline to strategies that would mitigate cancer risk.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed a total of 97727 receiver-function data recorded by 590 stations in North China from 711 teleseismic events. We used a common-conversion-point stacking (CCP) method to generate a 3D reflectivity volume in the area between 108°-125°E and 36°-43°N, in the depth range of 200 to 800 km. We found significant topography on both the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities. It is well known that estimating the depths of the two discontinuities from Ps conversion times are very sensitive to the reference P- and S-wave velocity models. We used the EARA2014 model, which was derived from a waveform adjoint tomography study of East Asia (Chen et al., 2015) and had comparable resolutions for both P- and S-wave velocity, as the 3D reference model in computing the Ps moveouts for the CCP stacking. We found that the 660-km discontinuity is depressed up to 25 km along the east coast of China, indicating the presence of the subducted Pacific slab in the region. We found a strong and localized anomaly beneath the Quaternary Datong volcano located at the northeastern edge of the Ordos plateau in north China. The 410-km and the 660-km discontinuities are, respectively, depressed and uplifted by a few kilometers beneath the volcano, resulting in a transition zone approximately 15 km thinner than the global average. This observation suggests a deep origin of the Datong volcano, although it was usually attributed to edge driven convection by most of the literatures.",

            "abstract": "A Forbush decrease (FD) is a sudden depression in the intensity of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) background, followed by a gradual recovery. One of the major causes of FDs is the presence of magnetic structures such as magnetic clouds (MCs) or corotating interaction regions (CIRs) that have enhanced magnetic field, which can scatter particles away reducing the observed GCR intensity. Recent work (Gopalswamy et al. 2014, GRL 41, 2673) suggests that coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are expanding anomalously in solar cycle 24 due to the reduced total pressure in the ambient medium. One of the consequences of the anomalous expansion is the reduced magnetic content of MCs, so we expect subdued FDs in cycle 24. In this paper, we present preliminary results from a survey of FDs during MC events in cycle 24 in comparison with those in cycle 23. We find that only ~17% FDs in cycle 24 had an amplitude >3%, as compared to ~31% in cycle 23. This result is consistent with the difference in the maximum magnetic field intensities (Bmax) of MCs in the two cycles: only ~ 10% of MCs in cycle 24 have Bmax>20nT, compared to 22% in cycle 23, confirming that MCs of cycle 24 have weaker magnetic field content. Therefore, we suggest that weaker magnetic field intensity in the magnetic clouds of cycle 24 has led to FDs with smaller amplitudes.",

            "abstract": "The 1D Velocity Distribution Function (VDF) of He+ pickup ions shows two distinct populations that reflect the sources of these ions. The highly suprathermal population is the result of the ionization and pickup of almost resting interstellar neutrals that are injected into the solar wind as a highly anisotropic torus distribution. The nearly thermalized population is centered around the solar wind bulk speed and is mainly attributed to inner-source pickup ions that originate in the inner heliosphere.\nIt is generally believed that the initial torus distribution of interstellar pickup ions is rapidly isotropized by resonant wave-particle interactions, but recent observations by Drews et al. (2015) of a torus-like VDF strongly limit this isotropization. This in turn means that more observational data is needed to further characterize the kinetic behavior of pickup ions.\nIn this study we use data from the Charge-Time-Of-Flight sensor on-board SOHO. As this sensor offers unrivaled counting statistics for He+ together with a sufficient mass-per-charge resolution it is well-suited for investigating the He+ VDF on comparatively short timescales. We combine this data with the high resolution magnetic field data from WIND via an extrapolation to the location of SOHO. With this combination of instruments we investigate the He+ VDF for time periods of different solar wind speeds, magnetic field directions, and wave power. We find a systematic trend of the short-term He+ VDF with these parameters. Especially by varying the considered magnetic field directions we observe a 1D projection of the anisotropic torus-like VDF.\nIn addition, we investigate stream interaction regions and coronal mass ejections. In the latter we observe an excess of inner-source He+ that is accompanied by a significant increase of heavy pickup ion count rates. This may be linked to the as yet ill understood production mechanism of inner-source pickup ions.",

            "abstract": "An inversion method of thermal tracer tomography is presented, using the travel times of cross-well tomographic thermal tracer tests to invert the hydraulic conductivity distribution of an aquifer. Thermal tracer tests are common investigation techniques to examine groundwater transport processes and aquifer properties. Heat is actively introduced by injecting hot water or by heating groundwater in a well and then recording temperature changes in observation wells. Applying thermal tracers in a tomographical setup allow us to map hydraulic heterogeneities in an aquifer. Based on the assumption that the heat transport is dominated by advection, the tracer travel times can be related to the hydraulic conductivity field. In order to make this assumption, we minimize the effects of thermal diffusion and density driven flow by using early time diagnostics of the recorded temperature signals in the inversion instead of the mean tracer travel times or full thermal breakthrough curves. The obtained travel times are inverted with a standard eikonal solver algorithm, using the staggered grid method to increase the resolution. The resulting tomogram represents the hydraulic conductivity distribution profile between the injection and observation wells. As a reliability assessment, the null-space energy map of the tomogram is calculated.\nThe method is developed and tested using an aquifer data set which is three dimensional, high resolution and analog. One major finding is that preferential flow paths existing in the analog can be identified and reconstructed. Even though the eikonal inversion is based on an approximation of the diffusion equation, hydraulic conductivity values in the tomograms are comparable to those in the original analog. This also opens the door for rapid inversion of alternative tracers applied in a tomographic configuration. Sensitivity analysis of the technical test parameters for the thermal tracer shows that the method is not sensitive to the injection temperature, but the injection rate has to be kept within a set range to obtain decent results.",

            "abstract": "Population growth and climate change add additional pressures affecting water resources management strategies for meeting demands from different economic sectors. It is especially challenging in arid regions where fresh water is limited. For instance, in the Tailanhe River Basin (Xinjiang, China), a compromise must be made between water suppliers and users during drought years. This study presents a multi-objective irrigation water allocation model to cope with water scarcity in arid river basins. To deal with the uncertainties from multiple sources in the water allocation system (e.g., variations of available water amount, crop yield, crop prices, and water price), the model employs a interval linear programming approach. The multi-objective optimization model developed from this study is characterized by integrating eco-system service theory into water-saving measures. For evaluation purposes, the model is used to construct an optimal allocation system for irrigation areas fed by the Tailan River (Xinjiang Province, China). The objective functions to be optimized are formulated based on these irrigation areas’ economic, social, and ecological beneﬁts. The optimal irrigation water allocation plans are made under different hydroclimate conditions (wet year, normal year, and dry year), with multiple sources of uncertainty represented. The modeling tool and results are valuable for advising decision making by the local water authority—and the agricultural community—especially on measures for coping with water scarcity (by incorporating uncertain factors associated with crop production planning).",

            "abstract": "Large-eddy simulation is used to study trade-wind cumulus clouds and their\nsensitivity to perturbations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find\nthat the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective\nequilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale\nadvective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when\ncooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to\ncloud droplet number density, when radiation depends realistically on the\nvertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the\nproperties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depends on the microphysical\nstate and therefore on the cloud droplet number density, here taken as a proxy\nfor the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in\ncloud droplet number density is a deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening\nleads to a decrease in relative humidity in most of the trade wind boundary\nlayer. As a consequence small clouds and cloud remnants evaporate faster in an\nenvironment with high aerosol load than in the undisturbed control case\nconstituting a negative lifetime effect. This negative lifetime effect is\nconfirmed by means of cloud tracking diagnostics in the LES. In the\nnear-equilibrium regime the decrease in cloud cover associated with the\nnegative lifetime effect compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the\nbrightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the\norganized precipitating cumulus cloud field is small. The figure summarizes\nthis conceptual model of the revised cloud lifetime effect.",

            "abstract": "The Emprirical Green's Function (EGF) method uses pairs of events of high wave form similarity and adjacent hypocenters to decompose the influences of source time function, ray path, instrument site, and instrument response. The seismogram of the smaller event is considered as the Green's Function which then can be deconvolved from the other seismogram. The result provides a reconstructed relative source time function (RSTF) of the larger event of that event pair. The comparison of the RSTFs at different stations of the observation systems produces information on the rupture process of the larger event based on the observation of the directivity effect and on changing RSTFs complexities.\nThe Basel EGS dataset of 2006-2007 consists of about 2800 localized events of magnitudes between 0.0<ML<3.5 with event pairs of adequate magnitude difference for EGF analysis. The data has sufficient quality to analyse events with magnitudes down to ML=0.5 for an apparent directivity effect although the approximate rupture duration for those events is of only a few milliseconds. The dataset shows a number of multiplets and repeating earthquakes known from earlier studies. The larger events seem to appear close to the rim of the microseismic cloud. We are interested in their rupture behaviour. Using the EGF method we compute rupture orientations for about 190 event pairs and relate them to the event location, the known fault system, and stress regime. For the majority of events we observe a similar rupture direction which seems to correlate with the over all shape of the microseismic cloud. The large events, however, point back to the injection source.\nAdditionally the rupture direction fitting yields estimates for projections of the rupture velocity on the horizontal plane. They seem to vary between the multiplets in the reservoir from 0.3 to 0.7 times the S-wave velocity.\nTo our knowledge source characterization by EGF analysis has not yet been introduced to microseismic reservoirs with comparable data quality to the one from the Basel experiment. Our results show that EGF analysis can provide valuable additional insights on the distribution of rupture properties within the reservoir. The results suggest a preferred rupture direction of large induced events that occur at the reservoir rim back towards the injection source.",

            "abstract": "A numerical simulation of magnetic reconnection in the dayside ionosphere of an unmagnetized planet and a comparison of the size distribution of flux ropes obtained from simulation with that from observation will be reported. Flux ropes have been frequently observed in the dayside ionospheres of Venus and Mars[Russell and Elphic, 1979; Cloutier et al.,1999] and their radius has been found to be between 6 to 12 km near the subsolar location of Venus[Russell et al., 1990]. Dreher et al. [1995] suggested using an MHD simulation that reconnection caused by an IMF rotation can generate flux ropes at the Venus ionopause. However, Dreher et al. [1995] examined only the linear stage of reconnection, so the nonlinear stage that takes into consideration the vertical convection of the reconnection site along the intrinsic convection in the Venus ionosphere has yet to be investigated. In this study, using a 2-D multi-species MHD simulation, the spatiotemporal evolution of reconnection in the ionosphere of Venus is examined. The size distribution of flux ropes is also examined and the validity of the generation mechanism of flux ropes is discussed by comparing the rope size distribution with the observed one. In the ionosphere of Venus, our simulation result shows that plasmoid instability [Loureiro et al., 2007] occurs in a Sweet-Parker (SP) current sheet above the altitude where Lundquist number exceeds 106, and consequently many plasmoids are generated. In the nonlinear stage, secondary reconnections occur in the current sheets, which exist between adjacent pairs of plasmoids, and thus smaller flux ropes are created. It has been suggested that the smaller side of the size distribution increases as a result of hierarchical reconnections in the SP current sheet [Shibata et al., 2001]. The observational size distribution [Vignes et al., 2003] shows that the population of small flux ropes is larger than that of large ones and it is consistent with the simulation result. Through plasomoid coalescences, a small number of monster plasmoids [Loureiro et al., 2012], which are larger in size than the initial current sheet thickness, are generated in the nonlinear stage. These plasmoids are as large as the giant ropes observed by Venus Express [Zhang et al., 2012], and it is suggested that the giant ropes can be generated by the plasmoid instability.",

According to a nonlinear complementary relationship model, it was derived that, with constant energy input (denoted by constant radiation term (Erad) of potential evaporation), the changes in aerodynamic term (Eaero) are accompanied with opposite changes in actual evaporation under water-limited conditions, but same direction changes in actual evaporation under energy-limited conditions. As a result, the radiation term and aerodynamic term play different roles in the Budyko curve. In other words, complementary relationship plays a role in the Budyko framework, which should be seriously considered.\nThe role of complementary relationship on the Budyko curve from water-limited to energy-limited environments was schematically analyzed, considering the different correlations between actual evaporation and the radiation and the aerodynamic terms. Under water limited conditions, the catchment with a higher Erad/Eaero would be wetter, and characterized with higher evaporation efficiency and larger properties parameter of Budyko curve. Under energy limited conditions, the role of complementary relationship may be different.\nErad/Eaero is found to be connected with the variations of catchment parameter in the Budyko curve, and an exponential relationship between the catchment parameter and Erad/Eaero was derived through dimensional analysis and mathematical reasoning.\nThe analysis will be evaluated using water balance data of a number of catchments from non-humid to humid environments over China.",

However, migration is already a major process in deltas, such as the growth of major cities such as Dhaka and Kolkata. Climate and environmental change interacts with a range of catchment and delta level drivers, which encompass a nexus of sea-level rise, storms, freshwater and sediment supply from the catchment, land degradation, subsidence, agricultural loss and socio-economic stresses. DECCMA (Deltas, Vulnerability and Climate Change: Migration and Adaptation/CARRIA) is investigating migration in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM), Mahanadi and Volta Deltas, including the influence of climate change. The research will explore migration from a range of perspectives including governance and stakeholder analysis, demographic analysis, household surveys of sending and receiving areas, macro-economic analysis, and hazards and hotspot analysis both historically and into the future. Migration under climate change will depend on other adaptation in the deltas and this will be examined. Collectively, integrated analysis will be developed to examine migration, other adaptation and development pathways with a particular focus on the implications for the poorest. This will require the development of input scenarios, including expert-derived exogenous scenarios (e.g., climate change) and endogenous scenarios of the delta developed in a participatory manner. This applied research will facilitate decision support methods for the development of deltas under climate change, with a focus on migration and other adaptation strategies.",

            "abstract": "The Tasmanide, the eastern one third of Australian continent, experienced long-term lateral continental growth via accretionary processes in the Phanerozoic. The Delamerian and Lachlan Orogens represent the first two phases of such accretions. A detailed 3D crustal Vs model of the orogenic suture zone help 1) decipher the early subduction-accretion processes and 2) explore the crustal responses of the latest intraplate basaltic volcanisms on Australian continent beneath the Newer Volcanic Province (NVP). To construct such model, ambient noise data are collected from 40 short-band seismic stations in the region, from which Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps are generated at 2-18 s periods. A 3D Vs model with a general resolution of 20-30 km is then constructed based on a Monte-Carlo approach, and is interpreted with the aid of 3D gravity modelling.\nIn the shallow crust of this model, different velocity features are observed on the two sides of the Moyston Fault (MF), which are coincident with distinct magmatism and metamorphism at each side. Especially, high velocities are observed right above amphibolite metamorphic complex and its western edge are perfectly confined to the MF, suggesting the tectonic significance of MF during early accretions. In the middle crust, the MF is associated with ~6-8% velocity differences on the two sides, which indicate large compositional differences even taking 20-30 mW/m2 thermal discrepancies of the two areas into account. The compositional differences are probably results of a remanent continental lithosphere in the east of MF and an oceanic lithosphere in the west as proposed by previous seismic and geochemical studies in the area. Meanwhile, no large concentrated low velocities are observed in the upper and mid crust of the NVP; while considerable high velocities are seen in the lower crust. The crustal velocity structures together with strong positive gravity features at NVP suggest large basaltic magmatic reservoir has probably crystallized in the lower crust of the NVP.",

            "abstract": "Long-term nitrogen deposition has caused a problem called nitrogen saturation in forest ecosystems globally. Aber et al. (1989) suggested that nitrogen saturation activate soil nitrification in forest systems, which is the main process of N2O production in aerobic condition. Thus, nitrogen saturation may affect significantly the N2O emission from forests, while the impact on flux has not been quantitatively evaluated yet.\n In the present study, 3-year monitoring of N2O emission was performed in an N-saturated forests (Tama Hill, Tokyo): the emission rate of N2O was measured monthly by a closed chamber method at 12 plots along a slope, and the net nitrification rate of surface soil (0–10 cm) was measured 4 times in situ. In addition, a comparative research was conducted in summer in eight temperate forests with different stages of nitrogen saturation in central Japan; the N2O flux, soil moisture, nitrogen availability and stream water NO3- concentration were measured at each site. In an N-saturated forests, the annual N2O emission was estimated to be 0.88 kg N ha-1year-1 , showing a typical seasonal variation . The seasonal patterns of N2O emission were significantly related to soil moisture and ambient temperature. We also found high spatial variation of N2O flux among 12 plots along the slope, which was generally higher at the bottom. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between the rate of N2O emission and the net nitrification rate with WFPS<60%, while it was unclear in some humid spots with WFPS>60% , probably due to the effect of denitrification. In comparison sites, the N2O emission rate ranged nearly 16-fold from 0.13-2.11 g N ha-1day-1 was linearly related to the stream water NO3- concentration ranged 10-fold from 0.14 to 1.4 mg N/L.

            "abstract": "A compaction of soils at agricultural areas is a known phenomenon influencing the water retention and runoff regimes. Nevertheless, an investigation of compacted soil layer position and (dis)continuity is complicated. Using of direct measurement methods is almost infeasible at larger areas due to excessive labour and cost demands of such an approach. Other disadvantage of direct methods is usually lack of continuous information, which may be desirable in some cases. The electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is useful method for its relatively simple and non-invasive data acquisition and continuity of the measured data. However, reliability of the ERT measurement for exact plough pan delineation is still questionable. In this work we assessed the feasibility of the ERT to delineate the compacted soil layer. To do so, we compared soil electrical resistivity with soil penetration resistance. The field experiments took place at the experimental catchment in central part of the Czech Republic. Soil profile samples were taken to gain more complex information of soil physical characteristics possibly influencing the soil resistivity. All measurements were performed recurrently under different topsoil structure and soil saturation conditions. Classical methods of statistic and geo-statistis was used to evaluate the data. The effect of the compacted subsoil layer on soil water regime during heavy rainfall events was evaluated with the use of dual porosity numerical code S1D. Due to comparatively lower ratio of preferential pathways and macropores in the subsoil the percolating water accumulate on the plough pan causing local flooding of the fields or lateral shallow subsurface runoff. The research was performed within the framework of a postdoctoral project granted by Czech Science Foundation No. 13-20388P.",

            "abstract": "A major flash flood event took place on 28 September, 2012 in SE Spain, resulting in 10 fatalities and much damage to infrastructure regionally. The flood affected long-term monitoring sites in two catchments in which morphological changes and flow dynamics of these ephemeral channels were being measured. Thus detailed data on channel state prior to the flood were available. The flood event in the Nogalte catchment was extreme in its peak flow, rate of rise and unit runoff. The catchment has steep relief and much bare soil under almond groves, resulting in high sediment supply. The channel is confined in places, but mostly wide and braided, composed of loose gravel and occupying much of the valley floor. Flow was spatially continuous, with high connectivity throughout the catchment. The flood effects were net depositional in the monitored sites, with massive sedimentation on the channel bars. Vegetation was destroyed. Bank erosion and destruction of embankments took place in some locations. Hydraulic calculations indicate very high velocities, stream power and Froude numbers. Modelling and field evidence demonstrate extremely high sediment competence and sediment loadings. The influence of the event dynamics on processes and net outcomes is discussed. The impacts are compared with other events in this and neighbouring catchments. Overall, the event in the Nogalte did not alter the morphology markedly in spite of its extreme characteristics. It is suggested that these valley floors are adapted to this type of flash flood but that flows of such force and magnitude need to be allowed for in management in such an environment.",

            "abstract": "A necessary requirement in studies using in-situ cosmogenic isotopes is to convert the measured isotope concentrations to exposure ages or geomorphic process rates. This involves using an accepted reference production rate, derived experimentally at a calibration site that has independent age control, and applying scaling factors for latitude and altitude in order to calculate a site-specific production rate. Throughout the development of the in-situ cosmogenic dating method, although reference production rates are necessarily nuclide specific, the scaling factors were not.\nThe first atmospheric scaling model by Lal and Peters [1967] and others that followed, were based on the principle that as the cosmic ray particle flux attenuates with depth, the energy spectrum of nucleons of energy below 400 MeV becomes invariant at atmospheric depths greater than 200 g/cm2(altitude < 12 km). Hence scaling factors would thus be isotope independent resulting in production rate ratios of different isotopes to be invariant as a function of altitude. However, recent models by Argento et al. [2012, 2015] and Lifton et al. [2014] suggest that the energy spectrum is not invariant and scaling factors should in fact be isotope specific.\nThe essential feature of the new models is that the focus is on generating the energy spectrum of cosmic-ray nucleons that is then converted into scaling factors with known cross sections. To benchmark the new scaling models I have collated secondary cosmic-ray neutron spectra measurements from the last 20 years and utilised these to calculate site-specific production rates. When using both ground-based and airborne neutron spectra measurements, the result follows the general trend predicted by the new models requiring isotope specific scaling. In contrast, using only the ground-based measurements, which range from sea-level to ~4000 m in altitude, no evidence for isotope specific scaling is apparent.",

            "abstract": "Ambient noise tomography (ANT) has become a popular method to study the crustal and uppermost mantle structure of the earth in recent years due to its exclusive capability to extract short-period surface wave signals. Most of ANT are based on ray theory that assumes interstation surface waves from ambient noise are mainly sensitive to a narrow zone alone the ray path from one station to the other. Recently, many studies have demonstrated that long-period Rayleigh wave signal with high SNR can be obtained from cross-correlation of ambient noise data and could be used to do long period surface ware tomography. In order to obtain accurate phase velocity maps using long period surface waves from ambient noise, frequency effects must be considered in tomography.\nIn this study, we investigate the feasibility of finite frequency ANT by calculating 2-D phase sensitivity kernel based on Born approximation. In calculating 2D sensitivity kernels for empirical Green’s functions extracted from cross-correlations between a pair of stations, one station is regarded as receiver and the other as virtual source. Based on the 2D finite frequency sensitivity kennels, we develop a finite frequency ambient noise tomography method to construct Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps. To demonstrate the feasibility of our developed method, we apply the method to empirical Green’s functions extracted from cross-correlations of USArray noise data to construct phase velocity maps at 20-150 sec periods. Our resulting phase velocity maps are very similar to earthquake-based phase velocity maps with almost zero means and 20-30 m/s stand deviations of differences. Major tectonic features in USA are well revealed in our phase velocity maps.",

The responses of plant productivity and nutrient cycling to nitrogen deposition have been widely reported in forests across Euro-America, but with little evidence from subtropical forest ecosystem across China. Here we conducted a nitrogen fertilization experiment in a nature subtropical forest in southeast China for more than four years, and investigated the induced changes in litter production, leaf N and P concentrations and resorption efficiency of Castanopsis eyrei, as the dominate species in most subtropical evergreen forests in China. Results showed that N fertilization increased litter production, which performed a concurrent seasonal pattern with peak defoliation in spring and autumn. N fertilization significantly increased N and P concentrations in green and senesced leaves, and the leaf N and P resorption efficiencies. In contrast to the predominant results across temperate and tropical ecosystems, our findings reveal a distinguishable pattern of resorption efficiencies in respond to nutrient changes, and highlight that regional characteristic and spatial heterogeneity should be considered when predicting future impacts of N deposition on plant growth and nutrient cycling.",

            "abstract": "Passive seismic monitoring of natural or induced seismicity can provide important information about time-variant subsurface phenomena, especially concerning fluid flow and stress-strain conditions. Traditional monitoring focuses on locating seismic events, and interpreting the results in terms of changes to subsurface properties. Instead, we directly estimate the subsurface velocity changes, which can be more quantitatively related to changes in fluid and stress states via rock physics and geomechanical relationships. The expected velocity changes are often so small that conventional traveltime tomography has difficulty in providing reliable detailed estimates. Our method is based on full waveform inversion (FWI) of the seismic data. FWI estimates a high-resolution subsurface model by fitting waveforms in the data domain based on a numerical solution to the wave equation. We evaluate the performance of our FWI by using a synthetic set of a limited number (up to three) repeating events recorded at a surface array of sensors. We use a realistic complex velocity model which includes fine-scale heterogeneity, and consider the case where fluid pore pressure has changed the stress state leading to a small velocity increase in two distinct thin layers. We assume that we have reasonable estimates of the event locations and the background velocity model before starting the inversion. We compare parallel, double-difference and bootstrapping techniques, and analyse effects of accuracy in the background velocity model to the inversion. FWI retrieves the correct velocity change with excellent accuracy at a high spatial resolution less than one wavelength. This is due to the ability of FWI to invert the full waveform data, rather than traveltime arrivals only. We analyse the inversion sensitivity kernels and show that the spatial resolution improves, and the required density of the sensor array reduces, for velocity changes nearer to the seismic source location.",

Especially in wide aperture fractures, flow processes may be dominated by gravitational instead of capillary forces leading to a deviation from the classical volume effective approaches (Richard’s equation, Van Genuchten type relationships). The existence of various flow modes such as droplets, rivulets, turbulent and adsorbed films is well known, however, their spatial and temporal distribution within fracture networks is still an open question partially due to the lack of appropriate modeling tools. With our work we want to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying flow and transport dynamics in unsaturated fractured media in order to support the development of more refined upscaled methods, applicable on catchment scales. We present fracture-scale flow simulations obtained with a parallelized Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model. The model allows us to simulate free-surface flow dynamics including the effect of surface tension for a wide range of wetting conditions in smooth and rough fractures. Due to the highly efficient generation of surface tension via particle-particle interaction forces the dynamic wetting of surfaces can readily be obtained. We validated the model via empirical and semi-analytical solutions and conducted laboratory-scale percolation experiments of unsaturated flow through synthetic fracture systems. The setup allows us to obtain travel time distributions and identify characteristic flow mode distributions on wide aperture fractures intercepted by horizontal fracture elements.",

Although the accuracy and resolution of GPS-based monthly solutions is not as high as compared to GRACE monthly solutions derived from KBR ranging, it is interesting to have time-variable gravity from GPS orbits: (i) as the continued monitoring of mass transport processes, (ii) as independent information on time-variable gravity. We show that Swarm GPS monthly solutions can be successfully used to continue the time series of monthly gravity solutions derived from GPS tracking of GRACE satellites.

            "abstract": "During PolarsternExpedition PS87, numerous slide scars and mass-transport deposits were discovered along the Siberian part of Lomonosov Ridge between about 81°N and 84°N. Swath-bathymetry data indicate that different processes probably triggered slope failures and that failures occurred at various times. On top of the southern Lomonosov Ridge at water depths between 800 and 1000 m we mapped SE-NW oriented, streamlined landforms over long distances. These features are interpreted to be glacial lineations that formed beneath grounded ice sheets and ice streams. Similar unidirectional bed forms have also been identified on the East Siberian continental margin where they were related to large and coherent ice masses („East Siberian Chukchi Ice Sheet – ESCIS“). The orientations of the lineations identified in this study are similar to those on the East Siberian continental margin, suggesting that the ESCIS extended further north than originally proposed. The load and erosional behaviour of this extended ice sheet/shelf that probably occurred during major Quaternary glaciations (MIS 6 or older, i.e. MIS 12 and 16?), may have caused physical conditions that triggered the landslides on this part of Lomonosov Ridge.\nAlthough the single landslides with sediment volumes of 2 to 20 km3 are relatively small in comparison to well-studied megaslides (e.g., the Storrega Slide off Norway: 2400-3200 km3), in sum probably >1000 km3of sediment were redistributed and transported down-slope. The widespread dimension of such processes was not known yet, and its discovery has certainly to be considered in re-calculation of Arctic Ocean sedimentary and organic-carbon budgets.\nAlong the steep and 100-500 metres high headwalls of the escarpments, younger sediments have been removed and led to exhumation of Miocene to early Quaternary sediments close to the seafloor. Some of these sediments were studied in more detail. Here, we can show for the first time that the mid/late Miocene central Arctic Ocean was relatively warm (4-7°C) and ice-free during summer, but sea ice occurred during spring and autumn/winter. A comparison of our proxy data with Miocene climate simulations seems to favour relatively high late Miocene atmospheric CO2 concentrations.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that high concentration of TDS (total dissolved solid) in industrial effluent gives rise to the toxicity to the Daphnia magna toxicity test. D. magna is vulnerable to relatively low TDS concentration showing the 24-hr EC50 of Salinity 0.6% (as the sea salt concentration). Recently, standard mandatory toxicity testing using Daphnia magna has been used to monitor industrial effluent toxicity according to Korea standard method (Acute Toxicity Test Method of the Daphnia magna Straus (Cladocera, Crustacea), ES 04704. 1a) under regulation. Since only one acute toxicity testing is applied in the present, we are trying to introduce microbial battery for more complete toxicity assessment.\nIn this study, the acute toxicities between daphnids and microbes were compared. The results of D. magna and Vibrio fischeri toxicity test from 165 industrial wastewater effluents showed high positive correlation. In addition, the possibility of predicting daphnia toxicity from the bacterial toxicity data amounts to 92.6% if we consider salinity effect (>5ppt) together. From this study, we found that the V. fischeri toxicity test is a powerful battery tool to assess the industrial wastewater toxicity. Here, we suggest that luminescent bacteria toxicity test be useful not only for complete toxicity assessment which can’t be obtained by daphnia toxicity testing only but also for the reduction cost, time, and labor in the Korean society.\nKeywords : D. magna, V. fischeri, Industrial waste water, battery test\nAcknowledgement\nThis research was supported by a grant (15IFIP-B089908-02) from Plant Research Program funded by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korean government",

            "abstract": "The eddy-covariance towers of AmeriFlux network are important for the analysis of terrestrial ecosystem-atmosphere interactions, and they have been used to improve our understanding of the mechanism behind terrestrial carbon cycle and upscaling from site to landscape and regional scales. However, the spatial representativeness of AmeriFlux network has not been assessed, especially accounting for the effects of land cover change on it using high spatial resolution data. Here we demonstrated an approach for evaluating the spatial representativeness of flux tower measurements based on footprint climatology analyses, land cover change data and remotely sensed vegetation indices. This method was applied to 79 flux towers of AmeriFlux network located in the continental United States, covering evergreen forest, deciduous forest, mixed forest, grass, cropland, shrub, and wetland biomes. For each site, monthly and annual footprint climatologies (i.e. monthly or annual accumulative footprints) were calculated using the Simple Analytical Footprint model on Eulerian coordinates (SAFE-f). The footprint climatologies were then overlaid on the images of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and National Land Cover Database (NLCD) for the years (2001, 2006 and 2011), which were used as surrogates of land surface fluxes to assess the spatial representativeness. For most sites of AmeriFlux network, the results show that (i) the percentages of the target vegetation functional type (dominant land cover) observed by the AmeriFlux towers were higher than 60%; (ii) to some extent, most of the AmeriFlux sites presented anisotropically distributed patterns of NDVI within the 90% annual footprint climatology area; (iii) the land surface heterogeneity within the flux footprint area differed among sites; and (iv) the land cover types had changed higher than 10% within 6 km*6 km area centered at the flux tower for 5 AmeriFlux sites. We conclude that the footprint modeling based on high spatial resolution remotely-sensed data is a pragmatic approach for assessing the spatial representativeness of flux tower measurements. Meanwhile, the land cover change within footprint climatology area may affect the upscaling of eddy-covariance flux measurement to landscape/regional scales.",

            "abstract": "We present the results of gravity modeling for the North Atlantic region based on interpretation of GOCE gravity satellite data. First, to separate the gravity signal caused by density anomalies within the crust and the upper mantle, we subtract the lower harmonics in the gravity field, which are presumably caused by deep density structure of the Earth (the core and the lower mantle). Next, the gravity effect of the upper mantle is calculated by subtracting the gravity effect of the crustal model. Our “basic model” is constrained by a recent regional seismic model EUNAseis for the crustal structure (Artemieva and Thybo, 2013); for bathymetry and topography we use a global ETOPO1 model by NOAA. We test sensitivity of the results to different input parameters, such as bathymetry, crustal structure, and gravity field. For bathymetry, we additionally use GEBCO data; for crustal correction – a global model CRUST 1.0 (Laske, 2013); for gravity – EGM2008 (Pavlis, 2012). Sensitivity analysis shows that uncertainty in the crustal structure produces the largest deviation from “the basic model”. Use of different bathymetry data has little effect on the final results, comparable to the interpolation error. The difference in mantle residual gravity models based on GOCE and EMG2008 gravity data is 5-10 mGal. The results based on two crustal models have a similar pattern, but differ significantly in amplitude (ca. 250 mGal) for the Greenland-Faroe Ridge.\nThe results demonstrate the presence of a strong gravity and density heterogeneity in the upper mantle in the North Atlantic region. A number of mantle residual gravity anomalies are robust features, independent of the choice of model parameters. This include (i) a sharp contrast at the continent-ocean transition, (ii) positive mantle gravity anomalies associated with continental fragments (microcontinents) in the North Atlantic ocean; (iii) negative mantle gravity anomalies which mark regions with anomalous oceanic mantle and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. To understand better a complex geodynamics mosaic in the region, we compare our results with regional geochemical data (Korenaga and Klemen, 2000), and find that residual mantle gravity anomalies are well correlated with anomalies in epsilon-Nd and iron-depletion.

            "abstract": "The interaction of individual rift segments determines the evolution of a rift system and subsequent continental break-up. Inherited heterogeneities control where initial rifts will form and since these are often not properly aligned, rift segments form separately and need to interact. Another important factor affecting rift-segment interaction is the obliquity of plate divergence (transtension), which also promotes eventual continent break-up (Brune et al., 2012).\nBoth analogue and numerical techniques have been used to model rift interaction (e.g. Acocella et al., 1999; Allken et al., 2012) but transtension has never been applied. Here we present a first-order analogue study that elaborates upon earlier studies by assessing the effects of (1) transtension, (2) rift offset and (3) presence and geometry of inherited weak zones that link rift segments. An improved analogue set-up allows more freedom in inherited structure geometry and model analysis with X-Ray Computer Tomography (CT) techniques reveals internal structures with time (Fig. 2 and 3).\nOur experiments yield the following conclusions:\nIncreasing the degree of transtension (decreasing angle α in Fig. 1) controls general rift structures: from wide rifts in orthogonal divergence settings to narrower rifts with oblique internal structures under transtensional conditions to narrow strike-slip dominated systems towards the strike-slip domain;\nRift linkage through transfer zones (hard linkage) is generally promoted by 1) decreasing rift offset and 2) increasing the degree of transtension. However, initial rift linkage might involve relay ramps (soft linkage) due to the interplay of divergence direction and rift offset;\nInherited rift-linking weak zones have little effect on rift interaction unless they are oriented ca. perpendicular to the divergence direction;\nSince the orthogonal divergence models resemble natural examples (Fig. 3), our transtension models might predict what structures can be expected in natural transtension settings.\nWork in progress involves the influence of more complex inherited structure geometries under sinistral and dextral transtension. Future work will test the effects of changing divergence rate along strike (scissorlike divergence).",

            "abstract": "Evidence for global greening is converging, asserting an increase in CO2 uptake and biomass of the terrestrial biosphere. Global greening refers to global net increases in the area of green canopy, stocks of carbon, and the duration of the growing season. The growing seasons in general have prolonged while the stock of biomass carbon has increased and the rate of deforestation has decelerated, although these trends are mixed in the Tropics. Evidence for these trends comes from firm empirical data obtained through atmospheric CO2 observations, remote sensing, forest inventories and land use statistics. The drivers of global greening cannot be assessed based only on unambiguous empirical measurements. They include spatially and temporally heterogeneous combinations of changing land use and management – including green revolution and increasing yields, afforestation, forest protection and management, and abandonment of agricultural land –, changes in the global environment (increased CO2, warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons in the northern latitudes, acceleration of the global nitrogen cycle), and shifts in demand for forest and farm products. The global trade of biomass-derived commodities affects the link between consumption patterns and the land cover impact. Global greening confirms the immediacy of global change and may be associated with more or less biodiversity and diverse environmental and human consequences depending on local circumstances. Understanding causes, mechanisms, and implications of global greening requires integrated analyses spanning land use and management, demand for products of the terrestrial biosphere, and the atmosphere and climate. Understanding the pace and drivers of global greening matters crucially for assessing the future of the terrestrial C sink; ecological, economic, social, and cultural assessments of the bio-economy; and the preservation of ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Remote subalpine ecosystems are usually characterized by nutrient-poor soils (Körner, 2004; Seastedt et al., 2004), making them particularly susceptible to undergo changes due to increased atmospheric N deposition (Vitousek et al., 1997; Preunkert et al., 2003). Using Δ17O, a conserved tracer of atmospheric nitrate (NO3 atm) (Michalski et al., 2004; Tsunogai et al., 2010), and δ15N, indicator of NO3 biological sources (Kendall, 1998; Casciotti et al., 2009), we measured the seasonal variations of NO3 atm stable isotopic composition and concentration in several streams and soils originating from two sub-alpine watersheds in the French Alps. Our objective was to investigate whether or not NO3 atm impacts the soil N biogeochemical cycle by increasing nutrients availability for plants and bacteria. We coupled streams and soils measurements with snow-pits sampling and aerosols collection at the Lautaret Pass, to better emphasize the correlation between atmospheric deposition, soil retention and watersheds effluents response.\nOur results reveal that different temporal dynamics govern our study site: stream measurements show that in spring, snowmelt results in a NO3 atm impulse, accounting for ca. 31 % of the total stream NO3 budget; on the opposite in autumn, NO3 atm accounts only for ca. 3 % of the total stream NO3 budget, highlighting the presence of a NO3 bacterial pool (nitrification). We also inferred from the observed Δ17O variations two distinct phenomena in the spring/summer season: a fast snow run-off and a slower snow-water percolation. The later is believed to affect most the soil N cycle as it directly increases available NO3. Measured soil leachates and extracts confirm this hypothesis and point out the potential importance of anthropogenic N deposition as on average 7 to 10 % of the soil solutions NO3 derives directly from the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The recently-developed cosmic-ray neutron intensity method measures area-average soil moisture at an intermediate scale of hectometers. Calibration has proven difficult at that scale because of spatial variability of soil water and the presence of other pools of water, such as that in vegetation, also spatially and temporally variable.\nSoil moisture is determined using a standard calibration function that relates the neutron intensity to soil water, and that has been parameterized by fitting a curve to neutron intensities modelled at different soil moistures. Neutron transport was simulated using the MCNPX model in which a simple setup of bare ground and sandy homogeneous soil only composed of SiO2 was used. The standard procedure is that only one parameter of the calibration function should be fitted, which is determined from at least one independent soil moisture calibration.\nIn this study, site-specific calibration functions are determined to obtain some insights on the effect of other pools of hydrogen than soil moisture. Insights will elucidate whether the calibration scheme for field sites with other major pools of hydrogen should be adapted. The calibration functions are obtained similarly to the standard calibration function, but site specific model-setups are used. We obtained calibration at field sites within HOBE - the Danish Hydrologic Observatory. The field sites represent three major land covers within the catchment; farmland, forest and heathland, and the model-setups are based on site-specific data for soil chemistry, soil organic carbon, litter layer and above- and below ground biomass.\nThe three models provided three different calibration functions and, additionally, they were all different from the standard calibration function. The steepness of the curve and the dynamic range of neutron intensity modeled were found to be particularly dependent on the above-ground biomass and the thickness of the litter layer. Three-to-four independent soil moisture calibrations were conducted at each field site to validate the modeled site-specific calibration functions. A satisfactory fit of modeled and measured neutron intensity was found. The calibration scheme is recommended to be modified for field sites of considerable amounts of above ground biomass and thick organic rich litter layer.",

            "abstract": "Sulphide-bearing waste-rock dumps represent complex geological systems characterised by high percentages of low-grade mineralisations and non-valuable sulphides (such as pyrite and pyrrhotite). The sulphide oxidation triggers acid mine drainage (AMD) processes and the release of several metals of environmental concern. The severe physicochemical properties of these metal-contaminated environments tend to inhibit soil forming processes and represent an important stress factor for the biotic communities by exerting a strong selective pressure. Some macro- and micro-fungi are pioneer and extremophile organisms, which may survive and tolerate high concentrations of toxic metals in contaminated environments. Many studies show the fungal capability to bioaccumulate, biosorb, and store in their cells a high concentration of ecotoxic metals. A 7 years multidisciplinary survey was carried out in the Libiola sulphide mine. The results evidenced that the waste rock dumps of the area are characterized by an extremely poor flora and a specific mycobiota, due to the soil acidity, high concentration of trace metals, and unavailability or paucity of nutrients and organic matter. Our studies allowed the complete mineralogical, geochemical, and mycological characterization of one of the biggest dumps of the mine. 30 microfungal vital strains were isolated in pure cultures and studied with molecular and morphological approach, for their identification. The results allowed the isolation of some rare and important extremophilic species. Penicillium was the most recurrent genus, together with Trichoderma and Cladosporium. In particular, Penicillium glandicola is a rare species previously isolated from cave or arid environments, whereas P. brevicompactum is one of the most important fungi for metal corrosion. Hence, some bioaccumulation tests allowed to select a Trichoderma harzianum strain efficient to uptake Cu and Ag from pyrite-bearing soils, highlighting its central role in fungal remediation protocol. Further studies are in progress to investigate the potential interactions between microfungi and sulphides from the Libiola mine soils and to evaluate the fungal role in the biomineralisation and deactivation/mobilisation of toxic metals.",

            "abstract": "Frequency of heat extremes during the summer season has increased continuously since the late 20th century despite the global warming hiatus. In previous studies, anthropogenic influences, natural variation in sea surface temperature (SST), and internal atmospheric variabilities are suggested to be factors contributing to the increase in the frequency of warm extremes. Here 100-member ensemble historical simulations were performed (called “database for Probabilistic Description of Future climate”; d4PDF) to examine physical mechanisms responsible for the increasing hot summers and attribute to the anthropogenic influences or natural climate variability. 60km resolution MRI-AGCM ensemble simulations can reproduce historical variations in the mean temperature and warm extremes. Natural SST variability in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans contribute to the decadal variation in the frequency of hot summers in the Northern Hemisphere middle latitude. For example, the surface temperature over western North America, including California, is largely influenced by anomalous atmospheric circulation pattern associated with Pacific SST variability. Future projections based on anomalous SST patterns derived from coupled climate model simulations will also be introduced.",

            "abstract": "Gas-/aerosol-phase (PM2.5) amines/aminium salts and their photochemical oxidation products were simultaneously measured with a FIGAERO-HRToF-CIMS using water clusters of hydronium ions (H3O+(H2O)n, n = 1, 2,3) as reagent ions. Measurements were performed from 26 August to 17 September 2014 in Nanjing, a typical megacity in China. The major detected oxidation products of amines included amides, imines, and nitrosamines. All species except imines were predominantly present in the aerosol phase. The relative abundances (in molarity) of aerosol-phase ammonium, aminium, amidium, iminium, and nitrosaminium ions respectively ranged from 98.84%, 0.50%, 0.26%, 0.32%, and 0.07% in a clean day case to 84.32%, 4.23%, 2.84%, 2.78%, and 5.82% in a polluted day case. Diurnal variations of particulate aminium ions and amidium ions were found anti-correlated. Aminium ions were lower in the daytime and started building up during nighttime. Amidium daytime profiles, on the contrary, followed closely with the solar radiation intensity, indicating that amides were most likely produced by photochemistry instead of multiphase chemistry. The thermograms of aminium ions and their oxidation products in ambient samples showed broadened peaks spanning from ~60 °C to ~120 °C. However, laboratory tests using pure methylaminium sulfate salt produced sharp peaks centered around 158 °C. These findings indicated that aminium ions might not exist as thermostable sulfate salts in the aerosol phase as suggested by their strong basicity.",

            "abstract": "We examine the long-term slip history of the Banyak Islands section of the Sunda megathrust, which stretches for ~100 km between the islands of Simeulue and Nias offshore northern Sumatra. In the last decade this section has ruptured in two large earthquakes: the great Mw 8.6 2005 Nias-Simeulue earthquake and a previously unstudied Mw 7.8 earthquake that occurred five years later in April 2010. Using data from the Sumatra GPS Array (SuGAr), we model the coseismic slip distributions of these earthquakes. The 2005 rupture had a low-slip patch near the Banyak Islands (with higher slip patches on either side along-strike), and we show that the 2010 earthquake rupture coincides with this low-slip patch. The uplift pattern in the coral records suggest that the 2005 rupture might have been similar to its 1861 predecessor [Meltzner et al., 2015]. We investigate whether the low coseismic slip behavior of the Banyak Islands section is persistent for great earthquakes in this region. Coral records also show that the Banyak Islands section had a 15-year-long slow slip event between 1966 and 1981, immediately down-dip of the 2010 rupture patch [Tsang et al., 2015, in press]. The complex slip history in this section might result from differences in frictional properties, or structural features that could include a transform fault in the downgoing slab, a bend in the megathrust, and an extension of the Batee fault zone in the upper plate. We explore candidates for the cause of the diverse slip behavior of this patch. Understanding these structural and morphological controls on megathrust slip behavior has important implications for seismic hazard analyses.",

            "abstract": "RAL has developed an optimal estimation scheme to retrieve global height-resolved information on methane from IASI measurements in the thermal infrared (7.9 micron) band. The use of IASI thermal infrared observations produces methane data at relatively high spatial resolution, both day and night, over land and ocean. The retrieval scheme extracts two independent pieces of information on the profile, with sensitivity extending into the lower troposphere. Column-averaged mixing ratios are derived from the retrieved profile with a precision of 20-40 ppbv. The retrieval scheme has been extensively validated and shown to perform well in comparison with column-averages from both ground-based observations (TCCON) and from the satellite short-wave infrared sounder GOSAT; a paper is currently in preparation (R.Siddans et al., ‘Global height-resolved methane retrievals from IASI’).\nA limitation of thermal infrared retrievals is that sensitivity to the boundary layer is low compared to short-wave infrared sounders. However, IASI also measures methane lines in the 3.7 micron spectral range, where there is significant solar contribution in the daytime over land. Utilising this spectral region therefore has the potential to increase IASI sensitivity to methane in the boundary layer, although the 3.7 micron band has yet to be exploited due to the complexity of modelling both solar and thermal contributions to the measurements and the relatively high noise level of IASI in this spectral region.\nA continuous series of observations are planned by IASI on MetOp-A, -B and –C, followed by IASI-NG on MetOp-SG, covering the period from 2007-2040. Here we present 7 years of global methane retrievals from IASI MetOp-A thermal infrared data, spanning the period 2007-2013, along with validation and model comparison results. We also present early findings from an investigation into the potential of adding information on near-surface methane by exploiting the 3.7 micron band.",

            "abstract": "Microtremor array measurements and three-component microtremor measurements have been performed at the west coast of Hawaii Island (Figure.1). Two seismographs with three-component accelerometers were used for data acquisition. At each site, one seismograph was fixed in one place and data was acquired at that location for the entire survey. Data was acquired by a second seismograph at larger separations ranging from 5 to 3403m from the fixed seismograph. Data acquisition was repeated at each new separation. In each measurement, 10 to 60 minutes of ambient noise was recorded. As the separations of seismographs increased, the record length of ambient noise was increased. The sampling interval used was 10msec. An entire measurement took several hours. Data acquisition was performed in the day-time and the seismographs were placed in relatively quiet places such as in parks or residential areas. A spatial autocorrelation was used for calculating phase velocity and a clear dispersion curve (Figure 2a) was obtained in frequency range from 0.2 to 30 Hz. A joint inversion was applied to the observed dispersion curve, and H/V spectrum, and S-wave velocity model was analyzed for the site. In the inversion, phase velocities of the dispersion curve and the absolute value and peak frequencies of the H/V spectra were used as observation data. The unknown parameters were layer thickness and S-wave velocity. A Genetic Algorithm was used for optimization. Theoretical H/V spectra and phase velocities are generated by calculating the weighted average of the fundamental mode and higher modes (up to the 5th mode) based on medium response.\nFigure 2b shows an S-wave velocity model obtained by the inversion. We can see that a low velocity layer with S-wave velocity from 250 to 700 m/s exists to a depth of 90 m. A velocity layer with S-wave velocity from 900 to 1500 m/s exists at a depth range of 90 to 1300 m. Bedrock with S-wave velocity about 3000 m/s exists at a depth of 2200 m.",

            "abstract": "The project COSC (Collisional Orogeny in the Scandinavian Caledonides) focuses on the mid Paleozoic Caledonide Orogen in Scandinavia in order to better understand orogenic processes, from the past and in recent active mountain belts. The Scandinavian Caledonides provide a well preserved example of a Paleozoic continent-continent collision, where the surface geology in combination with geophysical data provide control of the geometry of the Caledonian structure.\nIn 2014 the COSC-1 borehole was successfully drilled through the Seve Nappe Complex (SNC) to ~ 2.5 km depth near the town of Åre (central Sweden). Subsequently a major seismic survey was conducted in and around the COSC-1 borehole which comprised both seismic reflection and transmission experiments. This will allow extrapolation of results from core analysis and downhole logging to the structures around the borehole. The survey consisted of three simultaneous experiments: 1) a high-resolution zero-offset Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP), 2) a multi-azimuthal walkaway VSP in combination with three long offset surface receiver lines, and 3) a limited 3D seismic survey.\nIn this study data from the multi-azimuthal walkaway VSP experiment and the long offset surface lines were used to derive a detailed velocity model around the borehole from the inversion of first arrival traveltimes. The P-wave velocity profile at the borehole obtained by this tomography approach correlates in general with sonic velocities measured during borehole logging and with interval velocities calculated from the zero-offset VSP data, however the absolute values are always significantly higher. This is probably due to the presence of significant seismic anisotropy in the SNC which has also been observed in ultrasonic lab measurements. The obtained anisotropic velocity model serves as the basis for the ongoing application of imaging approaches like pre-stack depth migration techniques.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical measurements made during the South Island Geophysical Transect (SIGHT) and the Southern Alps Passive Seismic Experiment (SAPSE) identified a region of anomalously low elastic wave velocity at depth adjacent to New Zealand’s Alpine Fault. In the same area there is an anomaly of increased electrical conductivity, identified in magnetotelluric surveys across the Southern Alps. These anomalies have been assumed to relate to the presence of fluids. In particular, enhanced resistivity may result from interconnected fluid or graphite on the grain scale within ductilely shearing rock. These fluids were released from the lower crust as it metamorphosed during burial into the base of the thickened crust beneath New Zealand’s Southern Alps. Graphite, observed in the Alpine Schist and exhumed hanging wall mylonites, is hypothesized to be remobilized by and precipitated from these fluids in trace amounts to contribute to the high conductivity. Pore decorated grain boundaries, which impart dynamic permeability during shear, could allow upward migration of over pressured fluids and potentially graphite, until they reach an array of near vertical backshears adjacent to the Alpine Fault. Outcrops along the hanging wall of the Alpine Fault expose rock exhumed from subsurface regions. To identify the causes of the large scale geophysical anomalies, we investigated static rock elastic, magnetic and electrical properties of the exhumed rocks on a hand sample scale. We will present measurements of phase anisotropy with respect to foliation to verify the anomaly is present at hand sample scale. We consider how geophysical measurements vary with mineralogical content and distribution, determined by both XRD derived bulk mineralogy and thin section observations. We aim to identify the microscale source of the geophysical anomaly and determine the relative contribution of different mineral phases.",

            "abstract": "The Alpine Fault, New Zealand is an oblique slip thrust with significantly high slip rate, and its dip-slip component causes the rapid uplift of the Southern Alps and the extremely high geothermal gradient in it. Thermoluminescence (TL) dating is a method using the phenomenon that energy accumulated in the crystal from radiation of surrounding radioactive elements is reemitted in the form of light when heating the minerals. This method covers a wide range of age from 1,000 to 1,000,000 years, and has relatively low reset temperature for the accumulation of radiation dose. Therefore, TL dating is a feasible geochronometry for the reconstruction of the thermal history of the area with very high uplifting rate. In order to determine uplifting rates and their distribution in the Southern Alps adjacent to the Alpine fault, ten rock samples were collected for TL dating in the distance 1 km from main fault plane along the Stony Creek. All the samples commonly include quartz veins which are folded tightly or in isoclinal form parallel to the foliations. TL dating was performed using quartz grains separated from host rock. A widely ranging TL ages are obtained from the hanging wall of the fault. The rocks within 600m from present shear zone yield ages ranging from 55.2 ka to 88.8 ka, showing older ages with distance from shear zone. Within 600 m to 900 m from the fault, relatively younger ages, 54.7 to 34.4 ka are obtained. Assuming the thermal gradient of 10 °C /100 m and exhumation rate of 10 m / kyr, the zeroing depth and temperature of TL signals is estimated from 350 to 900 m and from 45 to 100 °C, respectively. The range of TL ages is very large amounted to 50,000 years in the narrow zone. This may be responsible for the variety of TL zeroing temperatures in the hanging wall rocks rather than disturbance of thermal structure and/or inhomogeneity of uplifting rate in this area. Annealing tests are necessary to clarify the real properties of TL for each sample tested.",

            "abstract": "Projected future warming is particularly strong in northern high latitudes. Permafrost present in those areas contains high quantities of “frozen carbon” that could be released in the atmosphere. This communication will present different improved approaches to monitor the land-surface temperature (LST) variations in summer (without snow) and in winter (under snow cover), using microwave brightness temperatures.\n For the summer period, the method combines 37 GHz passive microwave and thermal infrared data to estimate LST during summer snow-free periods calibrated at a pixel-based scale, leading to a new LST dataset provided at 25 km scale and at an hourly time step during the ten-year analysis period (2000–2011). This product was locally evaluated at five experimental sites of the EU-PAGE21 project against air temperature measurements and meteorological model reanalysis, and compared to the MODIS LST product at both local and circumpolar scale. The results giving a mean RMSE of the order of 2.2 K demonstrate the usefulness of the microwave product, which is unaffected by clouds as opposed to thermal infrared products and offers a better resolution compared to model reanalysis.\nThe snow impact on ground temperature, due to its insulation properties modified by the climate changes, must also be monitored. For the winter period, we use satellite data (MODIS “LST” and passive microwave AMSR-E “Tb”) assimilated in a climate land surface scheme (CLASS) driven by reanalysis meteorological data and coupled with a radiative transfer model (HUT) in order to generate a daily Tb corresponding the simulated soil and snow conditions. The land surface scheme is adjusted to minimize the simulated Tbs against the measured Tbs. We show that the retrieved simulated ground-temperatures under the simulated modified snow cover is improved by up to 2 to 4 K when using satellite data compared to the simulated ground temperatures using the model (alone) without constraint.",

The observed ground motions show mach smaller PGA and response spectra level than the expected from the ground motion prediction equations. Although the large slip is mapped beneath the Kathmandu area by the source inversion result, it is very important issue to understand the reason that the ground motion is not so large.\nI compared source time functions and its Fourier amplitude spectra (source spectra) among the similar size earthquakes. From the finite source fault database of USGS from 2000, I have selected the crustal and inter-plate earthquakes whose seismic moment is ranging from twice to half of that of the Gorkha earthquake. I used the database of source time functions by USGS to avoid the inter-event systematic difference by the analysis method. Totally 17 events were selected. In the time domain, the source time function of the Gorkha earthquake seems to show smoother and smaller peak moment rate value among those of events.\nThe average and the standard deviation (α) of the source spectra of those events are calculated from the source time functions. The source spectra of the Gorkha earthquake show smaller value than the average-σ in the frequency range between 0.05 and about 1Hz. Although the source time functions from teleseismic records in the frequency range larger than about 0.5Hz is not so reliable and we need the information of more higher frequency range to discuss the near fault strong motion accelerations, the fact that the source spectra of the Gorkha earthquake shows systematically smaller than the similar size events would explain the weak generation of high frequency ground motions in the source area. This kind of analysis of the source time function database is useful to understand the near-source ground motion characteristics even there are not strong motion records.",

This area is of particular interest because it experienced a number of Phanerozoic crustal building events including the Emeishan Large Igneous Province, the India-Eurasia collision and Ailaoshan - Red River Fault displacement. In the Phan Si Pan uplift area, there are at least three different geochronological complexes, including: (1) Late Permian, (2) Eocene and (3) Early Oligocene. (1) The Late Permian silicic rocks are alkali ferroan A1-type granitic rocks with U/Pb ages of 251 ± 3 to 254 ± 3 Ma. The Late Permian silicic rocks of Phan Si Pan uplift area intrude the upper to middle crust and are considered to be part of the ELIP that was displaced during the India-Eurasian collision along the Ailaoshan-Red River Fault shear zone and adjacent structures (i.e. Song Da zone). Previous studies suggest the Late Permian granitic rocks were derived by fractional crystallization of high – Ti basaltic magma. (2) The Eocene rocks are alkali ferroan A1-type granites (U/Pb ages 49 ± 0.9 Ma) and are spatially associated with the Late Permian granitic rocks. The trace element ratios of this granite are similar to the Late Permian rocks (Th/Nb=0.2, Th/Ta = 2.5, Nb/U = 24, Nb/La =1.2, Sr/Y=1). The origin of the Eocene granite is uncertain but it is possible that it formed by fractional crystallization of a mafic magma during a period of extension within the Yangtze Block around the time of the India-Eurasia collision.\n (3) The Early Oligocene granite is characterized as a peraluminous within-plate granite with U/Pb ages of 31.3 ± 0.4 to 34 ± 1 Ma. The Early Oligocene granite has trace element ratios (Th/Nb = 2.1, Th/Ta = 22.6, Nb/U = 4.4, Nb/La = 0.4, Sr/Y = 60.4) similar to crust melts. The high Sr/Y ratio (Sr/Y = 20 - 205) indicates a lower crust source that was garnet-bearing. The Phan Si Pan uplift was neither a subduction zone nor an arc environment, during the Early Oligocene thus the granite may have formed as the result of partial melting lower crust by heat from an unknown within plate hot zone (mantle plume?).",

Two geological sampling campaigns were conducted to get the knowledge of hydrological properties of soil in the study area of 200×200 m2 around SG station in MH.\nPRINCIPLE OF TIME LAPSE 3D HYDROGEOLOGICAL MODEL\nThe model of study site consists of the surfaces of ground and bedrock gridded with 2×2 m2 resolution. The height of GW table was interpolated to 2×2×0.1 m3 grid between GW and SM monitoring points. Close to the outline of the study site and areas lacking of sensors GW table was defined by extrapolation and considering the geological information of the area. The bedrock porosity is 2% and soil porosity determined by geological information and SM recordings is from 5 to 35%. Only fully saturated media is considered in the time lapse model excluding unsaturated one.\nBENEFICIERS\nWith a new model the fluctuation of GW table can be followed with ranging time lapses from 1 minute to 1 month. The gravity effect caused by the variation of GW table can be calculated more accurate than before in MH. Moreover, the new model can be validated and refined by measured gravity, i.e. hydrological model can be improved by SG recordings (Figure 1).",

            "abstract": "Theoretical bounce resonance diffusion coefficients for interactions between electrons and magnetosonic waves are calculated and validated using guiding-center test particle simulations. First, we compare the theoretical diffusion coefficients of Roberts and Schulz with test particle simulations and find perfect agreement. However, the theoretical diffusion coefficients of Roberts and Schulz assume waves to be present on the whole trajectories of particles; therefore, they are not directly applicable to magnetosonic waves, which are found to be confined to equatorial regions from observations. Second, we derive a new set of bounce-resonance diffusion coefficients, taking into consideration the equatorial confinement of magnetosonic waves. These new diffusion coefficients are also validated by test particle simulations. Using a previously published magnetosonic wave model, our results demonstrate that bounce-resonance diffusion mainly results in strong pitch angle scattering of energetic electrons even with a moderate wave amplitude of 50 pT. We conclude that bounce-resonance diffusion plays an important role in relativistic electron dynamics and should be incorporated into global radiation belt modeling.",

            "abstract": "Landfast sea ice is a type of sea ice adjacent to the coast and immobile for a certain period of time. It is important to analyze the temporal and spatial variation of landfast ice because it has significant influences on marine ecosystem and the safe operation of icebreaker vessels. However, it has been a difficult task for both remote sensing and in situ observation to discriminate landfast ice from other types of sea ice, such as pack ice, and also to understand the dynamics and internal strss-strain of fast ice. In this study, we identify landfast ice and its annual variation in Terra Nova Bay (74° 37′ 4\"S, 164° 13′ 7\"E), East Antarctica, where Jangbogo Antarctic Research Station has recently been constructed in 2014, by using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology. We generated 38 interferograms having temporal baselines of 1-9 days out of 62 COSMO–SkyMed SAR images over Terra Nova Bay obtained from December 2010 to January 2012. Landfast ice began to melt in November 2011 when air temperature raised above freezing point but lasted more than two month to the end of the study period in January 2012. No meaningful relationship was found between sea ice extent and wind and current. Glacial strain (~67cm/day) is similar to tidal strain (~40 cm) so that they appear similar in one-day InSAR. As glacial stress is cumulative while tidal stress is oscillatory, InSAR images with weekly temporal baseline (7~9 days) revealed that a consistent motion of Campbell Glacier Tongue (CGT) is pushing the sea ice continuously to make interferometric fringes parallel to the glacier-sea ice contacts. Glacial interferometric fringe is parallel to the glacier-sea ice contact lines while tidal strain should be parallel to the coastlines defined by sea shore and glacier tongue. DDInSAR operation removed the consistent glacial strain leaving tidal strain alone so that the response of fast ice to tide can be used to deduce physical properties of sea ice in various ice stages. One-day InSAR images revealed that fast ice is not attached to CGT in the early ice formation stages while they began to couple with each other so that the entire glacial motion of up to 67cm/day is transferred directly to fast ice. In the final thawing stage just before ice breakage, ocean wave travelling through the fast ice is also observed by one-day InSAR.",

            "abstract": "Modeling flow in porous media is relevant for many environmental, energy and industrial applications. From an environmental perspective, the relevance of porous media flow becomes evident in subsurface hydrology. In general, flow in natural porous media is at low Reynolds numbers, yet the large variability in the hydraulic conductivity values encountered in natural aquifers leads to highly heterogeneous flow fields. This natural variability in the conductivity field will affect both dilution rates of non reactive tracers and reactive mixing. A physical consequence of this heterogeneity is also the presence of localized kinematical features such as straining, shearing and vorticity in the fluid element. These kinematical features will influence the shape of solute clouds and its fate. While in porous media straining and shearing have been considered as important kinematical features controlling the shape of the plume and consequently mixing, much less attention has been devoted to vorticity, which can be defined as the anti-symmetric component of the velocity gradient tensor. In the present work we analyze how vorticity is related to large scale heterogeneity, as described by global parameters such as the log-conductivity variance and integral scale, and porous microstructure. Following a micro-mechanical approach, the medium is schematized as an ensemble of independent inclusions placed at random in a homogeneous matrix. Adopting this model permits to solve the flow problem by means of only few parameters, such as the conductivity contrast, the volume fraction and the shape and inclination of the inclusions, the latter two properties representing the microstructure. Through this conceptualization, it is possible to approximate the structure of natural heterogeneous porous media. We show that vorticity depends on both conductivity contrast, epitomized by the log-conductivity variance, and the microstructure. In addition, vorticity and lateral dispersion are related, as both increase with conductivity contrast. The latter is the critical parameter controlling the spreading rate. However this relationship is not univocal, since increasing anisotropy ratio leads to an opposite trend in vorticity and dispersion values.",

The silicate minerals are known to be dissolved by organic acids and polysaccharides known as bacteria metabolites. The metabolic activity of bacteria therefore plays an important role in the interaction between dissolution of the silicate minerals and formation of secondary minerals. However, little is known about the secondary mineral formation process associated with the bacterial metabolism. To clarify the bacterial effect on the mineral dissolution and the secondary mineral formation, we closely investigated the effect of bacterial activity on surface texture modification and chemical composition changes of plagioclase which is the most abundant silicate mineral in the earth’s crust. The bacteria were isolated from soil and then added in a suitable medium with several plagioclase fragments (Ab100% and An100%). It was incubated for 10 days. Al and Si concentrations in the medium were measured by ICP-AES to monitor the dissolution of the plagioclase. Secondary mineral formation during the incubation was observed by TEM, EDS and SAED methods. The authors will give the experiment results and discuss the effect of bacterial activity on the plagioclase dissolution and the secondary mineral formation in detail.",

            "abstract": "Focal mechanism determination is an important content in modern seismology. Currently, it is mainly realized by inverting seismic and geodetic data. For large earthquakes, however, there are some limitations for these two data sets. In seismic data inversion, the point-source approximation demands both epicentral distance and wavelength much larger than the source dimension. Thus very low frequency need to be used, and sometimes they may exceed the response range of broadband seismometers. For geodetic data, since the surface deformation attenuates with the square of epicentral distance, it is hard to use the far-field data to deduce the point-source mechanism.In this work, we introduce the tsunami wave data into mechanism determinations. Because of the long-periods and slow attenuation, tsunami wave can to some extent overcome the above problems existing in seismic and geodetic data. For point source model, by ignoring the source volume change, the focal mechanism can be represented by a linear combination of five characterized focal mechanisms (Kikuchi and Kanamori, 1991). So if we calculate the theory tsunami wave (TTW) of the characterized focal mechanisms, we can get the focal mechanism with the observed tsunami wave (OTW) through a linear optimization.In the application to the 2011 Tohoku Mw9.0 earthquake, the mechanism determined by tsunami wave inversion is in a good agreement with our current knowledge of the earthquake, further confirming that it was a thrust event. In addition, the tsunami wave inversion shows an advantage in constraining the centroid depth, which is relatively difficult in some traditional studies.",

            "abstract": "Kelud volcano, (Indonesia) has in recent years demonstrated the classical dichotomy of eruptive styles, with an effusive dome eruption in 2007-08 and an explosive Plinian eruption in 2014, causing widespread ash fall and the evacuation of 100,000 people. This study compares both the deep (magma reservoir) and shallow (conduit feeder system) magmatic processes that occurred before both eruptions, using a combination of petrography as well as analytical and experimental petrology. The first results from this study show that despite their significant differences in eruptive style, these eruption products had identical magma compositions, comprising of basaltic andesite. Furthermore, the phenocryst assemblage and mineral compositions of the explosive and effusive products are also similar, pointing towards equivalent pre-eruptive storage conditions. The key difference lies within the microlite populations and matrix glass chemistry. These suggest that the eruptive style is determined by the ascent history, with different P(H2O)-T-t paths leading to either effusive or explosive behavior. Interestingly, some plagioclase phenocrysts preserve progressive capture of small melt inclusions during different stages of crystal growth. Raman spectroscopic analysis of these small melt inclusions from crystal core to rim, provides a unique view of magmatic water contents during magma reservoir evolution. We speculate that water content variations (~0.6 – 2.3%) may exist due to a complex interplay between the fractionating basaltic andesite and fresh mafic injections. This study will also show the preliminary results from the first phase experiments done on Kelud volcanics, constraining the magmatic storage conditions preceding both the 2014 explosive and 2007 effusive eruptions.",

Their sources are often located on the interplate boundary (Rogers and Dragert, 2003; Shelly et al, 2006; La Rocca, 2009), consistent with fluids released by the dehydration of subducted plates (Hacker et al., 2003). Reports of tremors in the overriding continental crust of several subduction zones in the world (Kao et al., 2005; Payero et al., 2008; Ide, 2012) suggest fluid circulation at shallower depths but potential fluid paths are poorly documented. Here we obtained seismic observations from receiver functions that evidence the close association between the shallow tremor zone, electrical conductivity, and tectonic features of the Cascadia overriding plate. A seismic discontinuity near 15 km depth in the crust of the overriding North American plate is attributed to the Conrad discontinuity. This interface is segmented, and its interruption is spatially correlated with conductive regions and shallow swarms of seismicity and non-volcanic tremors. These observations suggest that shallow fluid circulation, tremors and seismicity are controlled by fault zones limiting blocks of accreted terranes in the overriding plate (Brudzinski and Allen, 2007). These zones constitute fluid “escape” routes that may contribute unloading fluid pressure on the megathrust.\nObara, K. (2002). Science, 296, 1679-1681.\nRogers, G., & Dragert, H. (2003).

            "abstract": "Impacts of climate change threaten California farmers in a number of ways, most importantly through a decline in freshwater availability, concurrent with a rise in water demand. The future of California’s multibillion-dollar agricultural industry depends on increasing water use efficiency on farms. In coastal California, the growing season of economically important crops overlaps with the occurrence of coastal fog, which buffers the summer dry season through shading effects and direct water inputs. While the impacts of coastal fog on plant biology have been extensively studied in natural ecosystems, very few studies have evaluated its direct effects on the water and energy budgets of agricultural systems. The objective of this study was to develop a mechanistic understanding of the relationships between coastal fog and the water and energy budgets of croplands in order to improve estimates of crop-scale evapotranspiration rates, which has potential to curtail groundwater use based on local cloud meteorology. We established three sites on strawberry farms along a coastal-inland gradient in the Salinas Valley, California. At each site, we installed a passive fog collector and a micrometeorological station to monitor variation in microclimate conditions. Flow meters were installed in drip lines to quantify irrigation amount and timing. To assess plant response to foggy and non-foggy conditions, we collected measurements of photosynthesis and transpiration rates at the leaf and canopy-scale between June-September 2015. We found that canopy-level transpiration rates on foggy days were reduced by half compared to sunny, clear days (1.5 and 3 mmol H2O m-2 s-1, respectively). Whereas the amount of direct fog water inputs to the soil did not differ significantly between foggy and clear days, average photosynthetically active radiation between 0900-1100 hr. was reduced from 1500 to 500 μmol photons m-2 s-1 between these sampling periods. Our results provide convincing evidence that shading effects by fog is a primary influence on crop transpiration rates in coastal agricultural fields during summer. The outcome of our research provides a first step towards making more accurate estimates of how much irrigation water may be reduced during foggy periods without sacrificing crop yields on coastal agricultural lands.",

One pronounced feature of the magnetosheath is the presence of dawn-dusk asymmetries which are to some extent, dependent on upstream solar wind conditions. The present poster focuses exclusively on the dawn-dusk asymmetry of ion density in close vicinity to the dayside magnetopause. We study the yearly variation of the magnitude of this asymmetry over the THEMIS era between 2008 and 2015. During the 3 years surrounding 2009 (solar minimum) we observe a strong dawn-favoured asymmetry (~20%) and then a reduced value for the years following 2011. From a statistical standpoint, we attempt to identify the physical mechanisms responsible for this yearly variation. We also investigate the underlying mechanism generating the asymmetry from both an MHD and kinetic perspective. The susceptibility of the magnetopause to the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) depends also on the density gradient of the adjacent magnetopause plasma.

            "abstract": "We present the results of a study of the impact of orbit positioning noise (OPN) caused by incomplete knowledge of the Earth’s gravity field on gravity models estimated from satellite gravity data.\nThe OPN is simulated as the difference between two sets of orbits integrated on the basis of different static gravity field models. The OPN is propagated into ll-SST data, here computed as averaged inter-satellite accelerations projected onto the Line of Sight (LoS) vector between the two satellites.\nWe consider the cartwheel formation (CF), pendulum formation (PF), and trailing formation (TF) as they produce a different dominant orientation of the LoS vector. Given the polar orbits of the formations, the LoS vector is mainly aligned with the North-South direction in the TF, with the East-West direction in the PF (i.e. no along-track offset), and contains a radial component in the CF.\nAn analytical analysis predicts that the CF suffers from a very high sensitivity to the OPN. This is a fundamental characteristic of this formation, which results from the amplification of this noise by diagonal components of the gravity gradient tensor (defined in the local frame) during the propagation into satellite gravity data. In contrast, the OPN in the data from PF and TF is only scaled by off-diagonal gravity gradient components, which are much smaller than the diagonal tensor components.\nA numerical analysis shows that the effect of the OPN is similar in the data collected by the TF and the PF. The amplification of the OPN errors for the CF leads to errors in the gravity model that are three orders of magnitude larger than those in case of the PF. This means that any implementation of the CF will most likely produce data with relatively low quality since this error dominates the error budget, especially at low frequencies. This is particularly critical for future gravimetric missions that will be equipped with highly accurate ranging sensors.",

            "abstract": "In fact, many cities in the world are established on the active faults. As the rapid urban development, thousands of large facilities, such as ultrahigh buildings, supersized bridges, railway, and so on, are built near or on the faults, which may change the balance of faults and induce urban earthquake. Therefore, it is significant to delineate effectively the faults for urban planning construction and social sustainable development. Due to dense buildings in urban area, the ordinary approaches to identify active faults, like geological survey, artificial seismic exploration and electromagnetic exploration, are not convenient to be carried out. Gravity, reflecting the mass distribution of the Earth’s interior, provides a more efficient and convenient method to delineate urban faults. The present study is an attempt to propose a novel gravity method, multi-scale gravity analysis, for identifying urban active faults and determining their stability. Firstly, the gravity anomalies are decomposed by wavelet multi-scale analysis. Secondly, based on the decomposed gravity anomalies, the crust is layered and the multilayer horizontal tectonic stress is inverted. Lastly, the decomposed anomalies and the inverted horizontal tectonic stress are used to infer the distribution and stability of main active faults. For validating our method, a case study on active faults in Shenzhen City is processed. The results show that the distribution of decomposed gravity anomalies and multilayer horizontal tectonic stress are controlled significantly by the strike of the main faults and can be used to infer depths of the faults. The main faults in Shenzhen may range from 4km to 20km in the depth. Each layer of the crust is nearly equipressure since the horizontal tectonic stress has small amplitude. It indicates that the main faults in Shenzhen are relatively stable and have no serious impact on planning and construction of the city.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of postseismic deformation following large earthquakes plays a significant role in determining future regional seismic hazard. Patches of the coseismic fault plane that failed to rupture in the initial earthquake may fail in future damaging earthquakes or release stress by slipping aseismically. Furthermore, postseismic deformation offers a rare opportunity to probe the rheology of fault zones, providing important constraints for models of the earthquake deformation cycle.\nThe April 2015 M7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake ruptured a major thrust fault beneath central Nepal. Rupture began at ~15 km depth and appears to have propagated laterally along a shallow decollement. Geodetic and seismological observations suggest that most coseismic slip occurred on the deepest half of the fault plane, between the ramp under the high Himalaya and Kathmandu. 50 km of the fault south from Kathmandu to the Main Frontal Thrust did not fail coseismically, consistent with a lack of clear surface ruptures.\nAnalysis of GPS data suggests the entire Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) is locked from the surface to the depth of the Gorkha earthquake. The behaviour of the MHT to the west and up-dip of the Gorkha earthquake in the postseismic period is essential for our understanding of the ongoing seismic hazard. These sections of the fault may be relieving stresses aseismically or still be accumulating stresses which could be released in future, large earthquakes. Attempting to answer why these sections of the fault are behaving as they are will also place constraints on fault zone rheology.\nThe launch of ESA's Sentinal-1A allows for monitoring of postseismic deformation every 12 days over a large area. This short repeat time and large coverage allows us to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of postseismic deformation in great detail and complements GPS results from the region. We will present a preliminary analysis of postseismic deformation in the 6 months following the earthquake using data from Sentinel-1A. Preliminary results suggest little postseismic deformation up-dip of the 2015 rupture.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainties remain about the sensitivity of eroding landscapes to climate changes over a range of frequencies and amplitudes. Numerical models suggest that simple catchment-fan systems should be responsive to glacial-interglacial climate cycles, recording them in both sediment flux and the grain size distribution of their deposits. However these models are largely untested and the propagation of climatic signals through simple sediment routing systems remains contentious. Here, we present detailed sedimentological data from 8 debris flow fans in Owens Valley, eastern California. These fans have an exceptionally well-constrained depositional record spanning the last 120 ka, which we use to examine how sediment export has varied as a function of high-amplitude climate changes. We find a strong and sustained relationship between debris flow grain size and paleoclimate proxies over an entire glacial-interglacial cycle, with significantly coarser-grained deposits correlated with warm and dry conditions. Our data suggest these systems are highly reactive to climate forcing, with a short response timescale of <10 ka and no evidence of signal buffering, which we interpret to be driven by rapid sediment transfer from source to sink. We demonstrate that debris flow grain size follows an exponential relationship with temperature, coarsening at a rate of ~10 % per °C. Using this observation, and a known relationship between temperature and storm intensity, we propose that the climate signal recorded in these fan deposits captures changing storm intensity during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. This study offers a direct test of existing models of catchment-fan systems, confirming that glacial-interglacial climate changes can be clearly expressed in their grain size records. Our results also suggest that these debris flow deposits contain a high-resolution, testable record of past storm intensity, and that storminess is the primary control on their sedimentological properties.",

            "abstract": "Recently deep thermochemical structures have been studied intensively. The observed large anomalies with reduced seismic velocities (LLSVPs) beneath Africa and the Pacific are obtained in numerical models as an initial dense layer at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) is pushed up to piles by the convective flow (e.g., McNamara et al., EPSL 229, 1-9, 2010). Adding a dense CMB layer to a model featuring active plate tectonics, Trim et al. (EPSL 405, 1-14, 2014) find that surface mobility is strongly hindered by the dense material and can even vanish completely for a CMB layer that has a too high density or too large a volume.\nIn a further study we employed a fully rheological model in which oceanic plates form self-consistently. We observe that an initial dense CMB layer strongly affects the formation of plates and therefore the onset time of plate tectonics. We present a systematic 2D parameter study exploring the time of plate initiation and discuss the resulting deep thermal and thermochemical structures in a self-consistent thermochemical mantle convection system.",

Finally, dissolved loads, suspended loads and river\nbottom sediments were analyzed for their major and trace elements contents, and a geochemical mass balance was built in\norder to quantify both chemical and mechanical erosion rates.\nResults show a good agreement between long-term erosion rates derived\nfrom initial topography reconstructions and so called short-term\nerosion rates from the geochemical mass balance analyses of dissolved and\nsuspended load. The cosmogenic method largely underestimates erosion rates, but comparison with the geochemical mass balance shows that episodic landslides dominate erosion of the basins.\nFinally a new approach of the geochemical mass balance with a systematic\nstudy along the range of river sediment grain size allows to depict weathering vs genesis and transport of sediments.",

            "abstract": "Retention basins and urban reservoirs are increasingly used to support drinking water supply in large metropolitan contexts, since they make use of a resource, i.e., stormwater, that would be otherwise wasted, thus limiting the amount of water extracted from natural systems or produced with energy-intensive techniques. Yet, the operation of these infrastructures faces a twofold challenge. First, the presence of large impervious areas in urban catchments results in high discharge peaks and runoff volumes and a fast runoff response to rainfall, with consequent very short times of concentration. Second, stormwater transports large amount of pollutants to the receiving water bodies. This paper contributes a novel High-Performance Integrated Control framework to support the real-time operation of urban water supply storages affected by water quality problems. We use a 3D hydrodynamic, high-fidelity, simulation model to predict the main water quality dynamics and inform a real-time controller based on Model Predictive Control. We integrate the simulation model into the control scheme by a model reduction process, where the high-fidelity simulator is first used to identify and then replaced by a low-order dynamic emulator, which runs orders of magnitude faster. The framework is used to design the hourly operation of Marina Reservoir, a 3.2 Mm3 stormwater-fed reservoir located in the centre of Singapore operated for drinking water supply and flood control. Because of its recent formation from a former estuary, the reservoir suffers from high salinity levels, whose dynamics is modelled with Delft3D-FLOW. Results show that the real-time operation designed by our framework drops the minimum salinity levels of nearly 30% while reducing the average annual deficit of drinking water supply by about two times the active storage of the reservoir. Such a win-win solution is obtained by means of a model reduction process that reduced the dimensionality of Delft3D-FLOW by three orders of magnitude.",

Here, we predicted the carbon emission of China during the period 2011~2050 under seven scenarios, and analyzed the scientific and social implications of realizing the goal. Our results showed that: (1) C emissions of China will reach their peaks at 2022~2045 (with peak values 3.15~5.10 Pg C), and the predicted decay rates of C intensity were 2.1~4.2% in 2011~2050; (2) the precondition that the national C emission reaches the peak before 2030 is that the annual decay rates of C intensity must exceed 3.3% , as decay rates under different scenarios were predicted higher than that except for Past G8 scenario; (3) the national C emission would reach the peak before 2030, if the government of China should realize the C emissions reduction goals of China's 12th five-year plan, climate commitments of Copenhagen and INDC; (4) Chinese government could realize the goal of C emission peaking around 2030 from just controlling C emission intensity , but associated with relatively higher government's burden. In summary, China’s C emission may well peak before 2030, meanwhile the combination of emissions reduction and economic macro-control would be demanded to avoid heavier social pressure of C emissions reduction occurred.",

            "abstract": "The Utsira formation is a large offshore saline aquifer in the North Sea that is considered a likely candidate for storage of CO2 emissions. Currently, the Utsira is host to the longest operating CO2 storage project, the Sleipner project, which has injected 1 Mt CO2/y since 1996. The entire Utsira formation has an estimated storage capacity of 15 Gt, which is equal to 300 Sleipner-sized projects in simultaneous operation for the next 50 years. Injectivity into the Utsira is exceptionally good, and no pressurization has been observed at Sleipner. The formation is over 100-m thick and comprised of unconsolidated sand with high porosity and permeability (30-40% and 1-3 Darcy). The Nordland shale has been characterized as a high-quality seal that is regionally thick, extensive and absent of significant faults.\nSignificant scale-up of CO2 injection into the Utsira is required to increase storage of regional CO2 emissions well beyond what is currently stored today. Full utilization of the Utsira storage capacity would result in injection rates >100 Mt/y, significantly larger than Sleipner. Despite the lack of pressure effects at Sleipner, higher injection rates will likely lead to pressure build-up in the Utsira. Relatively little is known about the magnitude of pressure build-up and resulting impact on caprock integrity with high-volume injection. The problem is complex, involving multiphase flow and mechanical deformation of the storage reservoir and the surrounding formations, and covers large spatial scales, ranging several hundred kilometers in lateral extent. There are significant challenges in applying fully coupled hydromechanical simulators to problems of this scale. The computational effort required to solve a resolved is significant, and efforts to reduce the complexity of the model are needed. In this study, simplified modeling approaches are investigated. A reduced order multiphase flow model coupled with a geomechanical model results in greater efficiency. Similarly, fully coupled hydromechanical models can be applied with single-phase flow conditions. Both approaches are applied to the Utsira and compared under different injection and boundary conditions. Large-scale pressure build-up and subsequent impact on caprock deformation are analyzed in the Utsira for high-volume injection rates.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between groundwater and surface water plays a dominant role in the geo-environment in arid or semi-arid basins, especially in the discharge area around rivers. Tóth (1963) found that the lowest reaches of a large-scale basin could be the discharge area of local, intermediate and regional groundwater flow systems with different circulation depths. However, little research has been devoted to identify the dominant source of river water from a specific flow system in real river basins. In this study, the source of water in the Dosit River in the Ordos Cretaceous Basin is examined. The main aquifer of the watershed is the poorly consolidated Cretaceous sandstone with a thickness of 700–1000 m, which is overlain locally by Tertiary mudstones and extensively by thin unconsolidated Quaternary sediments. There are numerous wells with different depths which provides an excellent opportunity to sample groundwater from different flow systems. In addition, all of the artesian wells belongs to the intermediate and regional flow systems. Therefore, the analysis of hydrogeochemical and isotope techniques were used to investigate groundwater sources and their associated discharging processes to the river. Based on the Piper plot, several groups with distinct geochemical compositions could be found, which shows that the river water was mixed with groundwater from local and intermediate flow systems in the upstream, and dominated by groundwater from the intermediate flow system in the downstream. The relationship between δ D and δ18O supports this scenario. According to the Gibbs scheme, groundwater chemical evolution is mainly controlled by rock dominance and evaporation process, while, an evaporation trend could be found in river water. These results not only enhance the understanding of chemical evolution of groundwater in the study area, but also indicated the importance of artesian wells.\n Tóth, J., 1963.

The total flux of carbon to UK rivers from the terrestrial biosphere was 21.8 tonnes C/km2/yr and the net catchment loss was 70%. Including the role of fluvial organic nitrogen means that for total nitrogen species UK rivers are gaining 9.6 tonnes N/km2/yr from the terrestrial biosphere but are losing 63% of this nitrogen by the tidal limit.\nIn a parallel study, in-situ experiments investigating rates of degradation in unfiltered surface water from a headwater, peat-dominated stream. Experiments were conducted on unfiltered samples (DOM and POM could be considered); on fresh samples (experiments were started stream-side); and over 70 hours (similar to in-stream residence time of the UK). The study found that the DOC concentration of samples in the daylight declined by 64%, compared with 6% decline for the samples kept in the dark: the POC loss in the light was 13%.

Initial rate kinetics in the light were as high as 3rd order, but the study could show that no single rate law could describe the whole diurnal degradation cycle.\nDeveloping a physically-based set of rate laws for the turnover of DOM and POM over the appropriate timescales showed that the derived set of rate laws was able to explain experimental data with a 13% MAPE based on turnover in three types of organic matter (particulate, labile dissolved, refractory dissolved) although the order and rate of reactions did change between sets of observations. The modelling suggests that activation energies are low and that processes are not sensitive to temperature change. Application of the modelling scheme to organic matter turnover in an English river, showed that annual removal of total organic carbon (TOC) was equivalent to a total in-stream loss rate of between 58% over a median in-stream residence time of 35 hours.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies revealed highly dynamic and rich behavior of microbial communities inhabiting soil aggregates. Modeling of these processes in three dimensional (unsaturated) pore networks provided insights into the unique conditions essential for coexistence of oxic and anoxic microsites that shape (and respond to) aerobic and anaerobic microbial communities. Soil hydration dynamics continuously alter the spatial extent of anoxic niches (hotspots) that flicker in time (hot moments) and support anaerobic microbial activity even in unsaturated and oxic soil profiles. We extend a model for individual-based microbial community growth in 3-D angular pore networks mimicking soil aggregates of different sizes placed in different ambient boundary conditions reflecting profiles of water, carbon, and oxygen in soil. An upscaling scheme was developed to account for aerobic and anaerobic activity within each aggregate class size and soil depth integrated over the aggregate size distribution in the soil for a range of hydration conditions. Results show that dynamic adjustments in microbial community composition affect CO2 and N2O production rates in good agreement with experimental data. The modeling approach addresses a long-standing challenge of linking hydration conditions to dynamic adjustments of microbial communities within “hotspots” with the emergence of “hot moments” reflecting high rates of denitrification and organic matter decomposition.",

            "abstract": "Bush encroachment describes a global problem which is especially facing the savanna ecosystem in Africa. Livestock is directly affected by decreasing grasslands and inedible invasive species which defines the process of bush encroachment. For many small scale farmers in developing countries livestock represents a type of insurance in times of crop failure or drought. Among that bush encroachment is also a problem for crop production. Studies on the mapping of bush encroachment so far focus on small scales using high-resolution data and rarely provide information beyond the national level. Therefore a process chain was developed using a multi-scale approach to detect bush encroachment for whole Africa. The bush encroachment map is calibrated with ground truth data provided by experts in Southern, Eastern and Western Africa. By up-scaling location specific information on different levels of remote sensing imagery – 30m with Landsat images and 250m with MODIS data – a map is created showing potential and actual areas of bush encroachment on the African continent and thereby provides an innovative approach to map bush encroachment on the regional scale. A classification approach links location data based on GPS information from experts to the respective pixel in the remote sensing imagery. Supervised classification is used while actual bush encroachment information represents the training samples for the up-scaling. The classification technique is based on Random Forests and regression trees, a machine learning classification approach. Working on multiple scales and with the help of field data an innovative approach can be presented showing areas affected by bush encroachment on the African continent. This information can help to prevent further grassland decrease and identify those regions where land management strategies are of high importance to sustain livestock keeping and thereby also secure livelihoods in rural areas.",

            "abstract": "The degree of coupling and the seismogenic properties of the plate interface at subduction zones are affected by the abundance of slab fluids and subducted sediments. High fluid input can cause high pore-fluid pressures in the subduction channel and decrease coupling leading to aseismic behaviour. Constraining fluid input and transfer is therefore important for understanding plate coupling and large earthquake hazard, particularly in places where geodetic and seismological constraints are scarce. We use P-wave traveltimes from several active source seismic experiments and P- and S-wave traveltimes from shallow and intermediate depth (< 150 km) local earthquakes recorded on a vast amphibious array of OBSs and land stations to recover the Vp and Vp/Vs structure of the central Lesser Antilles subduction zone. Our model extends between Martinique and Antigua from the prism to the arc and from the surface to a depth of 160 km. We find low Vp and high Vp/Vs ratio (> 1.80) on the top of the slab, at depths of up to 100 km. We interpret this high Vp/Vs ratio anomaly as evidence of elevated fluid content either as free fluids or as bound fluids in hydrated minerals (e.g. serpentinite). The strength and depth extent of the anomaly varies strongly from south to north along the subduction zone and correlates with variations in forearc morphology and with sediment input constrained by multi-channel seismic reflection profiles. The anomaly is stronger and extends to greater depth in the south, offshore Martinique, where sediment input is elevated due to the vicinity of the Orinoco delta. The gently dipping forearc slope observed in this region may be the result of weak coupling of the plate interface. A high Vp/Vs ratio is also observed in the forearc likely indicating a fractured and water-saturated overriding plate. On the other hand the anomaly is weaker and shallower offshore Guadeloupe, where sediment input is low due to subduction of the Barracuda ridge. Here a strong plate coupling is likely responsible for uplifting the inner forearc and formation of the Karukera spur. We infer that variations in plate coupling modulated by slab fluid transport and release are a major factor in determining the distribution of seismic slip in the Lesser Antilles subduction zone.",

This study used dynamic downscaling climate change data to (1) evaluate the extreme river aggradation and the sediment transfer processes under the worst historical conditions and projections for the late 21st century, and (2) change the extreme discharge to discuss the interaction on different flow intensities and sediment transfer processes by CCHE2D for the downstream of Gaoping River in southern Taiwan. The results show that the sediment aggradation in the historical period is 14 × 106 m3; instead, the sediment variation in the late 21st century is reduced by 15% compared to the historical period. Artificial structures play import roles in advancing sediment deposition and aggradation control in the Gaoping River. In addition, when peak flow discharges exceed threshold discharge, 10-yr return period discharge, and severe aggradation will occur in the Gaoping River bed (Figure 1). The bed changes will become gentler as the peak discharge increases. It indicates that extreme floods induce relatively severe degradation and significant floods will carry out relative aggrades in the whole Gaoping River bed. These findings assist in understanding the bed change processes under extreme typhoon rainfall events using dynamic downscaling climate change data.",

Under the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and implemented by the World Bank (WB), Nepal chosen as one of four countries best suitable for results-based payment system for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD and REDD+) scheme. At the national level Landsat based, from 1990 to 2000 the forest area has declined by 2%, i.e. by 1467 km2, whereas from 2000 to 2010 it has declined only by 0.12% i.e. 176 km2. A cost effective monitoring and evaluation system for REDD+ requires a balanced approach of remote sensing and ground measurements.\nThis paper provides, for Nepal a cost effective and operational 30 m Above Ground Biomass (AGB) estimation and mapping methodology using freely available satellite data integrated with field inventory. Leaf Area Index (LAI) generated based on propose methodology by Ganguly et al. (2012) using Landsat-8 the OLI cloud free images. To generate tree canopy height map, a density scatter graph between the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) estimated maximum height and Landsat LAI nearest to the center coordinates of the GLAS shots show a moderate but significant exponential correlation (31.211*LAI0.4593, R2= 0.33, RMSE=13.25 m). From the field well distributed circular (750m2 and 500m2), 1124 field plots (0.001% representation of forest cover) measured which were used for estimation AGB (ton/ha) using Sharma et al. (1990) proposed equations for all tree species of Nepal. A satisfactory linear relationship (AGB = 8.7018*Hmax-101.24, R2=0.67, RMSE=7.2 ton/ha) achieved between maximum canopy height (Hmax) and AGB (ton/ha). This cost effective and operational methodology is replicable, over 5-10 years with minimum ground samples through integration of satellite images.

            "abstract": "Up to Jurassic times the Antarctic and African continents were part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Some 185 Ma the onset of rifting caused the dispersal of this vast continent into several minor plates. The timing and geometry of the initial break-up between Africa and Antarctica as well as the amount of volcanism connected to this Jurassic rifting are still controversial. In the southern part of the Mozambique Channel a prominent basement high, the Beira High, forms a distinct crustal anomaly along the Mozambican margin. It is still controversial if this area of shallow basement is a continental fragment or was formed during a period of enhanced magmatism and is of oceanic origin.\nTherefore, a wide-angle seismic profile with 37 OBS/H was acquired starting from the deep Mozambique Channel, across the Beira High and terminating on the shelf off the Zambezi River. The main objectives are to provide constraints on the crustal composition and origin of the Beira High as well as the amount of volcanism and the position of the continent-ocean transition below the Zambezi Delta. To obtain a P-wave velocity model of this area the data were forward modeled by means of the 2D-Raytracing method.\nPreliminary results indicate a clear thickening of the crust below the Beira High up to 20-24 km. Evidences for a high velocity body are found in the area below the Zambezi shelf with velocities of 7.2-7.4 km/s and up to 5 km thickness. Oceanic basement velocities at the very eastern part of the line start with values of 5.5 km/s, and increase to 6.9 km/s at lower crustal levels, that are typical for Jurassic oceanic crust. Across the Beira High the starting velocity and its gradient slightly change, presenting typical values for continental fragments. However, due to a sparse ray coverage of diving waves for the Beira High lower crust, these velocities still have to be proved. Thus, we will introduce the final results of a Finite Difference amplitude modeling, which will constrain the lowermost velocity gradients to allow a sound interpretation of the Beira High origin. The acquired shipborne, magnetic data show a complex magnetic pattern and strong influences by the presence of lava flows and intrusions and require further investigations.\nWe will introduce the latest results of the joint interpretation of seismic and potential field data sets.",

            "abstract": "The world’s largest rivers deliver ~19 billion tonnes of sediment to the coastal zone annually, with a significant fraction sequestered in the large deltas that are home to 14% of the world’s population. Most (>70%) of these large deltas are under threat from a combination of rising sea levels and ground surface subsidence, while the rivers that feed them have also been subjected to damming, substantially reducing the sediment supply that is available for delta (re)construction.\nIn this paper we use new measurements of suspended sediment load, combined with hydrological modelling, to reconstruct inter-annual variations in sediment load with and without tropical cyclones during the period 1981-2005. We examine in particular the results at Kratie in Cambodia, a gauging station that is located within 250 km of the apex of the Mekong delta. Our results indicate that fluvial sediment loads at Kratie have undergone a large and rapid decline (at a rate of ~2 Mt/yr, reducing the annual sediment load in this period by ~50%) during the study period. This is a remarkable finding, but we also show that this decline in sediment load is attributable almost entirely to a commensurate decline in the proportion of the Mekong’s sediment load that is forced by tropical storms.\nOur results have profound implications. The Mekong’s great delta, the rice basket of SE Asia, is home to 17 million people. A sustainable supply of fluvial sediment is critical in preventing the Mekong’s delta being ‘drowned’ by rising sea levels. In recent years attention has been focused on the likely deleterious effects of hydropower dam construction in the Mekong Basin on the future sediment loads reaching the delta. However, it is evident that the delivery of sediment from the Mekong River has already undergone a substantial reduction, similar in magnitude to that associated with future dam-induced trapping, as a result of recent changes in tropical storm climatology. A continuing dearth of tropical storms may lead to the death of this great delta earlier than was previously anticipated.",

            "abstract": "Temporal variations of hydrological conditions exert direct influence over the deformation of the shallow crust. In the last years, geodetic measurements have shown that annual variations in total groundwater content induce time-varying deformation of the crust that are mostly reflected in the vertical component and that are frequently reproduced by time-varying loads over an elastic half-space. Here we present new GPS observations showing transient ground deformation in the Apennines (Italy), mostly evident in the horizontal components, that correlate with multi-annual hydrological signals as measured by rainfall, GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) and discharge of karstic springs. The observed transient signal is superimposed on the long-term ~3mm/yr NE-SW directed active extension, correlates with the seasonal recharge/discharge cycle of groundwater flow and its multi-annual variations and appears to modulate the intensity of tectonic extensional opening in those regions characterized by large carbonatic aquifers. In particular, periods of increasing discharge from karstic spring correlate with an enhanced extensional signal, whereas exhaustion periods (decreasing discharge) correlate with reduced extensional signal. Neither surface loading on an elastic medium nor a volumetric inflation source could explain both vertical and horizontal observed deformation. We suggest that the observed deformation is related to the presence of highly fractured shallow crust (upper 1-1.5 km) that deforms according to variable conditions of the hydraulic head within the large carbonate aquifers. Following these observations we model the observed horizontal and vertical time-dependent signal using simple tensile dislocations at shallow depth (< 1.5 km), whose opening is scaled to the discharge of the largest karstic spring, taken as a proxy for the regional elevation of the groundwater table within the carbonate aquifers. These new findings contribute to the understanding of the role of the karst systems in conveying large amount of water in the shallow crust and to an improved management of these important natural resources.",

Geological observations suggest that the regional crustal structure is inherited from the accretion of different terranes at Ordovician times and later reactivated during Andean compression since Miocene. Geophysical observations confirmed that the structure is extending in depth with décollement levels that accommodate crustal shortening in the region. In order to get a better insight on the shallow tectonics we computed high frequency local receiver functions from slab seismicity (~100 km depth). Local earthquakes present a higher frequency content that permits a better vertical resolution. Using a common conversion point (CCP) stacking method we obtained cross sections showing high-resolution crustal structure in the western part of the Pampean flat slab region, at the transition between the Precordillera and the Frontal Cordillera. Our results show a well-defined structure and their lateral extent for both units down to 80 km depth. In good agreement with previous studies, our higher resolution images better identify very shallow discontinuities putting more constraints on the relationships with the regional structural geology. Recent petrological analyses combined with RF high-resolution structure also allow us to better understand the regional crustal composition. Interestingly, we are able to observe a shifting structure beneath the Uspallata-Calingasta Valley, highlighting the differences in terms of crustal structure between the Precordillera and the Frontal Cordillera. Previously determined focal mechanisms in the region match well this shifting thrust structure down to ~40 km depth. Geological evidence suggests this suture corresponds to an early Devonian subduction zone and that this Devonian structure still accommodates deformation in the region even after intense compression and important crustal thickening during the past 20 million years.",

            "abstract": "The acoustic and gravity waves propagating in the planetary atmospheres have been studied intensively as markers of specific phenomena (tectonic events, explosions) or as contributors to the atmosphere dynamics. To get a better understanding of the physic behind these dynamic processes, both acoustic and gravity waves propagation should be modeled in an attenuating and windy 3D atmosphere from the ground to the upper thermosphere. Thus, In order to provide an efficient numerical tool at the regional or the global scale a high order finite difference time domain (FDTD) approach is proposed that relies on the linearized compressible Navier-Stokes equations (Landau 1959) with non constant physical parameters (density, viscosities and speed of sound) and background velocities (wind). One significant benefit from this code is its versatility. Indeed, it handles both acoustic and gravity waves in the same simulation that enables one to observe correlations between the two. Simulations will also be performed on 2D/3D realistic cases such as tsunamis in a full MSISE-00 atmosphere and gravity-wave generation through atmospheric explosions. Computations are validated by comparison to well-known analytical solutions based on dispersion relations in specific benchmark cases (atmospheric explosion and bottom displacement forcing).",

This study has been carried to evaluate the performance of WRF model to various combinations of physical parameterization schemes for predicting surface and upper air meteorology around the capital city of India, Delhi popularly known as National Capital Region (NCR). Eight sensitivity experiments has been conducted to find the best combination of the parameterization schemes for the study area during summer (4th - 18th April, 2010 ) season. The model predicted surface temperatures at 2m, relative humidity at 2m and wind speeds at 10m are compared with the observations from Central Pollution Control Board (at Dwarka and Shadipur monitoring stations) and Indian Meteorological Department (VIDP and VIDD stations) whereas the upper-air potential temperature profile and wind speed profile are validated using Wyoming Weather Web data archive at VIDD station. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of simulations indicate that for temperature and relative humidity, the combination consisting of Yonsei Unversity (YSU) as the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) scheme, the Monin Obhukhov as the surface layer (SL) scheme along with NOAH land surface model (LSM) has been found to be performing better than other combinations. The combination consisting of Mellor Yamada Janjic (Eta) as the PBL scheme, Monin Obhukhov Janjic (Eta) as the SL scheme and Noah LSM performs reasonably well in reproducing the observed wind conditions. This indicates that the selection of parameterization schemes may depend on the intended application of the model for a given region.",

            "abstract": "Understanding converted surface waves is helpful because they could improve the accuracy of earthquake location if the exacted scattered point is known as well as serve to image shallow structures with dispersion features. Previous studies have reported a few observations of body-to-surface-wave conversion associated with deep earthquakes. For example, Wagner and Langston used coda intensity analysis and f-k analysis to confirm a P-to-Rg wave and performed forward modeling with T-matrix method demonstrating that a 1km relief was responsible for the observed body-to-surface wave scattering. Moreover, Furumura et al. observed unusual Rayleigh waves converted from S wave observed at Australia with deep earthquakes occurred along Kermadec-Tonga trench and a 2D Pseudospetral method is adopted to illustrate that the Rayleigh waves could be explained by ridge structures.\nBoth T-matrix and pseudospetral algorithms are based on numerical methods. However, we lack a theory to study the mechanism of those surface waves quantitatively. For instance, the relationship between the topography with the dominate frequency of converted surface waves could be resolved thoroughly with a theoretical approach. From this perspective, we carried out a theoretical method to calculate the converted Rayleigh wave with surface topography. During the calculation, a homogeneous half space medium is assumed and the path of the converted phase is divided into two segments.\nFirstly, we will introduce our theoretical method in detail and a comparison of our results and SEM results will be presented to verify our methods. Secondly, the topography effect and the transfer efficiency of P and S wave will be examined quantitatively with different source mechanisms. Then, we will report an observation of unusual large amplitude surface waves transferred from body waves at local stations. Our preliminary result shows that those anomalous waves are identified as Rayleigh wave and are probably generated by the steep topography. In the end, we will discuss the algorithm’s extension, such as calculating the converted Love wave, and its shortage since a plane wave approximation is applied in the calculation.",

Its functionality makes comprehensive analysis on volumes of satellite, in situ and model data. The result of such analysis can be used to reveal different natural and artificial phenomena on a sea surface such as polar lows or oil slicks. Continuous data source renewal allows user to trace a development of a phenomenon in time up to the near real time monitoring. The application allows to select a set of products for a given date which should be displayed on a basemap. In this way each product is presented by a separate layer and can be combined with others to get a complete picture of what is happening in the region. It is possible to change visibility and opacity for each particular layer. Along with various satellite products the application’s catalog offers such data sources as meteorological model data, in situ measurements, ship and polar station tracks. Any combination of layers including their order and opacity can be shared or saved by user for later investigation. Zoom capability is activated when user wants to explore some particular region in detail. Being a simple and intuitive action on a client-side it is supported by a huge set of server-side technologies: on-demand data subsetting, tiling and caching. For vector data, such as wind speed and direction or air pressure, we developed a web feature service (WFS) by contributing to an open-source project and adopting it to serve meteorological model data. All of the above allows to cut off unnecessary detalization on low zoom levels and to provide high resolution data on high zoom levels without losing in user interface responsivity.",

            "abstract": "Transit time distributions (TTDs) are an efficient way of characterizing complex transport dynamics of a hydrologic system. Time-invariant TTD has been studied extensively, but TTDs are time-varying under unsteady hydrologic systems due to both external variability (e.g., time-variability in fluxes), and internal variability (e.g., time-varying flow pathways). The use of “flow-weighted time” has been suggested to account for the effect of external variability on TTDs, but neglects the role of internal variability. Recently, to account both types of variability, StorAge Selection (SAS) function approaches were developed. One of these approaches enables the transport characteristics of a system - how the different aged water in the storage is sampled by the outflow - to be parameterized by time-variable probability distribution called the rank SAS (rSAS) function, and uses it directly to determine the time-variable TTDs resulting from a given timeseries of fluxes in and out of a system. Unlike TTDs, the form of the rSAS function varies only due to changes in flow pathways, but is not affected by the timing of fluxes alone. However, the relation between physical mechanisms and the time-varying rSAS functions are not well understood.\nIn this study, relative effects of internal and external variability on the TTDs are examined using observations from a homogeneously packed 1 m3 sloping soil lysimeter. The observations suggest the importance of internal variability on TTDs, and reinforce the need to account for this variability using time-variable rSAS functions. Furthermore, the relative usefulness of two other formulations of SAS functions and the mortality rate (which plays a similar role to SAS functions in the McKendrick-von Foerster model of age-structured population dynamics) are also discussed. Finally, numerical modeling is used to explore the role of internal and external variability for hydrologic systems with diverse geomorphic and climate characteristics. This works will give an insight that which approach (or SAS function) is preferable under different conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere Turbulence Experiment (MTeX) is a rocket-based experiment that was conducted on the night of the 25-26 January 2015 at Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR), Chatanika, Alaska (65°N, 147°W). The experiment required two key elements: the ability to measure turbulence in well-defined meteorological conditions and the ability to measure fluctuations in the atmosphere at sub-meter scales. Modern lidar (or laser radar) systems provided the first element. Rocket-borne ionization gauges and ionization probes provided the second element. We used the established rocket launching and lidar facilities at PFRR to study this turbulence. The specific weather condition we required to frame our turbulence measurement was a Mesospheric Inversion Layer. MILs are a signature of large-scale planetary wave breaking in the upper atmosphere, where a region with a temperature inversion lies below a region with an adiabatic lapse rate. The region with the inversion allows small-scale waves to become unstable, break, and generate turbulence. The region with the adiabatic lapse rate is indicative of a well-mixed layer and the presence of turbulence. The Rayleigh lidar observations began at 18:37 25 January local time. By 20:30 we had acquired sufficient lidar signal to detect a MIL between 80-85 km. The first MTeX rocket was launched at 00:13 and the second one at 00:46. The lidar temperature soundings show that the atmosphere was disturbed with temperatures in the stratosphere being cooler than expected from climatology with no clear stratopause. Our preliminary analysis of the rocket measurements shows spectral characteristics typical of layers of strong turbulence. Measurements were made both on the upleg and downleg of each rocket flight. In this presentation we present the technical details of the rocket flight, key data from the flight, and show how that data from different instruments is combined to characterize the waves and turbulence present during MTeX. The documentation of the MIL and the weather conditions over the whole night critically define the model scenarios for characterizing and understanding the turbulence using contemporary fluid-dynamic computer simulations.",

            "abstract": "A first ever study on atmospheric carbonyl compounds (CC) were made over eastern Himalaya in India. Samples were collected over a high altitude hill station, Darjeeling (27.01°N, 88.15°E, 2200 masl) during 2011-2012. It is well known that CC have toxic and carcinogenic properties as well as they have important effects on regional climate. Therefore their presence in the environment is of great concern especially for the Himalayan region because of the ecological and geographical importance of the area. The average annual concentration of total CCs was 293.3 ± 463.9 μgm-3 with maximum during post monsoon (1104.8 ± 568.0 μgm-3) and minimum during winter season (72.2 ± 42.9 μgm-3). Darjeeling experiences huge emissions of carbonaceous pollutants from massive influx of tourists during premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. Though the emission strength could be comparable, the loss of carbonyls from the atmosphere could be due to photochemical degradation under high solar insolation during premonsoon. Acetone was most abundant species with an annual average concentration of 200.8±352.9 μgm-3 with 70 % contribution to the total CCs measured. Interestingly, acetone over Darjeeling was found to be much higher than most of the metropolitan cities in the world. The average formaldehyde to acetaldehyde ratio (1.64 ± 1.43) over Darjeeling is a good representation of a typical urban atmosphere at this high altitude over this part of Himalaya. High carbonyl concentration over eastern Himalaya compared to other megacities across the globe could be attributed to uncontrolled activities related to development in tourism, high population density and moreover it’s unique orography and land use pattern with narrow roads, unplanned township etc. The unscientific treatment of human and animal and other domestic waste is another major concern which significantly contribute to carbonyl and other carbonaceous pollutants over this part of Himalaya.",

The approach involves numerically calculating 3-D Green's tensors, which is made efficient by exploiting Green's reciprocity.\nThe rationale for 3-D seismic source inversion has several aspects. For structurally complex regions, such as the Japan area, it is necessary to account for 3-D Earth heterogeneities to prevent unknown structure polluting source solutions. In addition, earthquake source characterisation can serve as a means to delineate existing faults. Source parameters obtained for more realistic Earth models can then facilitate improvements in seismic tomography and early warning systems, which are particularly important for seismically active areas, such as Japan.\nWe have created a database of numerically computed 3-D Green's reciprocals for a 40°× 40°× 600 km size area around the Japanese Archipelago for >150 broadband stations. For this we used a regional 3-D velocity model, recently obtained from full waveform inversion. The model includes attenuation and radial anisotropy and explains seismic waveform data for periods between 10 – 80 s generally well.\nThe aim is to perform source inversions using the database of 3-D Green's tensors. As preliminary steps, we present initial concepts to address issues that are at the basis of our approach. We first investigate to which extent Green's reciprocity works in a discrete domain. Considering substantial amounts of computed Green's tensors we address storage requirements and file formatting. We discuss the importance of the initial source model, as an intelligent choice can substantially reduce the search volume. Possibilities to perform a Bayesian inversion and ways to move to finite source inversion are also explored.",

In observations, the two hemispheres exhibit symmetry in their albedo but this symmetry is not reproduced in many models. Biases in cloud cover in the Southern Hemisphere storm track are one of the key drivers of inter-hemispheric albedo biases in models and many of the same models exhibit biases in their representation of the monsoons and the ITCZ. Here, we examine one such model, HadGEM2-ES, using a spectrum of idealised and bias correction experiments. We show that simplified corrections to the albedo in the Southern Hemisphere are capable of improving the representation of the monsoons. However, as the bias corrections are made more realistic and targeted at the Southern Ocean, the response in the cross-equatorial tropical energy transport changes. Albedo perturbations lead to adjustments in the partitioning of the meridional heat transport between the atmosphere and ocean. We examine the mechanisms through which these adjustments occur, both locally and through teleconnections, and how they determine the spatial pattern of the energy transport and associated precipitation response. The impact on the fidelity with which the ITCZ and monsoons are represented, with a particular focus on West Africa, are investigated.",

            "abstract": "The northeastern Caribbean island arc, which materializes the boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates, is particularly exposed to large earthquakes and tsunamis. The low level of preparedness of a large part of its population and the lack of risk reduction provisions in public policies in many countries of the region put their population and economy at high risk in case of large telluric events. Here we investigate the impact that three possible earthquake scenarios, all consistent with the regional seismotectonic setting, would have on northern Haiti through inundation by tsunami waves. These scenarios follow the conclusions of the 2013 IOC Meeting of Experts (IOC Workshop Report No. 255) and simulate the effect of a M8.0 earthquake on the Septentrional strike-slip fault (possibly similar to the 1842 earthquake), a M8.1 earthquake on the offshore thrust fault system north of Haiti, and an earthquake rupturing a large portion of the offshore thrust fault system north of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. We calculate run-up heights along the northern coast of Haiti, in particular in the densely populated, coastal city of Cap Haitien. We find that the rupture of the offshore North Hispaniola thrust fault could result in wave heights up to 10 m with inundation up to 4 km inland, with only 10-15 minutes between ground shaking and the first wave arrivals. The city of Cap Haitien is particularly exposed, with potential flooding of most of the city and its suburbs, including the international airport. We also find that the historical reports available for the 1842 earthquake, when compared to our simulations, favor a rupture of the North Hispaniola thrust fault, although much uncertainty remains. If the 1842 earthquake did not rupture the Septentional fault offshore Haiti, then it is currently capable of at least a Mw7.7 earthquake, significantly larger than previously thought. The simulations presented here provide a basis for developing conservative maps of run-up heights that can be transferred, with added factors of safety, into practical implementation for tsunami preparedness and protection.",

            "abstract": "The appropriate mowing pattern is necessary to be investigated for ensuring the maximum extent feeding supply to livestock and avoiding grassland degradation simultaneously. Previous research about mowing pattern mostly focused on the impact of different cutting ways, such as cutting height, frequency and times, but the land use background factor was commonly ignored. For this reason, we conducted an identical mowing interval gradients experiment (mowing in every 1, 2 and 3 years) in two plots under different land use backgrounds from 2005. One plot was mowed (MP) in every year dominant by Leymus chinensis(Trin.) Tzvel. and the other plot was grazed (GP) before experiment conducted which is dominant by Stipa Baicalensis Roshev. Our results indicate that GP has significant advantages on species diversity, biomass and root-shoot ratio than that in MP under the same mowing interval pattern. Conversely, content of soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrient (total nitrogen, TN and total phosphorus, TP) in MP is significant greater than that in GP. Moreover, in terms of the amount of soil microflora, ammonifier abounded in MP, but anaerobic azotobacteria abounded in GP instead, which may confirm the higher content of TN in MP soil. In summary, the impact of identical mowing interval pattern on vegetation and soil performed diversely in MP and GP suggesting that land use background factor should be taken into account when a mowing pattern is made by government. Further work will be conducted to identify the different nutrient allocation patterns in each components on both individual and community scales which will help us to better understand the mechanisms of land use changing in semi-arid grassland ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial evaporation links energy, water and carbon cycles over land and is therefore a key variable of the climate system. However, the global-scale magnitude and variability of the flux, and the sensitivity of the underlying physical process to changes in environmental factors, are still poorly understood due to limitations in in situ measurements. As a result, several methods have risen to estimate global patterns of land evaporation from satellite observations. However, these algorithms generally differ in their approach to model evaporation, resulting in large differences in their estimates. One of these methods is GLEAM, the Global Land Evaporation: the Amsterdam Methodology. GLEAM estimates terrestrial evaporation based on daily satellite observations of meteorological variables, vegetation characteristics and soil moisture. Since the publication of the first version of the algorithm (2011), the model has been widely applied to analyse trends in the water cycle and land-atmospheric feedbacks during extreme hydrometeorological events. A third version of the GLEAM global datasets is foreseen by the end of 2015. Given the relevance of having a continuous and reliable record of global-scale evaporation estimates for climate and hydrological research, the establishment of an online data portal to host these data to the public is also foreseen. In this new release of the GLEAM datasets, different components of the model have been updated, with the most significant change being the revision of the data assimilation algorithm. In this presentation, we will highlight the most important changes of the methodology and present three new GLEAM datasets and their validation against in situ observations and an alternative dataset of terrestrial evaporation (ERA-Land). Results of the validation exercise indicate that the magnitude and the spatiotemporal variability of the modelled evaporation agree reasonably well with the estimates of ERA-Land and the in situ observations. It is also shown that the performance of the revised model is higher compared to the original one.",

Shortwave direct aerosol radiative forcing (SWDARF) under clear-sky condition is estimated about 5 Wm-2 from satellite retrievals and model simulations [Yu et al., 2006ACP]. Simultaneous observations of aerosols and clouds are very limited, thus it is difficult to validate the estimation of SWDARF under cloudy-sky condition. Recently, the global vertical distributions of aerosols and clouds are retrieved by the measurements of CloudSat and CALIPSO satellites. Oikawa et al. [2013JGR] used CALIPSO and MODIS data in order to evaluate the SWDARFs in four scenarios: clear-sky condition, the case that aerosols exist above clouds, the case that aerosols exist below high-level clouds, and the case that aerosols are not detected by CALIOP in cloudy-sky condition. Over Atlantic Ocean off southwest Africa, biomass burning aerosols are transported above low-level clouds and cause large positive SWDARF [Oikawa et al., 2013JGR; Chand et al., 2009Nat.

            "abstract": "Cloud microphysical data obtained from aircraft measurements of stratocumulus clouds over the southeastern pacific during the VOCALS-Rex field campaign and over the Great Plains region in Oklahoma during the RACORO field campaign were analyzed for evidence of entrainment mixing of air from above cloud top. Mixing diagram analysis was made for the horizontal flight data recorded at various rates (1 Hz, 10 Hz and 40 Hz). For the maritime stratocumulus clouds, the dominant observed feature, a positive relationship between cloud droplet mean volume (V) and liquid water content (L), suggested occurrence of homogeneous mixing. On the other hand, estimation of the relevant scale parameters (i.e., transition length scale and transition scale number) consistently indicated inhomogeneous mixing. Importantly, the flight altitudes of the measurements were significantly below cloud top. We speculate that mixing of the entrained air near the cloud top may have indeed been inhomogeneous; but due to vertical circulation mixing the correlation between V and L became positive at the measurement altitudes in mid-level of clouds, because during their descent, cloud droplets evaporate, faster in more diluted cloud parcels, leading to a positive correlation between V and L regardless of the mixing mechanism near the cloud top. For the continental stratocumulus clouds, the positive relationship between V and L was even more pronounced while the scale parameters were less indicative of inhomogeneous mixing. Finding evidence for vertical circulation mixing was difficult for these clouds because flight plans in this campaign were not designed to investigate such process.",

The relationship between turbulence and reconnection, and its contribution to magnetospheric transport and dynamics will be evaluated. Observational studies to date have shown that the magnetotail rarely exhibits simple steady convection; instead, flows in the magnetotail have a high level of fluctuations. Flows driven on the scale of the entire system break up into structures that cascade to smaller scales finally reaching scales at which they are dissipated. MHD simulation studies have been carried out both for idealized cases which can be compared to statistical studies of observed events and for event studies where direct comparisons to observations have been made. . In both cases realistic fluctuation spectra were produced in the inertial range. The simulations also do a good job of representing the effects of dissipation and yield dissipative scale lengths that are comparable to those inferred from observations. Turbulence is important at intermediate scales in the plasma sheet, in particular around dipolarization fronts. We will explore the interaction between large-scale and smaller-scale fluctuations and their contributions to the magnetotail structure. We will use a global MHD simulation and iPIC3D implicit particle in cell simulation to examine how turbulence is related to global and local processes involved in the current sheet.",

            "abstract": "Man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere is a significant contributor to the greenhouse gas effect and related global warming. Sequestration of CO2 into saline aquifers has been proposed as one of the most practical options of all geological sequestration possibilities. During CO2 geological sequestration, monitoring is indispensable to delineate the change of CO2 saturation and migration of CO2 in the subsurface. Especially, monitoring of CO2 saturation in aquifers provides useful information for determining amount of injected CO2. Seismic inversion can provide the migration of CO2 plume with high resolution because velocity is reduced when CO2 replaces the pore fluid during CO2 injection. However, the estimation of CO2 saturation using the seismic method is difficult due to the lower sensitivity of the velocity to the saturation when the CO2 saturation up to 20%. On the other hand, marine controlled-source EM (mCSEM) inversion is sensitive to the resistivity changes resulting from variations in CO2 saturation, even though it has poor resolution than seismic method. In this study, we proposed an effective CO2 sequestration monitoring method using joint inversion of seismic and mCSEM data based on a cross-gradient constraint. The method was tested with realistic CO2 injection models in a deep brine aquifer beneath a shallow sea which is selected with consideration for the access convenience for the installation of source and receiver and an environmental safety. Resistivity images of CO2 plume by the proposed method for different CO2 injection stages have been significantly improved over those obtained from individual EM inversion. In addition, we could estimate a reliable CO2 saturation by rock physics model (RPM) using the P-wave velocity and the improved resistivity. The proposed method is a basis of three-dimensional estimation of reservoir parameters such as porosity and fluid saturation, and the method can be also applied for detecting a reservoir and calculating the accurate oil and gas reserves.",

            "abstract": "Hotspots are anomalous regions of volcanism at Earth's surface that show no obvious association with tectonic plate boundaries. Classic examples include the Hawaiian-Emperor chain and the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain province. The majority are believed to form as Earth's tectonic plates move over long-lived mantle plumes: buoyant upwellings that bring hot material from Earth's deep-mantle to its surface. It has long been recognised that lithospheric thickness limits the rise height of plumes and, thereby, their minimum melting pressure. It should, therefore, have a controlling influence on the geochemistry of plume-related magmas, although unambiguous evidence of this has, thus far, been lacking. Here we integrate observational constraints from surface geology, geochronology, plate-motion reconstructions, geochemistry and seismology to ascertain plume melting depths beneath Earth's longest continental hotspot-track, a ~2000 km long track in eastern Australia that displays a record of volcanic activity between ~33 and ~9 Ma, which we call the Cosgrove track. Our analyses highlight a strong correlation between lithospheric thickness and magma composition along this track, with: (i) standard basaltic compositions in regions where lithospheric thickness is less than ~110 km; (ii) volcanic gaps in regions where lithospheric thickness exceeds ~150 km; and (iii) low-volume, leucitite-bearing volcanism in regions of intermediate lithospheric thickness. Trace-element concentrations from samples along this track support the notion that these compositional variations result from different degrees of partial-melting, which is controlled by the thickness of overlying lithosphere. Our results place the first observational constraints on the subcontinental melting depth of mantle plumes and provide direct evidence that lithospheric thickness has a dominant influence on the volume and chemical composition of plume-derived magmas.",

We have produced a global hyperspectral mosaic of the complete VIMS data set of Titan between T0 (July 2004) and T112 flyby (July 2015), by merging all the data cubes sorted by increasing spatial resolution, with the high resolution images on top of the mosaic and the low resolution images used as background. We filtered out the observing geometry in order to remove the pixels acquired in too extreme illuminating and viewing conditions, which systematically produce atmospheric artifacts. We used thresholds of 80° both on the incidence and emission angles, 100° on the phase angle, and 7 on the airmass. These thresholds corresponds to a trade-off between surface coverage and data quality. The viewing geometry is normalized at first order using a surface photometric function derived from the observation at 5 µm, where the atmospheric scattering is almost negligible. We also use the wings of the atmospheric windows as a proxy to correct for the amount of additive scattering present in the center of these windows, where the surface is seen by VIMS. Various color composites can then be produced using combinations of different wavelengths to emphasize surface heterogeneities. Among these, a RGB composite with red controlled by the 5 µm image, the green by the 2 µm image and the blue by the 1.27 µm, reveals the extent of equatorial dune fields appearing in brownish tones. Bluish areas corresponds to regions possibly enriched in water ice or other organic compounds. Composite of band ratios such as 1.59/1.27 µm, 2.03/1.27 µm and 1.27/1.08 also prove to be more useful to better emphasize surface variations, even if they are also more sensitive to residual artefacts due to atmospheric and geometric effects or calibration residuals.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of morphological evolution both in terrestrial and planetary landscapes is of increasing interest in the geosciences. In mountainous regions, bedrock channel formation as a consequence of the interaction of uplift and erosion processes is fundamental for the entire surface evolution. Hence, the accurate description of bedrock channel development is important for landscape modelling. To verify existing concepts developed in the lab and to analyse how in situ channel erosion rates depend on the interrelations of discharge, sediment transport and topography, there is a need of highly resolved topographic field data.\nWe analyse bedrock erosion over two years in a bedrock gorge downstream of the Gorner glacier above the town of Zermatt, Switzerland. At the study site, the Gornera stream cuts through a roche moutonnée in serpentine rock of 25m length, 5m width and 8m depth. We surveyed bedrock erosion rates using repeat terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) with an average point spacing of 5mm. Bedrock erosion rates in direction of the individual surface normals were studied directly on the scanned point clouds applying the M3C2 algorithm (Lague et al., 2013, ISPRS). The surveyed erosion patterns were compared to a simple stream erosivity visualisation obtained from painted bedrock sections at the study location.\nSpatially distributed erosion rates on bedrock surfaces based on millions of scan points allow deduction of millimeter-scale mean annual values of lateral erosion, incision and downstream erosion on protruding streambed surfaces. The erosion rate on a specific surface point is shown to depend on the position of this surface point in the channel's cross section, its height above the streambed and its spatial orientation to the streamflow. Abrasion by impacting bedload was likely the spatially dominant erosion process, as confirmed by the observed patterns along the painted bedrock sections. However, a single plucking event accounted for the half of the total eroded material.\nOur results demonstrate the practicability of TLS for highly resolved spatio-temporal erosion monitoring in the field and quantitatively confirm concepts of spatially varying erosion rates based current thinking. Furthermore, we introduce an easy-to-apply method for qualitative spatial erosion detection by paint.",

            "abstract": "The course of permafrost degradation depends on climate, vegetation, disturbance, and excess ground-ice content and distribution, which vary over time. Our understanding of possible future landscape trajectories under climate warming can be improved by observing past responses to changes in these critical drivers. Using a novel combination of lake-sediment records, field observations and LiDAR imagery, we reconstructed the late-Quaternary history of the marginal upland of the Yukon Flats, interior Alaska, a loess-mantled region with massive ground ice and numerous thermokarst lakes. Two lakes formed ~11,000-12,000 cal yr BP through inferred thermokarst processes. Charcoal in basal sediments indicates fire may have influenced lake initiation. In a third, older basin, major input of terrigenous silt occurred before or during this time. At all studied lakes, sedimentation has been stable through much of the Holocene. Meso-scale topographic features that are obscured by forest are revealed by LiDAR images to include widespread linear corrugations cutting across the uplands, deep gullies, and other features resembling lake drainage channels. These imply past dramatic surface-sediment mobilization. Lakes intersect the corrugations, indicating that the mobile phase occurred no later than the earliest Holocene. Several interacting factors may have been critical in first enhancing, then slowing, this activity. High summer insolation, increasing moisture, initially sparse vegetation, then development of woody cover and increase in fire disturbance likely combined to generate rapid and deep thaw of glacial-age permafrost. Initial lake lowering and generation of steep local topography favoring drying of uplands, a summer water deficit, and early-Holocene establishment of evergreen forest cover and consequent surface insulation likely combined to shift the system to a near-quiescent state (the system is not entirely inactive today: a partial lake drainage event was observed in 2103). The history and current state of this thermokarst-affected landscape differ from other regions. It has undergone non-linear shifts in process rates and developmental trajectory. Overall resilience to current and future environmental change here and in other regions may be equally individualistic.",

            "abstract": "The apatite crystal structure is capable of incorporating H2O, F and Cl, as well as trace CO2 and sulphur. These can be related to parental magma compositions through application of a series of pressure and temperature-dependent exchange reactions (Piccoli and Candela, 1994), permitting apatite crystals to preserve a record of all major volatile species in the melt. Furthermore, due to the general incompatibility of P in other rock-forming minerals, apatite is ubiquitous in igneous systems and often begins crystallising early, such that apatite inclusions within phenocrysts record melt volatile contents throughout magmatic differentiation. In this work, we compare the compositions of apatite inclusions and microphenocrysts with pyroxene-hosted melt inclusions from the Astroni 1 eruption of Campi Flegrei, Italy. These data are coupled with magmatic differentiation models (Gualda et al., 2012), experimental volatile solubility data (Webster et al., 2014) and thermodynamic models of apatite compositional variations (Piccoli and Candela, 1994) to determine a time-series of magmatic volatile evolution in the build-up to eruption. We find that apatite halogen/OH ratios decreased through magmatic differentiation, while melt inclusion F and Cl concentrations increased. Melt inclusion H2O contents are constant at ~2.5 wt%. These data are best explained by volatile-undersaturated differentiation over most of the crystallisation history of the Astroni 1 melt, with melt inclusion H2O contents reset during ascent, due to rapid H diffusion through the phenocryst hosts (Woods et al., 2000). Given the rapid diffusivity of volatiles in apatite (Brenan, 1993), preservation of undersaturated compositions in microphenocrysts suggests that saturation was only achieved a few days to months before eruption and that it may have been the transition into a volatile-saturated state that ultimately triggered eruption.\nPiccoli and Candela, 1994.

This interaction gives rise to an induced magnetosphere around the planet with distinct boundaries encapsulating, and separating plasma populations of differing origin. The European Space Agency Mars Express (MEX) mission has been in operation for a full solar cycle, affording us an extensive and unique dataset to study the response of the main Martian plasma boundaries to external and internal factors. From analysis of the electron flux measured by the Analyzer of Space Plasma and Energetic Atoms Electron Spectrometer (ASPERA-3 ELS) instrument on-board MEX, we present the initial results of identification of the bow shock and induced magnetospheric boundaries along with their variation in position over the last solar cycle. Compared to other bodies in the solar system that lack an intrinsic global magnetic field, the presence of crustal magnetic fields distributed across the Southern hemisphere of Mars further complicates and differentiates the Martian plasma system. The impact of the presence of these crustal magnetic fields on the location of boundaries is also studied.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic activity in and around the year 536 CE led to the coldest decade of the Common Era, and has been speculatively linked to large-scale societal crises around the world. Using a coupled aerosol-climate model, with eruption parameters constrained by recently re-dated ice core records and historical observations of the aerosol cloud, we reconstruct the radiative forcing resulting from a sequence of two major volcanic eruptions in 536 and 540 CE. Comparing with a reconstruction of volcanic forcing over the past 1200 years, we estimate that the decadal-scale Northern Hemisphere (NH) extra-tropical radiative forcing from this volcanic “double event” was larger than that of any known period. Earth system model simulations including the volcanic forcing are used to explore the temperature and precipitation anomalies associated with the eruptions, and compared to available proxy records, including maximum latewood density (MXD) temperature reconstructions. Special attention is placed on the decadal persistence of the cooling signal in tree rings, and whether the climate model simulations reproduce such long-term climate anomalies. Finally, the climate model results will be used to explore the probability of socioeconomic crisis resulting directly from the volcanic radiative forcing in different regions of the world.",

One storm will be specifically highlighted which occurred on 26 January 2013 when a solar wind shock hit the Earth. After impact, electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves, observed both on the ground and with the Van Allen Probes, and relativistic electron precipitation (REP) were observed. A few hours later a substorm injection, observed by GOES and LANL, led to 100s keV electron precipitation. Throughout the substorm microbursts were clearly observed. Both during the REP as well as during the substorm precipitation, ULF time scale modulation of the X-rays was observed. This storm period also covered a time period where ~150 keV electron precipitation was observed to correlate well with drift echoes at 300 keV. This last event has not yet been fully explained.\nWe will also present new results from storm periods during the second and third (Swedish) BARREL campaigns. We hope to be able to include results from conjunctions with EISCAT Tromso radar and HiT&MIS, a day time auroral imager, along with the current heliospheric fleet of satellites.",

            "abstract": "Strong feedbacks between river braiding and vegetation processes are now well-recognised. Recently, this has been illustrated in the notion of biogeomorphic succession, the transition from pioneer vegetation establishment to a fully-developed floodplain forest ecosystem. This succession also results in important vegetation-mediated feedbacks, through bank stabilisation and the capture of organic matter and fine sediments, stimulating soil formation and further enhancing the succession process itself. However, there are few studies that have addressed what this succession might mean for the evolution of channel planform, and almost no studies that have considered how this succession rates might be mediated by groundwater. The latter is a key concern for gravel-bed rivers with low water retention capacity. Here, we present results from a 2 km length of braiding-wandering river system in Switzerland (Allondon River). We show that the spatio-temporal dynamics of the groundwater table drives the biogeomorphic succession process at different rates, leading to very different river channel pattern responses. In the upper braiding-anastomosing part of the reach, the groundwater table is deeper. Here, dendrochronological data show that rates of pioneer vegetation growth are strongly dependent upon groundwater table fluctuations. Bank resistance modelling shows that vegetation-reinforcement of bank resistance is below its maximum. In the meandering lower part of the reach, with a mature floodplain forest, tree growth rates are independent of groundwater fluctuations, because trees can almost always access the higher groundwater table. Bank resistance is at its maximum. Through time, in response to disturbance frequency, the meandering tendency has migrated upstream. Thus, our results suggest that groundwater access modulates biogeomorphic succession processes in ways that determine the resultant river channel pattern.",

Magnetic null points are believed to be the preferred locations in space where magnetic reconnection is luckily to happen, and are in the focus of interest of space missions such as Cluster and MMS. Simulations of magnetic reconnection in various configurations performed with the implicit particle-in-cell code iPic3D revealed that nulls are ubiquitious in these models. We apply the Poincare index technique to locate and identify the topological characteristics of the magnetic null points in different three-dimensional simulations. We investigate the relevance of magnetic nulls to energy dissipation, turbulence and plasma instabilities. In particular, we found out that magnetic nulls of spiral type associated with magnetic islands and flux ropes play more important role in the energy release than the radial nulls. This finding is in accordance with some recent MHD simulations and in situ observations of Cluster spacecraft.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice, snow and atmosphere interactions are major drivers of the spatial distribution of snow over sea ice in polar regions. Here, we combine measurements of the wind flow, atmospheric conditions and blowing snow at two locations on an Antarctic sea ice floe, with terrestrial laser scanning to characterize a blowing snow storm and its influence on the spatial patterns of snow distribution at resolutions of 1-10 cm over an area of 100 m x 100 m. The datasets were obtained during the SIPEX II (Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment II) research voyage to East Antarctica (September-November 2012). The pre-storm surface (2012-10-20) exhibits multi-directional elongated snow dunes behind aerodynamic obstacles likely formed during previous snowstorms. The post-storm surface (2012-10-23) exhibits clear new deposition dunes elongated along the predominant wind direction. The new deposition areas amount to 38% of the total surveyed area. Patterns of erosion are less evident but cover a larger portion of the area. This results in a total volume of change near zero with a mean elevation difference of 0.02 m indicating that net erosion or deposition from snowfall was small despite of large mass relocation. After the storm, the statistical distributions of elevation and the 2D correlation functions remain similar to those of the pre-storm surface. The pre- and post-storm surfaces also exhibit power-law relationships in the power spectrum with little change between pre- and post-storm slopes. These observations suggest that despite the significant change observed in the snow surface patterns, the change does not translate into significant changes in the spatial statistical and scaling properties of the surface morphology. Such an observation is important for sea-ice model representations of the sub-pixel variability of sea ice surfaces, particularly between snowstorm events, although more datasets will be required to extend these results to a wider range of sea ice surface morphologies.",

Although the soil moisture values obtained from these different platforms have temporal and spatial consistency, they often have differences in their signal (i.e. variance) components and/or in their scales. Therefore, it is necessary to rescale these datasets to a reference dataset in order to avoid any added bias during preprocessing phase. There are different linear and non-linear rescaling methods developed for rescaling of time series. However the added utility nonlinear rescaling methods compared to linear methods remained not well explored. In this study accuracy of 12 different linear and non-linear methods in rescaling of soil moisture time series are evaluated over 4 USDA ARS watersheds using LPRM-, NOAH-, API-, and station-based datasets. Results showed that generally non-linear methods (especially artificial neural networks) result in improved accuracy than linear methods.",

            "abstract": "Air temperature is often considered as a proxy of the stream temperature to model the distribution areas of aquatic species water temperature is not available at a regional scale. To simulate the water temperature at a regional scale (105 km²), a physically-based model using the equilibrium temperature concept and including upstream-downstream propagation of the thermal signal was developed and applied to the entire Loire basin (Beaufort et al., submitted). This model, called T-NET (Temperature-NETwork) is based on a hydrographical network topology. Computations are made hourly on 52,000 reaches which average 1.7 km long in the Loire drainage basin.\nThe model gives a median Root Mean Square Error of 1.8°C at hourly time step on the basis of 128 water temperature stations (2008-2012). In that version of the model, tree shadings is modelled by a constant factor proportional to the vegetation cover on 10 meters sides the river reaches. According to sensitivity analysis, improving the shade representation would enhance T-NET accuracy, especially for the maximum daily temperatures, which are currently not very well modelized.\nThis study evaluates the most efficient way (accuracy/computing time) to improve the shade model thanks to 1-m resolution LIDAR data available on tributary of the LoireRiver (317 km long and an area of 8280 km²).\nTwo methods are tested and compared: the first one is a spatially explicit computation of the cast shadow for every LIDAR pixel. The second is based on averaged vegetation cover characteristics of buffers and reaches of variable size.\nValidation of the water temperature model is made against 4 temperature sensors well spread along the stream, as well as two airborne thermal infrared imageries acquired in summer 2014 and winter 2015 over a 80 km reach.\nThe poster will present the optimal length- and crosswise scale to characterize the vegetation from LIDAR data.",

            "abstract": "Grid point percentiles have commonly been used to represent uncertainty in temperature and precipitation projections, while pattern scaling of temperature and precipitation has been used to demonstrate robustness in climate change projections.\nUsing CMIP5 we demonstrate a substantial disproportionality between global climate sensitivity and the regional distribution of temperature change. We argue that estimating a given probability for a change in any particular region prevents a probabilistic statement about the change in a different region, as this would potentially be in conflict with the global mean being the overall constraint in any given model realization: if the largest climate change signal is chosen in each point, the global mean temperature change exceeds the change projected by any individual model. This is not physically justified. For precipitation, spread is large in all grid points; consistent with no change and a large uncertainty everywhere. Each individual model on the other hand shows a clear and statistically significant pattern of change. This implies that the physical consistency between climate variables such as temperature and precipitation is basically lost in a statistical analysis based on grid-point statistics.\nHere we propose an EOF approach identifying dominating patterns of regional climate change. These are used to construct globally consistent maps of the uncertainty in climate change scenarios. By going beyond the grid point level statistics, our method is designed to capture the spatial patterns in the uncertainty and maintain the physical correlations between variables. In particular, we identify that based on the EOF analysis of temperature changes; a bit more than 50% of the variance in the temperature change pattern is explained by the first EOF. To keep physical consistency, using the same PC loadings deduced from temperature on precipitation changes, only explains around 10% globally and between 15 - 30% of the variance in precipitation changes over land, depending on various means to separate out the most dominant individual model. This implies, however, that within the inner 50% of the explained temperature variance, the more physically consistent pattern of change in precipitation is much better constrained than it appears using grid point statistics.",

            "abstract": "The continuous monitoring of soil moisture in a permanent network can yield an interesting data product for use in hydrological data assimilation. Major advantages of in situ observations compared to remote sensing products are the potential vertical extent of the measurements, the finer temporal resolution of the observation time series, the smaller impact of land cover variability on the observation bias, etc. However, two major disadvantages are the typical small integration volume of in situ measurements and the often large spacing between monitoring locations. This causes only a small part of the modelling domain to be directly observed. Furthermore, the spatial configuration of the monitoring network is typically temporally non-dynamic. Therefore two questions can be raised. Do spatially sparse in situ soil moisture observations contain a sufficient data representativeness to successfully assimilate them into the largely unobserved spatial extent of a distributed hydrological model? And if so, how is this assimilation best performed?\nConsequently two important factors that can influence the success of assimilating in situ monitored soil moisture are the spatial configuration of the monitoring network and the applied assimilation algorithm. In this research the influence of those factors is examined by means of synthetic data-assimilation experiments. The study area is the ± 100 km² catchment of the Bellebeek in Flanders, Belgium.\nThe influence of the spatial configuration is examined by varying the amount of locations and their position in the landscape. The latter is performed using several techniques including temporal stability analysis and clustering. Furthermore the observation depth is considered by comparing assimilation of surface layer (5 cm) and deeper layer (50 cm) observations. The impact of the assimilation algorithm is assessed by comparing the performance obtained with two well-known algorithms: Newtonian nudging and the Ensemble Kalman Filter.",

            "abstract": "The present work focuses on the detection and analysis of the postseismic surface deformations following the two earthquakes that hit the Emilia Romagna region (Italy) on May 20 and 29, 2012. The 2012 Emilia earthquake sequence struck the central sector of the Ferrara arc, which represents the external fold-and-thrust system of the Northern Apennines thrust belt buried below the Po plain. The May 20 event occurred on the Ferrara basal thrust at depth, at about 6-7 km, while, during the May 29 event, the rupture jumped on an inner splay of the Ferrara system.\nThe analysis of the postseismic displacements was carried out thanks to a dataset of SAR COSMO­ SkyMed images covering a time span of about one year (May 20, 2012 – May 11, 2013) after the May 20 event. The DInSAR results revealed the presence of two deformation patches: the first one is located in the area that experienced the coseismic uplift. Here the postseismic displacements point out a further ground uplift occurring along the first three months after the 20 May event. The second deformation patch is located in the villages of San Carlo and Mirabello, where ground subsidence lasting about four months was detected.\nWe hypothesized that both the observed phenomena are related to the pore pressure perturbation caused by the coseismic deformation. In particular, the ground uplift is due to the deep crustal deformations caused by the pore fluid diffusion at depth to re-establish the initial hydrostatic stresses. Instead, the ground subsidence is related to the compaction of the shallow sandy layers caused by the liquefaction phenomena, which widely affected the San Carlo and Mirabello area.\nPreliminary numerical analyses performed with the Finite Element Method and empirical relations confirmed our hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "Terror Rift is a >300 km-long, 50-70 km-wide, 14 km-deep sedimentary basin at the edge of the West Antarctic Rift System, adjacent to the Transantarctic Mountains. It is cut into the broader Victoria Land Basin (VLB). The VLB experienced 100 km of mid-Cenozoic extension associated with larger sea floor spreading farther north. The post-spreading (Neogene) development of Terror Rift is not well understood, in part because of past use of different stratigraphic age models. We use the new Rossmap seismic stratigraphy correlated to Cape Roberts and Andrill cores in the west and to DSDP cores in the distant East. This stratigraphy, and new fault interpretations, was developed using different resolutions of seismic reflection data included those available from the Seismic Data Library System. Depth conversion used a new 3D velocity model. A 29 Ma horizon is as deep as 8 km in the south, and a 19 Ma horizon is >5 km deep there and 4 km-deep 100 km farther north. There is a shallower northern part of Terror Rift misaligned with the southern basin across a 50 km right double bend. It is bounded by steep N-S faults down-dropping towards the basin axis. Between Cape Roberts and Ross Island, the Oligocene section is also progressively-tilted. This Oligocene section is not imaged within northern Terror Rift, but the simplest hypothesis is that some of the Terror Rift-bounding faults were active at least during Oligocene through Quaternary time. Many faults are normal separation, but some are locally vertical or even reverse-separation in the upper couple of km. However, much of the vertical relief of the strata is due to progressive tilting (horizontal axis rotation) and not by shallow faulting. Along the trend of the basin, the relief alternates between tilting and faulting, with a tilting margin facing a faulted margin across the Rift, forming asymmetric basins. Connecting faults across the basin form an accommodation zone similar to other oblique rifts. The Neogene basin is shallow to non-existent 300 km north of Ross Island, near -74° 30’ latitude. We propose that the Neogene history of Terror Rift has been highly-oblique right-lateral, terminating northward into right lateral faults of northern Victoria Land.",

The purpose of the present study is to reveal global-scale changes in marine fog in a warmer climate.\nThe changes in marine fog with climate change are investigated using AMIP, AMIP4K (where a uniform +4 K SST is added to the AMIP SSTs), and AMIPfuture (where a patterned SST perturbation is added to the AMIP SSTs) experiment data simulated by the MRI-CGCM3 (Yukimoto et al. 2012), which was used for CMIP5 runs. First, the representation of the fog in the model was examined using ship observation data and cloud mask data retrieved from CALIPSO satellite data (Kawai et al. 2015). The comparison showed that the MRI-CGCM3 can represent the climatological global distribution of marine fog relatively well. Basically marine fog represented by the model is warm air advection fog, and it was found that the change in the horizontal temperature advection near the surface mostly determines the changes in marine fog in a warmer climate. Therefore, the changes in marine fog can be almost explained by the large-scale circulation changes. On the other hand, in-cloud LWC (liquid water content) of the fog is consistently increased in a warmer climate for the same horizontal surface temperature advection. The changes in mid-latitude marine fog in both the northern and southern hemispheres and for both summer and winter seasons are discussed in connection with the large-scale circulation changes.",

            "abstract": "While preferential flow of hot fluids along highly permeable, fractured rocks seems intuitive, such efficient flow leads to the entrainment of cold ambient seawater resulting in a distinct decrease in fluid temperatures. This temperature drop is difficult to reconcile with high-temperature black smoker activity observed at outcropping fault zones on the seafloor. In our recent study (Andersen et al., 2015) we aim to resolve this apparent contradiction by combining newly acquired seismological data (Grevemeyer et al., 2013) from the high-T, off-axis Logatchev 1 hydrothermal field (LHF1) along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) with 2D hydrothermal flow modeling. The seismic data shows intense off-axis seismicity with focal mechanisms suggesting a fault zone dipping from LHF1 toward the ridge axis.\nIn order to explain fault-related high-T hydrothermal discharge as observed at LHF1, our simulations predict that fault zones need to be just permeable and wide enough to capture and redirect hot hydrothermal fluids ascending from above a driving heat source. Very wide or highly permeable fault zones are not sufficiently fed by the limited supply of hot fluids such that cold seawater is entrained to “fill up” the fault zone, causing a decrease in hydrothermal vent temperatures. Our findings illustrate an intrinsic relationship between fault characteristics (width and permeability) and associated hydrothermal fluid flow: the higher the fluid mass flux along a fault zone, the lower the hydrothermal fluid temperature.\nThe cooling effect observed in hydrothermal fluids at permeability contrast, might explain the sparsity of high-T hydrothermal activity along the heterogeneous, highly faulted Mid-Atlantic Ridge.",

            "abstract": "Global land scarcity is a major concern, which, due to climate change, lifestyle changes, and population growth, will only continue to worsen. It is a major driver of global environmental degradation, famine, and sociopolitical conflicts. With some 33% of the world’s dwindling supply of arable land dedicated to grossly inefficient animal husbandry or animal feed production, it is easy to see that dietary consumption patterns play an important role. Although population growth in East Asia has stagnated, changing dietary trends mean that China is now the world’s largest consumers of meat, consuming 25% of global meat production, despite having less than half of the American per capita equivalent. This paper assesses changing dietary consumption patterns of Taiwan, whose current per capita meat consumption surpasses all other East Asian countries, over the past 30 years and considers the relationship this has had on overall land consumption. We then consider dietary trends of Mainland China, which shares a common cultural heritage and whose current Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is similar to Taiwanese PPP levels in 1985. Finally we retrospectively project three alternative Taiwanese consumption patterns over the past 30 years, consider the effect of each scenario on per capita land consumption, and finally consider these results in terms of culturally analogues Mainland China.",

            "abstract": "Changes in sea level associated with glacial cycles affect the pressure beneath a mid-ocean ridge (MOR) [1,2,3]. Pressure controls the depth of first melting, and therefore the rate of change of pressure controls the rate of change of the depth of first melting. The changing depth of first melting alters the effective rate at which mantle, and thus CO2, enters the melting region. Melt then transports CO2 to the ridge axis, where it enters the climate system. We calculate that the lag between sea level change and consequent variation in MOR CO2 emissions is 40-120 kyrs[4], similar to the timescale of glacial cycles. Could these variations in MOR CO2 emissions feed back on climate and lead to ice-age pacing at a small multiple of the obliquity period? [5]\nTo test this hypothesis we begin with a climate model comprised of a global energy balance and a 1D ice sheet. The ice sheet flows under its own weight, accumulates due to precipitation, and melts in response to the local energy balance[6]. This model broadly replicates Early Pleistocene 40 kyr glacial cycles. We extend the model to include a variable greenhouse effect, according to atmospheric CO2, and variable MOR CO2 emissions driven by sea level. The lag between sea level change and MOR CO2 emissions is controlled by mantle permeability. If this model does not demonstrate MOR CO2 emissions altering glacial cycles, it would suggest this hypothesised feedback mechanism can be rejected.\n ",

            "abstract": "Landscape Evolution Models are important experimental tools for understanding the long-term development of landscapes. Designed to simulate timescales ranging from decades to millennia, they are usually driven by precipitation inputs that are lumped, both spatially across the drainage basin, and temporally to daily, monthly, or even annual rates. This is based on an assumption that the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the rainfall will equalise over the long timescales simulated.\nHowever, recent studies (Coulthard et al., 2012) have shown that such models are sensitive to event magnitudes, with exponential increases in sediment yields generated by linear increases in flood event size at a basin scale. This suggests that there may be a sensitivity to the spatial and temporal scales of rainfall used to drive such models.\nThis study uses the CAESAR-Lisflood Landscape Evolution Model to investigate the impact of spatial and temporal resolution of rainfall input on model outputs. The sediment response to a range of temporal (15 min to daily) and spatial (5 km to 50km) resolutions over three different drainage basin sizes was observed. The results showed the model was sensitive to both, generating up to 100% differences in modelled sediment yields with smaller spatial and temporal resolution precipitation. Larger drainage basins also showed a greater sensitivity to both spatial and temporal resolution. Furthermore, analysis of the distribution of erosion and deposition patterns suggested that small temporal and spatial resolution inputs increased erosion in drainage basin headwaters and deposition in the valley floors. Both of these findings may have implications for existing models and approaches for simulating landscape development.",

            "abstract": "Earth's lowermost mantle is characterized by a seismic reflector at 200 to 300 kilometers above the core-mantle boundary. This so-called D'' discontinuity may be caused by a phase transition from perovskite to post-perovskite, by a sudden onset in seismic anisotropy, by an accumulation of scatterers, by remnants of subducted slabs or dense primitive materials, or may bear witness to chemical reactions with core material. We discuss these possible interpretations of D'' structure in the light of array seismologically attainable observables and their accuracies. Synthetic modeling of the seismic response of a wide range of lowermost mantle models shows e.g. that the maximum observable thickness of a second-order discontinuity corresponds to the maximum thickness of the D'' discontinuity observed in previous studies. Thus, the observation of sharp D'' reflectors cannot rule out the predicted wide phase transition in perovskite at lowermost mantle conditions. Synthetic results also show that steep topography of one sharp discontinuity may cause multiple apparent reflectors a different depths, possibly providing explanations for apparent double reflectors or complex structure near the edges of large low shear wave velocity provinces. Regarding topography, we propose an additional array seismological observable for measuring the lateral variability of discontinuity depths utilizing both traveltime and slowness measurements at regional seismic arrays. However, despite improving the seismic resolution of lowermost mantle structure, none of the initially proposed possible mechanisms that may cause the D\" reflector can be falsified. Seismological studies may rely on further mineralphysical, geochemical and dynamical specification of the elastic parameters corresponding to the individual thermal and compositional range of each model including their respective accuracies, to reliably support or falsify or even discriminate the physical cause for the observed lowermost mantle complexity.",

In this presentation, we show an ancient record of earthquake rupture in shallow portion of subduction zone, characterized by frictional melting of smectite.\nTwo young and non-metamorphosed accretionary complexes developed in the Miura and Boso peninsulas, central Japan: 1) the Early to Middle Miocene and 2) the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene accretionary complex. Based on the vitrinite reflectance, the maximum burial depth were estimated as 2-3 km (65-90˚C) and less than 1 km (about 20 ˚C), respectively. The former complex thrust up above the latter one, leading to formation of the Ishido thrust. The difference of maximum paleotemperature and low angle of the thrust dipping (<30˚) implies the total net slip should be over a few km. The fault core is composed of black-colored thin (<1 mm) pseudotachylite and fault gouge. Under SEM-BSE observation, the pseudotachylite is characterized by homogeneous glassy matrix including fragments of quartz/feldspar, submicron-sized Fe-rich spherules, and vesicles. Based on the mineralogy of the host rock, spot analyses and elemental mapping, origin of the pseudotachylite was apparently frictional melting of smectite containing Fe. Fe-rich spherules formed by rapid cooling of pseudotachylite. On the other hand, occurrences of the fault gouge: no grain-preferred orientations, folding with pseudotachylite, intrusion into pseudotachylite and vice versa, suggest that the gouge corresponds to the fluidized zone associated with high-speed shear. This fluidized zone contains large number of pseudotachylite fragments, and some pseudotachylite cut the fluidized zone, indicative of plural earthquake ruptures occurred along this thrust.",

The KORUS-AQ campaign, jointly organized by National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) of Korea and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) aims at understanding various aspects of air quality problem in Korea and will be held in spring, 2016. In preparation for this campaign, pre-campaign was held during May 18-June 13, 2015, in Seoul where numerous local anthropogenic sources exist and influence of Chinese continental outflow directly affects. Here we present some of the important results from the pre-campaign. Chemical properties of aerosols were measured with AMS. Aerosol and CCN number concentrations, aerosol size distribution and aerosol hygroscopic growth factor were measured by CPC, CCN counter, SMPS and H-TDMA, respectively. Average diurnal variation of aerosol number concentration showed three dominant peaks at around 0600_UTC and morning and evening rush hours. Each peak seemed to have different characteristics and therefore detailed analyses of physical and chemical properties of aerosols during the peaks as well as during some special events will be made. The hygroscopicity parameter, kappa, will be estimated by examining CCN activity, H-TDMA measured hygroscopic growth factor and mixing rule of aerosol chemical components, and the result will be compared as well.",

This timely information garners great public interest and provides a rich opportunity to engage students in discussion and analysis of earthquakes and tectonics. In this presentation I will describe a suite of iOS and Mac OS X apps that I use for teaching and that Penn State employs in outreach efforts in a small museum run by the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. The iOS apps include a simple, global overview of earthquake activity, epicentral, designed for a quick review or event lookup. A more full-featured iPad app, epicentral-plus, includes a simple global overview along with views that allow a more detailed exploration of geographic regions of interest. In addition, epicentral-plus allows the user to monitor ground motions using seismic channel lists compatible with the IRIS web services. Some limited seismogram processing features are included to allow focus on appropriate signal bandwidths. A companion web site, which includes background material on earthquakes, and a blog that includes sample images and channel lists appropriate for monitoring earthquakes in regions of recent earthquake activity can be accessed through the a third panel in the app. I use epicentral-plus at the beginning of each earthquake seismology class to review recent earthquake activity and to stimulate students to formulate and to ask questions that lead to discussions of earthquake and tectonic processes. Less interactive OS X versions of the apps are used to display a global map of earthquake activity and seismograms in near real time in a small museum on the ground floor of the building hosting Penn State’s Geoscience Department.",

            "abstract": "Himematsu and Furuya (2015) have reported that the 2007 dike intrusion episode in Tanzania accompanied significant aseismic strike slip at the subsiding zone above the tensile dislocation. No previous studies, however, have considered such strike slip components associated with dike intrusion events. Although seismic swarms during rifting events are often attributed to the magma intrusion, there is a hypothesis that aseismic slip may be responsible for the generation of seismic swarm (e.g., Lohman & McGuire, 2007). It is thus possible that similar aseismic strike slip could have generally occurred during any rifting events.\nWe re-examine the crustal deformation signals during the 2005-2010 Afar rifting episode using ALOS/PALSAR (L-band) images. The seismic swarm and the dike intrusion intermittently occurred from September 2005 to May 2010. Some previous studies have already reported the 3D displacements for the September 2005 rifting event (e.g., Wright et al., 2006). While two ~Mw5.5 right-lateral earthquakes were reported around the focal region, their results showed no remarkable horizontal displacement at the graben-like subsiding zone. However, we argue that the insignificant horizontal displacements along the intruded dike would be due to the lack of coherent signals near the subsiding zone.\nWe applied offset tracking technique to the ascending-track data set (12 June 2007 – 20 June 2010) to acquire the robust crustal deformation signals. Both the azimuth offset and the multiple aperture interferometry (MAI) data are sensitive to the displacement along the satellite track (~N350°E), and showed clearly the NNW horizontal displacement at the subsiding zone. At the subsiding zone the range offset and azimuth offset data depicts the maximum changes of about 225 cm and 110cm, respectively. Because focal mechanisms of the earthquakes reported by previous studies and Global CMT catalogue during the rifting indicate few strike components, we propose that the horizontal displacements may be caused by aseismic strike-slip. We will discuss the mechanism of the aseismic strike slip relating with the seismic swarm.",

            "abstract": "The compositional and thermal heterogeneity of convecting mantle critically affect magma production and compositions and cannot be easily distinguished from each other. The way to resolve this ambiguity is an independent estimation of temperature and composition of mantle sources of various types of magma.\nHere we report application of olivine-spinel-melt geothermometers based on partition of Al, Cr, Sc, Y, Fe and Mg as well as direct measurement of H2O concentrations in melt for olivine hosted melt and spinel inclusions from different primitive lavas of MORB, OIB, LIP, Archean komatiites and SSZ. The results suggest significant variations of crystallization temperature for the same Fo of high magnesium olivines from different types of mantle-derived magmas: from the lowest (down to 1220oC) for MORB and SSZ to the highest (up to over 1500oC) for komatiites and Siberian meimechites. These results confirm the relatively low temperature of the mantle sources of MORB and SSZ magmas, low to moderate amount of H2O (0.2-1 wt%) in komatiite primary melts, high H2O contents (over 2 wt%) of SSZ primary magmas and higher temperatures in the mantle plumes.\nThe established liquidus temperatures and compositions of primary melts allow estimating potential temperatures of their mantle sources. The highest potential temperatures over 1800 oC are characteristic for Archean komatiites. For Phanerozoic age the highest potential temperatures (1650oC) are found for the largest LIPs: Siberian, North Atlantic and Caribbean. The sources of OIBs yield significant range of potential temperatures: 1400-1600oC, positively correlated with magma production rate. MORBs yield potential temperature between 1350-1400oC except those from ultra slow spreading ridges (e.g. Knipovich ridge), which display potential temperatures down to 1250 oC. Potential temperatures of SSZ mantle sources are typically within the range for MORB, suggesting origin of SSZ primary melts by H2O fluxing of convecting mantle wedge. Exceptions are some boninites, which require higher temperature and plume related sources.\nThe results strongly confirm mantle plume theory and external source of H2O in SSZ mantle. The H2O in komatiites could be incorporated in the transitional zone.",

            "abstract": "A recent study has shown the ability of the Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) at Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR, PFISR) to characterize turbulence in the mesosphere (D-Region) [Nicolls et. al, 2011]. We present case studies of AMISR measurements of turbulence where the meteorological conditions are defined by the presence of persistent Mesospheric Inversion Layers (MILs). We consider MILs that are detected by satellite over a day and are also detected by Rayleigh lidar at PFRR [Irving et. al, 2014]. MILs are a signature of large-scale planetary wave breaking in the upper atmosphere, where a region with a temperature inversion lies below a region with an adiabatic lapse rate. The region with the inversion allows small-scale waves to become unstable, break, and generate turbulence. The region with the adiabatic lapse rate is indicative of a well-mixed layer and the presence of turbulence. AMISR-class radars have a steerable narrow beam (1°) and high vertical resolution (750 m). We review the principles and practices of incoherent scatter radar with a focus on detection of D-region turbulence using radar spectra. We present the geometry of the turbulence and the radar, comparing the turbulent, plasma, and radar spatial scales. We develop a turbulence retrieval algorithm using a Voigt function spectral line. We fit the spectra to a Voigt function using the Levenberg-Marquardt method and use the Gaussian component of the Voigt spectra to calculate the RMS velocity, and hence the turbulent energy dissipation rate. With the environmental conditions characterized by satellite and lidar and the turbulence characterized by radar data, we can test the ability of PFISR to characterize mesospheric turbulence under consistent meteorological conditions and develop robust technique for turbulence measurements.",

At a distance of 3.6 AU the instrument detects the first water ions from the comet but the comet activity is still low and the solar wind passes through the thin atmosphere without being much affected. The situation gradually changes as the comet moves closer to the sun and the cometary atmosphere develops. Mass loading becomes important, the solar wind is deflected and large fluxes of accelerated cometary ions are observed. We characterize the changes of the ion environment in terms of ion fluxes and energy spectra as the comet moves from 3.6 AU through perihelion.

            "abstract": "The global ocean overturning circulation plays a central role in climate by transporting heat, freshwater and carbon around the Earth. Cold water that sinks at high latitudes is upwelled along surfaces of constant density connecting the deep ocean to the sea surface in the Southern Hemisphere. Cross-density circulation can however shortcut the along-density circulation, thereby impacting large-scale water mass pathways, overturning time scales, and the abyssal ocean’s ability to act as a carbon reservoir. Despite its crucial role for climate, the cross-density circulation is poorly known since our capacity to measure it has historically been lacking. In this study, we present the first measurements of the slow multi-year cross-density circulation in the Southern Ocean interior. We show that 10–25% of the Southern Ocean overturning circulation is redirected through cross-density shortcuts. We find strong regional variations in the intensity of cross-density circulation, with hotspots where cross-density velocities are enhanced by 5 to 14-fold. Our results suggest a disproportionate contribution of those regions to the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, and highlight the importance of reliably representing them in our conceptual and forecast models of the ocean’s role in climate.",

            "abstract": "Methane hydrate (hereafter called “MH”) is crystalline solid compound consisting of hydrogen-bonded water molecules forming cages and methane gas molecules enclosed in the cage. When using MH as an energy resource, MH is dissociated to methane gas and water and collect only the methane gas. The optimum MH production method was the “depressurization method”. Here, the production of MH means dissociating MH in the geologic layers and collecting the resultant methane gas by production systems. In the production of MH by depressurization method, MH regeneration was consider to important problem for the flow assurance of MH production system. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the effect of flow phenomena in the pipeline on hydrate regeneration. Cavitation is one of the flow phenomena which was considered a cause of MH regeneration. Large quantity of microbubbles are produced by cavitation in a moment, therefore, it is considered to promote MH formation. In order to verify the possible of MH regeneration by cavitation, it is necessary to detailed understanding the condition of MH formation by cavitation. As a part of a Japanese National hydrate research program (MH21, funded by METI), we performed a study on MH formation using by cavitation. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the formation MH by using cavitation in the various temperature and pressure condition, and to clarify the condition of MH formation by using observation results.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we suggest the new method to correct the bias of projected daily precipitation using two probability distributions, which are Gamma and generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, and spline interpolations. The normal bias correction methods are usually focused on the average annual precipitation. However, the needs of extreme events analysis in climate change are increasingly growing to prevent the future disaster, such as flooding. We conduct the bias corrections of daily precipitation with considering the extreme cases of projected daily precipitation and also maintaining the characteristics of observed annual precipitation. The observed daily precipitation data at four sites are examined to estimate the effects of the new bias correction method for the extreme events. The power of this method is checked with the observed daily precipitation from 1979 to 2005 at Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu and Busan in Korea by the Q-Q plots and statistical diagnostic tools before applying to the projected precipitation. And then this method is applied to estimate the bias of projected precipitation and compared to the results of the previous studies, such as linear scaling and quantile mapping with Gamma distribution. We found that this method can preserve the characteristics of annual precipitation and estimate the appropriate extreme quantiles. These results illustrate the need to consider this method in the bias correction of projected precipitation in extreme analysis, which is very attractive for designing water-related infrastructure in response to future climate change.",

            "abstract": "The 2010 mildly explosive eruption at Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland, produced mingled tephra of benmoreitic and trachytic composition whereas alkali basalt was emitted during preceding flank eruption. Tephra of the first explosive phase are composed of three glass types, alkaline rhyolite, mixed benmoreite, and basalt. The early formed benmoreitic tephra (erupted on 15 and 17 April 2010) had large 210Po in excess of 210Pb [(210Po/210Pb)0= 1.88)] at the time of eruption, and possibly a small 210Pb excess over its parent 226Ra. In contrast, the preceding flank eruption produced basalt with (210Po)0 = 0, upon eruption, and the final trachyte (end of May 2010) had lost most of its 210Po during open-system degassing. The 210Po excess in the first erupted benmoreites is interpreted to result from 210Po degassing of basaltic magma and the accumulation of 210Po-enriched gas, either in the upper part of the basaltic intrusion, below the rhyolite-basalt interface, on in the pre-existing residual rhyolitic magma chamber. A model of radon and polonium accumulation in the rhyolitic reservoir, allows calculating the ratio of mass of basalt magma degassing over mass of magma accumulating excess gas. This ratio decreased from 20 to 15 over 2 days, implying zoned magma reservoir, with the uppermost and gas-richest part erupted first. The duration of pre-eruptive gas accumulation in this model is approximately one year. This corresponds closely to the initiation of a seismic swarm beneath Eyjafjallajökull, early June 2009, which was the first pre-eruptive signal detected. The coincidence between initiation of gas accumulation at relatively shallow depth and deeper seismicity strongly suggests that the excess gas phase originated from a basalt magma batch intruded at depth, and that this gas phase reached the surface approximately a year later.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that the South Atlantic Ocean experienced two phases of fast spreading in Late Cretaceous and Oligocene-Miocene, separated by a period of slow spreading around the K-T boundary. These two phases of fast spreading are correlated with two main periods of widespread uplift in the African continent. The present-day situation is characterized by a strong topographic gradient across the oceanic basin, with Africa being elevated and South America being depressed by non-isostatic forcing. These observations are not easily explained through shallow tectonics, but can be linked dynamically under the assumption of a thin and low-viscosity asthenosphere. In particular, they can be easily understood as the result of unsteady pressure-driven flow in such a low-viscosity sublithospheric layer.",

            "abstract": "It is accepted that high-energy particles are efficiently generated during their crossing of shocks in space, where the diffusive shock acceleration is the most standard process to explain the observed energy spectrum beyond the order of a gigaelectronvolt. In contrast, recent spacecraft observations have shown different characteristics in a lower energy range (a kilo- to megaelectronvolt): particles in the heliosphere have a power-law spectrum in particle speed with a spectral index of -5, which is commonly found in any solar wind conditions. This is a puzzling result that the shocks are not a necessary element responsible for accelerating particles. The alternative mechanism, a pump acceleration, is proposed where particles are accelerated in a region containing large-scale compressions and expansions (e.g., Fisk and Gloeckler, JGR 2014). In the present study, we elucidate the validity of this mechanism by performing hybrid simulations to investigate the particle, particularly pickup ions, dynamics in various situations of non-uniform velocity field, such as a simple fast/slow flow interaction, sinusoidal structures, or random profiles, and to compare the velocity spectrum of suprathermal particles in each case. We also study the scale dependence of acceleration processes by comparing the spectrum of the energetic H+, He+, and O+.",

            "abstract": "Plant communities are largely shaped by prevailing climatic conditions. As a result, environmental change is expected to alter the (functional) composition in plant communities. Because plants, and particularly the composition of plant species, play an important role in driving ecosystem processes, it is crucial that we improve our understanding on which environmental factors are most important in shaping plant communities. Here we presnt the results for a cross–Eurpean study, were we assessed the role of environmnetal conditions on plant community composition in 56 peatlands. We show that plant species richness and diversity are relatively stable across the main environmental gradients. Nevertheless, we observe large changes in the plant community structure. In other words, species turnover increased with increasing differences in environmental viariables. Such turnover in the community composition is largely associated to gradients temperature and precipitation, whilst nutrients –often reported as major driver for changes in peatland ecosystems– were only important at the end of the gradient of current deposition levels in Europe. Using a combination of species distribution modelling and species co-occurence patterns, we identified two spatially non–exclusive groups of plant species. Species within a distinct group responded similarly to bioclimatic variables and nutrient deposition levels, whilst between group response was mirrored. These results suggest that these two groups of plants are subjected to divergent environmental filters. Additionally, European peatlands aggregate into two distinct clusters based on plant functional trait composition. Each cluster was dominated by plant species from either one of the two co-response groups. Overall, our results demonstrate that environmental change results in a gradual replacement of plant species from two divergent groups, consequently affecting the functional trait composition in peatlands.",

This study used a natural stream as an experimental site with the site was 60m long by 30m wide, which was in downstream of Landao Creek, Huisun forest, Taiwan. The field experiment was designed to investigate the effects of river processes on bar, and the effects vegetation dynamics had on bar formation, which cause by upstream dam broke. To analysis how vegetation impact on bar-form and bar-stabilization, we used wood piles (4.4×4.4×80cm) as natural rigid vegetation, which inserted into the bar upstream.\nIn the field site, we chose 6 site to set wood piles, each site was designed 4 row and were total 11 piles within, which set at in-row and in- line spacing of 50×20cm. According to the results, two primary phase of forming bar in the fluvial processes were discussed. First, in the flood period, presence of piles could trap large gravel in the front and turn the gravel into deposition. When the deposition gradually accreted, the front of deposition would induce flow to divide, let flow disperse into two branches around the deposition; some coarser particles rather are transported along the bar surface with momentum of flow movement and deposited at the top of bar, than are transported along the diversion channel around the bar (the median grain size of bar top were coarser 50% than before). Second, in the flood recession period, bar quickly accreted portions of passing bed load sheets and grew laterally and in the headward direction. Phenomenon showed that the composition of grain size were decreasing in the headward direction, which flow entrained were getting smaller with flood recession (the median grain size between top and the front of bar differed 30%).",

            "abstract": "Local impacts of meteorological events are often shaped by the microclimates in which they occur and only by including understanding of these microclimates can robust assessments and projections of such events be made. However, co-production of knowledge with end users is also required in order to make the assessments useful for decision makers and for society as a whole. This work presents two studies working with end users around the European city of Bergen, Norway.\nThe first study is on extreme winds assessment for larger-scale construction. While such an assessment is usually based on historical observations when the climate was more stationary, under a changing climate, infrastructure built to last for the next fifty years or more may experience events not seen in the observational period. The case study is presented for the newly completed Hardanger Bridge in Norway and demonstrates a novel method for incorporating estimates of future changes in extreme winds into the design process (figure 1). Given the close collaboration with the engineers involved in the bridge’s construction, the method was tailored to fit with existing practices and standards.\nThe second study focuses on air pollution events within the city that are favoured by persistent wintertime temperature inversions in the narrow Bergen valley. Using a temperature profile radiometer, these temperature inversions have been characterized and related to the local circulation in- and above the valley. There has been the assumption that the many large ships in Bergen harbour had a major contribution to high pollution events within the city. Results from this study however indicate that temperature inversions are mostly connected to down-valley winds. These should remove the ship-emissions from the city, giving the ships a much smaller impact on high air pollution events than previously assumed, something that is under further evaluation and of high interest for the local harbour authority.\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "Uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and associated climate changes leading to enhanced seasonality in precipitation and drying, are argued to have induced a global ecological shift from C3-frorest to C4-grassland between 8 and 5 million years ago. However, both tectonic and climatic changes predate the timing of the C3-C4 transition, with paleoaltimetry studies pointing to a high Tibetan Plateau no later than 10 Ma and the existence of an intense monsoon since ca. 11 Ma.\nTo better understand the role of the Tibetan Plateau, we present results of a paleoecology study based on the carbon isotope compositions of leaf-wax n-alkanes (δ13Calk) from Qaidam basin, an intermontane basin on the youngest and the northernmost portion of Tibetan Plateau. Samples were collected from a 5-km thick, fluvial-lacustrine sequence dated 15 Ma to 1.8 Ma. Organic geochemical indices and detrital thermochronological studies preclude post-depositional thermal alteration of the studied materials.\nOur results, which show persistently low δ13Calk values, are consistent with the dominance of C3 flora on the Tibetan Plateau, in contrast to the prominent C4 rise surrounding the Tibetan Plateau and around the globe. We argue that a high Tibetan Plateau, established prior to the global ecological C3-C4 shift, served as a shelter of C3 flora since the Miocene. High-elevation and cold environments provided a competitive advantage for C3 by damping/counteracting the physiological advantage of C4 which outperforms C3 plants under warm, high-irradiance, water-stress and low pCO2 conditions.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 Tohoku EQ revealed that co-seismic displacement along the megathrust can reach the deformation front of subduction zones. Since then the global significance of slip-to-the-trench has become an important field of study; hence investigation of past events at other active megathrusts is critical. Offshore SE Costa Rica the deformation front of the Caribbean forearc is formed by a ~10 km-wide accretionary wedge. Here, drill Site U141 has revealed a record of frontal thrusts detached along biogenic ooze, which correlates lithologically with the “reference” Site U1381. This biogenic ooze contains >70% of organic components.There are up to 15% silica-rich elements in the upper part of the formation, while clay increases downsection. The biogenic ooze is overlain by silty clay, in which smectite is the dominant mineral.\nLow- to high-velocity friction experiments were performed on the biogenic ooze and the silty clay to investigate the velocity dependence of friction and the micromechanical foundation of strain localization within fontal thrusts. These experiments were performed at slip-rates of 3 µms−1 to 3.5 ms−1and σn up to 12 MPa, under both room-humidity and water saturated conditions. These experimental results indicate that, at low slip-rates, the biogenic ooze is stronger than the silty clay. At increasing slip-rates silty clays have a positive dependence of friction, while biogenic oozes show a sharp decrease of their friction coefficient as slip-rate increases. This rate-weakening behavior of the biogenic oozes may enhance co-seismic slip along the megathrust. The implication of these mechanical measurements is that the geological structures found in the forearc toe offshore SE Costa Rica were formed by locally high slip-rates that have enhanced slip propagation to the trench. Under slow slip-rates, deformation can have localized easier by creeping within the clays than in the oozes as seen.\nAs Tsunami earthquakes are known to form with pronounced slip-to-the trench, the presence of biogenic oozes could be an indicator for past and potential tsunamigenic events. If so, this would be the case for the MAT from Guatemala to Costa Rica where similar biogenic ooze is found at all drill sites. Specifically, biogenic ooze may have formed the slip surface of the 1992 Nicaragua tsunami EQ. This needs to be tested.",

Here we examine the liquidus phase relations in the Fe-Fe3S binary system between 38 and 138 GPa based on characterization of a sample recovered from a melting experiment at high pressure and temperature in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell. Both Fe-8wt.%S and Fe-14wt.%S samples were employed as starting materials, which were homogeneous mixtures of fine-grain Fe and FeS (<1 µm) prepared by induction melting and rapid quenching technique [Morard et al., 2011 PCM]. We used a focused ion beam (FIB) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry for textural and chemical characterizations of recovered samples. The samples exhibited a melting texture with quenched liquid alloy at the hottest part and solid Fe or Fe3S at its outside. In a couple of samples, the quenched liquid was in direct contact with solid Fe3S, and solid Fe was also present right next to Fe3S, suggesting that the composition of such liquid is close to a eutectic composition (~10 wt.% S at 66 GPa and ~12 wt.% S at 138 GPa). Indeed, this interpretation is consistent with the results of other experiments obtained in this study. Our data demonstrate that the eutectic liquid composition in the Fe-Fe3S binary system decreases its sulfur concentration with increasing pressure, which is in agreement with previous studies [Morard et al., 2008 EPSL; Kamada et al., 2012 EPSL]. The sulfur content in the eutectic liquid composition may be less than 10 wt.% at the inner core boundary pressure. The recent shock-wave study by Huang et al.[2013 GRL] suggested 10 wt.% S in the outer core, but the present study indicates that such liquid alloy with 10 wt.% S crystalizes the B2 phase of Fe-S alloy and thus does not support the sulfur-rich outer core.",

The results show that the cloud fraction of warm liquid phase is dominated only over the tropical oceans between 30°N and 30°S and ice-phase clouds are very frequent over the continents and mid-latitude oceans. Supercooled liquid- and mixed phase clouds only locate at the mid- and high- latitudes region. In addition, the relationship between cloud phase and environment parameters (such as, ice nuclei, vertical velocity) is also further discussed. In summary, the radiative contribution of warm water cloud has maximum value (reach -150 W/m2) over the several important Stratocumulus regions (such as, west coasts of North America, South America, and West Africa). However, the radiative contributions of mixed-phase and super-cooled water cloud are not to be neglected over the Southern ocean (between -100 and -150 W/m2), especially the mixed-phased cloud over the west-central Pacific Ocean warm pool. The results highlight the importance of mixed-phase and supercooled water cloud processes for the regional energy cycle and may lead to an improved prediction of climate change by general circulation models.",

The recently-completed Norwegian young sea ICE cruise (N-ICE2015) made measurements north of Svalbard from a ship drifting within the Arctic sea ice pack from mid-winter into summer (January—June 2015). The purpose of the experiment was to provide better understanding of the drivers and effects within this new sea ice regime in the Arctic. This extensive measurement campaign made concurrent, in-situ measurements of all aspects of the Arctic sea ice system including atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, snowpack, and biology. The atmosphere plays a key role in the sea ice system, thus, observations were made of the meteorological conditions, radiative fluxes, boundary layer properties, turbulent fluxes, clouds, and atmospheric profiles. Interestingly, the atmospheric circulation in this region during this period was very different during January to March than in April to June. This led to very different meteorological and radiative balance regimes during these two periods, with much larger variability in winter. We will present preliminary data from the atmospheric observations made throughout the campaign, which offer clues to how large-scale atmospheric circulation affects energy balance and heat and moisture transport in the Arctic.",

However, there is limited process-based evidence to determine the density and spatial extent of riparian tree planting required to obtain temperature targets under differing environmental conditions. A simulation experiment was used to understand the importance of riparian vegetation density, channel orientation and flow velocity for stream energy budgets and river temperature dynamics. Water temperature and meteorological observations were obtained in addition to hemispherical photographs along a ~1 km reach of the Girnock Burn, a tributary of the Aberdeenshire Dee, Scotland. Nine hemispherical images (representing different uniform canopy density scenarios) were used to parameterise a deterministic net radiation model and simulate radiative fluxes. For each vegetation scenario, the effects of eight channel orientations were investigated by changing the position of north at 45° intervals in each hemispheric image. Simulated radiative fluxes and observed turbulent fluxes drove a high-resolution water temperature model for the reach. Simulations were performed under low and high water velocity scenarios. Both velocity scenarios yielded decreases in mean (≥ 1.7 °C) and maximum (≥ 3.0 °C) temperature as canopy density increased. Slow-flowing water resided longer within the reach, which enhanced heat accumulation and dissipation and drove higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures. Intermediate levels of shade produced highly variable energy flux and water temperature dynamics depending on the channel orientation and thus the time of day when the channel was shaded. We demonstrate that in many reaches relatively sparse but strategically located vegetation could produce substantial reductions in maximum temperature and suggest that these criteria are used to inform future river management.",

            "abstract": "Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability is an important process for mass transport at the flank magnetopause during northward interplanetary magnetic field. Previous theoretical studies conclude that the development of the K-H instability should base on the most unstable mode, which is a function of the shear-flow Mach number, but is independent of the location of the unperturbed boundary. However, simulations of subsonic velocity shear indicate that the amplitude and wavelength of the vortices expand with time, but the growth rate of the K-H instability is relatively unchanged. We suspect that the growth rate of different wavelength should depend on the location of the unperturbed boundary. In this study, we examine the growth rate of the K-H instability with subsonic velocity shear as a function of Mach number, wavelength, and the location of the unperturbed boundary. Our results indicate that for a given Mach number, the growth rate increases but the wavelength of the most unstable wave mode decreases with increasing distance from the unperturbed boundary from the center of the surface wave. Namely, if the wavelength of the surface wave increases with increasing amplitude of the surface wave, the growth rate could remain unchanged for a period. As a result, the most unstable mode could be irrelevant to the observed wavelength of the surface wave. Our results provide a good theoretical explanation of the evolution of K-H instability found in simulations and observations.",

            "abstract": "The deformation of olivine is fundamental to plate-scale geodynamic processes, and its various deformation mechanisms may induce behaviours such as strain localisation and viscous anisotropy in the upper mantle. Improved characterisation of the lattice- to grain-scale processes by which creep occurs under a range of conditions will therefore better establish the role of different deformation mechanisms in controlling macroscopic tectonics.\nRecent developments in high angular resolution electron-backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) have provided a new tool for analysing crystal plasticity and associated geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) densities across length scales of 10-7–10-3 m. This approach employs diffraction-pattern cross-correlation to achieve exceptional sensitivity in measurements of lattice rotation (< 0.01°) and GND density (~1011 m-2), and is being used to study dislocation processes and deformation mechanisms in a wide variety of materials-science applications.\nWe apply HR-EBSD analysis to olivine to characterise GNDs associated with different deformation mechanisms. We establish the ideal EBSD settings (i.e. step size and pattern binning) to optimise spatial resolution, GND sensitivity and mapping speed. GND distributions are measured in olivine single crystals and polycrystals deformed by dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding, or diffusion creep, in the laboratory or nature. We characterise the spatial distribution of dislocation structures, including the wavelength of periodic structures and the correlation between dislocation density and grain boundaries or triple junctions. A statistical assessment of GND distributions will be linked to variations in deformation mechanism. These results will provide a new tool for assessing deformation mechanisms in naturally deformed mantle rocks, thereby evaluating the validity of experimental flow laws under natural deformation conditions.",

            "abstract": "The estimation of design rainfall requires long-term precipitation observations in high temporal resolution. Those data are available only with poor spatial density, which usually entails regionalization for their practical application. An alternative would be to utilize the high spatial resolution of weather radar for the estimation of design rainfall. Meanwhile the observation length of many operational radar instruments extend over a time period of 10 years, which suggests to analyze their benefits for estimating design rainfall.\nIn this study, 13 years of observations from the Hannover radar station located in Northern Germany are analyzed together with about 50 recording rain gauges in the observation range of the regarding their reproduction of extreme rainfall statistics. Pure radar data and radar-station merging products are analyzed for rainfall durations from 5 minutes to 6 hours and return periods from 1 year to 30 years. Partial duration series of the extremes were derived from the data and probability distributions fitted. The performance of the design rainfall estimates is assessed based on cross validations for observed station points, which are used as reference. For design rainfall estimation using the pure radar data, the pixel value at station location is taken; for the merging products, spatial interpolation methods are applied.\nThe results show, that pure radar data are not suitable for the estimation of extremes. They usually lead to an overestimation compared to the observations, which is opposite to the usual behavior of radar rainfall for average intensities. However, some of the merging products between radar and station data can provide a better estimate for extremes as the station data alone, especially for the longer durations. Main condition for a good performance is that the radar data are adjusted to daily observed rainfall sums prior to their application.",

            "abstract": "The general circulation of the middle and upper atmosphere is determined by waves that form in the lower atmosphere. Large-scale Rossby waves and small-scale gravity waves propagate upward and release their energy in regions of instability such as critical layers. Rossby wave breaking leads to large scale disturbances in the wind and temperature fields known as a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). These have a great impact on the seasonal weather and climate of the middle atmosphere. SSW events have a particular relationship with gravity waves in the Arctic middle atmosphere. During these events gravity waves reestablish geostrophic balance in the wind field, i.e. the stratospheric polar jet. This return to geostrophic balance, called geostrophic adjustment, generates gravity waves. We used the data from a recent rocket mission, lidar measurements, satellites, and MERRA to understand the coupling of small scale turbulent motions to large scale wave motions in the atmosphere. The Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere Turbulence Experiment (MTeX) rocket investigation was composed of two rockets launched from Poker Flat Research Range on 25-26 January 2015. MTeX was launched into a mesospheric inversion layer (MIL) giving us a known meteorology. A neutral density sensor that measured turbulence at 20 cm scales flew on both MTeX payloads. Rayleigh lidar measurements of the stratosphere and mesosphere give us the temperature and density structure at kilometer scales characterized the mean environment as well as gravity waves and the MIL. Satellite measurements allow us to characterize the planetary wave activity. MERRA reanalysis gives us a characterization of the winds and planetary waves and their effect on the generation and propagation of waves from scales of tens to thousands of km. The combination of these three data sources and MERRA reanalysis gives us a view of the waves from the synoptic-scale generation and propagation of waves to the small-scale generation of turbulence. We can thus characterize the motions from waves to turbulence around a defined and persistent meteorological event to better understand turbulent transport in the mesosphere.",

            "abstract": "Noise tomography usually works under the assumption that the inter-station ambient noise correlation is equal to a scaled version of the Green’s function between the two receivers. This assumption, however, is only met under specific conditions, for instance, wavefield diffusivity and equipartitioning, zero attenuation, etc., that are typically not satisfied in the Earth. This inconsistency inhibits the exploitation of the full waveform information contained in noise correlations regarding Earth structure and noise generation. To overcome this limitation we attempt to develop a method that consistently accounts for noise distribution, 3D heterogeneous Earth structure and the full seismic wave propagation physics in order to improve the current resolution of tomographic images of the Earth.\nAs an initial step towards a full waveform ambient noise inversion we develop a preliminary inversion scheme based on a 2D finite-difference code simulating correlation functions and on adjoint techniques. With respect to our final goal, a simultaneous inversion for noise distribution and Earth structure, we address the following two aspects: (1) the capabilities of different misfit functionals to image wave speed anomalies and source distribution and (2) possible source-structure trade-offs, especially to what extent unresolvable structure could be mapped into the inverted noise source distribution and vice versa.",

            "abstract": "Eclogitic rocks provide key constraints on both the evolution (P-T-t-ε paths) and the deformation modes of the crust along the subduction interface and therefore are crucial for the understanding of tectonics at large scale. Here we present some preliminary results of a microstructural study on eclogitized mafic dykes exposed within granulites from the continental basement silver of the Mt. Emilius klippe (Western Internal Alps, Italy). In this region, highly deformed eclogites characterized by a strong layering between garnetite and clinopyroxenite bands is the most predominant feature. These different levels present very heterogeneous deformation patterns, and while the garnet-rich levels tend to have a brittle behavior, the deformation within clinopyroxene-rich levels is possibly accommodated by creep. This is evidenced by the presence of elongated grains, subgrain boundaries and intense grain size reduction close to rigid garnets. Crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) measurements in garnets indicate a quasi-random distribution. In most of the clinopyroxenes levels nevertheless, the CPO is relatively strong, with multiples of uniform distribution varying from 4 to 5.5 (value of 1 is random texture). This CPO in the clinopyroxenes is characterized by a strong alignment of poles (001) parallel to the lineation and (100) and [010] distributed along girdles cross-cutting the foliation plane. These mylonitic rocks are sometimes found as clasts within meter-thick brecciated fault rocks formed at, or nearly close to, the metamorphic peak in eclogite facies. Therefore, the materials along the subduction interface at these P-T conditions (i.e., ~2.0-2.5 GPa; 500-550°C) can locally be brittle where deformation is classically envisioned as ductile. We propose a model that involves creep deformation, heterogeneous fluid circulation, and local brittle behavior to explain the co-existence of ductile and brittle features developed in the same depth region.",

A live simulation of tidal flows on a modelled version of the estuary can be viewed on a box in the centre of a virtual room. Using the controller, the user is able to raise sea levels and see what happens as the tide levels adjust.\nHumber-in-a-Box uses a numerical model built with data used for published research. The hydraulic component of the CAESAR-Lisflood model code was incorporated into the UNITY-3D gaming engine, and the model uses recorded tidal stage data, bathymetry and elevations to build the virtual environment and drive the simulation. Present day flood defences are incorporated into the model, and in conjunction with modelling tidal flows, this provides a better representation of future flood risk than simpler linear models. The user is able to raise and lower sea levels between -10 m and 100 m, in 1m increments, and can reset the simulation to present day levels with one button click.\nHumber-in-a-Box has been showcased at several outreach events and has proven to be very popular and effective in an environment where time with each user is pressured, and information needs to exchange quickly. It has also been used in teaching at Undergraduate level, although the full potential of this is yet to be explored.

Direct solvers are incorporated both in the forward and inverse problems, For the forward problem, the vector Helmholtz equation for the secondary electric field is discretized on a hexahedral mesh using edge finite elements, then a direct sparse-matrix solver is chosen to effectively reuse its factorization both in the survey simulation and Jacobian computation. The inversion method is formulated as a functional optimization with an objective functional containing terms measuring data misfit and model structure by means of smoothness and anisotropy. These measures are efficiently incorporated through the use of an iteratively reweighted least-squares scheme. The objective functional is minimized by a Gauss-Newton approach using a direct dense-matrix solver.

Australian temperate grasslands represent a broad range of plant communities from exotic pastures to native grasslands, but all are important for food security (livestock grazing) and biodiversity retention. Climate predictions for temperate Australia include higher temperatures, altered rainfall frequency/seasonality, increased drought severity and more regular wildfires. The ecosystem response to these climatic factors is unknown, and the need to improve the monitoring of these highly dynamic grassland systems at a landscape scale is acute.\nThe aim of this research is to use high-frequency phenological data to improve the identification of grassland functional types and ultimately use this to improve the inter-annual monitoring of dynamic grassland systems.\nWe use hourly repeat photography and the Green Chromatic Coordinate vegetation index to characterize the vegetative phenology of several native and exotic grassland communities. Monthly vegetation surveys allow us to correlate plant functional groups with indicator features on the phenology profile. C4-dominated grasslands are characterized by a consistent low greenness during winter, the commencement of greening in late spring/early summer and the retention of green vegetation throughout the summer. Exotic C4 grasslands can be distinguished from native ecosystems by their early-spring flush of annual grasses and forbs prior to the primary greening in late spring/early summer. Native C3 grasslands are more variable in response to rainfall and exhibit multiple greening/browning cycles within the year. They tend to green up earlier in the spring and brown off rapidly in response to high temperatures and low rainfall. Exotic C3 grasslands also green up in early spring but exhibit a more traditional unimodal phenology profile.\nWe discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using this method for monitoring grassland vegetation dynamics, including considerations of time-of-day, shadowing and camera angle. Finally, we highlight the potential benefits and challenges for integrating these methods with satellite systems.",

Sediment transport models have been used to calculate the timescales of fan formation on Mars using orbital or rover-based imagery. These models provide a constraint on the total volume of water involved which has major implications for understanding the hydrologic history of early Mars. However, while the robustness of sediment transport models are not in doubt, the usefulness of their application to fans on Mars still requires testing using a terrestrial system of similar type, scale and possibly origin. The 1918 volcanically-generated catastrophic jökulhlaup (glacier outburst flood), southern Iceland deposited a ≤2 km3 fan over a known observed timescale of 6-8 hr. Predicted timescales using standard sediment transport models are in excellent agreement with the known timescale. This close agreement between observed and predicted timescales was arrived at only because key parameters related to the 1918 jökulhlaup are well known and tightly constrained from ground-based observations of the sedimentology and sedimentary architecture. Crucially, the latter provided independent estimates of hydraulic parameters. This work highlights the need for more detailed stratigraphic and sedimentary analysis of units on Mars (and Earth), which can provide constraints on the nature of water flow (magnitude, frequency, intermittency) and on hydraulic parameters. Such information cannot be gleaned from the final snapshot of surface geomorphology using remote imagery.",

These modes may become relevant when constituting a\ntriadic resonance with the fundamental forced mode, i.e., when the\nheight of the container matches their axial wave lengths.

            "abstract": "Jordan faces a great variety of water-related challenges: domestic water resources are scarce and polluted; the sharing of transboundary waters has led to tensions and conflicts; and Jordan is extremely dependent of foreign water resources through trade. Therefore, sustainable water management in Jordan is a challenging task, which has not yet been accomplished. The objective of this study was to analyse Jordan’s domestic water scarcity and pollution and the country’s external water dependency, and subsequently review sustainable solutions that reduce the risk of extreme water scarcity and dependency. We have estimated the green, blue and grey water footprint of five different sectors in Jordan: crop production, grazing, animal water supply, industrial production and domestic water supply. Next, we assessed the blue water scarcity ratio for the sum of surface- and groundwater and for groundwater separately, and calculated the water pollution level. Finally, we reviewed the sustainability of proposed solutions to Jordan’s domestic water problems and external water dependency in literature, while involving the results and conclusions from our analysis. We have quantified that: even while taking into account the return flows, blue water scarcity in Jordan is severe; groundwater consumption is nearly double the sustainable yield; water pollution aggravates blue water scarcity; and Jordan’s external virtual water dependency is 86%. Our review yields ten essential ingredients that a sustainable water management strategy for Jordan, that reduces the risk of extreme water scarcity and dependency, should involve. With respect to these, Jordan’s current water policy requires a strong redirection towards water demand management. Especially, more attention should be paid to reducing water demand by changing the consumption patterns of Jordan consumers. Moreover, exploitation of fossil groundwater should soon be halted and planned desalination projects require careful consideration on the sustainability of their energy supply.",

            "abstract": "The glaciation history of the Balkan Peninsula is subject of research since the late 19th century. To date, only a few moraines on the Balkan Peninsula are dated, mainly using 10Be exposure dating applied on quartz bearing rocks. Since large parts of the Balkan Peninsula mountains are composed of carbonatic rocks, absolute age dating is restricted to 36Cl exposure dating, which, to date, was not conducted in this region yet. So far, an absolute chronological control in limestone-dominated areas is limited to U-series minimum ages of calcitic cements. In order to obtain more information about the timing of the glaciation history on the Balkan Peninsula, we investigated a terminal moraine in a NNE-facing cirque in the Galicica Mountains (40°56´N, 20°49´E) in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The cirque comprises a series of nested moraine ridges at the base of the cirque wall, with the largest one being sampled. Samples from five limestone boulders in crest position (≈ 2050 m a.s.l.) were taken and pre-treated for AMS measurement at the University of Cologne. Three preliminary ages point to a moraine formation in the course of a late Pleistocene glaciation, either Last Glacial Maximum or Younger Dryas. The data were discussed concerning corrections for topographic shielding, snow cover, inheritance, and erosion. However, five AMS re-measurements are currently in progress in order to refine the correlation of the moraine formation to a specific glacial period. The resulting ages will be compared to sediments of the adjacent Lakes Ohrid and Prespa, which represent valuable climatic and environmental archives. Several studies on these sediments were carried out in order to reconstruct relative changes in temperature and moisture availability. Moreover, the inferred moraine formation ages will be compared to glaciation reconstructions of other mountainous regions on the Balkan Peninsula to improve the knowledge on past climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Jianchuan basin, Yunnan Province, China, is the widest continental Cenozoic sedimentary basin in the southeastern Tibetan plateau. It is located ~10 km east of the Red River fault zone. Climatic simulations and palaeoenvironment studies suggest that SE Asia has experienced a variable intensity monsoon system for 40 Ma. Because sediments can record deformation, climate and environment changes, the Jianchuan basin provides the opportunity to assess the relative role of climate and tectonics on the Tibetan plateau formation.\nSediments consist of floodplain siltites, massive fluvial sandstone, few carbonate levels, coal and volcanosedimentary deposits. U/Pb dating of zircons from dykes, volcanodetrital deposits and lava flows respectively cutting and interbedded within the sediments was performed by in-situ LA-ICPMS. All ages range from 38 to 35 Ma. Such absolute dating is confirmed by palaeontological evidence. Dental remains of Zaisanamynodonwere found in coal deposits. This giant Rhino lived in Asia during the Ergilian (late Eocene).\nOur data allow us to propose a revised stratigraphy for the Jianchuan basin: contrary to what was suggested by previous studies, i.e. a continuous sedimentation from the Paleocene to the Miocene, nearly no sedimentation occurred after 34 Ma. Combined with a sedimentological analysis, the data indicate that during the late Eocene, the Jianchuan area was covered by a large (>15 km) braided river system that coexisted with local transient lakes, in a moderate-slope and semi-arid environment. This major sedimentation event was followed by a period of more humid conditions that may be related to an intensification of the monsoon. The end of the sedimentation seems to be contemporaneous with the Ailao Shan-Red River fault activation. The new stratigraphy has also implications for regional studies that need robust age constraints, for example for reconstructing palaeoelevation or provenance of sediments.",

            "abstract": "Seasonal climate prediction may allow predicting crop yield to reduce the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate variability and its extremes. It has been already demonstrated that seasonal climate predictions at European (or Iberian) scale from ensembles of global coupled climate models have some skill (Palmer et al., 2004). The limited predictability that exhibits the atmosphere in mid-latitudes, and therefore de Iberian Peninsula (PI), can be managed by a probabilistic approach based in terciles. This study presents an application for the IP of two methods for linking tercile-based seasonal climate forecasts with crop models to improve crop predictability.\nTwo methods were evaluated and applied for disaggregating seasonal rainfall forecasts into daily weather realizations: 1) a stochastic weather generator and 2) a forecast tercile resampler. Both methods were evaluated in a case study where the impacts of two seasonal rainfall forecasts (wet and dry forecast for 1998 and 2015 respectively) on rainfed wheat yield and irrigation requirements of maize in IP were analyzed. Simulated wheat yield and irrigation requirements of maize were computed with the crop models CERES-wheat and CERES-maize which are included in Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT v.4.5, Hoogenboom et al., 2010). Simulations were run at several locations in Spain where the crop model was calibrated and validated with independent field data.\nThese methodologies would allow quantifying the benefits and risks of a seasonal climate forecast to potential users as farmers, agroindustry and insurance companies in the IP. Therefore, we would be able to establish early warning systems and to design crop management adaptation strategies that take advantage of favorable conditions or reduce the effect of adverse ones.\n",

            "abstract": "In this presentation we describe the effects of plasma density fluctuations in the solar wind on the relaxation of the electron beams ejected from the Sun. The density fluctuations are supposed to be responsible for the changes in the local phase velocity of the Langmuir waves generated by the beam instability. Changes in the wave phase velocity during the wave propagation can be described in terms of probability distribution function determined by distribution of the density fluctuations. Using these probability distributions we describe resonant wave particle interactions by a system of equations, similar to well known quasi-linear approximation, where the conventional velocity diffusion coefficient and the wave growth rate are replaced by the averaged in the velocity space. It was shown that the process of relaxation of electron beam is accompanied by transformation of significant part of the beam kinetic energy to energy of the accelerated particles via generation and absorption of the Langmuir waves. We discovered that for the very rapid beams with beam velocity Vb > 15vT, where vT is a thermal velocity of background plasma, the relaxation process consists of two well separated steps. On first step the major relaxation process occurs and the wave growth rate almost everywhere in the velocity space becomes close to zero or negative. At the seconde stage the system remains in the state close to state of marginal stability enough long to explain how the beam may be preserved traveling distances over 1 AU while still being able to generate the Langmuir waves.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires influence many aspects of the Earth system, including ecosystem distribution, biodiversity, the carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry and climate. The challenge is disentangling the various controls of fire, partly because of their diversity, and also because fire was impossible to observe and analyse as a global phenomenon until the satellite era. The study of ancient climates can be helpful to understand the natural drivers of wildfires. However, the reconstruction of wildfires is limited by the nature of the proxies available, chiefly charcoal, which only represents a portion of the carbon combustion continuum.\nIn here we evaluate the application molecular combustion biomarkers. For this purpose we have compiled an extensive collection of soils and lacustrine sediments representative of the humid to arid environments, which encompass the wide range of climates and ecosystems within the Iberian peninsula. We have measured the abundance of a monosaccharide anhydride (MA) biomarker called levoglucosan (1,6-anhydro-β-D-glucopyranose) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as well as general plant biomarkers such as n-alkanes. To discern between biogenic and/or anthropogenic combustion sources and the nature of fires we have investigated the use of levoglucosan, retene (PAH generated during combustion of conifer trees) and PAHs ratios such as phenantrane/anthracene and fluoranthene/pyrene. Charcoal (>150 microns) has also been measured in the lake samples to contribute in the assessment of local vs. regions fire signals. The final objective is to constrain the use of the molecular proxies as quantitative biomass combustion paleoproxies.\nThe data obtained has been mapped and compared to the documented occurrence of wildfires in Spain over the last two decades, and mesoescale patterns of atmospheric circulation and particle transport. Results show that the occurrence of levoglucosan and PAHs is widespread in modern soils and sediments in Iberia. Chemical markers are indicative of regional patterns of biomass burning rather than just local fires. Moreover, the interpretation of the molecular data requires careful consideration of the preservation processes of biomarkers as well as their input fluxes to sediments and soils.",

            "abstract": "Surface process rates provide keys to unravel controls of tectonics and climate on mountain evolution. In the Pamir, significant discrepancies exist between fluvial incision and denudation rates. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)-based fluvial incision outpaces cosmogenic nuclide (Be-10)-based denudation by up to 10 times at the western Pamir margin.\nDifferences in averaging times of determined rates cannot explain the contrast. The millennial denudation rates are highest (1.0 – 1.5 mm/yr) where long-term (104years) fluvial incision is moderate (2 – 5 mm/yr). In contrast, denudation is lower (~0.8 mm/yr) where incision is highest (7 – 10 mm/yr).\nProcess rates across the Pamir reveal differing control factors. The longitudinal profile and valley profiles of the Panj highlight links between fluvial incision and tectonic structures. Convex river reaches across the Pamir domes correspond to intense incision, whereas graded river segments coincide with southern dome boundaries. The indicated river captures induce intense incision and base level lowering for basins at the Pamir margins. Both, rapid incision and base level changes, maintain the steep slopes (0.75 quartiles) that are the predominant driver (R2 of ~0.8) for high denudation rates at the Pamir margins (0.5 – 1.5 mm/yr). However, highest denudation and lowest discrepancy to fluvial incision (~2 - 3 times) coincides with the areas receiving the highest annual precipitation. Multiple linear regression of denudation rates with the 0.75 quartiles of basin slopes and precipitation shows an R2 of 0.93. We propose that river captures are responsible for driving the intense incision along the Panj and consequently, provide the conditions for hillslope adjustment that contributes to the high denudation at the Pamir margins. Winter precipitation, and related concentrated discharge during the melting season, may act as limiting factor to hillslope adjustment and consequently, to denudation processes.",

            "abstract": "Environmental livelihood security refers to the challenges of maintaining global food security and universal access to freshwater and energy to sustain livelihoods and promote inclusive economic growth, whilst sustaining key environmental systems’ functionality, particularly under variable climatic regimes. Environmental security is a concept complementary to sustainable development, and considers the increased vulnerability people have to certain environmental stresses, such as climatic change. Bridging links between the core component concepts of environmental security is integral to future human security, and in an attempt to create this bridge, the nexus approach to human protection has been created, where water resource availability underpins food, water and energy security. The water-energy-food nexus has an influential role in attaining human security, yet little research has made the link between the nexus and livelihoods. In this research we provide a critical appraisal of the synergies between water-energy-food nexus framings and sustainable livelihoods approaches, both of which aim to promote sustainable development. In regions where livelihoods are dependent on environmental conditions, the concept of sustainable development is critical for ensuring future environmental and human security. Given our appraisal we go on to develop an integrated framework for assessing environmental livelihood security of multiscale and multi-level systems. This framework provides a tangible approach for assessing changes in the water-energy-food-livelihood indicators of a system. Examples of where system applications may occur are discussed for the Southeast Asia and Oceania region. Our approach will be particularly useful for policy-makers to inform evidence-based decision-making, especially in localities where climate change increases the vulnerability of impoverished communities and extenuates environmental livelihood insecurity.",

            "abstract": "In this research, we made a statistical analysis of severe magnetic fluctuations in the nightside near-Earth plasma sheet at |X| = 6 - 12 RE. The severe magnetic fluctuations are considered as necessary cause for current disruption in the substorm model raised by Lui [2001]. We use two-year magnetic field data of 2013 and 2014 with a sampling rate of 4 Hz, which are obtained by the FGM instrument aboard the TH-E (P4) probe of THEMIS. The severe magnetic fluctuation events are identified as σB / B > 0.5, where σB and B are standard deviation and average value of magnetic field intensity during the time interval of local gyroperiod. We find that the values of plasma beta for most fluctuation events are more than 10, indicating that they happen in the plasma sheet. Half of the fluctuation events happen with obvious decrease of AL index (10 nT). The estimated occurrence rates of severe fluctuation events are extremely low, 0.00093% at |X| = 6 – 8 RE, 0.00796% at |X| = 8 – 10 RE, and 0.0219% at |X| = 10 – 12 RE. Assuming that four substorms occur every day with a 5-min duration of current disruption, we suggest that the low occurrence rate of severe magnetic fluctuation may indicate that the current disruption regions are very localized (0.24 RE3, 2.0 RE3, 5.6 RE3 at |X| = 6 - 8, 8 - 10, 10 - 12 RE) in the tail, or the current disruption model is not suitable for most substorm cases. Meanwhile, around 62% of the fluctuation events are accompanied by earthward ion flow with speed more than 100 km/s. This may suggest that either the severe magnetic fluctuations are caused by earthward ion flow, or fluctuations cause earthward ion flow by reducing the tailward pressure gradient force due to current disruption. For the latter case, the flow should be observed slightly after the severe fluctuations, even though the superposed epoch analysis of flow speed with the epoch time of severe fluctuations does not show obvious flow increase after the fluctuations.",

We derived the size-frequency distribution of the illuminated side of the comet (∼ 50%), as well as identified the power-law indexes characterizing the two lobes of 103P.\n332 boulders larger than 10 m were identified on the imaged surface of the comet, with a global number density of nearly 140/km2 and a cumulative size-frequency distribution represented by a power-law with index of -2.7 ± 0.2. The two lobes of 103P show close indexes, i.e. -2.7 ± 0.2 for the bigger lobe (L1) and -2.6 +0.2/-0.5 for the smaller one (L2). Both the similar power-law indexes and the similar maximum boulder sizes derived for the two lobes point towards a similar fracturing/disintegration phenomena of the boulders as well as similar lifting processes that may occur in L1 and L2. Nonetheless, the significative difference in the number of boulders per km2 between the two lobes suggests that the more diffuse H2O sublimation on the bigger lobe produce twice the boulders per km2 with respect to those produced on the small lobe (primary activity CO2 driven).\nIf we compare the boulder distribution of the hyperactive 103P comet with similar studies performed on 67P (67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, i.e. the comet studied by Rosetta spacecraft), we derive that 103P shows a lower global power-law index (-2.7 vs -3.6). The size-frequency boulder trend of 103P is somehow closer to the -2.2 value measured on the neck region of 67P, i.e. the most active region of the northern hemisphere of 67P; nevertheless the hyperactivity of 103P works in a very different way than the normal activity of 67P in the neck/Hapi area. In addition to the global differences between the two comets’ activities, the absence of cliffs and walls on 103P show a completely different surface geomorphology between Hartley 2 and Churyumov-Gerasimenko, making them hardly comparable.",

            "abstract": "Tea is an important global agricultural commodity, both commercially and culturally. Assam, an agrarian state in northeast India is the largest single tea growing region in the world and the productivity (both in terms of quantity and quality) requires a specific range of enviro-climatic conditions. Precipitation and temperature are two climate factors which highly influence productivity. Thus water plays a critical role in sustaining future tea production in Assam. Recently the region has been affected by heterogeneous spatiotemporal distributions of precipitation and rising temperatures. This has led to temporally varying drought-like conditions during the tea production season, reducing crop resilience and degrading yield quality. Quantifying regional climate-yield characteristics enables more effective decision-making regarding climate change mitigation, water resources management and adaptation to sustain (and enhance) future tea crop production. This research used a panel based regression model to statistically quantify the extent to which precipitation and temperature variables are associated with changes in tea yield. Monthly time-series climate and yield data were regressed for the period 2004 to 2014. Yield data were obtained from 80 tea estates across the four main tea growing regions of Assam, and 120 climate variables were selected for analysis. Results indicate that periods of drought (e.g. more than 10 consecutive days of zero precipitation) are significantly associated with reductions in yield, whereas periods of intense precipitation (e.g. number of days where the 95th percentile was exceeded) are generally associated with increased yield. These results have provided an enhanced understanding of climate-yield characteristics, which will subsequently be used to deliver more climate-smart advisory decision-support services to tea producers in the region. Although water resources management practices, such as water harvesting structures, check dams and irrigation facilities, have been adopted by some tea producers, this research identifies a need for enhancing such climate mitigation measures, especially for minimising dry-spell induced crop failures.",

            "abstract": "Global carbon cycle is connected to terrestrial vegetation as an important sink of CO2. Plants contribute to the global carbon cycle both through photosynthesis and respiration processes. Fluorescence is a fraction of surplus energy, emitted to the environment by Chlorophyll molecules as a side-product of photosynthesis. As a result, Sun-Induced plant Fluorescence (SIF) is a reliable indicator of photosynthesis efficiency and therefore, important for vegetation observation, forest monitoring, global carbon uptake formulation and even agriculture.\nIn our study, a newly developed retrieval scheme is used to quantify SIF from non-invasive satellite measurements of Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Earthshine radiances. Our method has been developed and tested on simulated data, created by the comprehensive radiative transfer model, SCIATRAN. Sensitivity studies showed that the method is capable of assessing SIF. The method is then applied on long-term data of 10 years from SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography) and GOME-2 (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2) instruments and produced promising results.\nFurthermore, the relationship between the retrieved SIF values and vegetation's contribution to the global CO2 uptake is investigated by comparing monthly variation of SIF against GPP (Gross Primary Production) and FAPAR (Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) for selected regions.",

            "abstract": "Fragmented magmas in eruption columns obtain buoyancy by entrainment and heating of cold air. Theoretically, the proportion of the entrained air and temperature change of the magma fragments can be calculated through rigorous fluid dynamics, but these factors have not been evaluated from natural pyroclasts. In this study, we developed a new method for quantifying the degree of air entrainment based on pyrrhotite (Po) oxidation reactions, whose time scale corresponds to the typical duration of (sub-) Plinian eruptions (i.e., tens of seconds to a few hours). We examined pumice clasts and lava flows from the 1914–15 eruption of Sakurajima. During this event, various types of eruption were observed: Plinian eruptions with intermittent generation of clastogenic lava flow, followed by voluminous effusive lava flow.\nThe products of Po oxidation consisted of magnetite (Mt), hematite (Hm), and their composites. The occurrence of Po and the oxides were systematically correlated with the types of eruption. In Plinian pumices, unreacted Po ± porous Mt-Hm composite reaction rims were dominant, whereas in the clastogenic lava, porous Hm occurred predominantly with scarce unreacted Po and porous Mt. In the effusive lava, a variety of Po, Mt, and Hm assemblage was observed, but Po did not coexist with Hm-rims. The porous Mt crystals in the pumice clasts were found to be Ti-free, whereas those in the effusive lava had Ti-enriched rims. These correlations were explained by considering two factors: the achieved fO2, which was controlled by the extent of fragmentation (i.e., surface area exposed to air), and duration of the maintenance of a high-T and high-fO2 condition. This study has demonstrated that the cooling timescale of pumice clasts in eruption columns can be estimated through the rate of Po oxidation reactions Po→Mt and Mt→Hm. Lavas of clastogenic origin may also be recognized from the reaction.",

            "abstract": "We present results from new Markov Chain Monte Carlo inversions of (i) 1-D lunar crustal and upper mantle velocity models and (ii) 3-D lateral crustal thickness models anchored by crustal thicknesses under the Apollo stations and the artificial and natural impact sites. These new generation models are constrained by both the Apollo impact event seismic data arrival times and by the more recent GRAIL gravimetric data. In all models, 1-D seismic velocities are parameterized using C1 Bézier polynomials, using two independent sets to represent the crust and the underlying mantle. Other parameters of the inversions include the depth and velocity amplitude of the Bézier control points, the depth of the crust-mantle discontinuity, the thickness of the crust under each Apollo station and impact epicenter, the vp/vs ratio, as well as location-specific time delays. Inverting for station-specific crustal thicknesses and velocity delays highlights geology-related differences between stations (e.g. contrasts in megaregolith thickness, in shallow subsurface composition and structure). These differences have already been observed by other analytical methods in the past, as detailed in the literature. We also test the possibility of having a dual-layered crust. However, some of the finer structural elements might be difficult to observe with the available data and might fall within the inherent uncertainty of the dataset. We use the more precise LROC-located epicentral locations for the lunar modules and Saturn-IV booster artificial impacts, reducing that way some of the uncertainty observed in past models. Natural impact epicentral locations are relocated during the inversions. Constraints from deep and shallow moonquakes will be included in future inversions to potentially refine the velocity and crustal models. This work falls within the NASA InSight mission to Mars seismic investigation (SEIS). Accordingly, the method and analytical software developed for this study will be applied to the Martian data as soon as the first seismic data is available (late 2016).",

            "abstract": "The ocean-ice-atmosphere system is very complex, and there are numerous challenges with conducting fieldwork on sea-ice including costs, safety, experimental controls and access. By creating a new coupled Ocean-Sea-Ice-(Snow)-Atmosphere facility at the University of East Anglia, UK, we are able to perform controlled investigations in areas such as sea-ice physics, physicochemical and biogeochemical processes in sea-ice, and to quantify the bi-directional flux of gases in established, freezing and melting sea-ice.\nThe environmental chamber is capable of controlled programmable temperatures from -55°C to +30°C, allowing a full range of first year sea-ice growing conditions in both the Arctic and Antarctic to be simulated. The sea-ice tank within the chamber measures 2.4 m x 1.4 m x 1 m water depth, with an identically sized Teflon film atmosphere on top of the tank. The tank and atmosphere forms a coupled, isolated mesocosm. Above the atmosphere is a light bank with dimmable solar simulation LEDs, and UVA and UVB broadband fluorescent battens, providing light for a range of experiments such as under ice biogeochemistry and photochemistry. Ice growth in the tank will be ideally suited for studying first-year sea-ice physical properties, with in-situ ice-profile measurements of temperature, salinity, conductivity, pressure and spectral light transmission. Under water and above ice cameras are installed to observe the physical development of the sea-ice. The ASIBIA facility is also well equipped for gas exchange and diffusion studies through sea-ice with a suite of climate relevant gas measuring instruments (CH4, CO2, O3, NOx, NOy permanently installed, further instruments available) able to measure either directly in the atmospheric component, or via a membrane for water side dissolved gases.\nHere, we present the first results from the ASIBIA sea-ice chamber, focussing on the physical development of first-year sea-ice and show the future plans for the facility over the coming years. The ASIBIA sea-ice facility is a key component of a 5-year ERC funded program with a long-term goal to develop parameterisations for local to global scale models based on experimental results.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide mineralization via CO2-fluid-rock reactions provides the most permanent solution for geologic CO2 storage. Basalts, onshore or offshore, have the potential to store million metric tons of CO2 as (Ca, Mg, Fe) carbonates [1, 2]. However, as of today it was unclear how fast CO2 is converted to carbonate minerals in-situ in a basalt storage reservoir. The CarbFix I project in Iceland was designed to verify in-situ CO2 mineralization in basaltic rocks. Two injection tests were performed at the CarbFix I pilot injection site near the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant in 2012. 175 tons of pure CO2 and 73 tons of a CO2+H2S mixture were injection from January to March 2012 and in June 2013, respectively. The gases were injected fully dissolved in groundwater into a permeable basalt formation between 400 and 800 m depth using a novel CO2 injection system. Using conservative (SF6, SF5CF3) and reactive (14C) tracers, we quantitatively monitor and detect dissolved and chemically transformed CO2. Tracer breakthrough curves obtained from the first monitoring well indicate that the injected solution arrived in a fast short pulse and a late broad peak. Ratios of 14C/SF6, 14C/SF5CF3 or DIC/SF6 and DIC/SF5CF3 are significantly lower in the monitoring well compared to the injection well, indicating that the injected dissolved CO2 reacted. Mass balance calculations using the tracer data reveal that >95% of the injected CO2 has been mineralized over a period of two years. Evidence of carbonate precipitation has been found in core samples that were collected from the storage reservoir using wireline core drilling as well as in and on the submersible pump in the monitoring well. Results from the core analysis will be presented with emphasis on the CO2 mineralization.\n[1] McGrail et al. (2006) JGR 111, B12201; [2] Goldberg et al. (2008) PNAS 105(29), 9920-9925.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) data has many important applications including atmospheric correction of satellite imagery and monitoring of particulate matter air pollution. Current data products are generally available at a kilometre-scale resolution, but many applications require far higher resolutions. For example, particulate matter concentrations vary on a metre-scale, and thus data products at a similar scale are required to provide accurate assessments of particle densities and allow effective monitoring of air quality and analysis of local air quality effects on health.\nA novel method has been developed which retrieves per-pixel AOT values from high-resolution (~30m) satellite data. This method is designed to work over a wide range of land covers – including both bright and dark surfaces - and requires only standard visible and near-infrared data, making it applicable to a range of data from sensors such as Landsat, SPOT and Sentinel-2. The method is based upon an extension of the Haze Optimized Transform (HOT). The HOT was originally designed for assessing areas of thick haze in satellite imagery by calculating a ‘haziness’ value for each pixel in an image as the distance from a ‘Clear Line’ in feature space, defined by the high correlation between visible bands. Here, we adapt the HOT method and use it to provide AOT data instead. Significant extensions include Monte Carlo estimation of the ‘Clear Line’, object-based correction for land cover, and estimation of AOT from the haziness values through radiative transfer modelling.\nThis novel method will enable many new applications of AOT data that were impossible with previously available low-resolution data, and has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the air quality on health, the accuracy of satellite image atmospheric correction and the role of aerosols in the climate system.",

The main goal of this study is to put forward a PGD-MRF hybrid model for monthly rainfall forecast, which is based on Poisson Gamma Distribution (PGD) and Markov Random Field(MRF) models, to make up for the deficiency of the atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) in low spatial resolution and difficultly simulating regional climate change. The Wei River Basin was taken as an case study to investigate the accuracy of PGD-MRF hybrid model. Based on the monthly rainfall data from 1960 to 2010 at eight meteorological stations, the PGD model was firstly set up to fit the statistical relationship between monthly precipitation and GCM output factors. Then the monthly rainfall data in historical period of 1960-2010 were simulated through the spatial correlation of monthly rainfall analyzed by MRF model. The statistical downscaling model (SDSM) was also employed to evaluate the performance of the PGD-MRF model. The comparison of results revealed that the PGD-MRF model had provided a superior alternative to SDSM for forecasting monthly rainfall at all these eight meteorological stations. To further illustrate the stability and representativeness of the PGD-MRF model, the monthly rainfall data from 2001 to 2010 at Huashan station were used to verify the model. The results showed that the PGD-MRF model had a good stability and great representativeness as well as a high prediction precision.",

            "abstract": "We present observational features of electromagnetic waves detected by Geotail in the frequency range of several Hz in the upstream region of terrestrial bow shock. Two types of upstream whistler-mode waves are observed: left-hand polarized waves in narrow frequency range near 1 Hz and right-hand polarized waves in broad frequency range around the lower hybrid resonance frequency in the spacecraft frame. We performed statistical snalyses on these waves. The former narrowband whistlers and the latter broadband whistlers are observed when the interplanetary magnetic field is nearly parallel and perpendicular to the solar wind flow, respectively. The properties of the narrowband whistlers including the observed frequency, spectral shape, and wave vector direction suggest that they are nearly group-standing, which is a situation the waves are stagnating in the spacecraft frame. On the other hand, the broadband whistlers are not group-standing, and both types of the waves originate from the same wave source. Though most properties of the narrowband whistlers are restricted to be group-standing, the properties of the broadband whistlers can reflect their generation processes. We suggest that the waves are mainly generated through the modified two stream instability caused by reflected ions near perpendicular shock or the shock front dynamics, which can excite whistler mode waves in the frequency range around the lower hybrid resonance frequency with the oblique propagation angle to the ambient magnetic field.",

We use baseline Miocene and Pliocene geographies that have different reconstruction lineages so we describe methods to create a set of self-consistent paleogeographies that represent the main features of the three stages. We present large-scale features of the evolving climate and examine model fidelity by comparing modelled climatology against palaeoenvironmental proxy data. We focus on the climate of the Arctic region and investigate tectonic drivers of sea ice expansion by comparing and interpreting model predictions against borehole data from the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean. In particular how Late Miocene/ early Pliocene tectonic uplift in the Svalbard/Barents Sea and Greenland region, the opening of the Bering Strait, and the onset of deep water Atlantic-Arctic exchange influenced the development of modern sea ice cover.",

            "abstract": "The earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011 caused the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident. The accident released the significant quantities of radionuclides to the atmosphere. The radionuclide which remains most in the environment is a radioactive cesium isotope. Therefore, we concentrate on the behavior of the cesium to predict the distribution and fate of the radionuclides in the environment. Cesium is an alkali metal and is strongly sorbed by soil particles, especially small ones. In addition, the movement of the soil particles is strongly affected by an aquatic system such as a river and a lake. Accordingly, when we simulate the sediment transport by the influence of the aquatic system, we can predict the behavior of the cesium. In this research, we concentrate on the behavior of the sediment around the mouth of the Ukedo River which is located in about 7 km north from FDNPP. Since its upstream was heavily contaminated by the radionuclides released from FDNPP, the contaminated soils flow from the upstream by a flood. Therefore, we examine the behavior of the sediment with utilizing the 2-dimensional river simulation code Nays2D and we reveal where the sediment accumulates at a flood. We believe that the result is very useful information for the effective decontamination of the contaminated soils.",

            "abstract": "Oblique subduction of late cretaceous lithosphere of the Atlantic ocean beneath the thick (25km) crust of the Caribbean plate results in widespread deformation and vertical motions in the Lesser Antilles fore-arc. The present-day deformation includes a major transtensive left lateral fault system along the arc and several forearc transverse basins accommodating lengthening of the fore-arc northward. These deformations result from plate motion partitioning under increasing subduction obliquity from the Marie-Galante Basin (MGB) latitude (central Lesser Antilles) northward. Vertical motions in the fore-arc at a regional scale were interpreted as resulting from the effect of subducting ridges and reliefs. The present day uplift of the fore-arc islands acting since the late(?) Pleistocene is believed to attest for long wavelength bending of the plate under strongly coupled plate interface. Recent GPS data suggests a mostly uncoupled plate interface.\nTo decipher between the models and to understand the long-term evolution of the Lesser Antilles forearc since the Late Palaeogene, we interpret high-resolution bathymetric and seismic data from the MGB, together with the onland geology of shallow water carbonate platforms. The tectonic pattern reveals both inherited and late Neogene structures (re)activated under multidirectional extensive tectonic. The sismo-stratigraphic interpretation of sedimentary deposit displays long-term drowning and flexing of the upper plate similar to that occurring under intensive tectonic erosion at the subduction interface. Several short term period of second order uplift can correlate with sweeping of subducting ridges or transient events at the plate interface. The evolution of the Lesser Antilles fore-arc since the Late Palaeogene is interpreted within the regional geodynamical evolution of the plate boundary following its last major reorganization: collision of the Bahamas Bank and inception of the Greater Antilles strike-slip fault zone.",

            "abstract": "The use of Stage-Damage Curve (SDC) models is prevalent in ex-ante assessments of flood risk. To assess the potential damage of a flood event, SDCs describe a relation between water depth and the associated potential economic damage over land use. This relation is normally developed and calibrated through site-specific analysis based on ex-post damage observations. In some cases (e.g. Italy) SDCs are transferred from other countries, undermining the accuracy and reliability of simulation results. Against this background, we developed a refined SDC model for Northern Italy, underpinned by damage compensation records from a recent flood event. Our analysis considers both damage to physical assets and production losses from business interruptions. While the first is calculated based on land use information, production losses are measured through the spatial distribution of Gross Value Added (GVA). An additional component of the model assesses crop-specific agricultural losses as a function of flood seasonality.\nOur results show an overestimation of asset damage from non-calibrated SDC values up to a factor of 4.5 for tested land use categories. Furthermore, we estimate that production losses amount to around 6 per cent of the annual GVA. Also, maximum yield losses are less than a half of the amount predicted by the standard SDC methods.",

Deep-sea basalt formations provide large storage reservoir capacities and huge potential sources of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Fe2+. However, better knowledge of silicate mineral reaction rates with carbonate-bearing fluids is required to understand the overall carbon storage potential of these reservoirs.\nThis study investigates key reactions associated with progressive seawater-rock interaction using far-from equilibrium dissolution experiments. The experiments were carried out at 40 ˚C and at constant CO2 partial pressure of 1 atm. Mid-ocean ridge basalts from the Juan de Fuca and Mid-Atlantic Ridges and a gabbro from the Troodos ophiolite were reacted with 500 mL of CO2-charged seawater using thick-walled fluorinated polypropylene bottles combined with rubber stoppers. The starting material was crushed, sieved and thoroughly cleaned to remove fine particles (< 63 µm) to ensure a particle grain size between 63 and 125 µm for all the samples. The seawater chemistry and the pH were monitored throughout the experiments by daily analysis of 1 mL of fluid. The pH increased rapidly from 4.8 to 5.0 before stabilizing at 5.1 after 10 days of reaction time. The analysis of anions (S, Cl) highlighted a substantial evaporation (up to 15 %) during the experiments, requiring a correction factor for the measured dissolved ion concentrations. Evaporation corrected silicon (Si) and calcium (Ca) concentrations in the seawater increased by 5900 % and 14 %, resulting in total dissolved Si and Ca from basalt of 0.3 % and 2.4 %, respectively.\nThe results are comparable with literature data for fresh water experiments conducted on basaltic glass at higher temperature or pressure, illustrating the considerable potential of the mineral sequestration of CO2 in submarine basalts.",

            "abstract": "Displacement height d and roughness length zo are two important parameters in a commonly used Obukhov-Monin similarity-theory wind-profile formulation. These parameters have historically been considered to be properties of the underlying surface. A few studies have pointed out that d and zo for tall vegetation, like forest, are also dependent on stability. Since d and zo are defined by the semi-logarithmic law, the most strict determination of them would be based on the upper part of the surface layer, which is free of roughness sublayer effects. Often the displacement height is determined from the wind profile inside the stand. The present study makes use of measurements with 14 3D sonic anemometers (Metek) in the Norunda forest in Sweden. This site is dominated by pine with trees up to 26 m tall. The sonics were mounted at 1.8, 4.4, 9.5, 14.8, 20.8, 26.6, 29.6, 32.7, 37.9, 44.7, 59.5, 74, 88.5 and 101.8 m heights. Data from two summer seasons, 2014 and 2015, were used in the current analysis. A serious complication was that the momentum and sensible heat fluxes were rarely constant with height. Also, during nighttime profiles appeared with nearly constant wind speed in the upper part of the profile. In our analysis, the Obukhov length was calculated from friction velocity and sensible heat flux averaged for 26.6, 29.6 and 32.7 m. The mean friction velocity and Obukhov length were then used in the profile formulation. Displacement height giving the best match to the measured data at 44.7, 59.5, 74, 88.5 and 101.8 m was searched for. This method gave extremely erratic results. Alternatively, d was estimated using the exponential law with measurement heights 9.5, 14.8, 20.8 and 26.6 m giving d close to 22 m with a tendency of slightly increasing d towards more stable situations, but with large uncertainty. We then used a constant d of 22 m in the upper part of the profile and this resulted in zo of about 2.5 m. A small tendency of lower zo could be observed for very stable conditions, but with large uncertainty. At present we cannot confirm that d and zo are dependent on stability. We need to extend our analysis by including the roughness sublayer effects and the full length of measured profiles.",

            "abstract": "At short timescales (i.e. 10-4 to 102 yrs) the linkage between system forcing, response, and product can be measured and quantified at the field and laboratory scale. Even so, the general consensus is that this tripartite relationship is non-linear and complex. At long timescales (i.e. 102-107 yrs) the relationship between forcing and response is less certain (since we are not around long enough to observe and measure it) but the sedimentary record (the ‘product’) provides measurable, although fragmentary, information. Given this, what does/can the sedimentary record realistically offer Earth Scientists with regards to past system forcing, response, and state? Conversely the sedimentary record might be thought of as the final, ordered state(?) of time-integrated complex behaviour. The main issues from a stratigraphic perspective are: How do we recognise complex behaviour in the sedimentary record? At what temporal and spatial scales must we consider? What do we measure? How do we measure it? Using outcrop, laboratory and numerical datasets we will address some of these issues and then discuss the applicability and limitations of the sedimentary record. As a final point, if we truly want to understand the sedimentary record then much more could be done to integrate sedimentary product with the known system forcing and response (i.e. laboratory experiments, numerical experiments and real world process-product analysis). Such a workflow should ensure that an appropriate theory is designed that can be directly applied to the outcrop sedimentary record.",

Markarfljot is a glacial river that is fed by Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull, and the downstream sandur areas have been shown to be significant dust sources. Particulate matter concentration during dust storms was recorded on the sandur area using a TSI DustTrak DRX Aerosol Monitor 8533 and particle size data was recorded using a TSI Optical Particle Sizer 3330 (OPS). Wind speed was measured using cup anemometers at five heights.\nParticle size measured at the source area shows an extremely fine dust creation, PM1 concentration reaching over 5000 µg/m3 and accounting for most of the mass. This is potentially due to sand particles chipping during saltation instead of breaking uniformly. Dust events occurring during easterly winds were captured by two permanent PM10 aerosol monitoring stations in Reykjavik (140 km west of Markarfljot) suggesting the regional nature of these events. OPS measurements from Reykjavik also provide an interesting comparison of particle size distribution from source to city. Dust storms contribute to the particular matter pollution in Reykjavik and their small particle size, at least from this source area, might be a serious health concern.",

            "abstract": "To understand the dynamics of the lithosphere in subduction systems, the knowledge of rock composition is significant. However, rock composition of the overriding plate is still poorly understood. To estimate rock composition of the lithosphere, it is an effective method to compare the elastic wave velocities measured under the high pressure and temperature condition with the seismic velocities obtained by active source experiment and earthquake observation. Due to an arc-arc collision in central Hokkaido, middle to lower crust is exposed along the Hidaka Metamorphic Belt (HMB), providing exceptional opportunities to study crust composition of an island arc. Across the HMB, P-wave velocity model has been constructed by refraction/wide-angle reflection seismic profiling (Iwasaki et al., 2004). Furthermore, because of the interpretation of the crustal structure (Ito, 2000), we can follow a continuous pass from the surface to the middle-lower crust. We corrected representative rock samples from HMB and measured ultrasonic P-wave (Vp) and S-wave velocities (Vs) under the pressure up to 1.0 GPa in a temperature range from 25 to 400 °C.\n For example, the Vp values measured at 25 °C and 0.5 GPa are 5.88 km/s for the granite (74.29 wt.% SiO2), 6.02–6.34 km/s for the tonalites (66.31–68.92 wt.% SiO2), 6.34 km/s for the gneiss (64.69 wt.% SiO2), 6.41–7.05 km/s for the amphibolites (50.06–51.13 wt.% SiO2), and 7.42 km/s for the mafic granulite (50.94 wt.% SiO2). And, Vp of tonalites showed a correlation with SiO2 (wt.%). Comparing with the velocity profiles across the HMB (Iwasaki et al., 2004), we estimate that the lower to middle crust consists of amphibolite and tonalite, and the estimated acoustic impedance contrast between them suggests an existence of a clear reflective boundary, which accords well to the obtained seismic reflection profile (Iwasaki et al., 2014). And, we can obtain the same tendency from comparing measured Vp/Vs ratio and Vp/Vs ratio structure model (Matsubara and Obara, 2011).",

Mediterranean maquis (schlerophyll species) is a typical evergreen ecosystem consisting of short shrubs with leathery leaves sparsely distributed. It is adapted to live in a semi-arid climate as that of Mediterranean coasts and can survive to these environmental stress condition, being able to recover after autumn rainfall. However, increased environmental stress condition may determine changes in vegetation behavior in the long period.\nThe aim of this study is to show the seasonal variability of sensible and latent heat, and CO2 exchanges measured, with the Eddy Covariance (EC) technique, over a Mediterranean Maquis site. It is located, about 600 m far from the sea, in the Capo Caccia peninsula (municipal district of Alghero (SS), Italy) within a natural reserve called “Le Prigionette”, also known as Arca di Noé, in the North-West Sardinia coast (40.61° N, 8.15° E, 74 m asl). Due to this proximity of the EC tower to the sea, the ecosystem vertical exchanges and their footprint may be differently affected by sea and land breeze during days and nights, respectively. A four-component net radiometer, a quantum sensor, and a meteorological station were also set up for ancillary measurements as well as four heat plates in four different positions to account for under canopy and bare soil conditions in the Maquis ecosystem. Therefore, the influence of different environmental variables, such as soil/air temperature, atmospheric conditions and soil moisture content, on energy and carbon fluxes will be investigated and their effect on the seasonal and inter-annual variability of surface fluxes will be analyzed.",

However, the spatial resolution of derived 2D velocities is restricted to scales above 100-150 km and the limited number of altimeters can lead to errors in the location of currents. On the contrary, infrared measurements of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) are well suited to locate flow patterns but it is difficult to extract quantitative estimations of ocean currents. During the last years, some works began to exploit the synergy of SST and altimetry measurements in order to retrieve ocean currents.\nNevertheless, all this previous works employed measurements which were near in time but not simultaneous. In that sense, Sentinel-3 is a multi-instrument mission that will circumvent this temporal limitation, providing simultaneous measurements of SST and altimetry with high-end accuracy and reliability. Our approach, based on the spectral properties of simultaneous SST and SSH observations, is tested using ENVISAT (RA, AATSR) data, since its geometry is similar to that of Sentinel-3 (SRAL, SLSTR).",

            "abstract": "Today the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is grounded mostly below sea level, making it sensitive to oceanic temperature and circulation changes. However, recent reconstructions of the Cenozoic bedrock topographic evolution of West Antarctica have suggested that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) may have first formed as a terrestrial ice sheet at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (33 Ma), when there was up to 20% more land area in West Antarctica. At some point during the Oligocene or Miocene (23 - 5 Ma) vast areas of West Antarctica became an over-deepened marine-based continental shelf, as is observed today. The evolution of the WAIS through this transition is largely unconstrained, but as atmospheric CO2 fluctuated between 600 and 200 ppm over the past 34 Ma, determining the development of a marine-based WAIS is critical in the context of understanding the sensitivity of ice sheet systems to environmental change. Our research re-examines the sediment cores recovered from the central Ross Sea, a principal drainage area of the WAIS, at Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 270 (77°26.48’S, 178°30.19’W). These cores contain a glacimarine sequence of late Oligocene age (28 - 23.1 Ma). Sedimentological (visual core description, facies, grain size analysis), geochemical (x-ray fluorescence), geophysical (seismic) techniques, and physical properties (magnetic susceptibility) are used to construct a sedimentation model of this sequence, in order to track the late Oligocene evolution of the WAIS. The late Oligocene warming (25 - 23 Ma) is examined in detail because proximal Antarctic geological records of ice sheet extent, proxy environmental data, and atmospheric CO2 appear to be at odds with the composite δ18O record of global temperature and ice volume at this time. Moreover, our research provides insights into the sensitivity of marine-based ice sheets, and supports the hypothesis that they are unstable above a CO2 threshold of 400 ppm. Our preliminary results also indicate that the WAIS may have been responsive to orbital forcing during the late Oligocene.",

            "abstract": "River impoundment by dams is known to strongly affect the natural flow regime and in turn the river attributes and the related ecosystem biodiversity. Making hydropower sustainable implies to seek for innovative operational policies able to generate dynamic environmental flows while maintaining economic efficiency.\nFor dammed systems, we build the ecological and economical efficiency plot for non-proportional flow redistribution operational rules compared to minimal flow operational. As for the case of small hydropower plants (e.g., see the companion paper by Gorla et al., this session), we use a four parameters Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution to mathematically formulate non-proportional redistribution rules. These rules allocate a fraction of water to the riverine environment depending on current reservoir inflows and storage. Riverine ecological benefits associated to dynamic environmental flows are computed by integrating the Weighted Usable Area (WUA) for fishes with Richter’s hydrological indicators. Then, we apply nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to an ensemble of non-proportional and minimal flow redistribution rules in order to generate the Pareto frontier showing the system performances in the ecologic and economic space.\nThis fast and elitist multiobjective optimization method is eventually applied to a case study. It is found that non-proportional dynamic flow releases ensure maximal power production on the one hand, while conciliating ecological sustainability on the other hand. Much of the improvement in the environmental indicator is seen to arise from a better use of the reservoir storage dynamics, which allows to capture, and laminate flood events while recovering part of them for energy production. In conclusion, adopting such new operational policies would unravel a spectrum of globally-efficient performances of the dammed system when compared with those resulting from policies based on constant minimum flow releases.",

            "abstract": "Tea production has a measurable impact upon millions of people’s livelihoods in northeast India. The region is experiencing changes in climate characteristics which are placing added pressure on the tea industry for sustaining livelihoods. To increase understanding of the role of tea within the Assam landscape, this research has engaged with multiple local tea-producing stakeholders. Approximately 65% of Assam’s tea is produced in large plantations, with the remaining 35% produced in smallholdings. Questionnaires were used to obtain information on land management practices operationalised by plantation managers and smallholders. Focus group sessions using the Delphi technique were conducted with tea workers (labourers for the plantations) to ascertain the level of importance of the tea sector to sustaining their livelihoods. Questionnaires and focus group surveys also attempted to establish stakeholder understanding of climate change. Data were analysed using spatial statistics to investigate intra- and inter-region variation in responses. Focus group responses were categorised to determine the livelihood asset base available to tea workers within plantations, with patterns of (dis)similarity observed spatially. Results indicate that land management practices (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide application), tea processing methods (e.g. onsite factory and energy generation), and social provisions for tea workers (e.g. sanitation and education facilities) varied greatly across the main tea growing regions of Assam. Tea workers listed numerous environmental and social factors as important for sustaining livelihoods, with the top ranked factors similar across some plantations (e.g. drinking water availability and access). Plantation managers are highly concerned with how climate conditions are affecting tea production, and although workers were aware of climate change issues in some plantations, socioeconomic conditions seemed of more pressing concern to their livelihoods.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogeological research and practice have dealt in recent years with problems related to groundwater quantity and quality. Models have been used for water flow, solute transport and, at most, chemical reactions, which were required to address issues such as water resources assessment, artificial recharge, seawater intrusion, impact of public works, and the like. “Weird” (i.e., outside the mainstream practical hydrogeology, restricted to academy) models were virtually restricted to spatial variability of permeability and the problems it imposed on transport (i.e., scale dependence of dispersivity, mixing, etc.). Yet, a broad gap has grown between academy and practical hydrogeology. Energy demands have created a new suite of problems that need to be solved to address CO2 storage, shale gas impacts or enhanced geothermal systems. These require solving mechanical and thermal equations. We contend, and will use example from our own work for illustration, that (1) these problems are not so new (hydrogeologists started working on them some 40 years ago), (2) hydrogeological tools are as needed to solve energy problems as they were for water problems (permeability remains the key parameter for most of them), (3) collaboration with sister Earth Sciences remains essential (the problems are highly coupled and no one can master all disciplines involved). The real challenge is not so much whether hydrogeology can address these problems, it can, as whether hydrogeologists can reduce the gap between academy and practice, which will be strongly stretched by these emerging problems.",

            "abstract": "The source region of the Yellow River contributes about 35% of the total water yield in the Yellow River basin playing an important role for meeting the downstream water resources requirements. Hydroclimatic trend and periodicity during the last 50 years were investigated to identify significant changes in time and space over the study area. Results showed that mean annual temperature increased for all stations and it had an accelerated increasing trend during the last decade. Mean annual precipitation trends varied depending on station location; however, they were generally slightly decreasing. Annual streamflow decreased markedly especially from the 1990s but showed recovery during recent years. Statistically significant changes in trend occurred for temperature in 1998 and for streamflow in 1990. Based on the streamflow change point, seasonal analysis results showed that precipitation mainly decreased during the summer monsoon period (July-September) and temperature increased throughout the year. Corresponding to the weakened monsoon period the average runoff depth is decreasing by 0.74 mm/year over the whole area. Statistically significant 2 to 4-year periodicities for mean areal precipitation and temperature occurred over the area. For streamflow, an even stronger 8-year periodicity was revealed from the end of the 60s to the beginning of the 90s.\nSummer precipitation trends and teleconnections with global sea surface temperature (SST) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) from 1961 to 2010 were investigated. The summer precipitation in the whole region shows statistically significant negative correlations with the central Pacific SST for 0-4 month lags and with the southern Indian and Atlantic Ocean SST for 5-8 month lags. Analyses of sub-regions reveal intricate and complex correlations with different SST areas that further explain the summer precipitation variability. The SOI had significant positive correlations mainly for 0-2 month lag with summer precipitation. It is seen that El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have an influence on the summer precipitation, and the predominant negative correlations indicate that higher SST in equatorial Pacific areas corresponding to El Nino coincides with less summer precipitation in the source region of the Yellow River.",

            "abstract": "We know that the surface temperature response, dT, to a perturbation in the climate forcing is determined by (1) the magnitude of the forcing, (2) any feedback effects and (3) the effective heat capacity of the system. These three components can be related through an energy budget model of the form dT = dQ/C, where dQ is the net heat perturbation from the combination of the forcing perturbation and the feedback processes, and C is the effective heat capacity of the system. On long, multi-decadal to centennial timescales, C is defined by the ocean. But on shorter timescales, the effective heat capacity in the atmosphere can determine the pattern of the surface temperature change. It has been demonstrated that the effective heat capacity of the atmosphere is defined by the volume of air through which that heat is distributed i.e. defined by the planetary boundary layer depth, h. The boundary-layer depth can vary from ~100 m to a few km across different locations, and during the seasonal and diurnal cycles. So even under a uniform forcing we can expect a strongly asymmetrical warming (or cooling) based on the climatology of h. We demonstrate this relationship in the recent warming period using a combination of surface observations and reanalysis products and find that it is the climatology of h which is the strongest predictor of the pattern of warming during the satellite era (1979-present).\nThis has important implications for the detection of climate forcing and feedback signals through the surface temperature. In many current detection and attribution studies of climate feedback processes we assume a linear relationship between a perturbation in the forcing, dQ, and the corresponding change in temperature, dT. However, the inverse relationship between h and the strength of dT means that we can get strongly amplified temperature responses in conditions with shallow h, and this linear relationship breaks down. We demonstrate that these conditions where h strongly affects dT occur more than 40% of the time. Here we present a re-evaluation of the effect of selected climate feedback processes (clouds, soil moisture and precipitation) on the surface climate by assessing the co-variability of the forcing, dQ, with the effective heat capacity of the atmosphere, h, which allows us to compare feedback processes on a like-for-like basis.",

            "abstract": "HAZUS, a loss estimation tool due to natural hazards, has been used in Korea. In the earlier development of earthquake loss estimation system in Korea, a ShakeMap due to magnitude 6.7 scenario earthquake in the southeastern Korea prepared by USGS was used. Attenuation relation proposed by Boore et al. (1997) is assumed to simulate the strong ground motion with distance. During the initial stage, details of local site characteristics and attenuation relations were not properly accounted. Later, the attenuation relation proposed by Sadigh et al. (1997) for site classes B, C, and D were reviewed and applied to the Korean Peninsula. Loss estimations were improved using the attenuation relation and the deterministic methods available in HAZUS. Most recently, a site classification map has been derived using geologic and geomorphologic data, which are readily available from the geologic and topographic maps of Korea. Loss estimations using the site classification map differ from earlier ones. For example, earthquake loss using ShakeMap overestimates house damages. 43% of houses are estimated to experience moderate or severe damage in the results using ShakeMap, while 23 % is estimated in those using the site classification map. The number of people seeking emergency shelters is also different from previous estimates. It is considered revised estimates are more realistic since the ground motions ensuing from earthquakes are better represented. In the next application, landslide, liquefaction and fault information are planned to be implemented in HAZUS. The result is expected to better represent any loss under the emergency situation, thus help the planning disaster response and hazard mitigations.",

            "abstract": "Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important carbon pool and it affects various phenomena in Arctic and alpine areas, e.g. biodiversity, surface albedo and soil conditions. The growing availability of high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM) makes it possible to utilize topographical information for modeling local ground surface conditions globally.\nWe investigated the effect of topography on field measured AGB (n = 359) and its commonly used proxy, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from SPOT 5 imagery. The study area located in an Arctic-alpine treeline environment (69 °N, 21 °E). We performed the analyses with boosted regression trees method by using elevation and four land surface parameters (LSPs), derived from 10 m DEM, as predictors. The LSPs were namely Potential Incoming Solar Radiation (PISR, MJ m-2 a-1), Topographic Position Index (TPI, r = 300 m), Slope (angle in degrees) and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI).\nAGB varied from 0 to 5647 g m-2, while median AGB of the data was 449 g m-2. The explained deviance of the AGB and NDVI models were 53 % and 65 %, respectively. Elevation and PISR were the most important predictors. Their interaction was also significant in both cases as the highest AGB were at low-elevation, high-radiation sites, which implicates that PISR significantly improves the modelling of temperature related growing conditions. TWI had no clear effect to AGB nor to NDVI. TPI and Slope had a minor effect on AGB, but no effect to NDVI. Areas lower than their surroundings (negative TPI) had relatively high AGB. Furthermore, steeper slopes had higher AGB compared to flat sites. This is probably caused by the presence of mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), which favors protected and steeper topography.\nLocal topography is an important driver of the fine scale AGB patterns. Thus, DEM derived LSPs should be taken into account when modelling current and future biomass distributions in Arctic and alpine areas. Moreover, LSPs can be useful when downscaling coarse resolution NDVI data.",

            "abstract": "There are various researches to respond to the natural disasters efficiently such as floods caused by climate change. Most of the studies have assessed the impact of climate change on floods by the increase of future rainfall and the sea level rise separately. However, we have to consider the effects of the combined floods by future heavy rainfall and sea level rise. This means the urban floods in coastal area can be occurred due to the combined inundation by overflow of urban drainage system and by sea level rise. Then we can estimate the flood damage from the combined floods due to the climate change.\nHence, this study selected Taehwa River basin, Korea which flows from the west to the east and extends to Ulsan bay. This study analysed on the influence of hydrologic alteration in the coastal area by considering the sea level rise as well as the future precipitation according to climate change. It is prepared the flood inundation map which is related to the increase of precipitation and sea level for assuring how the sea level rise effects on the coastal area caused by the climate change, and the flood damage assessment is estimated to compare the hydrologic alteration quantitatively.\nThe study result showed that flood level in the channel flows to the mouth rose as the water surface elevation rose due to the rise in sea level. In addition, the extent of increase in flood level caused by sea level rise was greater at a location nearer the outlet and it was smaller at a place farther from the outlet. It could be verified that the change of the inundation depth and damage area caused by the rise in sea level can have an effect on the flood damage assessment. It is important factor to analyse not only the increase of precipitation cuased of climate change in coastal rivers but also the change of rise in sea level, the flood water level, the flood inundation and the flood damage assessment. The result of this study could be used as basic data for creating technology that would assess the flood vulnerability of coastal urban regions and evaluate preventive measures for coastal disaster risk.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)grant funded by the Korea government (MEST) (No.2011-0028564).",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is one of the most important key variables for drought monitoring. It reflects hydrological and agricultural processes because soil moisture is a function of precipitation and energy flux and crop yield is highly related to soil moisture. Many satellites including Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity sensor (SMOS), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) provide global scale soil moisture products through microwave sensors. However, as the spatial resolution of soil moisture products is typically tens of kilometers, it is difficult to monitor drought using soil moisture at local or regional scale. In this study, AMSR-E and AMSR2 soil moisture were downscaled up to 1 km spatial resolution using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data—Evapotranspiration, Land Surface Temperature, Leaf Area Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index and Albedo—through machine learning approaches over Korean peninsula. To monitor drought from 2003 to 2014, each pixel of the downscaled soil moisture was scaled from 0 to 1 (1 is the wettest and 0 is the driest). The soil moisture based drought maps were validated using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and crop yield data. Spatial distribution of drought status was also compared with other drought indices such as Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI). Machine learning approaches were performed well (R=0.905) for downscaling. Downscaled soil moisture was validated using in situ Asia flux data. The Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) improved from 0.172 (25 km AMSR2) to 0.065 (downscaled soil moisture). The correlation coefficients improved from 0.201 (25 km AMSR2) to 0.341 (downscaled soil moisture). The soil moisture based drought maps and SDCI showed similar spatial distribution that caught both extreme drought and no drought. Since the proposed drought monitoring approach based on the downscaled soil moisture considered not only high resolution soil moisture but the other climatic and environmental characteristics such as precipitation, vegetation, and land surface fluxes, it is expected to provide useful drought information adaptive to different drought types.",

The area around Narębski Point located on the southeast coast of Barton Peninsula was designated as Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 171 (ASPA 171), and Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins inhabit in this area. The UAV images were acquired in a part of ASPA 171 from four flights in a single day, Jan 18, 2014. About 360 images were mosaicked as an image of about 3 cm spatial resolution and then a subset including representative penguin rookeries was selected. The subset image was segmented based on gradient map of pixel values, and spectral and spatial attributes were assigned to each segment. The object based image analysis (OBIA) was conducted with consideration of spectral attributes including mean and minimum values of each segment and various shape attributes such as area, length, compactness and roundness to detect individual penguin. The segments indicating individual penguin were effectively detected on rookeries with high contrasts in the spectral and shape attributes.

The Mentawai Gap, located along the Sunda subduction zone offshore SW Sumatra, has been inferred to have the potential to produce a devastating great earthquake in the near future. Along this segment of the megathrust, only limited/small patches ruptured on 12 September 2007, during a twin earthquake of Mw = 8.5 and 7.9, and on October 25th, 2010, during the Mw=7.8 shallow earthquake that generated a large tsunami with run‐up of up to ~8 m on Pagai islands. To better understand the mechanism of tsunamigenesis in general and better assess this hazard in the Mentawai locked zone in particular, we acquired a total of 1725 km high-resolution seismic reflection data across the subduction front along with more than 10000 km2 of multibeam bathymetry data. Along the Mentawai trench, we imaged the 2010 tsunami earthquake rupture zone, the Mentawai locked zone, the region impinged by the Investigator Fracture zone as well as the bending-related normal faults dissecting the incoming plate.\nWe find that the morphology of the frontal accretionary wedge section within both the region ruptured in 2010 and the locked segment consists of multiple folds bounded by double-vergent active faults, which when activated during a megathrust event could generate a large tsunami. We also find evidence of mass wasting along thrust escarpments, which could be erosional features or more likely landslides scars triggered by earthquake shaking. The density and distribution of these geologic features along strike could give clues on the seismic history of the segments. These new data will allow us to elucidate the tsunamigenic potential of the Mentawai locked zone.",

            "abstract": "The long-lasting minimum of Solar Cycle 23 as well as the overall weak maximum of Cycle 24 reveal the possibility for a return to Grand Solar Minimum conditions within the next decades. The past 1,000 years featured at least 5 excursions (lasting 60–100 years) of exceptionally low solar activity, induced by a weak magnetic field of the Sun. The last Grand Solar Minimum (the Maunder Minimum, 1645–1715) coincides with the Little Ice Age in Europe, a time of severe cold and hardship. The quantification of the implications of such a projected decrease in solar forcing is of ultimate importance, given the on-going public discussion of the role of carbon dioxide emissions for global warming, and the possible role a cooling due to decreasing solar activity could be ascribed to. However, existing model simulations that aim to answer these questions suffer from simplifications in the included parameterizations (e.g., no spectral radiation scheme), missing coupling with ocean models, or too low model tops. In addition, there is still no clear consensus about the actual strength of the Maunder Minimum, which is reflected in a range of spectral reconstruction datasets available. To estimate the range of climate response to different Maunder Minimum reconstructions, we compared 3 acknowledged solar datasets that show significant differences in both, total solar irradiance (TSI) and spectral irradiance (SSI) in a single model, first-time. For our purposes we choose to use the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry Model (EMAC) coupled to a mixed-layer ocean. EMAC incorporates interactive ozone chemistry, a high-resolution shortwave radiation scheme as well as a high model top (0.01 hPa). To get a clean climate signal, all simulations were conducted in time slice mode under 1960 conditions. The experiments show distinct differences in near surface temperatures and reveal the important role of stratospheric processes for the response of surface climate to solar irradiance variations.",

Grain size evolution has been studied with increasing interest over the last decades but its behavior in both mantle and lithosphere remains largely misunderstood due to its non-linearity. Several recent studies suggest that it might play a fundamental role in localization of deformation in the lithosphere but we focus here on the mantle in which we also observe important processes.\nWe propose a 1D compressible thermal convection model based on the equality of advective heat flux and the integral of viscous dissipation in the whole domain. Imposing mass conservation, our model is able to predict all rheological parameters able to produce both present day average surface velocity and lower mantle viscosity. Composite rheologies involving dislocation creep and grain size dependent diffusion creep are considered. The effect of phase transitions on the grain size is also explicitely taken into account. We present the family of solutions for the activation volume and the viscosity jump at the 660 discontinuity according to any initial choice of activation energy. The scaling laws for rheological parameters obtained are compared to self-consistent evolutionary simulations of mantle convection in 2D spherical annulus geometry considering composite rheologies. The transition between diffusion and dislocation creep due to the cooling of the Earth is illustrated in a set of numerical simulations starting from the physical conditions of the Archean.",

            "abstract": "Migmatite transdomes are formed by lateral and upward flow of partially molten crust in transtension zones (pull-apart structures). In order to understand the flow leading to this type of domes, 3D numerical models were set-up to simulate the general case of an extensional domain located between two strike-slip faults (pull-apart or dilational bridge). Results show that upper crust extension induces flow of the deep, low-viscosity crust, with rapid upward movement of transdome material when extension becomes localized. At this point a rolling hinge detachment allows rapid removal of upper crust. The internal structure of transdomes includes a subvertical high strain zone located beneath the zone of localized upper crust extension; this shear zone separates two elongate subdomes of foliation that show refolded/sheath folds. Lineation tends to be oriented dominantly subhorizontal when the amount of strike-slip motion is greater than the amount of upward flow of dome rocks. Models also predict nearly isothermal decompression of transdome material and rapid transfer of ~50 km deep rocks to the near surface.\nThese model results are compared to the structural and metamorphic history of several transdomes, and in particular the Variscan Montagne Noire dome (French Massif Central) that consists of two domes separated by a complex high strain zone. The Montagne Noire dome contains ~315 Ma eclogite bodies (U-Pb zircon age) that record 1.4 GPa peak pressure. The eclogite bodies are wrapped in highly sheared migmatite that yield 314-310 Ma monazite ages interpreted as the metamorphism and deformation age. Based on these relations we conclude that the Montagne Noire transdome developed a channel of partially molten crust that likely entrained eclogite bodies from the deep crust (~50 km) before ascending to the near-surface. One implication of this work is that the flowing crust was deeply seated in the orogen although it remained a poor recorder of peak pressure of metamorphism. The eclogite bodies entrained in partially molten crust are a reliable marker of channel depth, especially when the ages of eclogite and migmatite are so close, like in the Montagne Noire. This indicates that channels of partially molten rocks are typically developed in the middle to deep orogenic crust (~50 km).",

On a time scale of few years to a decade, both field variations may be linked to changes at the top of the core. We propose that the topography of the core mantle boundary (CMB) is in a dynamic equilibrium state mainly controlled by a dissolution/crystallization process of the mantle silicate rocks in the liquid alloy of the core. Subsequent to the continuous changes in topography at the CMB, we show that anomalies of hundreds of nGal and tens of nT/yr2 can be produced by the corresponding mass redistribution and the secondary flows generated by the dynamic pressure.

            "abstract": "Empirical modelling approaches are frequently used to upscale local eddy-covariance observations of carbon, water and energy fluxes to regional and global scales. The predictive capacity of such models largely depends on the data used for parameterization and identification of input-output relationships, while prediction for conditions outside the training domain is generally uncertain. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used in the past for empirical upscaling of eddy covariance measurements; here this modelling approach is used to predict gross primary production and latent heat flux on local and European scales with the aim to evaluate the effect of the sites network size and distribution on the total budgets and inter-annual variability predictions. ANNs were confirmed to be a valid tool for GPP and LE prediction, in particular for extrapolation in time. Extrapolation in space in similar climatic and vegetation conditions also gave good results, while extrapolation in areas with different seasonal cycles and controlling factors showed noticeably higher errors, confirming the importance of the training dataset representativeness. The distribution and the number of sites used for ANN training had a remarkable effect on prediction uncertainty in both, regional GPP and LE budgets and their interannual variability. Results obtained show that for ANN upscaling for continents with relatively small networks of sites (e.g. Africa), the error due to the sampling can be large and needs to be considered and quantified. The analysis of the spatial variability of the uncertainty helped also to identify which are the drivers less represented in the training dataset, contributing to the identification of hotspots where new towers would contribute more to the reduction of uncertainty in the empirical upscaling. Results are coherent with other studies on network representativeness although clearly related to the use of the data in these specific activities (upscaling).",

            "abstract": "The Porcupine Basin is a tongue-shaped basin SW of Ireland formed during the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean. Its history of sedimentation reveals several rifting and subsidence phases during the Late Paleozoic and Cenozoic, with a particular major rift phase occurring in Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous times. Previous work, focused on seismic and gravity data, suggest the presence of major crustal faulting and uppermost mantle serpentinization in the basin. Serpentinization is a key factor in lithospheric extension since it reduces the strength of mantle rocks, and hence, influences the tectonics of the lithosphere. Besides reducing the seismic velocity of the rock, serpentinization decreases mantle rock density favoring isostatic rebound and basin uplift, thus affecting the tectonic and thermal evolution of the basin. Here we characterize the deep structure of the Porcupine Basin from wide-angle seismic (WAS) and gravity data, with especial emphasis on the nature of the underlying mantle. The WAS data used were acquired along a 300 km long transect across the northern region of the basin. We used a travel time inversion method to model the data and obtain a P-wave velocity (Vp) model of the crust and uppermost mantle, together with the geometry of the main geological interfaces. The crustal structure along the model reveals a maximum stretching factor of ~5-6. These values are well within the range of crustal extension at which the crust becomes entirely brittle allowing the formation of major crustal faulting and serpentinization of the mantle. To further constrain the seismic structure and hence the nature of the mantle we assess the Vp uncertainty of the model by means of a Monte Carlo analysis and perform gravity modeling to test different interpretations regarding mantle rock nature.

The Accelerating Moment/Strain Releasing model could be seen as the loading process between the reduced seismicity after the last huge earthquakes around the epicenter and the next rupture. So the AMR model depends on the occurrence of the quiescence. Here, we develop an approach based on the concept of stress accumulation to unify and categorize all claimed seismic precursors in a same physical framework, including the quiescence, the AMR/ASR model and the short-term activation. It shows that different precursory paths are possible before large earthquakes and can be described by a logic tree with combined criteria at a given stress state and of precursory silent slip on the fault and within the faults system. Theoretical results are then compared to the time series observed prior to the earthquake catalog from 1980 to 2012, Italy. In the initial result, the case of the 2009 Mw = 6.3 L’Aquila earthquake, Italy, the observed precursory path is coupling of quiescence and accelerating seismic release, followed by activation. What’s more, the comparison between ETAS and Stress Accumulation Model shows that precursors are statistic significant when microseismicity is considered, which holds important information on the stress loading state of the crust surrounding active faults. Based on the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), we found that quiescence and ASR signals are significant when events below a magnitude of 2.2 are included and that short-term activation is significant when events below 3.3 are included. These results provide guidelines for future research on earthquake regional risk assessment and some kind of predictability.",

Characterizing in space and time the complex sources of these slow earthquakes, and their relationship with background seismicity and large earthquakes generation, is of great importance for understanding the physics and mechanics of the processes of active deformations along the plate interfaces.\nWe present here first developments towards a methodology for: (1) extracting the different frequency and scale components of observed tectonic tremor signal, using advanced time-frequency and time-scale signal representation such as Gabor transform scheme based on, e.g. Wilson bases or Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) bases; (2) reconstructing their corresponding potential sources in space and time, using the array method of Poiata et al.

In the present study, we examine a simplified wetland scheme that stores part of snowmelt with MATSIRO land surface model in a climate model, MIROC5. We conduct AGCM experiments using MIROC5 with climatological monthly SST and sea ice boundary conditions from 1979 to 1996 with and without the simplified wetland scheme. First, we compare simulated climatology of soil moisture in JJA with satellite based observation data. The result shows that eastern Eurasia has wet bias, and western Eurasia and North America except Alaska have dry bias; this might be caused by precipitation biases. The simulated soil moisture with the wetland scheme increases in high latitudes, about 0.2 for the most affected regions. Then, we evaluate simulated precipitation and surface air temperature using JRA55 reanalysis dataset. In the experiment without the wetland scheme, warm bias exists in most of the land area. By introducing the wetland scheme, the warm bias decreases because the latent heat flux increases and the sensible heat flux decreases. Simulated precipitation without the wetland scheme shows similar bias in soil moisture. It decreases in western Eurasia with the wetland scheme. Further, we evaluate the land-atmosphere coupling strength using rank correlation coefficient of soil moisture and lifting condensation level. The result shows that the effects of wetlands reduce the coupling strength.",

The visual inspection of core material from the plate boundary décollement reveals a clay layer with scaly fabric, cut by a sharp discontinuity that may be the record of co-seismic slip (Chester et al., 2013). This result brought to the need to re-evaluate the role and the characteristics of scaly fabric.\nScaly fabric is the typical meso/microstructure marking the location of slip concentration in all the active décollements cored near the trench (i.e. Barbados, Nankai, Costa Rica, Japan Trench) and in analogue fossil examples cropping out onland. Scaly fabric tends to form self-similar patterns, and usually areas with smaller phacoids are interpreted as more deformed. We know that scaliness develops in the early stages of deformation, that the slip surfaces defining the phacoids are sharp and they do not occur randomly, that they grow and coalesce forming a progressively finer anastomosing network, and that eventually the anastomoising slip surfaces are “enhanced” or “cut” by straight slip surfaces. Advances in identifying detailed evolutionary history of slip localization from scaly fabric to discrete surfaces have been paralleled by laboratory experiments. Here we try to summarize direct and indirect information on physical properties of clay layers deformed at shallow depth and, possibly, their links to the seismic cycle. These challenges include future work on the role of scaly fabric on earthquake deformation along faults.",

            "abstract": "This is the continuous study to clarify the geo-environmental changes on the post-fire alpine slopes of Mount Shirouma-dake in the northern Japanese Alps. The fire occurred at May 9, 2009 on the alpine slopes of Mount Shirouma-dake, and the fire spread to the Pinus pumila communities and grasslands. Although the grass had a little damage by the fire, the P. pumila received nearly impact of the fire. In the P. pumila communities where the leaf burnt, forest floor is exposed and become easy to be affected by atmospheric condition such as rain, wind, snow, and etc.\nFirst, we illustrated a map of micro-landforms, based on geomorphological fieldworks. We observed these micro-landforms repeatedly for fifth years after the fire. As the results of the observation, it is clear that remarkable changes of these micro-landforms have not occurred but some litters on the forest-floor in the P. pumila communities are flushed out to surroundings. The litter layer on the forest-floor in the P. pumila communities were 3-4 cm thick in August of 2011, but it became 0.5 cm thick in September of 2014. The P. pumila communities established on the slopes consists of angular and sub-angular gravel with openwork texture, which are covered by thin soil layer. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to soil erosion following the outflow of the litter.\nIn addition, we observe the ground temperature and soil moisture, under the fired P. pumila communities and the no fired P. pumila communities after the fire, to find influence of the fire. The ground temperature sensors were installed into at 1 cm, 10 cm, and 40 cm depth. The soil moisture sensors were installed into at 1 cm and 10 cm depth. The 1 cm depth of the soil on the post-fire slopes, diurnal freeze-thaw cycles occurred in October and November of 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 but it had not occurred in 2009 and 2010. In addition, the period of seasonal frost at 10 cm and 40 cm depth on the post-fire slopes are extended for two weeks. These thermal condition changes are triggered by decrease in the thickness of the litter layer on the fired P. pumila communities.",

These models are based on data that is geographically biased towards certain regions on the Northern hemisphere; the Southern hemisphere and equatorial regions are currently underrepresented. Here we present archeointensity data obtained from potsherds from the Wageningen-1 mound on the Northwest coast of Suriname (5.8°N 56.7°W); this settlement of the Hertenrits culture was excavated in the 1970s. We obtained potsherds from six levels between 0.75 – 3 meter below the surface, corresponding to 960 and 670 AD respectively (Versteeg, 2003, p. 269-270) based on four radiocarbon datings. The remanent magnetization is carried by small pseudo-single domain grains, is stable, and small overprints are typically removed below 150 °C. Archeointensities were obtained using the IZZI-Thellier protocol; laboratory alteration was monitored by pTRM checks and pTRM Tail checks. All 23 technically acceptable archeointensities (out of 52 samples measured) are very low: between 8.0 and 18.5 μT. A trend is suggested from an average of 10-12 μT at ~700 AD, to ~18 μT at ~950 AD. This corresponds to VADMs from ~28 at ~700 AD to ~47 ZAm2 at ~950 AD. This dramatically contradicts field model predictions that range from 38-39 μT (PFM9K.1b) to 38-46 μT (SHA.DIF.14k) for this location and the same ages. Our results predate the occurrence of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) by 500-1000 years; without a longer record it is difficult to decide whether our reported lows are a different discrete geomagnetic feature, or whether they are a precursor of the South Atlantic Anomaly.",

            "abstract": "Tomographic images show that the Indian lithosphere lies sub-horizontally beneath the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau. However, the evolution of the India-Eurasia collisional system that formed the present-day crustal and lithospheric structure is unclear. We developed a three-dimensional numerical model of this collision zone to investigate what causes the underthrusting of the Indian lithosphere and what consequences this might have on the topographic, structural and thermal evolution of the broad collision zone.\nOur modelling results show that initially the Indian continental plate subducts at ~45 degree dip, and that after oceanic slab break-off occurs (at least 10 Myr after initial collision), it may rise back towards the surface and underthrust the Eurasian plate. This process can result in the formation of a thick horizontal layer of continental crust that extends for about ~300 km from the suture zone under the overriding Eurasian plate. This scenario fits very well with the proposed deep structure of the area inferred from geophysical observations. Interestingly, we find that this process of underplating after slab break-off happens only if an external force pushes the subducting plate towards the overriding plate, consistent with a far field driver from the Réunion plume or ridge push.\nWe observe a sharp peak in the effect on overriding plate topography right after the occurrence of slab break-off. Afterwards, during underplating, the maximum topographic effect is lower, but the area with high topography is much larger (up to 200 km across). Precise contributions to elevation are parameter-sensitive, but this pattern of a northwards-migration of the topographic effect seems robust. As the Indian continental lithosphere rises, its temperature decreases at the top of 100 – 250ºC through time. At the same time, however, the deepest part of the subducted continental crust gets hotter reaching temperatures of ~850ºC. Moreover, the overriding mantle wedge progressively migrates northwards away from the trench and eventually disappears. This pattern matches observed trends in the location and composition of magmatism in the Lhasa terrane.",

            "abstract": "The stratigraphic evolution of fluvial fans is to a large extent governed by channel avulsion. Spatial variations in alluvial architecture are influenced by avulsion magnitude and frequency. However due to the absence of long–term chronostratigraphic records of fan stratigraphy, it has proved difficult to test patterns of fan evolution against records of climate variability. In order to understand the processes of channel avulsion during fan evolution, it is important to determine the spatio–temporal pattern of fluvial channel aggradation, incision, and migration. In this study, we reconstruct the shallow sub–surface alluvial stratigraphy of fluvial fan systems formed by the major Himalayan rivers, the Sutlej and Yamuna, in the northwestern Indo–Gangetic basin. We map the spatial distribution of channel sand bodies deposited by these rivers and develop a chronostratigraphic model for the fluvial succession in a depositional dip perpendicular transect. Sediment cores up to ~50 m deep along two transects are used to reconstruct the shallow stratigraphy of the fan systems. Discontinuous channel sand bodies are separated by floodplain fines which occasionally show weak pedogenesis that mark the end of episodes of channel aggradation. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating is used to bracket the timing of channel–filling episodes, and their spatial distribution. Mapping of sand bodies coupled with chronostratigraphic constraints allows reconstruction of channel migration patterns and their timing across the Sutlej–Yamuna fans. Chronostratigraphy permits temporal correlation with published measures of monsoon variability. We find that fluvial aggradation at the western end of studied transects, near the middle of the Sutlej fan, terminated around ~20 ka. We also show that abandonment of the paleo–Sutlej and major fan–scale avulsion occurred after ~15 ka, and was followed by formation of incised valleys that confined the modern fluvial system in northwestern Indo–Gangetic basin. Our study has importance for groundwater management policies in this water–stressed agricultural hotspot of India, because the sub–surface sand bodies form excellent fluvial aquifers. Thus, understanding the variability in sand body stratigraphy is important for understanding aquifer geometry.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that faults are not planar surfaces. Instead, their geometry exhibits fractal properties that span a wide range of scales (sub-micrometer to tens-of-kilometer). This “geometric fault roughness” has a distinct impact on the amount and distribution of stress that is induced in the medium when a fault slips. Although this is well known, large portions of this roughness are ignored in numerical simulations (even though they aim to understand the effect of roughness on seismic behavior): individual fault patches –the incremental elements that build the fault surface in the respective computer models– are planar and fault roughness at this and lower spatial scales is not considered. As a result, the fault-patch stress-transfer efficiency may be systematically too large in those numerical simulations with respect to the “actual” efficiency level. This defeats to some extend the purpose of those investigations that aim to constrain the effect of fault roughness on seismic behavior.\nHere, we investigate the effect of sub-patch fault geometric complexity on fault-patch stress-transfer efficiency. We sub-divide a circular fault patch (1km radius) into a large number of triangular sub-patches (using different levels sub-patch discretizations to confirm convergence of our results), emplace them in an elastic full space, and determine the amount of induced stress as a function of fault roughness. For each level of sub-patch discretization we generate 10,000 random fault geometries that obey the fractal properties mentioned above. The corresponding stress values are normalized with a nominal stress value that is due to slip along a planar fault(patch), providing scaling factors and their variability for stress transfer efficiency.The presented work therefore provides the means to implement sub-patch fault roughness into (numerical) investigations that adopot fault-patch interaction schemes.",

For corresponding to the natural plant growing condition, the vegetation models were arranged along one side of the flume wall. The vegetation models were made of the steel columns with staggered arrangement. The vegetation densities were set equal to 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.12, 0.15, 0.22 and 0.3. The experimental flow condition was steady and the vegetation models were emergent. The flow velocity was controlled close to the initiation of sediment motion. The scour patterns around the vegetation zone were measured by the Laser Distance Meter in equilibrium scour conditions. The results show that the scour patterns have similarity in vegetation density ranging from 0.03 to 0.12. The dimensionless scour length (D) is ranging 1.30-1.50. The dimensionless scour width (B) is ranging 1.11-1.48. The dimensionless accumulation width (E) is ranging 1.18-1.67. The dimensionless accumulation length (F) is ranging 0.49-1.81.The results also show that B and E are proportional to the vegetation densities, and the D and F are inversely proportional to the vegetation densities.",

            "abstract": "The effects of climate change on eroding landscapes and the sedimentary record remain poorly understood. The measurement of grain size fining rates in stream-flow dominated deposits provides one way to address this issue because, in principle, these trends embed important information about the dynamics of sediment routing systems and their sensitivities to external forcing. At a fundamental level, downstream fining is often driven by selective deposition of sediment. The relative efficiency of this process is determined by the physical characteristics of the input sediment supply and the spatial distribution of subsidence rate, which generates the accommodation necessary for mass extraction. Here, we measure grain size fining rates from apex to toe on two alluvial fan systems in northern Death Valley, California, which have well-exposed modern and 70 ka surfaces, where the long-term tectonic boundary conditions are known and where climatic variation over this time period is well-constrained. We integrate a self-similar gravel fraction fining model, based on selective sediment extraction, with cosmogenically-derived catchment erosion rates and gravel fining data, to estimate the change in sediment flux that occurred between 70 ka and the present day. Our results show that a 30 % decrease in average precipitation rate led to a 20 % decrease in sediment flux and a clear increase in the down-fan rate of fining. This supports existing landscape evolution models that relate a decrease in precipitation rate to a decrease in sediment flux, but implies that this relationship may be sub-linear. This study offers a new approach to applying grain size fining models to mountain catchments and their alluvial fan systems, and shows fan stratigraphy can be highly sensitive to climate changes over <105 years. However we also observe that this sensitivity is lost when sediment is remobilised and recycled over a time period longer than the duration of the climatic perturbation.",

            "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau is the headwaters of many major rivers in Asia, the change in streamflow is significant for social and economic development and natural ecology in the middle and lower reaches. Located in the alpine region, streamflow in the plateau is mainly affected by the cryosphere hydrological processes. Due to global warming in recent decades, the Tibetan Plateau is experiencing glaciers shrinking and permafrost degradation. Accelerated glacier melt led to the increasing meltwater, thus affecting the streamflow. Permafrost is an important factor in stabilizing the water cycle and streamflow, the ecological degradation and the significant changes of rivers, lakes, swamps, wetlands and other hydrological environment in recent decades in the Tibetan plateau is closely related to permafrost degradation. Therefore, it is important to explore the impact of cryosphere hydrological changes on the streamflow for the future water management.\nThis study uses a method of base flow separation and a stepwise multiple regression model to investigate the reasons for the runoff changes in different regions of the Tibetan Plateau during 1960-2000. The contribution of glacier melt to annual runoff is particularly estimated to explore the possible influences of soil freezing and thawing on annual runoff changes. The results show an increasing trend of the annual runoff in the upstream of Nujiang River, Lancang River and Qilian Mountains, dominated by the increasing of base flow; and a decreasing trend of the runoff in the upper reach of the Yarlung Zangbo River, Yellow River and Yangtze River, dominated by the reduction of quick flow. Change in the amount of runoff was mainly due to change in precipitation. Rising temperature accelerates the melting of glaciers and increases the summer quick flow. In addition, rising temperature may reduce the quick flow and increase the base flow due to change of the active permafrost layers, which leads to the increase of soil water storage capacity, then changes the runoff generation. Because of the wide distribution of permafrost in the Tibetan Plateau, the increase of base flow caused by the change of runoff generation will be continuous with the rising air temperature in the future.",

            "abstract": "Seismic data processing is currently undergoing a step change, benefitting from high-volume datasets and advanced computer power. In the last decade, a permanent seismic network of 30 broadband stations, complemented by dense temporary deployments, covered mainland Portugal. This outstanding regional coverage currently enables the computation of a high-resolution image of the seismicity of Portugal, which contributes to fitting together the pieces of the regional seismo-tectonic puzzle.\nAlthough traditional manual inspections are valuable to refine automatic results they are impracticable with the big data volumes now available. When conducted alone they are also less objective since the criteria is defined by the analyst. In this work we present CatchPy, a scanning algorithm to detect earthquakes in continuous datasets. Our main goal is to implement an automatic earthquake detection and location routine in order to have a tool to quickly process large data sets, while at the same time detecting low magnitude earthquakes (i.e. lowering the detection threshold). CatchPY is designed to produce an event database that could be easily located using existing location codes (e.g.: Grigoli et al. 2013, 2014).\nWe use CatchPy to perform automatic detection and location of earthquakes that occurred in Alentejo region (South Portugal), taking advantage of a dense seismic network deployed in the region for two years during the DOCTAR experiment. Results show that our automatic procedure is particularly suitable for small aperture networks.\nThe event detection is performed by continuously computing the short-term-average/long-term-average of two different characteristic functions (CFs). For the P phases we used a CF based on the vertical energy trace while for S phases we used a CF based on the maximum eigenvalue of the instantaneous covariance matrix (Vidale 1991). Seismic event location is performed by waveform coherence analysis, scanning different hypocentral coordinates (Grigoli et al. 2013, 2014).\nThe reliability of automatic detections, phase pickings and locations are tested trough the quantitative comparison with manual results.\nThis work is supported by project QuakeLoc, reference: PTDC/GEO-FIQ/3522/2012",

            "abstract": "Climate change is impacting the high latitudes more rapidly and significantly than any other region of the Earth because of feedback processes between the atmosphere and the underlying surface. A warmer climate has already led to thawing of permafrost, reducing snow cover and a longer growing season; changes, which in turn influence the atmospheric circulation and the hydrological cycle. Still, many studies rely on one-way coupling between the atmosphere and the land surface, thereby neglecting important interactions and feedbacks. The observation, understanding and prediction of such processes from local to regional and global scales, represent a major scientific challenge that requires multidisciplinary scientific effort. The successful integration of earth observations (remote and in-situ data) and model development requires a harmonized research effort between earth system scientists, modelers and the developers of technologies and sensors. LATICE, which is recognized as a priority research area by the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Oslo, aims to advance the knowledge base concerning land atmosphere interactions and their role in controlling climate variability and climate change at high northern latitudes.

            "abstract": "The reconstruction and interpretation of sedimentary basins incorporated into folded and thrusted mountain belts is strongly limited by the style and intensity of shortening. This problem is exacerbated if deformation is polyphasic as is the case for the Paleozoic basins in the central Andes. Some of these have been deformed by folding and thrusting during at least 3 events in the Late Ordovician, the Late Paleozoic and Cenozoic. A realistic reconstruction of the original basin dimensions and geometries from outcrops and maps appears to be almost impossible.\nWe present results of a stepwise reconstruction of the Paleozoic basins of the central Andes by restoring basin areas and fills accounting for crustal shortening. The structurally most prominent feature of the central Andes is the Bolivian Orocline which accomodated shortening in the last 45 Ma on the order of between 300 and 500 km. In a first step basins were restored by accounting for Cenozoic rotation and shortening by deconvolving the basins using an enhanced version of the oroclinal bending model of Ariagada et al. (2008). Results were then restored stepwise for older deformation. Constraints on these subsequent steps are significantly poorer as values of shortening can be derived only from folds and thusts apparent in outcrops. The amount of shortening accomodated on unexposed and therefore unknown thrusts can not be quantified and is a significant source of error very likely leading to an underestimation of the amount of shortening.\nAccepting these limitations, basin restoration results in an increase in basin area by ≥100%. The volumes of stratigraphically controlled basin fills can now be redistributed over the wider, restored area, translating into smaller rates of accumulation and hence required subsidence. The restored rates conform to those of equivalent modern basin settings and permit a more realistic and actualistic analysis of subsidence drivers and the respective tectonic framework.",

            "abstract": "Although billions of dollars have been spent over the past half-century to reduce contamination of U.S. waters, quantifying parts-per-billion reductions in surface water concentration since has been relatively unsuccessful. The reasons for the failure in identifying the benefits of these remediative efforts include: (i) historic (pre-1980) problems in accurately sampling and analyzing trace element concentrations at parts-per-billion level, so that temporal reductions in trace metal contamination reflected improved sampling and analytical accuracy rather than real decreases in those concentrations; (ii) limited seasonal and long term research.\nSilver in its ionic form is more toxic to aquatic organisms than any other metal except Hg. Because Ag is not common naturally in the environment, its elevated presence in water, sediment or biological tissues is usually indicative of anthropogenic influences. However, there is very little published data on Ag levels in both water and sediment. The published studies include Ag levels in a few U.S. estuarine waters, including detailed and time series studies for the San Francisco Estuary system by the WIGS lab at UC Santa Cruz. In the open Ocean, Ag measurements are limited to a few studies in the North and South Pacific, The North and South Atlantic. However, as Gallon and Flegal recently noted, there is no available data on Ag concentrations from the Indian Ocean! Most of the dissolved Ag data from the Atlantic was made in WIGS lab at UC Santa Cruz\nAnalytical determination of Ag in seawater has come a long way since Murozumi reported the first dissolved Ag measurements from the N. Pacific in 1981 using isotope dilution MS after solvent extraction. In this presentation I will review analytical developments for Ag determination in the last three decades. I will also highlight the missing data gaps and present new tentative data on dissolved Ag concentration and cycling in polar regions including the Antarctic (Amundsen Sea) and The Siberian Arctic.",

            "abstract": "We investigate whether borehole measurements of self-potential (SP) can be used to monitor seawater intrusion into the UK chalk aquifer. The SP, a naturally occurring voltage, arises in water saturated porous and fractured media due to gradients in pressure (streaming potential) and concentration (exclusion-diffusion potential), both of which occur during seawater intrusion. We use an electrode array installed in an observation well c. 1.7km from the coast and 1.3km from an active abstraction well. Head fluctuations in the observation well are primarily controlled by tidal processes and seasonal changes in groundwater recharge.\nSP monitoring over a period of 1.5 years has revealed semi-diurnal fluctuations in voltage with larger amplitude (c.200μV) than those observed at a comparable inland site in the same chalk aquifer (c.0.2μV from spectral analysis). Numerical simulation of the coupled hydrodynamic and electrical processes in the coastal aquifer suggests that the streaming potential generated by tidal processes is one order of magnitude too small to be responsible for the semi-diurnal fluctuations in voltage. Instead, the signal is caused by the exclusion-diffusion potential across the saline front, the location of which moves in response to the tidal cycle. Thus the SP signal recorded at the well arises from the saline front which is some distance away.\nIn August 2013 and 2014, tidal processes coupled with a decline in inland head caused saline water to enter the observation well. Electrical conductivity logging over a tidal cycle showed that entry was via a fracture near the base of the well. Prior to each occurrence of saline breakthrough, an increase in the SP of c.300μV was observed, commencing c.5 days before saline water was detected in the well. Numerical simulation suggests that the SP precursor is dominated by the exclusion-diffusion potential across the saline front as it advances through the fracture.\nAlthough we focus here on an observation well, SP monitoring arrays could be installed in abstraction wells and our results suggest that the data may be used to provide early warning of saline water breakthrough, allowing for improved management of groundwater resources in coastal aquifers.",

            "abstract": "The southwestern part of Hokkaido, northern Japan, is located at the junction of the NE Japan arc and the Kuril arc. The subducting Pacific plate under this region shows a hinge-like shape due to the dip change of the subducting plate along the trench. Because of the interest in this unique tectonic setting, this arc-arc junction has been the focus of extensive geophysical studies (e.g. Kita et al., 2010, Morishige and van Keken, 2014; Wada et al., 2015). This region is also known as an area in which magmatism has been intense; there are many active volcanoes such as Usu, Tarumae, and Komagatake, and large calderas including Toya, Shikotsu, and Kuttara. In this region, the temporal and spatial evolution of the volcanism and the chemical compositions of the volcanic rocks are well characterized (e.g. Nakagawa, 1992). However, the generation conditions of magmas have not been estimated for these volcanoes, probably because of the scarcity of basaltic products. Therefore, a possible link between the tectonic setting and the intense magmatism is still unclear.\nIn this study, we carried out a petrological and geochemical study on mafic lavas (49.6–51.3 wt.% SiO2) from Usu Volcano, and estimated the conditions under which the magmas were generated. By application of a plagioclase-melt hygrometer to the plagioclase and the host magma, the water content of ~6.5 wt.% was obtained for the basaltic magma. Using this information, as well as the olivine maximum fractionation model (Tatsumi et al., 1983), the composition of the primary magma is estimated to be 47.9 wt.% SiO2, 15.1 wt.% MgO, and 4.1 wt.% H2O. Analyses using the multi-component thermodynamics suggest that the primary magma was generated in the source mantle with 0.9 wt.% H2O at 1310ºC and at 1.6 GPa. The water content of 0.9 wt.% of the source mantle is significantly higher than the estimates for the source mantle in the main NE Japan arc (<0.7 wt.% H2O); this implies that the flux of slab-derived fluids is higher at the arc-arc junction than the main NE Japan arc. Beneath the arc-arc junction, the subducting Pacific plate shows a hinge-like shape, and many fractures might have been developed in the slab; this may have resulted in the intensive hydration of the wedge mantle due to efficient release of the fluids from the slab.",

This article chose An Hui Province with Hefei City as the research area. In this study, the GIS data, including information of land use, road, population in Anhui province, was used to optimize the spatial distribution of emission sources. The 1km*1km population data (cited) is used to optimize the anthropogenic emissions, while the agricultural NH3 is distributed followed the coverage of agriculture from MODIS land use data. After optimization, the spatial distribution of the regional emission sources turned into a complicated pattern that has the characteristics of GIS information from a simple pattern.\nThe results of the Air Quality Model CMAQ that is driven with the emission sources before optimization and that after optimization was preliminarily validated with the station observation data. The validation results show: 1.The simulation results of CO and PM2.5 by optimized emission sources had some improvement comparing with the simulation results by normal emission sources when they were validated with observation data. The simulation results of PM2.5 in Yaohai were chosen as an example. The mean bias of simulation after optimization is -6.55 and that of simulation before optimization is -16.84.And mean error of simulation after optimization comparing with simulation before optimization is reduced from 22.07 to 13.69, and correlation coefficient R is increased from -0.22 to 0.23. 2. The simulation results are abnormal in a given period, mainly in the rush hour, and need to be corrected in the later period.\nThe results show that the accuracy of simulation results after spatial optimization with GIS tools is improved, and GIS data has some effects on improving the results of atmospheric environment simulation in Hefei City and Anhui province. Subsequent work will be to refine the GIS data, to improve the model grid resolution and to add more information about emissions, in order to improve the precision of the simulation, and to add satellite observation data to further verify the conclusion.",

            "abstract": "The magnetospheric response to a dawn-dusk component in the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) is known to lead to a number of asymmetries throughout the entire magnetosphere. We here present an event where simultaneous global imaging of the aurora from both hemispheres reveals a large longitudinal shift of the nightside aurora of around 3 hrs. This is interpreted as evidence of a highly twisted magnetotail due to the persistent positive IMF By before and during the event. At the same time, SuperDARN observes ionospheric flows in the nightside flow reversal region in both hemispheres. Our analysis indicates a stronger flow towards the dayside in the dusk cell in the southern hemisphere compared to its conjugate region. We interpret this as a signature of the process known as \"magnetotail untwisting\". We analyse this event with emphasis on the expected field-aligned currents (FAC) associated with the magnetotail untwisting mechanism. A more distinct arc is seen in the region of the untwisting fast flows compared to its conjugate location suggesting that the observed faster flows are associated with enhanced FACs as expected. To further investigate the influence of magnetotatil untwisting on FACs, we show average FAC maps from AMPERE (Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment) during IMF By dominated conditions. We show that suchIMF By dominated conditions are indeed characterized by significant asymmetries in FACs between the hemispheres, in good agreement with what is predicted from the untwisting mechanism. We therefore suggest that the process of magnetotail untwisting, controlled mainly by IMF By, likely plays an important role in driving asymmetric FACs in the two hemispheres.",

However, how best to implement Data Assimilation (DA) for these models remains an open question. At a fundamental level these models are very different from atmospheric models for which traditional DA was developed.\nThis poster describes the integration of JULES with the EMPIRE framework. EMPIRE (Employing MPI for Researching Ensembles) implements a test bed for ensemble based DA techniques that makes use of MPI message passing to exploit all available processing power. In particular EMPIRE contains several flavours of Particle Filter which show promise for the land surface DA problem. Examples of assimilating soil moisture observations from the ESA CCI data set into JULES are given for a number of sites in Africa.

            "abstract": "There is currently little information in South Africa concerning the influence of terrestrial ecosystems on biosphere-atmosphere interactions and their impact on the earth system. Climate modellers require data on energy exchanges between the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum to develop surface models of carbon, energy and water to scale up from the different biomes in South Africa, to regional and, ultimately, global scales. Atmospheric exchanges of South African biomes (ecosystems) are important due to the large and varied pant diversity they represent. The important ecosystem services (including water) delivered by these natural systems and their potential role in the long-term CO2 uptake from the atmosphere and carbon storage is a key gap in South African research.\nSouth Africa is already a water-scarce country so the predicted impacts of climate change on water resources are likely to have devastating effects. It is against this diminishing water supply that the South African government must develop innovative investments in water technologies and infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of growing water shortages due to climate change.\nThe Department of Science and Technology of South Africa is planning a multi-million rand investment in long-term ecological infrastructure with a focus on carbon, water and energy. The terrestrial programme will comprise six to seven landscape-scale ‘climate change observatories’, some in urban and agricultural situations, with eddy covariance flux towers for carbon water and energy measurements, regular remote sensing, for the long-term collection of environmental, ecological and social data. The South African flux network measurement programme aims to become a key role player in the assessment of the consequences of rapid land use change and future impacts of climate change both regionally and internationally.\nKey words: flux towers, eddy co-variance, carbon, water and energy",

            "abstract": "The behaviour of the crust shortly after large earthquakes has been the subject of numerous studies, but many co- and post-seismic processes remain poorly understood. Damage and healing of the bulk rock mass, post-seismic deformation and the mechanisms of earthquake triggering are still not well understood. These processes are important to properly model and understand the behaviour of faults and earthquake cycles.\nIn this presentation, we will show how in-situ measurements of seismic velocity variations have given new insights into these co- and post-seismic processes. An experiment was performed where a blast was detonated in a tunnel in an underground mine, while seismic velocity variations were accurately (0.005 %) measured with ambient seismic noise correlations.\nAdditionally, aftershock activity was examined and the influence of the removal of a piece of solid rock was estimated with elastic static stress modelling. The majority of the aftershocks were delayed with respect to the passing of the dynamic waves from the blast, while the locations of the aftershocks appeared clustered and not homogeneously spread around the blast location.\nA significant velocity drop is visible during the time of the blast, which is interpreted as co-seismic damage and plastic deformation. These non-elastic effects are healed by the confining stresses over a period of 5 days until the seismic velocity converges to a new baseline level. The instantaneous weakening and gradual healing observed from the velocity variations are qualitatively similar to results reported in laboratory studies.\nThe change in the baseline level of the seismic velocity before and after the blast indicate a change in the static stress that is comparable to the results of elastic static stress modelling. The differences between the elastic model predictions and the seismic velocity variations could be due to zones of fractured rock, indicated by the spatial clustering of the aftershocks, that are not represented by the homogeneous isotropic elastic model.\nThe delayed timing of the aftershocks, and the duration to velocity evolution, suggest that the same processes (stress change and damage) could control the timing of the two phenomena.

Subduction and collision of the aseismic Cocos Ridge is thought to have initiated <3.5 Ma and has been linked to: 1) late Miocene-Pliocene cessation of volcanism and uplift of the Cordillera de Talamanca, Costa Rica; 2) Quaternary migration of the volcanic arc toward the back-arc in Costa Rica; 3) Quaternary to present deformation within the Central Costa Rica Deformed Belt; 4) Quaternary to present shortening across the fore-arc Fila Costeña fold and thrust belt and back-arc North Panama Deformed Belt (NPDB); 5) Quaternary to present outer fore-arc uplift of Nicoya Peninsula above the seamount domain, and the Osa and Burica peninsulas above the ridge; and 6) Pleistocene to present northwestward motion of the Central American Fore Arc (CAFA) and northeastward motion of the Panama Region. We investigate the geodynamic effects of Cocos Ridge collision on motion of the Panama Region with a new geodynamic model. The model is compared to a new 1993-2015 GPS-derived three-dimensional velocity field for the western Caribbean and northwestern South America. Specifically, we test the hypotheses that the Cocos Ridge is the main driver for upper plate deformation in the western Caribbean. Our models indicate that Cocos Ridge collision drives northwest-directed motion of the CAFA and the northeast-directed motion of the Panama Region. The Panama Region is driven into the Caribbean across the NPDB and into northwestern South America, which is also converging with the Panama Region, pushing it toward the west-northwest. Therefore, recent (<3.5 Ma) collision of Panama with northwestern South America is driven by Cocos Ridge collision.",

            "abstract": "Although climate models' water vapour and lapse rate feedbacks are anti-correlated on a global scale, no such relationship is seen on regional scales. What determines the regional structure of these feedbacks?\nHere we compare the modelled behaviour of tropical climate feedback processes with satellite observations over the period 1979-2010. We use data from the High-Resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS) Channel 12 (~6.3 microns) to quantify changes in upper-tropospheric relative humidity. Investigating the regional structure of trends in tropospheric temperature and humidity, we discover consistent signatures of processes driving lapse rate and water vapour feedbacks across climate models and observational datasets.\nUpper-tropospheric warming trends are relatively constant over the Tropics because the tropical atmosphere is unable to maintain strong temperature gradients. The regional structures of upper-tropospheric warming are similar between models and observations. Therefore, the majority of the regional variation in tropical lapse rate feedback actually comes from regional variation in surface temperature changes, not tropospheric temperature changes.\nUpper-tropospheric moistening is mainly sensitive to regional precipitation trends. The degree to which moistening in the convective zones is transmitted to other parts of the tropics is central to determining the regional pattern of the water vapour feedback. These relationships could provide process-based metrics of climate models’ ability to simulate the physical processes driving tropical water vapour and lapse rate feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall anomalies during June-September over Indian subcontinent and southern Australia are remotely influenced by diabatic heating anomalies resulting from tropical sea surface temperature variability, including El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence from reanalysis datasets and a set of CMIP5 models pre-industrial outputs, shows considerable interdecadal variations in the relationship between regional rainfall and tropical variability. Those variations can be ascribed to varying coherence of ENSO with the IOD on the interdecadal timescale. In the Indian subcontinent, when ENSO and the IOD are strongly coherent in decadal periods, ENSO dominates an inverse relationship with rainfall and overwhelms the impacts from the IOD through a baroclinic teleconnection induced by ENSO; in decadal periods when the coherence of tropical variability is weak, the positive effect from the IOD dominates rainfall variability through a baroclinic teleconnection induced by the IOD, accompanied by a weakened influence from ENSO. In southern Australia, tropical variability plays a more distinct role in rainfall variability compared to its counterpart in India. Either an El Nino or a positive IOD leads to decreased rainfall, through equivalent barotropic Rossby wave trains emanating from the tropical Indian Ocean. An anomalously strong rainfall response in southern Australia is associated with a strong coherence of ENSO and the IOD in decadal periods. In decadal periods of weak coherence, the effect of ENSO can’t reach southern Australia.",

            "abstract": "Impact of climate change is not only seen on food production but also on food security, socio-economics of the poor and sustainable development of society. Adaptation to climate change is a pressing issue throughout the world to reduce the risks along with the plans and strategies for food security and sustainable development. As a key adaptation to the climate change, agricultural insurance is expected to play an important role in stabilizing agricultural production through compensating the losses caused by the climate change, meaning that the agricultural insurance can contribute to promotion of the stability in food security as one of 4 pillars defined by FOA of the United Nations.\nHaving the above as background, we conducted research on utilization of remote sensing data including satellite data to assess damage ratio of rice production which could be used for calculation of indemnity in the agricultural insurance. Our study site was in West Java, Indonesia.\nFor assessment of the damage ratio, estimation of rice yield is a key. As the result of our study, rice yield in dry season could be estimated at level of 1 % significance using SPOT5 satellite data taken in 2014, and the 10-fold cross-validation result was 0.7t/ha. Then, the decrease ratio in rice yield about each individual paddy field was calculated using data on the estimated result and the average yield of the past 10 years.\nAccording to the Indonesian agricultural insurance, if the damage of rice reaches 75% or above, the indemnity shall be paid to farmers. In our study site, the result showed that about 80 paddy fields located in lower irrigation region were the area to be paid by the insurance.\nOur study results suggest that the utilization of remote sensing data is much useful and promising for assessment of the damage ratio of rice production with precise, quick and quantitative, and also it can be incorporated into the insurance procedures.",

            "abstract": "The spatial variability of soil properties (particle size distribution, PSD, and bulk density, BD) has large effects on the spatial variability of soil moisture and therefore on plant growth and surface exchange processes. In model studies, soil properties from soil maps are considered homogeneous over mapping units, which neglects the small scale variability of soil properties and leads to underestimated small scale variability of simulated soil moisture. This study focuses on the validation of spatial variability of simulated surface soil moisture (SSM) in a winter wheat field in Western Germany using the eco-hydrological simulation system DANUBIA. SSM measurements were conducted at 20 different sampling points and nine different dates in 2008. Frequency distributions of BD and PSD were derived from an independent dataset (n = 486) of soil physical properties from Germany and the USA. In the simulations, BD and PSD were parameterized according to these frequency distributions. Mean values, coefficients of variation and frequency distributions of simulated SSM were compared to the field measurements. Using the heterogeneous model parameterization, up to 76 % of the frequency distribution of the measured SSM can be explained. Furthermore, the results show that BD has a larger impact on the variability of SSM than PSD. The introduced approach can be used for simulating mean SSM and SSM variability more accurately and can form the basis for a spatially heterogeneous parameterization of soil properties in mesoscale models.",

            "abstract": "Basaltic open vent volcanoes exhibit a wide range in eruption styles, from passive outgassing to Strombolian and Hawaiian explosive activity. Transitions between these styles are linked to contrasting two-phase (melt and gas) flow regimes in the conduit system. A wealth of data now exists characterising the fluxes and compositions of gases emitted from these volcanoes, alongside detailed observations of patterns of outgassing at the magma free surfaces. Complex variations in gas composition are apparent from high temporal resolution measurement techniques such as open path spectroscopy. This variability with time is likely a function of individual bubbles’ histories of growth during ascent, with variable degrees of kinetic inhibition. Our previous studies at Kilauea and Stromboli have, for example, linked CO2-rich gases with the bursting of bubbles that last equilibrated at some depth beneath the surface. However, very few studies have attempted to reconcile such observations with quantitative models of diffusion-limited bubble growth in magmas prior to eruption. We present here an analytical model that simulates the growth of populations of bubbles by addition of volatile mass during decompression, with growth limited by diffusion. The model simulates a range of behaviors between the end members of separated two-phase flow and homogeneous bubbly flow in the conduit, tied to thermodynamic models of solubility and partitioning of volatile species (carbon, water, sulfur). We explore the effects of the form of bubble populations at depth, melt viscosity, total volatile content, magma decompression rate and other intrinsic parameters on expected gas compositions at the surface and consider implications for transitions between eruption styles. We compare the the model to data suites from Stromboli and Kilauea.",

            "abstract": "We present the results of a set of numerical experiments designed to observe the imprint of three-dimensional density heterogeneities on a seismogram. To compute the full seismic wavefield in a three-dimensional heterogeneous medium, we use numerical wave propagation based on a spectral-element discretization of the seismic wave equation. We consider a 2000 by 1000 km wide and 500 km deep spherical section, with the one-dimensional Earth model PREM, altered so that the crust is 40 km thick and all the parameters in the crust are constant, as a background. Onto the uppermost 40 km of the underlying one-dimensional model we superimpose three-dimensional randomly generated velocity and density heterogeneities of various correlation lengths. We use different random realizations of heterogeneity distribution. We compare the synthetic seismograms for three-dimensional velocity and density structure with three-dimensional velocity structure and one-dimensional density kept as PREM, calculating relative amplitude differences and time shifts as functions of time and frequency. The misfits in time shift and amplitude for different frequency bands, epicentral distances and medium complexities are then stacked into histograms and statistically analysed. We observe strong dependency on frequency of density-related amplitude difference. We also conclude potential sensitivity to distant density structures, and that scattering is essential to observe significant density imprint on a seismogram. The possible density-related bias in velocity and attenuation for regional tomographic models is calculated using mean misfit values for given epicentral distances. Whereas the bias in velocity does not exceed 0.5% of the model value, the density-related change in attenuation may be as big as 71% of the model value for the mean amplitude difference in the highest frequency band. The results suggest that density imprint on a seismogram is not negligible and with further theoretical developments direct inversion for density may become feasible.",

            "abstract": "Liquid drainage in porous media is characterized by complex interfacial processes in which pore space geometry and drainage boundary conditions jointly determine entrapped liquid distribution behind an invading fluid front. For water drainage at the pore scale, the rapid emptying of ‘full’ pores at their air entry value leaves liquid in corners retained by capillary forces that subsequently slowly drain by film thinning in a process similar to foam drainage. The invasion patterns of drainage fronts reflect an interplay of capillary and viscous forces where higher drainage rates favor preferential invasion through more conductive pore spaces and result in a liquid distribution behind the front that deviates from hydrostatic conditions. The study describes drainage dynamics through the residual corner-film network using similarities with foam drainage. Experimentally we quantified pore scale geometry and resulting liquid distribution at different flow rates by rapid X-ray tomography (3D scan per second) of water drainage from coarse sand and glass beads. We define the fraction of pore liquid that drains with the front and the fraction left in corners based on pore shape parameters and estimate rates for gravity drainage of the corner film network. From imaged liquid distribution we distinguish conditions for entrapment of pore clusters that subsequently drain at secondary times scales defined by the foam drainage equation.",

The model optimizes surface emissions from biosphere and anthropogenic sources using the in-situ atmospheric concentration observations from NOAA and other cooperative networks. The CarbonTracker system is based on the ensemble Kalman filter, where the TM5 transport model is used as an observation operator. The estimated average global total emission for 2001-2012 is 519±37 Tg CH4/yr, with an average growth rate of 3.6 Tg CH4/yr. The emission estimate for the first half of the period (2001-2006) is ca. 10 Tg CH4/yr lower than the 12-year average, and the average growth rate was only 1.5 Tg CH4/yr. The emission estimate and its growth rate increased in the second half of the period (2007-2012) by ca. 12 Tg CH4/yr and ca. 80%, respectively. The differences in the average estimates and the growth rates before and after 2006 are mainly due to the growth of anthropogenic emissions in Asia. The results show no significant trend in Europe. Using the optimized emission estimates, atmospheric concentrations were calculated using TM5, and compared with in-situ, aircraft, and space-born observations.

There was increasing evidence showed that many problems had been occurred since ecological protection program began. Whether the artificial forest would adapt to environmental conditions on Loess Plateau is still controversial. In this paper, LANDIS-II, a spatially explicit model which included extension modules such as succession, disturbance, seed propagation, forest management, carbon dynamics and climate change, was applied to simulate dynamic natural succession of forests for coming 300 years in hilly-gully area of Loess Plateau. The results showed that (1) During the advancement of succession, the study area was occupied by different communities and appeared different succession stage successively under the condition of without considering the disturbance; (2) The current artificial forest has changed from 93.31% of Robinia pseudoacacia to exit the forest community in 50 years; (3) Platycladus oriental was the dominant species of coniferous trees and Populus davidiana was the dominant species of deciduous trees; (4)During the late succession stage, Platycladus oriental replaced Pinus tabulaeformis becoming the largest areal proportion of dominant tree species. The simulating of the natural succession in hilly-gully area of Loess Plateau forests at large space and long term scales, could provide a scientific basis for rational allocation of forest resources and forest management.

Evaluating the reliability of climate simulations in the region is essential to support water sustainability and food security under possible future climatic changes and population growth. Here, we assess the ability of a set of state-of-the-art regional climate models (RCMs) of the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX)-Africa to reproduce the hydrologic cycle of the NRB. For this aim, we adopt a verification framework based on the mass conservation principle that assumes that the mean annual difference between precipitation and evaporation equals the long-term mean discharge. We focus on four nested sub-basins encompassing different climatic zones with available discharge observations. We found that most RCMs overestimate the mean annual runoff (from +10% to +400%), because of a positive bias in the simulation of precipitation and a weak hydrologic cycle in the evaporation channel. Some exceptions are found in the more humid sub-basin upstream where a few climate simulations are not able to capture the intensity of the West African monsoon. Analyses of the water balance components also revealed that the signature of the RCMs is more significant than that of the driving General Circulation Model, likely due to the specific schemes adopted in the RCMs to parameterize the land-surface processes. This work is useful to increase the utility of regional climate simulations in impact studies supporting the development of water management polices and planning of hydraulic infrastructures in the basin.",

            "abstract": "The northern continental margin of the South China Sea (SCS) is a passive margin, and have experienced rifting and seafloor spreading. From continental shelf to deep sea basin, the nature of the crust gradually changes from continental crust to oceanic crust. Many studies use a term \"continent-ocean boundary (COB)\", to describe the boundary between these two kinds of crust. This boundary is roughly located along the boundary between slope and deep sea basin, and roughly parallels to the 3000 m isobath in the northern SCS.\nThis study analyzes many multiple channel seismic reflection profiles in the northern continental margin of the SCS, and has identified an angular unconformity between the slope and deep sea basin deposits at the COB in the NW sub-basin area. This unconformity extends from continental slope to NW sub-basin near the COB. Strata beneath the unconformity downlap to the basement. Furthermore, there is a strong reflector beneath the unconformity, and this strong reflector, called “Tom”, represents a hiatus which was recognized by biostratigraphic analyses from Site 1148 of ODP Leg 184. The strata between the unconformity surface and reflector Tom pinch toward deep sea basin, and then the unconformity and reflector Tom merge into one reflector. Therefore, the unconformity might be an erosional surface. The strata covered the unconformity onlap the unconformity. Some portions of the COB have intrusions forming basement high, and the unconformity and strata are coherent with basement relief.\nThe unconformity has been interpreted as a normal fault in some previous studies, but our study distinguishes it as an erosional surface. Besides, some previous studies consider the bottom of the sedimentary layers in the NW sub-basin as the onset of depositing deep sea environment, and suggested that it is related to the onset of seafloor spreading. However, we interpret the angular unconformity as the onset of deep sea environment, and it differs from the onset of seafloor spreading.",

            "abstract": "<span\" 고딕\"=\"고딕\"\">Clay-clast aggregates (CCA) have commonly been reported from experimental and natural fault gouges, but their formation process and mechanical meaning are not so clear. We call CCA snowball gouge aggregate (SGA) since its formation process is similar to that of snowball (see below) and CCA-like structure has been reported also from pure quartz and pure calcite gouges. Here, we discuss the formation process of SGA and its implication for faulting from experimental results of simulated gouges. We conducted high-velocity rotary shear experiments on Ca-bentonite gouges at a normal stress of 1 MPa, slip rate of 1.31 m/s, room temperature and room humidity conditions. Ca-bentonite gouge consists of montmorillonite (>95%) and other minor minerals including quartz and plagioclase. Upon displacement, the friction abruptly increases to the 1st peak (friction coefficient μ≈<span\" 고딕\"=\"고딕\"\"> 0.7) followed by slip weakening to reach a steady state (μ≈<span\" 고딕\"=\"고딕\"\"> 0.25~0.3). The simulated fault zone can be divided into slip-localization zone (SLZ) and low-slip-rate zone (LSZ) based on grain size. Spherical SGAs with their size ranging from 1 to 100 μm occur only in LSZ, and their proportion is more than 90%. Two types of SGA occur; SGA with and without a central clast. Both types of SGA show a concentric layering defined by the alternation of pore-rich (1-1.5 μm thick) and pore-poor layers (1.5-2 μm thick). Clay minerals locally exhibit a preferred orientation with their basal plane parallel to the layer boundary. We interpret that the pore-poor layers are clay-accumulated layers formed by rolling of SGA nuclei, and pore-rich layers correspond to the boundary between accumulated clay layers. Water produced from dehydration of clays due to frictional heating presumably acts as an adhesion agent of clay minerals during rolling of SGA. Since the number of layers within each SGA represents the number of rolling, the minimum displacement estimated from the number of layers and layer thickness of the largest SGA (with a diameter of 100 μm) is about 2.7 mm (slip rate≈ <span\" 고딕\"=\"고딕\"\">170 μm/s) which is much less than the total displacement of 20 m, suggesting that most of the displacement occurred along the SLZ. Our results imply that SGA can be formed only in subseismic slip-rate zones and that minimum displacement and slip rate can be estimated from SGA.",

            "abstract": "Changes in the geochemical environment in crystalline bedrock fractures were investigated using the stable isotopes of C, O and S in fracture filling minerals as tracers. Of special interest were the possible changes which may occur in the subsurface at low temperatures. Especially, the influence of microbial activity was recognized as a catalyst for inducing changes in the geochemical environment. The study site is the Olkiluoto island located on the western coast of Finland, planned to host a geological repository for nuclear waste.\nFracture surfaces were investigated to recognize the latest mineralizations at the site. These fillings were comprised of thin plates or small euhedral crystals of calcite and pyrite. The carbon and sulfur isotope compositions of calcite and pyrite were measured from bulk material by conventional IRMS, and in situ by secondary ion mass spectrometry. A notable feature of the late-stage fillings was high variabilities in the δ13C values of calcite and the δ34S values of pyrite, which ranged from -53.8 ‰ to +31.6 ‰ and from -50.4 ‰ to +77.7 ‰, respectively. Based on the isotopic compositions of the fillings, several features in the past hydrogeochemical environment could be recognized. The isotopic composition of the fracture fillings indicate an environment which was stratified with respect to depth. Characteristic features include bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) occurring at depths <111 m (bsl), and a methanogenetic environment at depths >50 m. It appears that methanic conditions were replaced by sulfate reduction at depths >50 m likely due to infiltration of SO42--rich brackish waters. Sulfate reducing bacteria used mainly surface derived organic carbon as electron donors. Some indication of minor methanotrophic activity was recognized in anomalously low δ13C values of calcite, down to -53.8 ‰, at the depth range of 34-54 m. This methanotrophic activity may have been related to bacteria using CH4 as an electron donor in BSR.",

            "abstract": "We monitor seismic velocity changes during an experiment at decametric scale aimed at artificially reactivate a fault zone by a high-pressure hydraulic injection in a shale formation of the underground site of Tournemire, South of France. A dense and a multidisciplinary instrumentation, with measures of pressure, fluid flow, strain, seismicity, seismic properties and resistivity allow for the monitoring of this experiment. We couple hydromechanical and seismic observations of the fault and its adjacent areas to better understand the deformation process preceding ruptures, and the role played by fluids. 9 accelerometers recorded repeated hammers shots on the tunnel walls. For each hammer shot we measured small travel time delays on direct P and S waves. We then located the seismic velocity perturbations using a tomography method. At low injection pressure, i.e. P< 15 Bars, we observe an increase of P-waves velocity around the injection, while we measure no change in S waves velocity. When the pressure overcomes 15 Bars, velocity perturbations dramatically increase with both P and S waves affected. A decrease of velocity is observed close to the injection point and is surrounded by regions of increasing velocity. Our observations are consistent with hydromechanical measures. Below 15 Bars, we interpret the P-wave velocity increase to be related to the compression of the fault zone around the injection chamber. Above 15 Bars, we measure a shear and dilatant fault movement, and a rapid increase in the injected fluid flow. At this step, our measures are coherent with a poroelastic opening of the fault with velocities decrease at the injection source and velocities increase related to stress transfer in the far field. Velocity changes prove to be efficient to monitor stress/strain variation in an activated fault, even if these observations might produce complex signals due to the highly contrasted hydromechanical responses in a heterogeneous media such as a fault zone.",

            "abstract": "Applying corrections for the known geology to gravity data can be traced back into the first quarter of the 20th century. Later on, mostly in areas with sedimentary cover, at local and regional scales, the correction known as gravity stripping has been in use since the mid 1960s, provided that there was enough geological information.\nStripping at regional to global scales became possible after releasing the CRUST 2.0 and later CRUST 1.0 models in the years 2000 and 2013, respectively. Especially the later model provides quite a new view on the relevant geometries and on the topographic and crustal densities as well as on the crust/mantle density contrast. Thus, the isostatic corrections, which have been often used in the past, can now be replaced by procedures working with an independent information interpreted primarily from seismic studies.\nWe have developed software for performing geological corrections in space domain, based on a-priori geometry and density grids which can be of either rectangular or spherical/ellipsoidal types with cells of the shapes of rectangles, tesseroids or triangles. It enables us to calculate the required gravitational effects not only in the form of surface maps or profiles but, for instance, also along vertical lines, which can shed some additional light on the nature of the geological correction. The software can work at a variety of scales and considers the input information to an optional distance from the calculation point up to the antipodes.\nOur main objective is to treat geological correction as an alternative to accounting for the topography with varying densities since the bottoms of the topographic masses, namely the geoid or ellipsoid, generally do not represent geological boundaries. As well we would like to call attention to the possible distortions of the corrected gravity anomalies.\nThis work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract APVV-0827-12.",

Modern distributional data for various organisms are also being made available for calibration and paleoecological analyses. The project is a collaborative effort among individuals from more than 20 institutions worldwide, including domain scientists representing a spectrum of Pliocene-Quaternary fossil data types, as well as experts in information technology. Working groups are active for diatoms, insects, ostracodes, pollen and plant macroscopic remains, testate amoebae, rodent middens, vertebrates, age models, geochemistry and taphonomy. Groups are also active in developing online tools for data analyses and for developing modules for teaching at different levels.\nA key design concept of NeotomaDB is that stewards for various data types are able to remotely upload and manage data. Cooperatives for different kinds of paleo data, or from different regions, can appoint their own stewards. Over the past year, much progress has been made on development of the steward software-interface that will enable this capability. The steward interface uses web services that provide access to the database.\nMore generally, these web services enable remote programmatic access to the database, which both desktop and web applications can use and which provide real-time access to the most current data. Use of these services can alleviate the need to download the entire database, which can be out-of-date as soon as new data are entered. In general, the Neotoma web services deliver data either from an entire table or from the results of a view. Upon request, new web services can be quickly generated. Future developments will likely expand the spatial and temporal dimensions of the database. NeotomaDB is open to receiving new datasets and stewards from the global Quaternary community.

            "abstract": "The notion that landscape features have coevolved over time is well known in the Earth sciences. Hydrologists have recently called for a more rigorous connection between emerging spatial patterns of landscape features and the hydrological response of catchments, and have termed this concept catchment coevolution. In this paper we review recent literature on this subject and attempt to synthesize what we have learned into a general framework that would improve predictions of hydrologic change. We first present empirical evidence of the interaction and feedback of landscape evolution and changes in hydrological response. From this review it is clear that the independent drivers of catchment coevolution are climate, geology, and tectonics. We identify common currency that allows comparing the levels of activity of these independent drivers, such that, at least conceptually, we can quantify the rate of evolution or aging. Knowing the hydrologic age of a catchment by itself is not very meaningful without linking age to hydrologic response. Two avenues of investigation have been used to understand the relationship between (differences in) age and hydrological response: (i) one that is based on relating present landscape features to runoff processes that are hypothesized to be responsible for the current fingerprints in the landscape; and (ii) one that takes advantage of an experimental design known as space-for-time substitution. Both methods have yielded significant insights in the hydrologic response of landscapes with different histories. If we want to make accurate predictions of hydrologic change, we will also need to be able to predict how the catchment will further coevolve in association with changes in the activity levels of the drivers (e.g., climate). There is ample evidence in the literature that suggests that whole-system prediction of catchment coevolution is, at least in principle, plausible. With this imperative we outline a research agenda that implements the concepts of catchment coevolution for building a holistic framework toward improving predictions of hydrologic change.",

            "abstract": "Potassium (K) and Thorium (Th) are useful tracers of crustal differentiation and secondary processes as these elements concentrate in melts during magmatic processes but are not equally mobile during alteration. They may be mapped by airborne or orbiting gamma ray spectrometers measuring the natural activity of 232Th and 40K. Such data are commonly used in geological mapping and mineral exploration on the Earth and have been produced for other planets. However, the direct comparison of spatially averaged concentrations measured remotely with bulk rock analyses of surface samples may be challenging. In the case of Mars, there is a notable shift between K, Th concentrations in Martian meteorites with those from orbital data [1]. We observe a similar discrepancy when airborne radiometric surveys on portions of the continental crusts are statistically compared with bulk analyses of rock samples. We argue that the generally right-skewed characteristics of the distributions of K, Th concentrations for the terrestrial crust may be extrapolated to the Martian crust. We illustrate how such distributions transform with resolution in remote sensing data, and evolve as normal laws as expected from the central limit theorem. This well-known statistical effect offers a simple explanation for the shift between K, Th concentrations in meteorites and orbital data. The shift would reflect the existence of disseminated occurrences of differentiated rocks on Mars, adding to other pieces of evidence for magmatic diversity [2-4]. The characteristics of the distribution of K and Th within the GRS footprint appears to be critical for a correct interpretation or these data, but such distribution cannot be directly documented on Mars due to the lack of appropriate data. However, interpretation of airborne remote sensing data sets on Earth will clearly benefit from the characterization of the spatial organization of K and Th concentrations at the outcrop scale (1 – 100 m), which is now possible by using portable gamma ray spectrometers.\n[1] Taylor, G.

            "abstract": "Surface turbulent heat fluxes are responsible for variability of surface ocean heat budget on synoptic and interannual scales. This variability is driven by variations of near surface atmospheric characteristics controlled in midlatitudes by atmospheric cyclones. We focus on understanding the mechanisms of synoptic variability of surface turbulent fluxes and on the origins of extreme turbulent fluxes and their impact on the atmospheric dynamics. The main questions addressed in this study are (i) what are the large scale atmospheric conditions associated with extreme ocean surface fluxes and are they related to cyclones, (ii) what is the role of extreme surface fluxes in the variability of oceanic heat content, and (iii) which characteristics of atmospheric cyclones are sensitive to the surface ocean flux signals? To answer these questions, we derived characteristics of the extreme surface fluxes from their empirical probability distributions from the NCEP-CFSR reanalysis, 1979-onwards and analyse them together with cyclone characteristics over the midlatitudinal North Atlantic. Cyclone tracking has been performed using state of the art numerical tracking algorithm applied to the reanalysis SLP at 6-hourly resolution. We argue that the presence of the high pressure system following to the rare part of propagating cyclone is a critical condition for the formation of extreme surface ocean fluxes which are associated with the cyclone-anticyclone interaction zone rather than with cyclone per se. We also demonstrate that the fraction of oceanic heat loss due to extremes linked to the atmospheric circulation. Locally this fraction can be as large as 50%. We also show that over the Gulf Stream more than 60% of cyclogenesis were associated with extreme surface fluxes.",

Atom interferometers offer interesting applications in geophysics (gravimetry, gradiometry, Earth rotation rate measurements), inertial sensing (submarine or aircraft autonomous positioning), metrology (new definition of the kilogram) and fundamental physics (tests of the standard model, tests of general relativity). Atom interferometers already contributed significantly to fundamental physics by, for example, providing stringent constraints on quantum-electrodynamics through measurements of the hyperfine structure constant, testing the Equivalence Principle with cold atoms, or providing new measurements for the Newtonian gravitational constant. Cold atom sensors have moreover been established as key instruments in metrology for the new definition of the kilogram or through international comparisons of gravimeters. The field of atom interferometry (AI) is now entering a new phase where very high sensitivity levels must be demonstrated, in order to enlarge the potential applications outside atomic physics laboratories. These applications range from gravitational wave (GW) detection in the [0.1−10 Hz] frequency band to next generation ground and space-based Earth gravity field studies to precision gyroscopes and accelerometers.\nThe Matter-wave laser Interferometric Gravitation Antenna (MIGA) presented here is a large-scale matter-wave sensor which will open new applications in geoscience and fundamental physics. The MIGA consortium gathers 18 expert French laboratories and companies in atomic physics, metrology, optics, geosciences and gravitational physics, with the aim to build a large-scale underground atom-interferometer instrument by 2018 and operate it till at least 2023. In this paper, we present the main objectives of the project, the status of the construction of the instrument and the motivation for the applications of MIGA in geosciences",

Unfortunately, the acceleration measurements suffer from a variety of disturbances, the most prominent being slow temperature-induced bias variations and sudden bias changes. These disturbances have caused a significant delay of the accelerometer data release.\nIn this presentation, we describe the new three-stage processing that is required for transforming the disturbed acceleration measurements into scientifically valuable thermospheric neutral densities. In the first stage, the sudden bias changes in the acceleration measurements are removed using a dedicated software tool. The second stage is the calibration of the accelerometer measurements against the non-gravitational accelerations derived from the GPS receiver, which includes the correction for the slow temperature-induced bias variations. The third stage consists of transforming the corrected and calibrated accelerations into thermospheric neutral densities. We describe the methods used in each stage, highlight the difficulties encountered, and comment on the quality of the thermospheric neutral density data set, which covers the geomagnetic storm on 17 March 2015.",

            "abstract": "The modality in which seismic fractures nucleate and propagate is still an open issue. Some authors claim that small and large earthquakes are different from the early stage of the rupture. Others believe that there is no way to distinguish a small shock from a large event, until the rupture process has completed. Within this context, in a previous work we investigated the evolution of the early P-wave displacement amplitude with time for different magnitude events and observed differences among the curves. We found indeed a rapid initial increase for the small shocks and a slower growth for the largest events. We interpreted the observations in terms of a different rupture beginning for small and large earthquakes, related to the friction conditions during the nucleation phase of earthquake ruptures. In this work, we first investigate the effect of the distance attenuation on the observed time evolution of the P-wave peak displacement amplitude. We analyzed a few colocated events, belonging to the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi sequence, recorded in the same source-to-receiver geometry, to prove that geometrical/propagation factors are not responsible for the observed initial slope of the P-wave amplitude. Then, following the concept of expanding the P-wave time windows, we propose a straightforward methodology, based on the P-wave amplitude, to quickly characterize the extension of the seismic source. In particular, we investigate whether the progressive measurement of the P-wave displacement amplitude can provide a rapid estimate of the event magnitude and of the expected size of the rupture. Finally, the real- time measurement of the initial P-wave amplitude allows for a preliminary evaluation of kinematic parameters of the rupture process. The duration and extension of the nucleation phase, as well as the frictional properties associated to the nucleation zone together with the rupture velocity are inferred as long as the P-wave amplitude is observed.",

            "abstract": "Professionals and students in geology use an array of graphs to study the earth, but relatively little detail is known about how users interact with these graphs. Comprehension of graphical information in the earth sciences is further complicated by the common use of non-traditional formats (e.g., inverted axes, logarithmic scales, normalized plots, ternary diagrams). Many educators consider graph-reading skills an important outcome of general education science curricula, so it is critical that we understand both the development of graph-reading skills and the instructional practices that are most efficacious. Eye-tracking instruments provide quantitative information about eye movements and offer important insights into the development of expertise in graph use.\nWe measured the graph reading skills and eye movements of novices (students with a variety of majors and educational attainment) and experts (faculty and staff from a variety of disciplines) while observing traditional and non-traditional graph formats. Individuals in the expert group consistently demonstrated significantly greater accuracy in responding to questions (e.g., retrieval, interpretation, prediction) about graphs. Among novices, only the number of college math and science courses correlated with response accuracy. Interestingly, novices and experts exhibited similar eye-tracks when they first encountered a new graph; they typically scanned through the title, x and y-axes, and data regions in the first 5-15 seconds. However, experts are readily distinguished from novices by a greater number of eye movements (20-35%) between the data and other graph elements (e.g., title, x-axis, y-axis) both during and after the initial orientation phase. We attribute the greater eye movements between the different graph elements an outcome of the generally better-developed self-regulation skills (goal-setting, monitoring, self-evaluation) that likely characterize individuals in our expert group.",

            "abstract": "Presence of absorbing aerosols above clouds causes its apparent darkening, observed at Top of Atmosphere. Owing to the large radiative warming and potential impacts on climate, above clouds aerosols (ACA) have recently been characterized in multiple satellite-based studies. While satellite data have particularly been useful in demonstrating the climate impact of ACA, uncertainties remain in the indepth understanding of aerosol-cloud radiative interactions. Recent studies also indicate large uncertainties in satellite retrievals of ACA optical depth and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), which are among the most important parameters in their radiative impact.\nHere, we present observations of clouds embedded in vertically extended and optically thick smoke, from NASA/GSFC’s airborne Cloud Absorption Radiometer. We focus on smoke plumes associated with pyroconvective activity from wildfires in Canada, during the ARCTAS campaign. Our key findings include characterization of clouds embedded in smoke, associated with a strong positive reflectance (R) gradient in the UV-VIS-NIR spectrum, as opposed to an (expected) negative gradient for cloud-free smoke and a flat spectrum for smoke-free cloud cover. Several cases of clouds embedded in thick smoke were found, when the aircraft made circular/spiral measurements, which not only allowed the complete characterization of angular distribution of smoke scattering, but also provided vertical distribution of smoke and clouds (within 0.5-5km). Specifically, the largest cloud darkening was found in the UV/VIS, with significant reduction at R0.34μm in contrast to the NIR wavelengths (e.g. 1.27μm). The observed darkening was found to be associated with large optical depths (0.5 - 3) and moderately low SSA (0.85–0.93 at 530nm), resulting in significantly large forcing efficiency of 250Wm-2τ-1 (using coincident sunphotometer, insitu and irradiance measurements). Our observations of smoke-cloud radiative interactions were found to be physically consistent with theoretical 1D and 3D radiative transfer calculations, capturing the observed gradient across UV-VIS-NIR. This study offers new insights in aerosol-cloud radiative interactions, which also can help in better constraining satellite-retrieval algorithms.\nhttp://car.gsfc.nasa.gov/",

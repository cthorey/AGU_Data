            "abstract": "Quantitative discussion regarding the state within the conduit and the magma chamber is important in considering subsequent eruption scenarios, since it is known that the mechanism and efficiency of gas escape from the conduit control the eruption style. The 2011 eruption of Shinmoe-dake is a suitable example for a quantitative examination using physical models of magma flow in a conduit. Mount Shinmoe-dake, in the Kirishima volcanic group (southwest, Japan), resumed its activity with a small phreatomagmatic explosion on January 19, 2011. The eruption style then underwent a series of sub-plinian explosions, shifted to lava extrusion that half-filled the summit crater, and to subsequent magmatic/phreatomagmatic activity including several vigorous vulcanian explosions that lasted until September 2011. Among this eruption sequence, we focused on the transition from the explosive (sub-plinian) stage to the effusive (lava extrusion) stage that apparently ceased after four days. To examine the conditions in the conduit and the magma chamber, numerical code is devised, based on the one-dimensional steady flow model of Kozono and Koyaguchi (2010), who modeled a dome-forming eruption. We systematically searched for a condition under which the magma would not be fragmented, keeping the initial volatile content in the magma chamber constant. We found that high magma permeability allowing the vertical gas escape in the conduit and/or considerable amount of lateral gas escape through the conduit wall were needed for the eruption for the eruption to effusive. The termination of lava extrusion seemed to have been brought about by successive reduction of the chamber pressure in the course of the explosive phase. We based on the above conduit flow model, estimated the amount of the pressure reduction until the termination of lava extrusion as 30 MPa. Applying a Mogi model, the total volume of the modeled magma chamber was estimated as 10 km3.",

            "abstract": "Frictional re-strengthening of bare rock surfaces at very low stresses and near zero slip rate, as observed in the laboratory, is traditionally interpreted as showing support for purely time-dependent healing as embodied in the Aging law. However, while slide-hold-slide experiments on bare surfaces do show an apparent (purely) time-dependent increase in the static friction upon reslide, we show that the stress minima attained during the preceding holds show a strong slip-dependence which contradict the Aging law. A velocity strengthening Slip law explains such data much better. We also show that, large velocity step decreases, which drive the system far below steady state just like long holds, clearly support the slip-dependent response of the Slip law over the time-dependent healing contained in the Aging law.\nBut, while time-dependent healing has an intuitive physical picture in terms of growth of the 'real contact area' with time, it is more difficult to ascribe one to slip-dependent healing. Here, we explore the possibility that the slip-dependence arises out of an interplay between contact `quality' and `quantity' at the scale of the asperity contacts. First, to further study the slip-dependence of healing, we carry out large velocity step decreases and sequences of long slide-hold-slides on both bare rock and gouge. Secondly, to probe the micro-mechanical origins of healing, we complement our mechanical data with amplitudes and travel time data of ultrasonic P- and S- waves transmitted across the sliding interface. While ultrasonic P-wave transmissivity has been used as a proxy for 'real contact area' in friction experiments by Nagata et al. (2012, 2014) before, the simultaneous use of P- and S-phases in our experiments is designed specifically to probe contact rheology. Initial results show strong correlations between changes in friction, transmitted wave amplitudes and travel times in response to changes in slip rate. We also observe important differences between the friction and ultrasonic data which might illuminate the role of contact `quality' in determining frictional strength. Using the ultrasonic data along with numerical modeling and inversion of the friction data, we hope to probe the micro-mechanical origins of frictional healing and rate-and-state friction in general.",

            "abstract": "Most numerical models of lithosphere deformation approximate the rheological behavior of polymineralic crust and mantle via single-phase flow laws assuming that the weakest or most abundant material controls the bulk rheology. However, previous work showed that in two phase aggregates the bulk viscosity of the dominant phase is significantly affected by second phase particles. Here we combine two unconventional approaches to quantify the relative impact of such particles on strain localisation and bulk response: (1) We run centimetre-scale numerical models of a matrix with inclusions using the elasto-visco-plastic FEM software Slim3D. Recrystallization-induced weakening processes in the matrix, i.e. grain boundary migration and nucleation, are approximated using strain-dependent viscous softening. (2) We conduct high T, constant strain rate deformation experiments with a matrix of deuterated ice (D2O) containing rigid or soft particles, i.e. calcite and graphite, respectively. Ice is a valuable rock analogue, as it replicates the microstructural and fabric changes as well as the non-Newtonian response of other anisotropic minerals, such as olivine and quartz.\nThe laboratory experiments exhibit two types of rheological behaviour: stress partitioning between ice and particles and strain localization in rheologically softer material. To quantify the contribution of both response types, we calibrate numerical simulations with data derived from laboratory experiments. The strain rate, stress, and viscosity evolution of the numerical experiment provides insight to non-linear strain localization processes, particle motion and time-dependent stress concentrations during the deformation. We fit the parameters of the viscous softening function and thereby quantify the amount of additional weakening in the matrix of ice mixtures in comparison to pure ice, which allows to constrain softening parameters used in large-scale simulations of glacial flow and lithosphere deformation.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of the critical zone are in many aspects poorly understood, resulting largely from the difficulty of observing key processes. Key stores and fluxes are invisible, from the energy budget in air and soil, to the fluxes of water in soils, air and plants. Fortunately we are poised to remove the blinkers, and reveal the spatial and temporal structure of these terms. This will be achieved by novel combinations of observation technologies and high-performance computing. Fiber optic technology allows 1 s measurement of temperature at 0.25 m resolution to 0.1 C. By injecting heat in the fiber, we can quantify stores of soil water, fluxes in soils and boreholes, and movement of the atmosphere. Air-born digital imagining is shown to facilitate cm-level observation of landscapes at the km-scale, as well as the potential to monitor the temporal dynamics of canopy interception. These data can be used to connect specific structures and plant assemblages to key fluxes. Many of these methods are being developed and provided at low cost to the community by the Center for Transformative Environmental Monitoring Programs (CTEMPs.org). A parallel effort, the Open-Source Published Environmental Sensing (OPENS.org) laboratory, provides a forum for the development and publication of user-producible instruments. In all cases the developments are characterized by combining low-cost per data point at hundreds to thousands of locations to provide a comprehensive view of the spacio-temporal dynamics of the crucial zone.",

The location was such that the CHILL radar could provide coverage for select storms. The 20 to 80 MHz VHF broadband interferometer was augmented by fast and slow antenna data for discerning both impulsive and overall charge motion. A substantial fraction of the flashes recorded during the Colorado campaign were observed to be inverted intraclouds. This was particularly true of a close tornadic storm on June 6 which was also distinguished by a large number of precursor events. We will detail some illuminative examples from this and other storms. We will also analyze the effect substantially longer baseline lengths and increased sensitivity had on the performance of the interferometer relative to previous campaigns as well as in comparison to the Lightning Mapping Array.",

The proposed framework has been validated against recently published experiments involving both, synthetic and natural hydrate soils, as well as different sediments types (i.e., different hydrate saturations, and different hydrates morphologies) and confinement conditions.

            "abstract": "Aggregates deformed by crystal plastic mechanisms often contain grains that exhibit crystallographic distortion (e.g., kinking, undulose extinction, subgrain development). In such grains, crystallographic orientations are typically dispersed along small circles on lower hemisphere equal-area plots. Thus, we consider that an intragranular dispersion axis represents a grain-scale axis of material rotation, and its position coincides with that of a highly localized vorticity axis.\nWe present a new method for determining the position of a grain-scale vorticity axis from intragranular crystallographic orientation data. This method leverages a method of rotational statistics known as principal geodesic analysis to identify a single best-fit rotational axis that matches the rotational dispersion of crystallographic orientations in a deformed grain. We further demonstrate that populations of such grain-scale vorticity axes can be used to infer a preferred vorticity axis for volumes of deformed aggregates. As an example of this type of application, we calculate intragranular vorticity axes from a sample-scale selection of grains (i.e., all the grains mapped in an EBSD orientation map) and use kernel density estimation to identify a preferred, sample-scale vorticity axis. The results of our bulk analysis match the vorticity axis inferred in previous studies of rocks deformed in the same shear zones.",

            "abstract": "Today the availability of information on the internet makes online catalogs very easy to access by both scholars and the public in general. The catalog in the \"Significant Earthquake Database\", managed by the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI formerly NCDC), NOAA, allows access by deploying tabular and cartographic data related to earthquakes and tsunamis contained in the database.\nThe NCEI catalog is the product of compiling previously existing catalogs, historical sources, newspapers, and scientific articles. Because NCEI catalog has a global coverage the information is not homogeneous. Existence of historical information depends on the presence of people in places where the disaster occurred, and that the permanence of the description is preserved in documents and oral tradition. In the case of instrumental data, their availability depends on the distribution and quality of seismic stations. Therefore, the availability of information for the first half of 20th century can be improved by careful analysis of the available information and by searching and resolving inconsistencies.\nThis study shows the advances we made in upgrading and refining data for the earthquake and tsunami catalog of Mexico since 1500 CE until today, presented in the format of table and map. Data analysis allowed us to identify the following sources of error in the location of the epicenters in existing catalogs:\n• Incorrect coordinate entry\n• Place name erroneous or mistaken\n• Too general data that makes difficult to locate the epicenter, mainly for older earthquakes\n• Inconsistency of earthquakes and the tsunami occurrence: earthquake's epicenter located too far inland reported as tsunamigenic.\nThe process of completing the catalogs directly depends on the availability of information; as new archives are opened for inspection, there are more opportunities to complete the history of large earthquakes and tsunamis in Mexico. Here, we also present new earthquake and tsunami findings that, so far, we have achieved.",

            "abstract": "The Critical Zone (CZ) is Earth’s breathing skin: the thin layer from treetop to bedrock that supports most terrestrial life. Key hydrological, biogeochemical, and physical processes occur in the CZ, including physical and chemical weathering, soil production, erosion, nutrient cycling, and surface/groundwater exchange. These processes in turn influence subsurface water storage capacity, landscape evolution, ecological stability, aquifer recharge and stream flow. Because the deep CZ is hidden from direct observation, it can only be studied by drilling and/or geophysical measurements. Given the relative scarcity of such data, we lack a complete understanding of the architecture of the CZ, how it varies across landscapes, and what controls that variation.\nWe present geophysical data that address these questions at six Critical Zone Observatories (CZO): Calhoun, Boulder Creek, Eel River, Reynolds Creek, Catalina-Jemez, and Southern Sierra. Conclusions include: (1) Regolith depth is influenced by the opening of fractures due to the release of regional and topographic stress as rocks are exhumed toward the surface. Stress models at Calhoun and Boulder Creek show remarkable agreement with seismic velocities in the shallow subsurface, suggesting that stress release controls the development of fracture porosity in the CZ. (2) Chemical weathering (plagioclase dissolution) begins at depths where fractures open (~40 m at Calhoun), implying that fracturing and chemical weathering are intimately paired in the deep CZ. (3) Volumetric strain is an underappreciated contributor to porosity in the CZ. In the Southern Sierra, strain dominates over chemical weathering in the upper 10 m, consistent with the stress-release model. (4) Geological structure and lithology can trump environmental controls (e.g., aspect and climate) on regolith development. At Catalina, strongly contrasting regolith thickness on north- and south-facing slopes, is not due to “northness”, but rather to foliation in the schist bedrock, which dips into the south-facing slope, creating permeable pathways for water infiltration. Lithology, especially differences in initial porosity, strongly influences regolith thickness at Reynolds Creek, where regolith is thicker in basalt flows than in granite.",

            "abstract": "Ambient noise correlation method has been widely used to extract surface waves and tomography. The extraction of body waves has been very limited, but recent reports have suggested promises for deep incident waves. Here we report our first observations of triplicated PKP phases and confirm observations of other body-wave core phases from noise correlations. We use dense seismic arrays in South America and China Regional Seismic Networks at distances from 145° to the antipode. We can clearly observe different PKP branches (df, bc, and ab) in stacks of the station-station correlations. Both ambient noise and earthquake coda contribute to PKP phases. However, the contributions vary with frequency and with body-wave phases. At shorter periods (5-20 s), three branches of PKP (df, bc, and ab) can be extracted from ambient noise and the ab phase from earthquake coda. At longer periods (15-50 s), earthquake coda are effective in generating the df branch, but not the ab branch. The generation of the PKIKP phase (df branch) from earthquake coda does not depend on earthquake focal mechanisms or focal depths. However, earthquakes far from the stations contribute more than events closer by. The best coda window is around 10000~40000 s and the best magnitude threshold is Mw >=6.8 or 6.9. The observation of triplicated PKP branches from noise provides a new type of data for studying the Earth’s deep interior, in particularly the inner core anisotropy, which overs some of the limitations of traditional earthquake-based studies (such as limited source distributions and source errors).",

In the third phase proposed here (GSWP3), an extensive set of quantities for hydro-energy-eco systems will be produced to investigate their long-term (1901-2010) changes. The energy-water-carbon cycles and their interactions are also examined subcomponent-wise with appropriate model verifications in ensemble land simulations. In this study, the preliminary results and problems found from the first round analysis of the GSWP3 pilot study are shown. Also, it is discussed how the global offline simulation activity contributes to wider communities and a bigger scope such as Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6).",

            "abstract": "A 240 m-thick Quaternary sediment sequence in Whataroa Valley was much thicker than predicted before drilling. DFDP-2A and DFDP-2B were mostly drilled through the sequence by dual-rotary method using air or water circulation, returning cuttings bagged at 1 or 2 m sample intervals. Some sorting/bias and contamination occurred. Core was retrieved in DFDP-2A from 125-160 m, with highly variable recovery (0-100%) and mixed preservation/quality. The sequence is interpreted to comprise: fluvial-glacial gravels (0-58 m); grading downward into sandy lake delta sediments (59-77 m); overlying a monotonous sequence of lake mud and silts, with rare pebble-cobble diamictite (77-206 m); with a basal unit (206-240 m) containing coarse cobbles and boulders that may represent a distinct till/diamictite. Evidence has yet to be found for any marine influence in lowermost sediments, despite deposition at least 120 m below present day sea level, and potentially 200 m bsl if uplift has occurred on the Alpine Fault. When corrected for uplift the lacustrine sequence broadly correlates to those in present Lakes Rotokina and Wahapo, suggesting a substantial (~100 km2) pro-glacial lake once covered the area. Radiocarbon dating of plant fragments indicate 70 m of upper lacustrine and deltaic sediments (129-59 m) were deposited rapidly between 16350-15800 Cal BP. Overlying alluvial gravels are much younger (<1 ka), but potentially also involved pulses of rapid aggradation. The sequence provides a record of sedimentation on the Alpine Fault hanging wall following late-glacial ice retreat up Whataroa Valley, with uplift and erosion followed by Holocene alluvial gravel deposition. Future work will address: (1) the nature and history of sedimentation, including the lithology and origin of sediments; (2) what, if any, geological record of tectonics (movement) or Alpine Fault earthquakes (shaking) the sediments contain.",

The ZFT shows total annealing age of ca.1-3 Ma on the hanging wall and partial annealing ages on the foot wall. The seismicity data indicates the MOSF is still active from central to southern central Range.\nWe consider that the MOSF is related with crustal channel flow in depth. To the western side of crustal flow it shows thrusting mechanism associated with MOSF and the normal faults (or normal shearing zone) develop in eastern side of the crustal channel flow.

            "abstract": "Bridging the gap between research-based experiments and fully operational products has been likened to crossing the valley of death. In this talk, we document the development of pre-season fire potential outlooks, informed by seasonal climate predictions, through a long-term collaboration between NOAA RISA teams, the Program for Climate, Ecosystem and Fire Applications (Desert Research Institute), the National Interagency Fire Center’s Predictive Services program and multiple collaborators. To transition experimental outlooks into a sustained, monthly operational product, we co-developed a temporary institution, the National Seasonal Assessment Workshops, as a platform for cross-disciplinary knowledge exchange, training, and experimentation in consensus forecast processes and product development. In our retrospective evaluation of the process, we identified several factors that supported the transition from research to operations. These include: the development of new institutions; focus on a geographic scale commensurate with the needs of federal and state land management agencies; participatory and deliberative engagements; cooperation by many partners with perspectives on the connections between climate and wildland fire management; and iterative engagement sustained by funding and human resource commitments from the key partners. Through co-production of the outlooks and the institution, we created a cross-disciplinary community of practice, thus, increasing the capacity of fire management practitioners to use climate information in decision making. This experiment in developing a collaborative climate service was not an unqualified success. For example, while practitioners almost always *consult* official probabilistic climate forecasts, based on the output from dynamical and statistical models, they sometimes *act* on information from self-constructed forecasts, based on analysis of analogue years. We recommend research to further examine the distribution and use of the outlooks, further dialogue with practitioners, and research to develop forecast evaluation metrics and practices to improve the use of official forecasts.

            "abstract": "This study incorporates uncertainty analysis into a model of the performance of stormwater best management practices (BMPs) to characterize the uncertainty in stormwater BMP effluent load that results from uncertainty in the BMP performance modeling in an urban stormwater system. Detention basins are used as BMPs in the urban stormwater systems, and the total suspended solids (TSS) are used as an urban nonpoint source pollutant in Los Angeles, CA. The k-C* model, which incorporates uncertainty analysis, is applied to the uncertainty of the stormwater effluent concentration in urban stormwater systems. This study presents a frequency analysis of the runoff volume and BMP overflows to characterize the uncertainty of BMP effluent loads, and the load frequency curve (LFC) is simulated with and without BMP conditions and verified using the observed TSS load. Finally, the effects of imperviousness, BMP volume, and BMP surface area are investigated using a reliability analysis. The results of this study can be used to determine the appropriate BMP size to achieve a specific watershed runoff pollutant load. The result of this evaluation method can support the adequate sizing of a BMP to meet the defined nonpoint source pollutant regulations.\nAcknowlegments\nThis research was supported by a grant (14AWMP-B082564-01) from Advanced Water Management Research Program funded by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korean government.",

Thus, in this work we present a framework that can be used to create direct and global irradiance forecasts for intra-hour, intra-day and days-ahead in real time.\nThe methodology presented uses ground telemetry, local sky images (if available), satellite images and the output of numerical weather predictions (NWP) models. Given that ground telemetry must be available and satellite images and NWP data are freely available for the entire US territory this methodology can be applied to any location of interest.\nFurthermore, the proposed methodology uses different figures of metric depending on the forecast horizon. For instance, in the intra-hour time scale the goal is to predict large ramps in irradiance and not bulk error metrics such as the RMSE or MAE.\nThis methodology is applied to locations in California with varying climates in order to assess its performance.",

            "abstract": "Nucleation rate strongly affects the texture of an igneous rock, controlling the number of crystals present, and influencing crystal growth rate and morphology. In experimental petrology, homogenization of a starting material is typically achieved by heating the material above its liquidus temperature (superheating). A common assertion is that melt structure relaxes so rapidly that the degree and duration of superheating are inconsequential to subsequent nucleation and growth of minerals. We investigated this hypothesis, exploring melt structural changes via their effects on the nucleation and growth of olivine in a silica-undersaturated melt composition.\nA rejuvenation-stage Hawaiian olivine melilitite with olivine on the liquidus was used as a starting material to eliminate homogenization problems associated with synthesizing melts from reagent mixtures. Dynamic crystallization experiments were conducted in a 1 atm gas-mixing furnace at moderately reducing conditions following thermal treatments of 0, 3, and 12 hours at temperatures of -5, +10, +25, +50, and +100 °C relative to the experimentally determined liquidus temperature (1395 °C). All cooling experiments were performed at constant rate (25°C/hr), and were rapidly quenched 200°C below the liquidus.\nOlivine morphologies were characterized by quantifying the ratio of the crystal perimeter to surface area; the ratio increases as crystals become more anhedral. We found that the ratio is correlated with experimental superheat degree and duration, a result that is not consistent with a uniform nucleation response to subliquidus cooling. We infer that superheating produces a delay in olivine nucleation that causes crystal growth to proceed rapidly and produce skeletal morphologies. A delay in nucleation is a potential consequence of the temperature-dependence of melt structure, and suggests inability of the melt to relax on the experimental time scale.",

            "abstract": "Horizontal flow recirculation is often observed in sharp river bends, causing a complex three-dimensional flow structure with large implications for the morphological and planimetric development of meanders. Several field observations in small scale systems show that sharp bends are often found in association with a strong increase in cross-sectional area, the deposition of outer bank benches and reattachment bars near the inner bank. Recent studies show that these bends can also occur in large scale systems. In this study, we present field measurements of a sharp bend in the Mahakam River, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The cross-sectional area increases by a factor of three compared with the reach averaged cross-sectional area. Along a river reach of about 150 km, cross-sectional area correlates strongly with curvature. The field measurements are analyzed together with the results from numerical simulation with a 3D finite element model, which yields a comprehensive view of the intricate flow structure. In turn, the model is used to validate a new equation that captures the water surface topography dependence on cross-sectional area variation and curvature. The results show the importance of the increase in cross-sectional area in the development of horizontal recirculation. Vertical acceleration of the flow into the scour causes the pressure to deviate from a hydrostatic pressure distribution. Strong downflow (up to 12 cm/s) advects longitudinal momentum towards the bed, causing the flow to concentrate in the lower part of the cross-section. This increases the velocity magnitude throughout the cross-section, which is expected to maintain the large scour depth found in several bends along the Mahakam River.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning significantly impacts atmospheric composition, as well as regional and global climate. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal trends in fire characteristics in several major fire regions using combustion signatures observed from space. Our main goals is to identify key relationships between the trends in co-emitted constituents across these regions, as well as linkages to main drivers of change such as meteorology, fire practice, development patterns, and ecosystem feedbacks. Our approach begins with a multi-species analysis of trends in the observed abundance of CO, NO2, and aerosols over these regions and across the time period 2005 to 2014. We use MOPITT multi-spectral CO, OMI tropospheric NO2 column, MODIS AOD, and MODIS FRP retrievals. The long records from these retrievals provide a unique opportunity to study atmospheric composition across the most recent decade. While several studies in the past have reported trends over these regions, most of these studies have focused on a particular constituent. A unique aspect of this work involves understanding co-variations in co-emitted constituents to provide a more comprehensive look at fire characteristics, which are yet to be fully understood. Here, we introduce a derived quantity (called smoke index) to represent bulk fire characteristics (e.g., flaming versus smoldering). The smoke index is calculated as the ratio of the geometric mean of CO and AOD fire enhancements to that of NO2 fire enhancements. Our initial results, which focused on the Amazon region, show that: 1) deforestation fires are dominantly flaming fires while non-deforestation fires are more likely to be dominantly smoldering fires; and 2) droughts have larger influence on non-deforestation (possibly understorey) fires than deforestation fires. Here, we will present an extension of this analysis to other fire regions around the globe (tropical, temperate and boreal fires) and explore other measurements available during this period for comparisons. We will also compare with current fire emission models, such as GFED and FINN, to test the robustness of our findings. We note that this exploratory work provides a unique perspective of fire characteristics that will be useful to improve predictive capability of fire emission and atmospheric models.",

            "abstract": "The long-term slow slip event (LSSE) in the Tokai area, central Japan, had continued five years from mid-2000 to mid-2005 [Suito and Ozawa (2009)]. LSSEs detected along many subduction zones and were considered to have some relationship between the released moments and their durations [e.g. Schwartz and Rokosky (2007)]. The duration of the Tokai LSSE in the first half of 2000s, expressed 'the latest event' hereafter, is very long and it is interesting to find an answer whether the latest event in the Tokai area is anomalous or not. In order to reveal this question, I analyzed a leveling data from 1981 to 1999 -- before the era of GNSS -- and the length change data between 1974 and 1992.\nThe deduced rates show two sorts of spatial patterns and the patterns appear alternately. One of them resembles the pattern during the latest event. Summing up the results and accounting for the estimation errors, it is clear that there are at least three events in the last thirty years; 2000-2005 (already and well known event), 1987-1990, and around 1983. The 2000-2005 event is the biggest and longest one, while 1983 event is the smallest and shortest one in the three events. It suggests that the duration of the event is longer, the interval to the next event becomes longer, and that there are some relationships between the size, duration time, and the recurrence interval of the events.\nThe second event, from 1987 to 1990, made clearer signal in the leveling data than the the first one made. I examined a forward modeling for the second event, assuming uniform slip on a rectangular fault that located the same place as the latest SSE occurred on. The results of the modeling show that the amount of the slip during the second event was around 5 to 15 mm/yr and the corresponding released moment is about Mw 6.6, which was smaller than the latest SSE done. It suggests that the duration of LSSEs in the Tokai Area is longer than that was expected from the relationship between the released moment and the duration for the LSSEs in the other area.",

Ground shaking due to local and regional earthquakes presents a potential hazard to Bangladesh, one of the most populated areas in the world. In order to constrain this hazard, we first investigate potential seismic sources (active faults), and second we analyze the material through which seismic energy propagates. To address potential earthquake sources, we focus on the Comilla Anticline, which is the frontal-most exposed structure of the CMFB as well as the most proximal to the capital city of Dhaka. We present several industry-acquired and depth-converted seismic reflection profiles, which exhibit an asymmetric detachment fold rising from a relatively deep décollement (5-6 km). Because there is no strong evidence for an associated emergent thrust, this actively growing fold may have low seismic potential. We place this work into a regional context by integrating previous research of CMFB structures to create a regional structural model, which reveals laterally varying wedge geometry. To address ground shaking, the second component of this work, we assess stacking velocities from our seismic reflection data in conjunction with sonic log velocities from several locations in Bangladesh. These data show varying velocity versus depth trends by region. Following similar, data-rich studies performed in the Los Angeles and adjacent basins, we use data and theory-driven fitting techniques to analyze depth-velocity trends for these different regions, and interpolate to create a laterally varying regional seismic velocity model. Velocities generally slow from east to west, consistent with the younging trend as we move from older, exhumed CMFB formations to recent and undeformed deposits.",

The hot-pressed specimens are wrapped in a thin layer of Nickel foil and sealed in 9mm long Platinum jackets along with overlying alumina pistons. Fitting of our preliminary data indicates that the deformation occurred in the dislocation creep regime with a stress exponent of ~3.3 and an activation energy of ~512 kJ/mol. Comparison of our results to previous studies indicates that K-feldspar is stronger than granulite but weaker than eclogite and dry olivine aggregates.

            "abstract": "Most groundwater supply bores in Australia do not have flow metering equipment and so regional groundwater abstraction rates are not well known. Past estimates of unmetered abstraction for regional numerical groundwater modelling typically have not attempted to quantify the uncertainty inherent in the estimation process in detail. In particular, the spatial properties of errors in the estimates are almost always neglected. Here, we apply Bayesian spatial models to estimate these abstractions at a regional scale, using the state-of-the-art computationally inexpensive approaches of integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE). We examine a case study in the Condamine Alluvium aquifer in southern Queensland, Australia; even in this comparatively data-rich area with extensive groundwater abstraction for agricultural irrigation, approximately 80% of bores do not have reliable metered flow records. Additionally, the metering data in this area are characterised by complicated statistical features, such as zero-valued observations, non-normality, and non-stationarity. While this precludes the use of many classical spatial estimation techniques, such as kriging, our model (using the R-INLA package) is able to accommodate these features. We use a joint model to predict both probability and magnitude of abstraction from bores in space and time, and examine the effect of a range of high-resolution gridded meteorological covariates upon the predictive ability of the model. Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) scores are used to assess a range of potential models, which reward good model fit while penalising excessive model complexity. We conclude that maximum air temperature (as a reasonably effective surrogate for evapotranspiration) is the most significant single predictor of abstraction rate; and that a significant spatial effect exists (represented by the SPDE approximation of a Gaussian random field with a Matérn covariance function). Our final model adopts air temperature, solar exposure, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as covariates, shows good agreement with previous estimates at a regional scale, and additionally offers rigorous quantification of uncertainty in the estimate.",

The major tectonic events as the formation of oceanic plateaus and microplates during the period occurred in the vicinity of the triple junctions [e.g., Nakanishi and Winterer, 1998; Nakanishi et al., 1999], implying that the study of the triple junctions is indispensable for understanding the tectonic evolution of the Pacific plate.\nPrevious studies indicate instability of the configuration of the triple junctions from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (155-125 Ma). On the other hand, the age of the birth of the Pacific plate was determined assuming that all triple junctions had kept their configurations for about 30 m.y. [Nakanishi et al., 1992] because of insufficient information of the tectonic history of the Pacific plate before Late Jurassic.\nIncrease in the bathymetric and geomagnetic data over the past two decades enables us to reveal the tectonic evolution of the Pacific-Izanagi-Farallon triple junction before Late Jurassic. Our detailed identication of magnetic anomaly lineations exposes magnetic bights before anomaly M25. We found the curved abyssal hills originated near the triple junction, which trend is parallel to magnetic anomaly lineations. These results imply that the configuration of the Pacific-Izanagi-Farallon triple junction had been RRR before Late Jurassic.",

            "abstract": "The Digital Crust EarthCube Building block is addressing the issue of multiple, heterogeneous but related datasets characteristic of field and sample based research using a ‘loose-schema’ approach, with linked entity and attribute definitions in an information model (ontology) registry (IMR). Various data entities (RDA ‘data types’) are defined by mapping entity and attribute definitions to definitions in the IMR. Inclusion (loading) of new data at the simplest level can bring in entities that are not registered, but these will not be ‘integratable’ with other data until someone does the schema matching into the IMR. New datasets can be designed using registered entity and attributes that will from the beginning be integrated into the system (similar to the approach used by the National Information Exchange Model). The fundamental abstract components in this system are 1) a data repository that allows storage of key-value structured data objects; and 2) a registry that documents information models-- the base data types, attributes and entities -- and mappings from the registered types in the datastore to the registered items. This constitutes the data repository subsystem. Data access is enabled by caching views of aggregated data from the datastore (aggregated based on the semantics of the registered items in the IMR) and creating indexes based on the registered items in the IMR. Contributing data to this system will be greatly facilitated by using existing, documented information models. It can accept datasets that are not ‘standardized’ as well, but the consequence is that those data will not be integratable with other existing data until the work is done to document the entities and attributes in the data and to map those into existing registered types.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of fire on the chemistry and flux of precipitation diverted to the forest floor as stemflow and throughfall by observing the impact of the June 2013 Thompson Ridge wildfire in the Jemez River Basin of New Mexico. The loss of canopy cover from wildfire drastically modifies landscapes and alters ecosystems as high intensity burns replace canopies with charred branches and trunks, change soil composition and erosion processes, and affect hydrologic flow paths and water chemistry. In order to track these changes throughfall and stemflow collectors were installed beneath burned and unburned canopies in two catchments impacted by the Thompson Ridge fire. Throughfall, stemflow, and open precipitation samples were analyzed for major cations, anions, organic matter, trace metals, and rare earth elements to determine how fire affects the chemical composition of the precipitation that interacts with burned canopies.\nPrecipitation samples collected from both burned and unburned sites during the 2014 summer monsoon season show variations across burn severity, specifically in calcium and strontium concentrations, and collector type with stemflow concentrations generally higher than throughfall and open precipitation concentrations. Precipitation samples collected from burned sites have distinct rare earth element concentrations, positive europium anomalies, and titanium/zirconium ratios as compared to those of unburned sites. Aqueous extracts of ash and charred bark were also analyzed to determine the origin of these signatures. A stem count model was used to determine tree density for individual plots and catchments from orthophotos taken before and after the 2013 fire. Upscaling these plot scale concentrations and fluxes to catchment scale allows this study to represent changes to an entire catchment and quantify effects of wildfire on chemical load and water chemistry.",

This region, previously examined by the THEMIS spacecraft, has shown evidence of bursty, high velocity, Earthward particle flows, turbulent magnetic fields, and large amplitude electric field signatures (amplitudes can, at times, exceed 100 mV/m). Kinetic features such as double layers, electron phase-space holes, and magnetic holes have been observed frequently throughout this region. The Magnetospheric Multi-scale (MMS) spacecraft, launched March 2015, are currently orbiting the Earth with the objective of observing the microphysics of magnetic reconnection. During its commissioning phase (March 2015 – August 2015), all four spacecraft apogees were primarily in the BBF Braking region. The presence of MMS in this region can offer higher spatial and temporal resolution of the BBF Braking region than ever before. We examine MMS observations kinetic structures (double layers, electron phase-space and magnetic holes) to further characterize the BBF braking region and its overall effects on the Earth space environment.",

            "abstract": "We have employed an optical Fiber DTS (distributed temperature sensing; N4386B by AP Sensing) system at a taiga site in Interior Alaska in order to monitor the surface and subsurface thermal regime continuously in space and time. The optic fiber cable sensor (multi-mode, GI50/125，dual core; 3.4 mm) of 2.7 km was installed on or below surface, measuring temperature at the half-meter resolution and half-hour interval. The site is in Poker Flat Research Range of the University of Alaska Fairbanks (N 65˚08’, W 147˚26’, 491 m a.s.l), underlain by permafrost. Dominant vegetation is black spruce. Within the area in which the cable was installed, density of spruce trees varies, ranging from open area with mosses to shrubby open forest to closed forest. Measurement was done for two years (from October, 2012 to October, 2014).\nWhen incident photons of a laser pulse is scattered by molecules of optical fiber (SiO2), a certain amount is back scattered at different frequencies (Stokes and Anti-Stokes peaks). The system detects the intensity ratio of the two peaks of this Raman scattering, which depends on the temperature of the molecules. The distance of the molecules is determines by the time it takes to travel (optical time domain reflectmetry; OTDR).\nAbout 2.0 km of the entire cable sensor lies on the surface to measure horizontal variations of surface temperatures. The diurnal and seasonal components of the variations were analyzed to illustrate their relationship with the overlying canopy characteristics. Cable is also coiled around a PVC tube (outer radius of 4 inch = 10.2 cm) for 120 cm, which is half buried to the ground to measure surface (or snow, when snow-covered) and subsurface temperatures with finer vertical resolution. Five of such tubes were installed in different land cover areas (open and closed forest, shrubs, open area, and relict thermokarst). We will also discuss challenges we encountered during installations and operations.",

            "abstract": "We describe the implementation of a new fast imaging technique to invert very low frequency (VLF) data measured on profiles into corresponding apparent current density systems over the 2D earth. First, a formulation has been derived to compute the vertical component of the magnetic field for a given 2D current density distribution in the Earth’s subsurface. Since the vertical component of the magnetic field is proportional to the real anomaly of VLF electromagnetic measurement, the derived formulation has been used for imaging subsurface structures. The 2D inversion code incorporating the preconditioned conjugate gradient approach was developed for imaging of the subsurface conductors using the real VLF anomaly in terms of apparent current density distribution in the subsurface. The preconditioner determined by the distances between the cells and the observation points greatly improved the quality of the very low frequency imaging. Finally, we tested our method using synthetic and real data and all tests returned favorable results. The presented formulation were also compared with other imaging techniques in terms of apparent current density and resistivity distribution using a standard numerical forward modeling and inversion technique. The presented imaging technique shows improvement with respect to the filtering approaches in depicting subsurface conductors. Further, results obtained using the presented approach is closer to the results of rigorous resistivity inversion.",

Detailed analysis of satellite data, MODIS, AIRS and OMI AURA have been carried out to study aerosol and meteorological parameters near the source of biomass burning and also at far region. During crop burning period, pronounced changes in the aerosol and meteorological parameters are observed at different pressure levels. The emissions from the crop burning are spread in the Indo-Gangetic plains from west-east, over the Himalayan region and over the central parts of India depending upon the wind direction and wind speed. The air quality changes anomalously affecting the visibility and aerosol parameters.

The notion of strange floods is based on the assumption that there are flood agents that dominate the upper tail of flood distributions for a region (severe thunderstorms in complex terrain in the case of the Heppner flood) and are exceedingly poorly characterized by conventional flood records. The orographic thunderstorm systems in the central Appalachians that dominate envelope curves of flood peaks in the eastern US for basin areas less than 1,000 sq. km. and control portions of the global envelope curve of rainfall accumulations at time scales shorter than 6 hours) provide a well-documented example of strange floods. Despite extensive evidence of their occurrence, principally from field-based case studies, they are poorly represented in conventional USGS flood records. We develop methods for examining strange floods based on analyses of the complete record of USGS annual peak observations and on hydrometeorological analyses of the most extreme floods in the US flood record. The methods we present are grounded in extreme value theory and designed to enhance our understanding of extreme floods and improve methods for estimating extreme flood magnitudes.",

Soil carbon dynamics and associated nutrient dynamics play significant roles in regulating global carbon cycle and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Our capability to predict future climate change depends to a large extent on a well-constrained representation of soil carbon dynamics in ESMs. Here we evaluate two decomposition schemes - converging trophic cascade (CTC) and Century - in CLM4.5/ACME V0 using data from the long-term intersite decomposition experiment team (LIDET), radiocarbon (14C) observations, and Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD). For the evaluation against LIDET, We exercise the full CLM4.5/ ACME V0 land model, including seasonal variability in nitrogen limitation and environmental scalars (temperature, moisture, O2), in order to represent LIDET experiment in a realistic way. We show that the proper design of model experiments is crucial to model evaluation using data from field experiments such as LIDET. We also use 14C profile data at 10 sites to evaluate the performance of CTC and CENTURY decomposition scheme. We find that the 14C profiles at these sites are most sensitive to the depth dependent decomposition parameters, consistent with previous studies.",

            "abstract": "We present the zircon-apatite U–Pb ages and zircon Hf isotope composition of the granite batholith exposed at the western boundary of Chihuahua. Granidiorite samples were analyzed from both, north and south of the Rio El Fuerte and Sinforosa Lineament. Based on previous studies, the WWN-EES trending Sinforosa Lineament is proposed as the manifestation of a terrane boundary between Seri in the north and Tahue terrane in the south. Zircon U–Pb data indicate that the magmatism spans a time period of 36 Ma from 89 to 53 Ma to the north of the Sinforosa Lineament while granodiorites in the south of the Sinforosa Lineament are dated at 59 Ma. The U–Pb apatite ages are variable in the north of the Sinforosa Lineament and range from 86–51 Ma. These apatite dates are 1–28 Ma younger than the corresponding zircon U-Pb crystallization ages. This indicates variable cooling rates and moderate to shallow emplacement. In contrast, in the south of the Sinforosa Lineament, the U–Pb apatite ages (64–59 Ma) are indistinguishable from the zircon U–Pb age (59 Ma), indicating rapid cooling and shallow emplacement. Zircon morphology and U-Pb dating revealed the absence of inherited component in the zircon ages, as no inheritance of any age has been observed. Most of the northwestern Mexico is underlain by Precambrian-Paleozoic-Jurassic basement. However, in the study area, U–Pb dating does not support the involvement of the older basement in generating the granite magmas. The weighted mean initial εHf (t) isotope composition of granodiorites on both sides of the Sinforosa Lineament varies from +2 to +5. However, Hf isotope composition in the south of the Sinforosa Lineament is more heterogeneous and relatively evolved with weighted Mean εHf (t) = +1.45. The Hf isotope composition is consistent with the previously reported near bulk silicate Sr-Nd isotope values. We suggest that the magmatic rocks in this region are not derived from melting of a felsic older crust beneath the batholith. Instead, the magmatism is related to the mildly radiogenic arc system in the northwestern Mexico. However, partial melting of sub continental mantle wedge cannot be ruled out. The difference in U–Pb ages and initial Hf isotope composition implies that the Sinforosa Lineament might be a refined boundary between the Seri and Tahue Terranes.",

In this study, we present a detailed analysis of a 300-km-long supersegment of the AAR to quantify the spatial variations in ridge morphology and axial and off-axis volcanisms as constrained by high-resolution shipboard bathymetry and gravity. The ridge axis morphology alternates between rift valleys and axial highs within relatively short ridge segments. To obtain a geological proxy for regional variations in magma supply, we calculated residual mantle Bouguer gravity anomalies (RMBA), gravity-derived crustal thickness, and residual topography for neighboring seven sub-segments. The results of the analyses revealed that the southern flank of the AAR is associated with shallower seafloor, more negative RMBA, thicker crust, and/or less dense mantle in comparison to the conjugate northern flank. Furthermore, this north-south asymmetry becomes more prominent toward the KR1 supersegment of the AAR. The axial topography of the KR1 supersegment exhibits a sharp transition from axial highs at the western end to rift valleys at the eastern end, with regions of axial highs being associated with more robust magma supply as indicated by more negative RMBA. We also compare and contrast the characteristics of the AAR supersegment with that of other ridges of intermediate spreading rates, including the Juan de Fuca Ridge, Galápagos Spreading Center, and Southeast Indian Ridge west of the Australian-Antarctic Discordance, to investigate the influence of ridge-hotspot interaction on ridge magma supply and tectonics.",

            "abstract": "The petrological importance of silicate garnet is derived from the presence of three distinct cation sites of varying size and coordination number. This allows for a wide range of trace, minor, and major element substitutions. However, a full and precise crystal-chemical understanding of the nature of transition metals in garnet is not at hand. Possible mechanisms of various charge-balanced substitutions (e.g. octahedral Ti4+ or tetrahedral Al3+) and the structural state of solid solutions (i.e. short- to long-range ordering) need study.\nWe report on ongoing efforts in these directions using 27Al and 29Si Magic-Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy. Early work on synthetic and natural Fe- and Mn-bearing pyrope- and grossular-rich garnets focused on the effect these paramagnetic transition metals have in measuring and interpreting NMR spectra. These results have been expanded with NMR measurements on synthetic pyrope-rich garnets containing other paramagnetic transition metals including Cr3+, V3+, Co2+, and Ni2+ as well as diamagnetic Ti4+. NMR peaks are severely broadened in the presence of even small concentrations of Cr3+, Mn2+, and Fe3+ leading to a loss of spectral resolution. On the other hand, the spectra of garnet containing V3+, Fe2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ have better resolution and show separate paramagnetically shifted NMR peaks. In some cases, crystal-chemical information can be obtained because of the large frequency separations between the NMR peaks that can be assigned to various local atomic configurations around Al and Si. Furthermore, the 27Al NMR spectrum of a synthetic pyrope garnet with about 2% diamagnetic Ti4+ on the octahedral site showed the absence of any tetrahedral Al3+, which rules out the substitution mechanism VITi + IVAl = VIAl + IVSi in the solid solution.\nOur NMR investigations on garnet are now being made at the exploratory level. We think that NMR spectra of diamagnetic garnet can provide information on a number of crystal-chemical properties. Spectra of garnet containing various paramagnetic transition elements can also, in some cases, give local structural information. With a better understanding of paramagnetic effects in NMR spectroscopy, this type of study can possibly be expanded to other geologically important paramagnetic minerals and phases.",

            "abstract": "The extent and morphology of bars in sinuous bedrock channels should be a function of the bedrock planform, and the size and flux of sediment. Difference in bar morphology should alter the extent of bare bedrock and the relative rates of lateral and vertical erosion. As part of a series of experiments to explore the interaction between sediment supply, bar morphology, and erosion of bedrock bed and banks, we conducted an experiment in a 6.2 m long flume with 4 low-amplitude bends. The water discharge and sediment supply in the ~30 cm wide flume were held constant 0.016 m3/s and 47 kg/hr, respectively. The uniform sediment had a median diameter of 4 mm. Bedrock and bar topography were measured using images taken from three cameras mounted on a movable cart processed using Photoscan and flow velocity was measured using an ADV. During the first 12 hours of the experiment, bars developed in the 3 downstream bends while the majority of the bed in the upstream-most bend was exposed. There was very little bedrock erosion during this period. The bar morphology, sediment flux, and water surface slope stabilized after 12 hours. The slope for the remainder of the experiment was 0.007 with an average flow depth of about 13 cm. The bars were 4-10 cm thick. Sediment covered about 79% of the channel bed area. Exposed bedrock surfaces occurred at each bend and extended from just downstream of the bend apex on the outside of the bend to just upstream of the apex of the inside of the next bend downstream. Except for at the very upstream end of the flume, transported sediment did not contact exposed bedrock, but rather transported along the alluviated portions of the bed. During this equilibrium phase (12-32.5 hours), we did not observe any lateral or vertical erosion in the flume, likely due to the small impact force of the relatively fine sediment. The next steps in these ongoing experiments is to run the same sediment at a lower sediment feed to compare the bar dimensions and extent of alluvial cover. We will then feed a coarser sediment sufficient to erode the bed at two distinct feed rates to observe the changes in bar morphology and erosion of the bed and banks as the sediment cover adjusts to the feed.",

            "abstract": "A coalescing array of fan lobes has been resolved in the central and western present-day Barents Sea from detailed seismic mapping of several progradational lobes above the Base Cretaceous Unconformity (BCU). The lobes developed over at least 200 000 km2, and form thicknesses constrained to be between 200 and 500 metres. Multiple influx points into the basin are suggested by the variable lobe orientation and position on the Barents platform.\nThe sediment volumes were in part affected by bathymetric variation on the palaeo-seafloor, but this is considered a secondary variable in comparison to the push from sediment transport mechanisms. Sediments were routed into and along troughs, or around highs in places such as the Hoop Graben, Fingerdjupet Sub-basin, and the Fedynsky High, respectively, showing a natural response to local variation in basin floor topography. Highs that existed during this development represent source areas for small sediment lobes that interfinger with the larger-scale lobes, but are considered orders of magnitude smaller than the strata sourced from extrabasinal terrains.\nThe source areas for the mappable strata in the central and western Barents Sea area must have been landmasses with considerable vertical thickness and/or areal extent. Acknowledged sediment sources, such as the Lomonosov Ridge is insufficient as a single source for these sediment volumes, and warrants the inference of a land mass which is hitherto unknown, but has been termed “Crocker Land” by other workers. The sediment influx rate from the northeast can be estimated by age comparison between the most proximal and the most distal sediment lobe, which in turn has bearings on the hinterland erosion rate.\nThe increasingly understood High Arctic Large Igneous Province (HALIP) is linked to the uplifting of a source area to the northwest of present day sink areas in Svalbard and the Barents Sea. Expressed as a number of subsurface sill intrusions and scattered extrusives, the HALIP indicates a spike in magmatic activity around the Barremian, which can explain the expansion and emergence of a source for time equivalent strata in the Boreal Basin and neighboring areas.",

            "abstract": "The lunar shape can inform us about the Moon’s early spin pole location, or history of true polar wander. This history is important for understanding the stability of polar ice deposits [1], and possible relationships between large-scale lunar features and the lunar orbit. Recently, Garrick-Bethell et al. [2] showed that when the effects of large basins are ignored, the Moon’s early spin pole could be inferred from a tidal-rotational deformation that froze-in when the Moon was closer to the Earth. They also showed that the lunar shape is consistent with early tidal heating in the crust during the magma ocean epoch [3]. Here we will present some updates to this work, and discuss how the lunar spin pole may have evolved in time, as inferred from the progressive formation of large basins and components of the degree-2 gravity field that are not associated with basins.\nSeparately, magnetic anomalies can address the problem of lunar polar wander, assuming the ancient dynamo that magnetized them was dominantly dipolar and aligned with the spin axis. However, recent surveys of magnetic anomalies reveal paleopole distributions that are quite complicated and inconsistent across different studies [4, 5]. Some reported paleopoles are consistent with the early spin pole inferred from the lunar shape [2], while others are not. These paleopoles imply either very large amounts of polar wander, or that the dynamo evolved with a complex field geometry. Some possible resolutions to these problems will be discussed, including secular variation of the magnetic field and difficulties with inversions for magnetic sources.\n",

            "abstract": "The majority of the space community believes that the magnetic reconnection, including the component reconnection, plays an important role in the energy and plasma transport in the space plasma. However, the component reconnection implies that, prior to the reconnection, there is a connection of two field lines with a non-zero magnetic field component, which violates the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field. Without the component reconnection, the antiparallel reconnection becomes an event that requires an exceptional condition of the ambient magnetic fields. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a theoretical model to explain the sudden change of the magnetic field configuration. For convenience, we shall call such a transient event the magnetic reconfiguration event. Our results indicate that, if the ambient field configuration can redirect the incoming ions and electrons into opposite directions, charge accumulation will take place and lead to the formation of field-aligned currents. The field-aligned currents can generate magnetic fields normal to the current sheet and lead to the formation of magnetic islands in one region and transient magnetic reconfigurations in the other region. The favorable conditions for the occurrence of the transient magnetic reconfigurations, including component magnetic reconfigurations, will also be discussed.",

An empirical equation and radiometric and reflective thresholds were derived to detect hot spots using the OLI data at band 5 (0.865 μm) and band 7 (2.200 μm) based on the increase in spectral radiance at shortwave infrared (SWIR) region due to the emission from objects with high surface temperature. We surveyed typical patterns of surface spectra using the ASTER spectral library to delineate a threshold to distinguish hot spots from background surfaces. To adjust the empirical coefficients of our detection algorithm, we visually inspected the detected hot spots using 6593 Landsat 8 scenes, which cover eastern part of East Asia, taken from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, displayed on a dedicated Web GIS system. Eventually we determined threshold equations which can theoretically detect hot spots at temperatures above 230 °C over isothermal pixels and hot spots as small as 1 m2 at temperatures of 1000 °C as the lowest temperature and the smallest subpixel coverage, respectively, for daytime scenes. The algorithm detected hot spots including wildfires, volcanos, open burnings and factories. 30-m spatial resolution of Landsat 8 enabled to detect wild fires and open burnings accompanied by clearer shapes of fire front lines than MODIS and VIIRS fire products. Although the 16-day revisit cycle of Landsat 8 is too long to effectively find unexpected wildfire or outbreak of eruption, the revisit cycle is enough to monitor temporally stable heat sources, such as continually erupting volcanos and factories. False detection was found over building rooftops, which have relatively smooth surfaces at longer wavelengths, when specular reflection occurred at the satellite overpass.",

            "abstract": "Reliability of geostationary communication satellites (GEO ComSats) is critical to many industries worldwide. The space radiation environment poses a significant threat and manufacturers and operators expend considerable effort to maintain reliability for users. Knowledge of the space radiation environment at the orbital location of a satellite is of critical importance for diagnosing and resolving issues resulting from space weather, for optimizing cost and reliability, and for space situational awareness. For decades, operators and manufacturers have collected large amounts of telemetry from geostationary (GEO) communications satellites to monitor system health and performance, yet this data is rarely mined for scientific purposes. The goal of this work is to acquire and analyze archived data from commercial operators using new algorithms that can detect when a space weather (or non-space weather) event of interest has occurred or is in progress. We have developed algorithms, collectively called SEER (System Event Evaluation Routine), to statistically analyze power amplifier current and temperature telemetry by identifying deviations from nominal operations or other events and trends of interest.\nThis paper focuses on our work in progress, which currently includes methods for detection of jumps (“spikes”, outliers) and step changes (changes in the local mean) in the telemetry. We then examine available space weather data from the NOAA GOES and the NOAA-computed Kp index and sunspot numbers to see what role, if any, it might have played. By combining the results of the algorithm for many components, the spacecraft can be used as a “sensor” for the space radiation environment. Similar events occurring at one time across many component telemetry streams may be indicative of a space radiation event or system-wide health and safety concern. Using SEER on representative datasets of telemetry from Inmarsat and Intelsat, we find events that occur across all or many of telemetry files at certain dates. We compare these system-wide events to known space weather storms, such as the 2003 Halloween storms, and to spacecraft operational events, such as maneuvers. We also present future applications and expansions of SEER for robust space environment sensing and system health and safety monitoring.",

            "abstract": "J-RISQ (Japan Real-time Information System for earthquake) has been developing in NIED for appropriate first-actions to big earthquakes. When an earthquake occurs, seismic intensities (SI) are calculated first at each observation station and sent to the Data Management Center in different timing. The system begins the first estimation when the number of the stations observing the SI of 2.5 or larger exceeds the threshold amount. It estimates SI distribution, exposed population and earthquake damage on buildings by using basic data for estimation, such as subsurface amplification factors, population, and building information. It has been accumulated in J-SHIS (Japan Seismic Information Station) developed by NIED, a public portal for seismic hazard information across Japan. The series of the estimation is performed for each 250m square mesh and finally the estimated data is converted into information for each municipality. Since October 2013, we have opened estimated SI, exposed population etc. to the public through the website by making full use of maps and tables.\nIn the previous system, we sometimes could not inspect the information of the surrounding areas out of the range suffered from strong motions, or the details of the focusing areas, and could not confirm whether the present information was the latest or not without accessing the website. J-RISQ has been advanced by introducing the following functions to settle those problems and promote utilization in local areas or in personal levels. In addition, the website in English has been released.\n・It has become possible to focus on the specific areas and inspect enlarged information.\n・The estimated information can be downloaded in the form of KML.\n・The estimated information can be updated automatically and be provided as the latest one.\n・The newest information can be inspected by using RSS readers or browsers corresponding to RSS.\n・Exclusive pages for smartphones have been prepared.\nThe information estimated by the advanced J-RISQ has been open since June 2015. The system is planned to be enhanced by improving estimation methods of earthquake motions, or models of population distribution.\nThis research was partially supported by SIP (Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program) under the leadership of Cabinet Office, Government of Japan.",

            "abstract": "The current standard approach for static or quasi-static slip inversion with geodetic data is by discretizing a fault into a number of patches whose size is mostly smaller than their depth, thus a straightforward inversion usually leads to wild oscillations in slip. This is because forward elastic models that relate slip at depth to surface deformation contain an exponential upward continuation term [Steketee 1958], which makes this problem inherently non-unique [Parker 1994]. To stabilize the inversion, a smoothness regularization is usually applied along with a non-negative slip constraint (e.g. left lateral slip only) [Jonsson et al 2002]. Sometimes a checkerboard test is performed in order to understand the resolving power of the data [Tong et al 2010]. While this approach can provide us with one reasonable model, we would also like to establish the complete set of models that is equally consistent with the data and assumptions. Here we investigate the possibility of applying linear inverse theory [Parker 1977] to slip inversion, in particular, the spectral expansion approach. This approach inverts for slip as a linear combination of orthonormal functions that span the model space. More important the spectral expansion approach isolates the parts of the model that are well determined by the data from those that are not. Based on the upward continuation nature of this problem, it is almost certain the part with lowest order or largest wavelength (i.e. seismic moment) is well determined. We plan to apply this approach to the recent Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake with ScanSAR acquisitions from ALOS-2 [Lindsey et al 2015] to investigate the distribution of the slip. The results will be reported at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "L’Aquila, with 6 scientists convicted of manslaughter, shocked the scientific community, leading to urgent re-appraisal of communication methods for low-probability, high-impact events. Before the trial, a commission investigating the earthquake recommended risk assessment be formalised via operational earthquake forecasts and that social scientists be enlisted to assist in developing communication strategies. Psychological research has identified numerous decision biases relevant to this, including hindsight bias, where people (after the fact) overestimate an event’s predictability. This affects experts as well as naïve participants as it relates to their ability to construct a plausible causal story rather than the likelihood of the event. Another problem is availability, which causes overestimation of the likelihood of observed rare events due to their greater noteworthiness. This, however, is complicated by the ‘description-experience’ gap, whereby people underestimate probabilities for events they have not experienced. That is, people who have experienced strong earthquakes judge them more likely while those who have not judge them less likely – relative to actual probabilities. Finally, format changes alter people’s decisions. That is people treat '1 in 10,000' as different from 0.01% despite their mathematical equivalence. Such effects fall under the broad term framing, which describes how different framings of the same event alter decisions. In particular, people’s attitude to risk depends significantly on how scenarios are described. We examine the effect of biases on the communication of change in risk. South Australian participants gave responses to scenarios describing familiar (bushfire) or unfamiliar (earthquake) risks. While bushfires are rare in specific locations, significant fire events occur each year and are extensively covered. By comparison, our study location (Adelaide) last had a M5 quake in 1954. Preliminary results suggest the description-experience gap is central to problems in risk communication, implying that accurate communication of risks can not be achieved via better description alone as this will be outweighed by people’s extended, quake–free experience. Communication methods designed to account for this bias are discussed.",

However, it is not clear whether these waves are connected, whether they have photospheric counterparts, and how they get excited. Recently, through cross-correlating oscillation signals in sunspots' umbrae with those in penumbrae and the sunspots' vicinity observed by SDO/HMI, we identified a fast-moving wave propagating from the sunspots to their outside. It is interesting to see whether this type of the photospheric wave is related to those waves observed above the photosphere in the chromopshere and corona. In this work, we analyze a well-observed sunspot region, using SDO/HMI data for the photosphere, AIA 1600Å and 1700Å data for the lower chromosphere, BBSO/NST Hα data for the chromosphere, AIA 304Å data for the transition region, and AIA 171Å data for the lower corona. Our results show that the wave phenomena observed at different atmospheric heights using different spectrum lines are actually a same slow magnetoacoustic wave propagating upward, likely with a wave source located a few megameters below the sunspots’ surface.",

The project regroups 8 Belgian Institutes under a single research program of the Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO). The project involves three regional climate models: the ALARO model, the COSMO-CLM model and the MAR model running according to the guidelines of the CORDEX project and at convection permitting resolution on small domains over Belgium. The project creates a framework to address four objectives/challenges. First, this projects aims to contribute to the EURO-CORDEX project. Secondly, RCP simulations are executed at convection-permitting resolutions (3 to 5 km) on small domains. Thirdly, the output of the atmospheric models is used to drive land surface models (the SURFEX model and the Urbclim model) with urban modules, a crop model (REGCROP), a tides and storm model (COHERENS) and the MEGAN-MOHYCAN model that simulates the fluxes emitted by vegetation. Finally, one work package will translate the uncertainty present in the CORDEX database to the high-resolution output of the CORDEX.be project. The organization of the project will be presented and first results will be shown, demonstrating that convection-permitting models can add extra skill to the mesoscale version of the regional climate models, in particular regarding the extreme value statistics and the diurnal cycle.",

            "abstract": "California is in the midst of a severe drought with below average runoff since WY 2012. Within this context, many water resource managers are scrutinizing water supply reliability assumptions for planning studies. Severe droughts represent a relatively rare phenomenon, occurring only a handful of times within our limited 100-year period of watershed runoff records. Furthermore, droughts may have different runoff magnitudes and durations that inherently present a challenge for direct comparisons of one drought with another. We use the sequent peak algorithm as a drought severity index (SPADSI) that accounts for both drought magnitude and duration relative to an assumed minimum release policy and fixed level-of-development (LOD) demand modeling framework. The SPADSI allows direct, quantitative evaluation of different policy options for lessening drought severity where, for example, layering a customer rationing policy onto model results reduced the SPADSI for the historical 1976-77 drought from 520 to 450 thousand acre-feet (TAF) and 1987-92 drought from 650 to 415 TAF for 2015 LOD. A strong correlation (R2 = 0.96) between Mokelumne River watershed runoff and tree-ring hydroclimate reconstructions for neighboring American and Stanislaus watersheds from Meko et al. (2014) was the basis for an extended 1100-year historical reconstruction of Mokelumne Watershed annual runoff. The reconstructed runoff timeseries is used to investigate extended historical drought durations for the Mokelumne Watershed where shorter one- to three-year droughts are most probable durations (>90%) whereas longer duration droughts lasting as long as 10 years such as occurred in 1776-85 are also possible, though much less likely. Applying the SPADSI to the reconstructed runoff timeseries showed that recent droughts e.g. 1929-34, 1976-77, and 1987-92 are all relatively severe within this millennial context, falling on the distribution tail of the extended SPADSI dataset. These findings are consistent with Meko et al. (2014) in their analysis of other watersheds in the region. These findings and other insights from the reconstructed runoff timeseries along with the SPADSI provide valuable information for water resource managers evaluating water supply reliability assumptions for future drought planning efforts.",

            "abstract": "The major dynamics of the cusp and the dayside polar cap ionosphere result from the solar wind interactions with the dayside magnetopause. It is well documented that transient reconnection facilitates most of the energy extraction from the solar wind to the dayside magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Therefore the forcing of the cusp ionosphere is pulsed. The IMF By controlled east-west movement of poleward moving forms (PMAFs) separating from the cusp is consistent with the magnetic tension pull of newly opened flux, which is a key feature tying the auroral phenomenon of PMAFs to flux transfer events (FTEs) at the magnetopause. The central region of an FTE is a mesoscale flow channel, bounded by a pair of Birkeland current sheets on each flank. Combined ground-based and in-situ measurements of FTE dynamics above Svalbard have provided us new in-sights about reconnection type space weather effects in the F-region ionosphere related to FTE flow channel/precipitation events.

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT The main purpose of this study is to quantify the magnitude and rate of change of major land use/land cover types, and to identify the major drivers of change in SMNP using GIS and remote sensing. To address the pre-stated objective three landsat images of the periods between 1985, 2000 and 2015 with the time series of 15 (fifteen) years for the conceqative of 30 years land use land cover dynamics were classified and analyzed using Erdas Emagine 9.2 and ArcGIS 10 environments. The results depicted that a remarkable expansion was observed in forest cover followed by farmland and settlements between 1985 and 2015 by about 16% (22 ha/y) and 14.7% (21 ha/y) although some portions of their original extent were converted into other LUC classes. Expansion of forest cover was dominantly attributed to conversions of exposed rocks (1334.97 ha) and shrubs (1255.23 ha). These possibly attributed to conversion of some portions of exposed rocks and shrubs which were unsustainably utilized into protected areas by area closure and transformation of shrubs into forest cover. Similarly, farmlands and settlement has been expanded mainly due to area gains from grassland (984.51 ha) and forest cover (1037.25 ha). These largely associated with encroachment of farmlands and settlements into grasslands and original natural forest cover as a result of population pressure. The results also indicated that the reduction of areas under grassland, exposed volcanic rocks and shrubs by about 2.35% (5 ha/y), 18% (32 ha/y) and 11% (14 ha/y) evident because the added areas from other LUC classes could not compensate the losses, respectively. The major drivers identified in study area were civil war between 1984 and 1991 resulted in the agricultural exploitation, deforestation and illegal wildlife hunting, population pressure due to influx of settlers for the last decade. Finally revitalizing the nationally park is not only the duty of the government but also all the concerned individuals specially the communities around the park and different stock holders at different levels should be work in integrative and in synergism manner.\nKey Words: Dynamics, Land use, GIS, Remo sensing\n Email address of the authors: * gglove2000@gmail.com.",

In order to improve the IRO inversion, many methods were studied. One of them uses known ionosphere background to constrain the inversion of IRO, but it has not been used in the routine processing of observation data, due to that it is difficult to get the proper ionosphere background. Data assimilation can provide accurate electron density on the three dimensional grid, which may be used to constrain the IRO inversion and improve the inversion result. This article assimilates the TEC of ground GPS and IRO observation, and the constrains the IRO inversion.

The receiver is installed at Bandung (6.9 deg S, 107.6 deg E; 9.9 deg S mag. latitude), Indonesia. In this study, we grouped our analysis into two groups based on duration of observation, (1) July-December 2014 (monthly F10.7 ranged from 124.7-158.7) which is named autumn equinox and (2) January-June 2015 (monthly F10.7 ranged from 120.1-141.7) which is named spring equinox. Our preliminary results can be summarized as follows; (1) the intensity of scintillations at spring equinox is higher than at autumn equinox although solar activity at autumn equinox is higher than at spring equinox, see Figure 1 and (2) as shown in Figure 2, the directional distribution of scintillation occurrences at spring equinox mostly concentrate in the western sky, so we see east-west asymmetric, but the distribution at autumn equinox doesn't show clearly east-west asymmetric.\nPrevious studies have reported that occurrence rate of the scintillation at spring equinox season is higher than at autumn equinox. Our results suggest that equinoctial asymmetry of scintillation occurrence can be also as an asymmetric of scintillation intensity and east-west asymmetric of scintillation occurrence between spring and autumn equinox. In general, plasma bubble is tilted westward as it vertically develop due to vertical shear in the eastward plasma drift in F region, and consequently, it will be tilted westward as it extends in latitude. Scintillation intensity will be stronger when signal propagation tend to be parallel with structure of the plasma bubble. Figure 2 also imply that the latitudinal extension of plasma bubble is higher at spring equinox than at autumn equinox. More the bubble extends in latitude, more the bubble structure exists in the western sky of the receiver. Thus, at spring equinox, scintillation intensity and occurrence may be stronger and higher in the west because signal propagations from the western sky with respect to the receiver location could be parallel with the structure of plasma bubble. Further discussion for this finding will be discussed in this study.",

Such techniques are especially effective in engaging students from underrepresented groups. As a result of participation, many CASE fellows have reported increased skills in communication and teaching, as well as in time management. These skills may prove directly applicable to higher education when teaching undergraduate students.",

            "abstract": "For 15 years rare earth element (REE) partitioning between zircon and garnet has facilitated the coupling of U–Pb ages to metamorphism, particularly in the granulite facies. The combination of in situ analysis and rapid data acquisition, particularly through combined techniques such as laser ablation split stream (LASS), means that complex terranes can be interrogated with increasing detail. However this detail provided by large datasets must also be combined with an understanding of the processes involved, for example the relative mobility of the REE, Ti, U and Pb within zircon grains that have withstood intense P–T conditions to varying degrees. Care must also be taken in identifying open system conditions, for example the presence or passage of partial melts that result in non-equilibrium, or very localised equilibrium, between the phases of interest.\nVisualisation of REE partition coefficients (DREE) becomes more complex with large datasets particularly when dealing with variably recrystallised zircon grains or multiple generations of garnet. Simple methods of visualising the important partitioning parameters identify temperature trends in experimental datasets [1, 2]. These trends can be used as clear indicators of zircon growing or recrystallizing in the presence of stable garnet and may be used as thermometers for zircon growth and for the identification of thermal peaks.\nInvestigation of zircon-garnet DREE values in both long-lived high grade terranes (e.g. S. India), and complex polymetamorphic terranes (e.g. Enderby Land, E. Antarctica) provides insight into how partitioning information can be carefully interrogated, by looking at systematic or erratic variations from experimental data, even when dealing with issues such as variably recrystallised zircon and melt migration.\nRubatto and Hermann, (2007).

            "abstract": "There are several large-scale volcanic complexes, e.g., Marius Hills, Aristarchus Plateau, Rumker Hills, and Flamsteed area in western Oceanus Procellarum of the lunar nearside. For better understanding of the lunar thermal history, it is important to study these areas intensively. The magmatisms and volcanic eruption mechanisms of these volcanic complexes have been discussed from geophysical and geochemical perspectives using data sets acquired by lunar explorers. In these data sets, precise gravity field data obtained by Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) gives information on mass anomalies below the lunar surface, and useful to estimate location and mass of the embedded magmas. Using GRAIL data, Andrews-Hanna et al. (2014) prepared gravity gradient map of the Moon. They discussed the origin of the quasi-rectangular pattern of narrow linear gravity gradient anomalies located along the border of Oceanus Procellarum and suggested that the underlying dikes played important roles in magma plumbing system. In the gravity gradient map, we found that there are also several small linear gravity gradient anomaly patterns in the inside of the large quasi-rectangular pattern, and that one of the linear anomalies runs through multiple gravity anomalies in the vicinity of Aristarchus, Marius and Flamstead volcano complexes. Our concern is whether the volcanisms of these complexes are caused by common factors or not. To clarify this, we firstly estimated the mass and depth of the embedded magmas as well as the directions of the linear gravity anomalies. The results were interpreted by comparing with the chronological and KREEP distribution maps on the lunar surface. We suggested providing mechanisms of the magma to these regions and finally discussed whether the volcanisms of these multiple volcano complex regions are related with each other or not.",

            "abstract": "Mindoro Island locates where the Palawan Continental Block (PCB) indented into the Philippine Mobile Belt (PMB) during the Early Miocene and where the Manila Trench terminates, having ceased convergence due to collision. On the transition from subduction to collision, Northwest Mindoro exhibits vigorous seismic activity and has been debated about its affiliation being PCB or PMB. Here, we use data from both the EHB and Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalogues to study the regional seismotectonics. We also deployed five broadband stations to probe the crustal thickness beneath NW Mindoro using receiver function analysis. Results show that, following the southeasterly reduction of convergence rates at the southern termination of the Manila Trench, the slab dipping angles steepen, were initiated at depth (~200 km) and propagate upwards. The horizontal distances of the trench and slab, as measured from the Wadati-Benioff zone at 200 km depth, also reduce in a southeasterly direction. Observations of intermediate-depth earthquakes that exhibit predominantly down-dip extensional stress patterns attest that the steepening of slab dipping angles is due to the negative buoyancy of the slab. Preliminary results of receiver function analysis suggest that the crustal thickness beneath NW Mindoro is about 40 km and is probably PCB affiliated.",

            "abstract": "The random and systematic errors of mesoscale atmospheric models are important to quantify due to the growing use of these models for atmospheric transport applications, such as atmospheric inversions. The main goal of the Indianapolis Flux (INFLUX) experiment is to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Indianapolis using high-resolution atmospheric inversions, which require the optimization and quantification of atmospheric transport errors. This study seeks to quantify the accuracy of the parameterization schemes used to represent boundary layer processes for simulations run for Indianapolis. INFLUX presents a unique opportunity to conduct an extensive observation-to-model comparison in order to assess model errors for latent heat and sensible heat fluxes, air temperature near the surface and in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), wind speed and direction, and ABL depth.\nThe mesoscale meteorological model used in this study was the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In order to test the sensitivity of meteorological simulations to different model packages, an ensemble of runs was created by varying ABL schemes, urban canopy models, and an improved urban land cover definition algorithm, which was created in order to reduce an inherent model overestimation of urban land cover. Nine different model configurations were tested and the meteorological errors were assessed for a period in winter (February 15, 2013 - March 20, 2013) and a period in summer (June 15, 2013 - July 20, 2013). There was not one model configuration that consistently outperformed all other configurations; however, the model runs that used the Bougeault & Lacarrere ABL scheme coupled with the multi-layer urban canopy model and the improved urban land cover algorithm was the model configuration that most consistently had the least amount of errors for our experiment setup.",

The underlying dynamics of this variability and its connection to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon will be elucidated. Using a multi-century pre-industrial simulation of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), coupled to the Biogeochemistry-Ecosystem-Circulation model (BEC) we show that ENSO-driven changes of upper ocean currents are responsible for the natural variability in the tropical Pacific carbonate system.\nBased on a Taylor expansion of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pCO2 and CO2 flux we find that during El Niño events, the anomalous meridional advection of low salinity water towards the equator leads to a dilution of Alkalinity (TA) and DIC in the western Pacific (155◦E to 165◦W), and a subsequent net reduction of surface pCO2. Combined with the anomalous westerly winds this causes an anomalous flux of CO2 into the ocean.\nIn the eastern equatorial Pacific (90◦W to 125◦W), surface DIC decreases during El Niño events due a reduction of upwelling. This in turn diminishes surface ocean pCO2. Its effect on eastern Pacific CO2 flux is overcompensated by the effect of El Niño-driven changes in mean wind speed, thus leading to an increased flux of CO2 out of the eastern Pacific ocean. \nThe presentation will also discuss the phase relationship between the western and eastern tropical Pacific anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa currently experiences rapidly growing human population, intrinsically tied to substantial changes in land use on shrubland, savanna and mixed woodland ecosystems due to over-exploitation. Significant conversions driving degradation, affecting fire frequency and water availability, and fueling climate change are expected to increase in the immediate future. However, measured data of greenhouse gas emissions as affected by land use change are scarce to entirely lacking from this region. The project 'Adaptive Resilience of Southern African Ecosystems' (ARS AfricaE) conducts research and develops scenarios of ecosystem development under climate change, for management support in conservation or for planning rural area development. This will be achieved by (1) creation of a network of research clusters (paired sites with natural and altered vegetation) along an aridity gradient in South Africa for ground-based micrometeorological in-situ measurements of energy and matter fluxes, (2) linking biogeochemical functions with ecosystem structure, and eco-physiological properties, (3) description of ecosystem disturbance (and recovery) in terms of ecosystem function such as carbon balance components and water use efficiency, (4) set-up of individual-based models to predict ecosystem dynamics under (post) disturbance managements, (5) combination with long-term landscape dynamic information derived from remote sensing and aerial photography, and (6) development of sustainable management strategies for disturbed ecosystems and land use change. Emphasis is given on validation (by a suite of field measurements) of estimates obtained from eddy covariance, model approaches and satellite derivations.",

            "abstract": "Delineating the relative contributions of mantle, slab, and crust to arc magmas is particularly challenging in the Cascades where the continental crust is juvenile and contrasts little with magmas in traditional radiogenic isotope systems (Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb). The Re-Os isotope system offers a sensitive technique for evaluating these contributions because even young crust has significantly higher Os ratios than the mantle. We analyzed Re-Os isotope ratios in 33 primitive basalts from 9 volcanic centers of the northern Cascade Arc (Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, GVB). Although GVB basalts have mantle-like Sr-Pb-Nd-Hf ratios (Mullen & Weis, 2015, EPSL), the range in 187Os/188Os is very large (0.13-0.99) with [Os] of <1 to 17 ppt. Ten samples of subducting Cascadia Basin sediment and altered Juan de Fuca MORB are associated with high 187Os/188Os (0.68-0.92) and [Os] = 25-132 ppt. The GVB basalts define two groups: Group 1 (Cinder Cone/Mt. Garibaldi, Salal Glacier, Mt. Meager, Indian Pass/Glacier Peak) has low Os isotopic ratios (0.13–0.19), only slightly elevated relative to global mantle wedge peridotites (≤0.16), indicating minimal crustal contamination. Group 1 samples lie on Os-Sr isotope mixing curves indicating variable sediment input to the mantle. Os ratios of Group 2 basalts (Silverthrone, Bridge River, Elaho, Cheakamus, Mt. Baker, Glacier Peak) extend to extremely high values, up to 0.99, and lie on different Os-Sr mixing curves indicating addition of a crustal contaminant. Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotopic ratios cannot be used to identify this crustal input because Groups 1 and 2 are identical in these isotope systems. Interaction with a mafic underplate from older Cenozoic or accreted Mesozoic arcs is likely, and Re-Os analyses of basement samples (in progress) will provide a test of this hypothesis. This study reveals that most primitive magmas in the Cascades have suffered variable crustal contamination, but only the Re-Os isotope system has the potential to delineate the extent of this involvement.",

Using the sequential data assimilation framework developed in meteorology and oceanography (e.g., Evensen, JGR, 1994) and a seismic cycle forward model based on Navier-Stokes Partial Differential Equations (van Dinther et al., JGR, 2013), we show that such information with its uncertainties is within reach, at least for laboratory setups. We aim to provide the first, thorough proof of concept for seismicity related PDE applications via a perfect model test of seismic cycles in a simplified wedge-like subduction setup. By evaluating the performance with respect to known numerical input and output, we aim to answer wether there is any probabilistic forecast value for this laboratory-like setup, which and how many parameters can be constrained, and how much data in both space and time would be needed to do so. Thus far our implementation of an Ensemble Kalman Filter demonstrated that probabilistic estimates of both the state of stress and strength on a megathrust fault can be obtained and utilized even when assimilating surface velocity data at a single point in time and space. An ensemble-based error covariance matrix containing velocities, stresses and pressure links surface velocity observations to fault stresses and strengths well enough to update fault coupling accordingly. Depending on what synthetic data show, coseismic events can then be triggered or inhibited. ",

            "abstract": "Nearly 50 years ago, Mercer first suggested the Eemian sea-level high stand was a result of a collapse of the marine portions of the West Antarctic ice sheet. Recently, special attention has been paid to West Antarctica’s Amundsen Sea Embayment due to its steeply sloping retrograde beds that are well below sea level, and observations of rapid grounding-line retreat, high ice-shelf basal-melt rates, and basin-wide glacier thinning and acceleration. Despite this focus, accurate assessments of the past and future behavior of this embayment remain elusive due to a lack of understanding of calving processes and ice–ocean interactions. Here we present a continuous two-year (2012-2014) time series of oceanographic, borehole, glaciological, and seismological observations of Pine Island Glacier ice shelf, its sub-ice ocean cavity, and the adjacent Amundsen Sea. With these data, we captured the ice shelf’s response to a large fluctuation in the temperature of the water (~1 °C) entering the sub-ice-ocean cavity. Initially, the ice shelf slowed by 5%, but, by the end of 2014, it had nearly recovered its earlier speed. The generally smooth changes in ice flow were punctuated by rapid (2-3 week), high-amplitude (~2.5% of the background speed) speedups and slowdowns. Satellite and seismological observations indicate that rapid speedups are caused by reduction of lateral drag along the ice stream’s shear margins as a large iceberg calves and that rapid slowdowns may be due to periodic regrounding on bed highs at low tide. Coupled ice-stream/ice-shelf/ocean-plume flowband modeling informed by these new data indicates that the more-gradual changes in speed are related to ocean temperature, ice-front position, and past ice-flow history. Our observations highlight an ice shelf’s rapid response to external forcings and that past ice-flow behavior affects subsequent ice response to external forcing. Thus, long-term, multifaceted investigations are necessary to determine whether a glacier/ice-shelf system is responding to external forcing or undergoing a terminal collapse due to the marine ice-sheet instability.",

            "abstract": "Tekirdag region (NW Turkey) is quite close to the North Anatolian Fault which is capable of producing a large earthquake. Therefore, earthquake hazard mitigation studies are important for the urban areas close to the major faults. From this point of view, integration of different geophysical methods has important role for the　study of seismic hazard problems including seismotectonic zoning. On the other hand, geological mapping and determining the subsurface structure, which is a key to assist management of new developed　areas, conversion of current urban areas or assessment of urban geological hazards can be performed by integrated geophysical methods. This study has been performed in the frame of a national project, which is a complimentary project of the cooperative project between Turkey and Japan (JICA&JST), named as “Earthquake and Tsunami Disaster Mitigation in the Marmara Region and Disaster Education”. With this principal aim, this study is focused on Tekirdag and its surrounding region (NW of Turkey) where some uncertainties in subsurface knowledge (maps of bedrock depth, thickness of quaternary sediments, basin geometry and seismic velocity structure,) need to be resolved. Several geophysical methods (microgravity, magnetic and single station and array microtremor measurements) are applied and the results are evaluated to characterize lithological changes in the region. Array microtremor measurements with several radiuses are taken in 30 locations and 1D-velocity structures of S-waves are determined by the inversion of phase velocities of surface waves, and the results of 1D structures are verified by theoretical Rayleigh wave modelling. Following the array measurements, single-station microtremor measurements are implemented at 75 locations to determine the predominant frequency distribution. The predominant frequencies in the region range from 0.5 Hz to 8 Hz in study area. On the other hand, microgravity and magnetic measurements are performed on the seven profiles of 45km to 60km length. We attempt to map varioations in bedrock, its geologic structure along the profiles. Final target would be 3-dimensional mapping of bedrock in the area.",

Both are important to assess the effect of anthropogenic aerosols on climate. We compare the daily mean simulated optical properties of aerosols with the observations from DRAGON-Asia campaign for March-May, 2012 (provided in level 2.0: cloud screened and quality assured). We find that the model reproduces the observed daily variability of fAOD (R=0.67), but overestimates the magnitude by 30%, which is in general consistent with other global model comparisons from ACCMIP. However, a significant high bias in the model is found compared to the observed SSA at 440 nm, which is important for determining the sign of aerosol radiative forcing. In order to understand causes for this gap we conduct several sensitivity tests by changing source magnitudes and input parameters of aerosols, affecting the aerosol optical properties under various atmospheric conditions, which allows us to reduce the gap and to find the optimal values in the model.",

The focal depth is estimated to be approximately 2.4 km and thus the earthquake is nucleated in Triassic marine sediment, coincident with the depths of the top boundary of Jialingjiang limestone formation (T1) which is an over-pressured (R~2.2) gas reservoir. The strike/dip/rake of source fault is 209/33/102, showing a rupture of a blind reverse fault in agree with the geological structures and regional stress regime of this area. Through an integrated analysis of several issues, including the focal parameters, the local petroleum geology and radon anomaly, and numerical stress analysis for gas production and injection, we propose that the associated fault slip of this earthquake was most probably initiated and driven by gas injection from the underlying over-pressured reservoir into the shallower gas reservoir of normal pressure. With consideration of the fact that the injection-induced seismicity in nearby gas fields shows very low levels of aftershock productivity, no aftershocks following the Suining earthquake indicates that the gas injection from the deeper reservoir is somewhat episodic and a fault-valve behavior.",

            "abstract": "Considering diverse source and high concentration of aerosol, numerous manners have been applied to detect aerosol properties in North East Asia (NEA). Above all, a geostationary orbit satellite, COMS has monitored atmosphere and ocean conditions over the NEA using two payloads of Meteorological Imager (MI) and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) since 2010. By using the MI measurements, an AOD retrieval algorithm was developed (Kim et al., 2014). Additionally, a number of ground-based network such as Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), Sky Radiometer Network (SKYNET), and Mie-scattering Light Detector and Ranging (LIDAR) Network have been in operation to capture aerosol variability. And, occasionally, field campaigns were conducted. In 2012 (March to May), the DRAGON-Asia campaign was performed by AERONET science team and NIER (National Institute of Environmental Research), and 40 sun/sky-radiometer was deployed. Subsequently, MAPS-Seoul campaign for detecting air quality was performed with 8 AERONET sites and 6 Pandora instruments in Korea. Those ground-based measurements provide validation dataset for satellite retrieval algorithm, as well as detect detail of aerosol characteristics at each local point. Thus, in this study, the AODs obtained from the aforementioned campaigns were applied to assess and improve the accuracy of MI AOD. For the DRAGON-Asia 2012, the comparison between MI AOD and AERONET AOD shows correlation coefficient of 0.85, regression slope of 1.00 and RMSE of 0.18. Furthermore, AOPs obtained from those field campaign results and the MI AOD were analyzed to understand temporal and spatial variance of aerosol in NEA during spring.",

            "abstract": "Infrastructure systems are expected to be functional, durable and safe over long service lives – 50 to over 100 years. Observations and models of climate science show that greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities have changed climate, weather and extreme events. Projections of future changes (albeit with uncertainties caused by inadequacies of current climate/weather models) can be made based on scenarios for future emissions, but actual future emissions are themselves uncertain. Most current engineering standards and practices for infrastructure assume that the probabilities of future extreme climate and weather events will match those of the past. Climate science shows that this assumption is invalid, but is unable, at present, to define these probabilities over the service lives of existing and new infrastructure systems. Engineering designs, plans, and institutions and regulations will need to be adaptable for a range of future conditions (conditions of climate, weather and extreme events, as well as changing societal demands for infrastructure services). For their current and future projects, engineers should: Involve all stakeholders (owners, financers, insurance, regulators, affected public, climate/weather scientists, etc.) in key decisions; Use low regret, adaptive strategies, such as robust decision making and the observational method, comply with relevant standards and regulations, and exceed their requirements where appropriate; Publish design studies and performance/failure investigations to extend the body of knowledge for advancement of practice. The engineering community should conduct observational and modeling research with climate/weather/social scientists and the concerned communities and account rationally for climate change in revised engineering standards and codes. This presentation presents initial research on decisionmaking under uncertainty for climate resilient infrastructure design.",

            "abstract": "A number of regions in the Sea of Japan are known for active gas venting and for gas hydrate exposures on the sea floor. In this investigation we employed several gas sensors mounted on a ROV in order to determine the concentrations of dissolved methane in the water near these sites. Methane concentrations were determined during two-second intervals throughout each ROV deployment during the cruise. The methane sensor deployments were coupled with seawater sampling using Niskin bottles. Dissolved gas concentrations were later measured using gas chromatography in order to compare with the sensor results taken at the same time. The observed maximum dissolved methane concentrations were much lower than saturation values, even when the ROV manipulators were in contact with gas hydrate. Nonetheless, dissolved concentrations did reach several thousands of nmol/L near gas hydrate exposures and gas bubbles, more than two orders of magnitude over the instrumental detection limits. Most of the sensors tested were able to detect dissolved methane concentrations as low as 10 nmol/L which permitted detection when the ROV approached methane plume sites, even from several tens of meters above the sea floor. Despite the low detection limits, the methane sensors showed variable response times when returning to low-background seawater (~5nM). For some of the sensors, the response time necessary to return to background values occurred in a matter of minutes, while for others it took several hours. Response time, as well as detection limit, should be an important consideration when selecting methane sensors for ROV or AUV investigations. This research was made possible, in part, through funding provided by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).",

Surface processes include multiple durations that could be trapped or ignored using general time series analysis. We first recognize overall transient signals in Taiwan region recorded by continuous GPS (cGPS) networks. Sparse estimation techniques and Bi-splines function are used to detect the signals on cGPS time series then estimate the parameters. Our study analyzes the transient deformation by using a multi-dataset of the cGPS, seismogram, digital terrain model (DTM), and rainfall gauges. We establish a systematic classification by weighting both the empirical trigger factors and regional criterion to classify the signals into seven types. Spatial and temporal characteristics of transient deformation show three major contributions in Taiwan region including the seismic-related, landslides-related, and slow-slip transients. The cGPS networks in Taiwan region show long-term transient deformation at rates 2-68 mm/yr, ~14%-75% of their tectonic interseismic velocities. Tectonic and surface processes involve ~38%-85% and ~15%-62%, respectively, in the transient deformation under different geological units of Taiwan region. The lack of consideration for the transient deformation in surface processes would underestimate their biases on tectonic interseismic velocity. Statistical linking between cGPS transient deformation, tectonic and surface processes of Taiwan indicate that earthquake, typhoon, and topography play important roles in the occurrence of transient deformation.",

As the first step of study, the GIS-based BROOK90 (gB90), operated on a grid resolution of 5×5 arc minute resolution under the RCP-based regional climate model (RCM) scenarios. To separate the effects of ecosystem functioning and distribution changes from the overall runoff change, modeling has conducted based on the three novel approaches of climate change with a doubled CO2 concentration, increases in the deciduous forest fraction at each watershed, and three RCM climate change. The results of the process-based model study are extended to develop the impact response model to assist policy makers to derive informed decisions in land, forest and water management.",

            "abstract": "Noble gases, particularly xenon (Xe), in mantle-derived basalts provide a rich portrait of mantle degassing and surface-interior volatile exchange. The combination of extinct and extant radioactive species in the I-Pu-U-Xe systems shed light on the degassing history of the early Earth throughout accretion, as well as the long-term degassing of the Earth’s interior in association with plate tectonics. The ubiquitous presence of shallow-level air contamination, however, frequently obscures the mantle Xe signal. In a majority of the samples, shallow air contamination dominates the Xe budget. For example, in the gas-rich popping rock 2ΠD43, 129Xe/130Xe ratios reach 7.7±0.23 in individual step-crushes, but the bulk composition of the sample is close to air (129Xe/130Xe of 6.7). Thus, the extent of variability in mantle source Xe composition is not well-constrained. Here, we present new MORB Xe data and explore constraints placed on mantle processing rates by the Xe data.\nTen step-crushes were obtained on a depleted popping glass that was sealed in ultrapure N2 after dredge retrieval from between the Kane-Atlantis Fracture Zone of the Mid Atlantic Ridge in May 2012. 9 steps yielded 129Xe/130Xe of 7.50-7.67 and one yielded 7.3. The bulk 129Xe/130Xe of the sample is 7.6, nearly identical to the estimated mantle source value of 7.7 for the sample. Hence, the sample is virtually free of shallow-level air contamination. Because sealing the sample in N2upon dredge retrieval largely eliminated air contamination, for many samples, contamination must be added after sample retrieval from the ocean bottom.\nOur new high-precision Xe isotopic measurements in upper mantle-derived samples provide improved constraints on the Xe isotopic composition of the mantle source. We developed a forward model of mantle volatile evolution to identify solutions that satisfy our Xe isotopic data. We find that accretion timescales of ~10±5 Myr are consistent with I-Pu-Xe constraints, and the last giant impact occurred 45-70 Myr after the start of the solar system. After the giant impact stage, the Pu-U-Xe system indicates that degassing of the planet via solid-state mantle convection and plate tectonics continued to liberate volatiles to the atmosphere and has led to between ~5-8 mantle turnovers over the age of the Earth.",

            "abstract": "Many factors give rise to relative sea-level (RSL) changes that are far from globally uniform. For example, spatially variable sea-level responses arise because of the exchange of mass between ice sheets and oceans. Gravitational, flexural, and rotational processes generate a distinct spatial pattern – or “fingerprint” - of sea-level change associated with each shrinking land ice mass. As a land ice mass shrinks, sea-level rise is greater in areas geographically distal to the ice mass than in areas proximal to it, in large part because the gravitational attraction between the ice mass and the ocean is reduced. Thus, the U.S. mid-Atlantic coastline experiences about 50% of the global average sea-level-rise due to Greenland Ice Sheet melt, but about 120% of the global average due to West Antarctic Ice Sheet melt.   Separating the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet contributions during the past 7,000 years requires analysis of sea-level changes from sites in the northern and southern hemisphere. Accordingly we present sea-level records within a hierarchical statistical modeling to: (1) quantify rates of change; (2) compare rates of change among sites, including full quantification of the uncertainty in their differences; and (3) test hypotheses about the sources of meltwater through their sea-level fingerprints. Preliminary analysis of three sites within our North and South Atlantic sea-level database indicates sea-level gradient in the rate of RSL rise during the mid Holocene between 6000 and 4000 years BP; a greater change in rate is found in Brazil than St Croix than New Jersey, consistent with an increase and then decrease in Greenland Ice Sheet mass.",

            "abstract": "We develop and test an iterative inversion framework that is designed for estimating surface CO2 fluxes at a high spatial resolution using a Lagrangian-Eulerian coupled tracer transport model and atmospheric CO2 data collected by the global in-situ network and satellite observations. In our inverse modeling system, we employ the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART that was coupled to the Eulerian atmospheric tracer transport model (NIES-TM). We also derived an adjoint of the coupled model. Weekly corrections to prior fluxes are calculated at a spatial resolution of the FLEXPART-simulated surface flux responses (0.1 degree). Fossil fuel (ODIAC) and biomass burning (GFAS) emissions are given at original model spatial resolutions (0.1 degree), while other fluxes are interpolated from a coarser resolution. The terrestrial biosphere fluxes are simulated with the VISIT model at 0.5 degree resolution. Ocean fluxes are calculated using a 4D-Var assimilation system (OTTM) of the surface pCO2 observations. The flux response functions simulated with FLEXPART are used in forward and adjoint runs of the coupled transport model. To obtain a best fit to the observations we tested a set of optimization algorithms, including quasi-Newtonian algorithms and implicitly restarted Lanczos method. The square root of covariance matrix for surface fluxes is implemented as implicit diffusion operator, while the adjoint of it is derived using automatic code differentiation tool. The prior and posterior flux uncertainties are evaluated using singular vectors of scaled tracer transport operator. The weekly flux uncertainties and flux uncertainty reduction due to assimilating GOSAT XCO2 data were estimated for a period of one year. The model was applied to assimilating one year of Obspack data, and produced satisfactory flux correction results. Regional version of the model was applied to inverse model analysis of the CO2 flux distrubution in West Siberia using continuous observation data by CO2 tower network JR-Station.",

Here we analyze initial data from the Last Millennium Climate Reanalysis Project (LMR) to explore climate dynamics on interannual to decadal timescales. In addition to identifying leading patterns of variability in the LMR, and their dependence on mean state, we also examine the dynamics implied by the LMR using a linear inverse modeling (LIM) approach. Specifically, we use a LIM to empirically estimate the low-order dynamics underlying the LMR reconstruction, to identify the evolution of leading modes of variability. We also use the LIM as a forecast model to estimate the predictive skill on decadal timescales over a large sample, and to identify the sensitivity of predictive skill to the state of the climate system.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate proxies provide the only measured record of Earth's climate history, but they are noisy and sparse in space and time. Climate model simulations provide dynamically consistent spatial fields, but lack a direct connection to specific climate states prior to the instrumental record. Paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA) provides an optimally weighted estimate of the climate state from these two sources of information based on their error characteristics. The Last Millennium Climate Reanalysis Project (LMR) uses an ensemble-based PDA method and annually-resolved proxy records to reconstruct Earth's climate for the past 1000 years on a regular latitude--longitude grid. First results of the LMR project are reported here.\nProxy records used in the first LMR reconstructions include: trees (ring width and wood density), corals (d18O and luminescence), ice cores (d18O), and a small number of sediment and speleothem records. A component of the data assimilation approach that distinguishes it from other techniques concerns the use of proxy system models to estimate the proxy from climate variables from a model simulation. Proxies are linearly related to 2-meter air temperature in a calibration dataset. Given a prior estimate of the climate from a model (here, a randomly sampled 1000-year control integration of CCSM4), we estimate the proxy value from the linear relationship (derived independently from the model). LMR analyses are compared against both existing gridded reanalysis records and withheld proxy records.\nResults show a cooling trend in global-mean air temperature during 1000-1900 CE, which derives primarily from cooling of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, offset by weak tropical warming. There is no evidence of a Medieval Climate Anomaly. During the 20th century, the LMR estimate of the global-mean air temperature compares very closely with other reanalysis products. Skill appears insensitive to the calibration dataset used to derive the proxy system models. Verification of spatial patterns shows coherent large-scale patterns of skill, including fields such as 500 hPa geopotential height. An essential aspect of the LMR involves error analysis, which reveals that the ensemble is very well calibrated when is error is defined by independent proxies or by gridded reanalysis fields.",

            "abstract": "Absorbing aerosols, by attenuating shortwave radiation within the atmosphere and reemitting it as longwave radiation, redistribute energy both vertically within the surface-atmosphere column and horizontally between polluted and unpolluted regions. East Asia has the largest concentrations of anthropogenic absorbing aerosols globally, and these, along with the region's scattering aerosols, have both reduced the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface regionally (\"solar dimming\") and increased shortwave absorption within the atmosphere, particularly during the peak months of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). We here analyze how atmospheric absorption and surface solar dimming compete in driving the response of EASM circulation to anthropogenic absorbing aerosols, which dominates, and why—issues of particular importance for predicting how the EASM will respond to projected changes in absorbing and scattering aerosol emissions in the future. We probe these questions in a state-of-the-art general circulation model (GCM) using a combination of realistic and idealized aerosol perturbations that allow us to analyze the relative influence of absorbing aerosols’ atmospheric and surface-driven impacts on EASM circulation. In combination, our results make clear that, although absorption-driven dimming has a less detrimental effect on EASM circulation than purely scattering-driven dimming, aerosol absorption is still a net impairment to EASM strength when both its atmospheric and surface effects are considered. Because atmospheric heating is not efficiently conveyed to the surface, the surface dimming and associated cooling from even a pure absorber is sufficient to counteract its atmospheric heating, resulting in a net reduction in EASM strength. These findings elevate the current understanding of the impacts of aerosol absorption on the EASM, improving our ability to diagnose EASM responses to current and future regional changes in aerosol emissions.",

In this study, we develop a new approach to calculate polarized emissivities of the polar sea ice at AMSR-E frequencies such as 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, and 36.5 GHz, based on the sea ice temperature data from the 6.9 GHz measurements by assuming that the emitting layer temperature is nearly independent throughout the 6 – 37 GHz frequency range. The results show that the emissivities are well coincident with theoretically-driven values. Furthermore, the ice surface roughness is estimated by assuming that departure of the retrieved polarized emissivities from specular emissivities is attributed to the surface roughness. The retrieved emissivities obtained from this research are compared with the theoretical values as well as with previously measured or retrieved emissivities.",

            "abstract": "Biochar, which is a by-product of pyrolysis, is widely accepted as a climate change mitigation strategy if it is applied to soils. A lot of researches have reported that application of biochar reduced the emission of N2O due to better aeration and increased pH. However, in the dry, organic poor, and heavily fertilized Korean field soil, we observed rather an increase in N2O emission in our previous researches. To explain this inconsistent trend, we conducted a research investigating the mechanisms of N2O emission. The main mechanisms of N2O emission from soils are nitrification and denitrification, among which we exclude the possibility of denitrification process because the soil water condition at our sampling dates was dry. To confirm our assumption that the increased N2O emission from the soil is mainly from the enhanced nitrification due to biochar addition, we used the nitrification inhibitor (DCD: Dicyandiamide). The experiment was performed in the pepper field located in Gyeonggi-do, Korea where we already observed an increase in N2O emission followed by biochar amendment in the previous year. Treatments include the control, biochar treatment (BC, 2 ton ha-1), DCD treatment (DCD, 10% of N fertilizer w/w), and biochar and DCD co-treatment (BC+DCD). All the treatments were received with N:P2O5:K2O (225 : 112 : 149 kg ha-1). Daily average of N2O emission rate was increased in the BC treatment by 154% and the emission was reduced to the control level in the BC+DCD treatment. From this result, we could confirm that the increased N2O emission from the biochar application is from the nitrification process. The field experiment will be prolonged to Aug 2015 and for the further analysis, the basic soil physicochemical parameters (TC, TN, pH, hot water extractable C, available N) and microbial parameters (fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis assay, microbial biomass C, and assay of nitrifiers) will be measured.",

            "abstract": "Recently many seismologists have paid attention to ambient seismic field, which is no more referred as noise and called as Earth’s hum, but as useful signal to understand subsurface seismic velocity structure. It has also been demonstrated that empirical Green’s functions can be constructed by retrieving both phase and amplitude information from ambient seismic field (Prieto and Beroza 2008). The constructed empirical Green’s functions can be used to predict strong ground motions after focal depth and double-couple mechanism corrections (Denolle et al. 2013). They do not require detailed subsurface velocity model and intensive computation for ground motion simulation. In this study, we investigate the capability of predicting long period surface waves by the ambient seismic wave field with a seismic event of Mw 4.0, which occurred with a limestone mine collapse in South Korea on January 31, 2015. This limestone-mine event provides an excellent opportunity to test the efficiency of the ambient seismic wave field in retrieving both phase and amplitude information of Green’s functions due to the single force mechanism of the collapse event. In other words, both focal depth and double-couple mechanism corrections are not required for this event. A broadband seismic station, which is about 5.4 km away from the mine event, is selected as a source station. Then surface waves retrieved from the ambient seismic wave field cross-correlation are compared with those generated by the event. Our preliminary results show some potential of the ambient seismic wave field in retrieving both phase and amplitude of Green’s functions from a single force impulse source at the Earth’s surface. More comprehensive analysis by increasing the time length of stacking may improve the results in further studies. We also aim to investigate the efficiency of retrieving the full empirical Green’s functions with the 2007 Mw 4.6 Odaesan earthquake, which is one of the strongest earthquakes occurred in South Korea in the last decade.",

            "abstract": "We present a 3D geologic model of the Santa Cruz Mountains west of the San Andreas Fault, as constrained by surface expressions of geologic units and well data. Topography within this area has been posited to result from the advection of crust into and through a restraining bend in the San Andreas Fault, which bounds this block to the northeast. We seek to use this new geologic model to test whether or not the geologically observed deformation is consistent with this uplift-advection model within the restraining bend. The new geologic model utilizes available data sets to concisely display the geology of the Santa Cruz Mountains as it is understood today. Restoring this 3D geologic model in Move3D illustrates the distribution of vertical and horizontal strain throughout the region, and yields insight into the spatial and temporal history of the uplift and evolution of the Santa Cruz Mountains. However, complexities associated with wide disparity in sediment thicknesses of individual units, and in total accumulated sediment thicknesses of adjacent regional sub-blocks comprising the range, complicate the restoration process. Additionally, the area hosts a number of potential strike-slip faults with unknown or poorly constrained total slip, and these structures may be partially responsible for the large changes in sediment thicknesses observed within this region. Low temperature thermochronometric data from granitic basement expressions associated with Montara Mountain and the Ben Lomond pluton, and from Eocene units exhumed along significant structures in the range, help to constrain structural evolutionary interpretations and regional block relationships. Coupling kinematic and thermo-mechanical models of the Santa Cruz Mountains will aid in understanding the evolution of the range, and in identifying and separating the contributions of regional transpression and restraining bend tectonics to total range uplift and to the production of the topography seen today.",

            "abstract": "A key to the understanding of past tsunami events is the ability to accurately date them. Analysis of past tsunami sediments is one of the most important tools for past tsunami reconstruction. A typical example of such tsunami sediment is tsunamigenic boulders. In Ishigaki Island, Japan, coral boulders that had been transported by tsunamis were distributed on the beach and land areas. Although the historical occurrences of several huge tsunamis were estimated based on large numbers of radiocarbon dating for coral boulders, radiocarbon dating can not determine a multiple rotational history by multiple tsunamis. A viscous remanet magnetization (VRM) dating method can be used to date any geological event that results in significant movements of a rock. Sato et al. (2014) applied VRM dating for comparing the radiocarbon age of these boulders. If a magnetic-mineral bearing rock is moved or re-oriented, the magnetism of the smaller magnetic grains re-aligns to the direction of the ambient magnetic field with time. This phenomenon is well known as Néel’s (1949, 1955) single-domain (SD) relaxation theory. Pullaiah et al. (1975) derived a time-temperature (t-T relation) relation by assuming Néel’s (1949, 1955) theory of magnetite. In principle, an experimental combination of short relaxation time and high temperature for removing VRM can determine the unknown relaxation time (tsunami age) at room temperature. We have been applied t-T relation to the coral boulders on Ishigaki Island, but their estimated ages showed older than radiocarbon dating. The longer relaxation time means that the observed magnetic relaxation is slower than the original Néel’s theory. Such slow relaxation has been described by a stretched exponential function. The stretched exponential law provided a reasonable fit to the published experimental data. Thus, in this study, we revisit Néel’s theory to provide a new t-T relation based on stretched exponential function.",

Roi-Namur houses a U.S. Department of Defense military installation and presents an ideal study location where a human impacted aquifer is co-located next to a natural aquifer as part of two artificially conjoined atoll islands. The hydrogeology and geochemistry of carbonate atoll aquifers has been well studied, particularly because of its small, well-defined hydrologic system that allows for relatively precise modeling. However, it is unknown how changes in land-use/land cover and managed aquifer recharge (MAR) alters natural geochemical processes in atoll aquifers. A better understanding of this has implications on groundwater quantity and quality, carbonate dissolution, and best aquifer management practices in the context of rising sea level and saltwater intrusion. Roi has been heavily modified to house military and civilian operations; here, lack of vegetation and managed recharge has increased the volume of potable groundwater and affected the geochemical processes in the freshwater lens and saltwater transition zone. Namur is heavily vegetated and the hydrogeology is indicative of a natural atoll island. A suite of monitoring wells were sampled across both island settings for major ions, nutrients, trace elements, DOC/DIC, δ13C and δ18O/2H isotopes. By modeling geochemical reactions using a conservative mixing approach, we measure deviations from expected reactions and compare the two contrasting settings using derived geochemical profiles through a wide salinity spectrum. Results indicate that groundwater on Namur is more heavily depleted in δ13C and has greater dissolved inorganic carbon, suggesting higher microbial oxidation and greater dissolution within the carbonate aquifer. This suggests MAR and reduction of vegetation makes the groundwater supply on atoll islands more resilient to sea level rise.",

By combining these measurements, we are able to calculate both the ionospheric currents and the ionospheric conductivity.

In addition, we can also estimate the amount of Joule heating in the ionosphere from j · E. Here, we show initial determinations of both ionospheric electric fields and Joule heating using MAVEN data. The electric fields are highly variable from orbit-to-orbit suggesting that the ionospheric electrodynamics can change on timescales of several hours. These changes may be driven by changes in the upstream solar wind and IMF or may result from dynamical variations of thermospheric neutral winds.",

In this Bayesian framework, the OCO-2 retrieval error distribution is particularly sensitive to the specification of surface albedo and aerosols, including the prior distribution for aerosol optical depth. The impact of the aerosol and albedo prior specification is studied through Monte Carlo experiments with a physically-based surrogate model.

The MSG/SEVIRI daily albedo product is disseminated operationally by the LSA-SAF processing centre based in Portugal since 2009. This product so-called MDAL covers Europe and Africa includes in the visible, near infrared and shortwave bands at a resolution of 3km at the equator. Recently, an albedo product at 1km so-called ETAL has been built from EPS/AVHRR observations in order to primarily MDAL product outside the MSG disk, while ensuring a global coverage. The methodology is common to MSG and EPS data and relies on the inversion of the BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) model of Roujean et al. On a given target, ETAL products exploits the variability of viewing angles whereas MDAL looks at the variations of solar illumination. The comparison of ETAL albedo product against MODIS and MSG/SEVIRI products over the year 2015 is instructive in many ways and shows in general a good agreement between them. The dispersion may be accounted by different factors that will be explained The additional information provided by EPS appears to be particularly beneficial for high latitudes during winter and for snow albedo.",

            "abstract": "Although oceanic transform faults (OTFs) constitute a small fraction of the total plate boundary area, better constraints on OTF tectonic parameters (e.g. fault length, slip rate, thermal structure) compared to other tectonic boundaries make OTFs a useful focus of the investigation of earthquake processes. OTF earthquakes are also accompanied by a large fraction of aseismic deformation that makes them an interesting target for exploring the interaction of creep with slow and quick earthquakes. Because most typical OTFs are quite remote, even indirectly observing their deformation processes is a serious challenge. Standard teleseismic analysis methods have yielded valuable constraints on the first-order characteristics of moderate-to-large magnitude OTF earthquakes, but fundamental questions regarding rupture length and area as well as rupture-front propagation speed remain unknown in these systems; Identifying the smaller-magnitude activity that often provides insight to some of these quantities is difficult. Short-period seismic arrays occasionally provide adequate information needed to locate small (mb < 4.0) earthquakes along Mid-Atlantic transforms. In this work, we explore the possibility of detecting and locating smaller earthquakes along remote OTFs using intermediate-period waveform-based comparisons (e.g. cross correlations) of template signals with the continuous seismic wavefield observed at seismic stations surrounding several OTFs. To extend our application to regions with limited template signals, we employ the match and locate procedure of Wang and Wen (2015) and use a spatial grid search to identify the location that maximizes network cross-correlation values. Preliminary results suggest that at least some small events can be identified and located using moderate-magnitude waveform templates. Our goal is to construct a metric that will produce acceptable false-alarm rates and that will allow us to visually confirm detections and extend the seismicity catalogs along OTFs to lower magnitude threshold, helping us to continue to investigate OTF deformation processes using remote seismic observations.",

            "abstract": "Summertime heat wave over Eurasia is induced by various climatic factors. As internal and external factors are changing under an abrupt climate change, the variability of heat waves exhibits radical changes. In this study, the long-term change in heat wave characteristics over Eurasia for the last several decades was examined and the impact of land-atmosphere interaction modulated by soil moisture variability on the change was investigated. Through the empirical orthogonal functions(EOF) analysis, the principle spatio-temporal pattern of Eurasian heat wave during July-August was objectively detected. The leading pattern (1st EOF mode) of the variability was found be an overall increase in heat waves over eastern Europe and east Asia (Mongol to northern part of China), which seems to be associated mainly with the global warming signal but with interannual variability as well. Through performing JULES(Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) land surface model simulation forced with observational atmospheric forcings, soil moisture and energy flux at surface were estimated, and the impacts of land-atmosphere interaction on the heat wave variability was investigated based on the estimated land surface variables and temperature observations. It is found that there is a distinct dry soil condition accompanying with East Asian heat waves. The dry condition leads to an increase in sensible heat flux from land surface to atmosphere and resulting near-surface warming, which is followed by warm-core high – a typical characteristics of a heatwave sustained by land-atmosphere interaction. This result is consistent with an distinct increase in heatwave in recent years. By using the hindcast of long-range prediction model of KMA, GloSea5, the seasonal predictability of heatwave was examined. GloSea5 reasonably well simulates the spatial pattern of Eurasian heatwaves variability found in observations but shows modest skill in simulating accurate year-to-year variability. This result suggests that soil moisture initialization may provide additional predictability for summer heat wave.",

We calculate regional sea level changes from these present day mass fluxes using an improved scaling factor for the GRACE data that accounts for the spatial and temporal variability of the observed signal. We calculate a separate scaling factor for the annual and the long-term components of the GRACE signal. To estimate the contribution of the GIC, we use a least square mascon approach and we re-analyze recent inventories to optimize the distribution of mascons and recover the GRACE signal more accurately. We find that overall, Greenland controls 43% of the global trend in eustatic sea level rise, 16% for Antarctica and 29% for the GIC. The contribution from the GIC is dominated by the mass loss of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, followed by Alaska, Patagonia and the High Mountains of Asia. We report a marked increase in mass loss for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. In Greenland, following the 2012 high summer melt, years 2013 and 2014 have slowed down the increase in mass loss, but our results will be updated with summer 2015 observations at the meeting. In Antarctica, the mass loss is still on the rise with increased contributions from the Amundsen Sea sector and surprisingly from the Wilkes Land sector of East Antarctica, including Victoria Land. Conversely, the Queen Maud Land sector experienced a large snowfall in 2009-2013 and has now resumed to a zero mass gain since 2013. We compare sea level changes from these GRACE derived mass fluxes after including the atmospheric and ocean loading signal with sea level change from satellite radar altimetry (AVISO) corrected for steric signal of the ocean using Argo measurements and find an excellent agreement in amplitude, phase and trend in these estimates.

            "abstract": "Subduction is thought to be the fundamental process for plate tectonics initiation. It can be approximately described in terms of Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We consider the lithosphere as a cold, dense layer with some characteristic viscosity on top of a low viscosity convecting interior. One major difficulty in subduction initiation is the strength of the cold top layer that prevents it from being unstable to failure. Sublithospheric convection can induce large stresses in the lithosphere and could be sufficient to overcome the strength of the lithosphere and cause it to fail. These stresses are caused by the dipping slope of the base of the lithopshere, and previous analysis on lithospheric stress distribution showed that large aspect ratio cells have higher stresses and thus higher critical yield stress, which means that wide cells are easier to subduct. In time-dependent multi-cell convection systems, we can define sub-cells by a single dipping slope. The sub-cell sizes vary with time, but as the change in the bottom topography of the lithosphere occurs rather slowly, we can study the dynamics in a sub-cell with single-cell steady-state solutions in which the cell size is fixed. We use a yield stress approach to simulate brittle and ductile failure in the lithosphere. The yield stress determines the extent of weakening, and thus controls the stability of the lithosphere. Using simple analytical solutions for Rayleigh-Taylor instability, we develop scaling relations between the yield stress and the timescale of growth of instability. For one of the sub-cells to become sufficiently weakened to initiate subduction, it has to maintain its size for a certain period of time. The scaling relations using this instability model could inform us on the time needed for a wide sub-cell to remain. We use these relations to constrain the time for subduction initiation and the yield stress for terrestrial planets.",

Instead, due in part to low dust accumulation rates and numerous dust cleaning events, Opportunity continues to operate on the Martian surface for over 4000 sols (over six Mars years). During this time period, the rover experienced six Martian winters and several dust storms. Because the sources of solar energy loss are known, the solar array energy output offers a method to scientifically estimate the loading and aeolian removal of dust from the solar array each sol. We will discuss the accumulation of dust on the solar panels as a proxy for dust movement at Meridiani Planum over the course of the entire mission to date.",

            "abstract": "The Hyuga-nada region, nearby the western end of the Nankai Trough in Japan, is one of the most active areas of shallow slow earthquakes in the world. Recently, ocean-bottom observation of offshore seismicity near the trench succeeded in detecting shallow tremor. The observed traces contained a complete episode lasting for one month exhibiting similar migration property of deep tremor [Yamashita et al., 2015]. This activity was associated with shallow very-low-frequency earthquake (VLFE) activity documented by land-based broadband seismic network. The coincidence between tremor and VLFE activities and similarity of their migration pattern show strong resemblance with the episodic tremor and slip episodes; this similarity suggests that the tremor activity in the shallow plate boundary may also be coupled with VLFE and short-term slow slip events in this area. It is important clarifying the seismicity including slow earthquakes to understand the slip behavior at a shallow plate boundary, and to improve assessments of the possibility of tsunamigenic megathrust earthquake that is anticipated to occur at the Nankai Trough. Motivated by these issues, we started long-term ocean-bottom monitoring in this area from May 2014 using 3 broadband and 7 short-period seismometers. In January 2015, we replaced the instruments and obtained the first data which includes minor shallow tremor and VLFE activity on June 1-3, 2014. Preliminary results of data processing show that the shallow tremor activity occurred at the northwestern part of the 2013 activity. The location corresponds the point where the tremors stopped migrating to further north direction and turned sharply eastward in the 2013 activity. On the other hand, clear tremor migration was not found in the 2014 activity. This local activity may imply that regional/small-scale heterogeneous structures such as a subducting sea mount affect the activity pattern. During the 2014 observation, many ordinary earthquakes also occurred in the Hyuga-nada region. However, nearby the ocean-bottom observation network, detected seismicity was very low even though there are the seismic stations in the seafloor. This result suggests that the frictional property along subduction plate interface may be separated sharply between the focal area of ordinary and slow earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Paleomagnetic analyses have been carried out on sedimentary rocks for over 65 years. Throughout much of this time, sedimentary magnetization acquisition has been associated with the depositional remanent magnetization and post-depositional remanent magnetization concepts, where dominantly detrital magnetic particles align passively with the geomagnetic field either during or after deposition. We are currently learning a great deal of new information about how sediments acquire a remanent magnetization. In recent years, biogenic magnetite has been recognized as an important source of sedimentary paleomagnetic signals, with common co-occurrence of biogenic and detrital particles. Detrital and biogenic magnetite particles will have different grain size distributions and, therefore, are likely to have different efficiencies of alignment with the geomagnetic field. The two particle types should then be expected to contribute differentially to remanence normalizations used in relative paleointensity investigations. We have assessed the relative efficiency or remanence acquisition for both detrital and biogenic magnetite in various sediments and find that biogenic magnetite is generally 2-4 times more efficient than detrital magnetite in contributing to sedimentary natural remanent magnetizations. Temporal variations in the concentration and efficiency of remanence acquisition of the two components will introduce an important non-geomagnetic factor that is important to consider in relative paleointensity studies, particularly if the relative proportion of the two magnetite components varies stratigraphically within a studied sedimentary sequence. Our results are the first to provide an assessment of variable remanence acquisition in sediments and demonstrates that much remains to be learned about sedimentary magnetization acquisition despite the longevity and importance of this subject.",

The SD observations also provide a mean to compute gain ratios between low-to-mid and mid-to-high gain stages. With its large dynamic range and high sensitivity, the DNB detectors can make observations during both daytime and nighttime. We will describe the DNB on-orbit calibration methodology used by the VIIRS Characterization Support Team (VCST) in supporting the NASA earth science community with consistent VIIRS sensor data records (SDRs) made available by the Land Science Investigator-led Processing Systems (SIPS).

            "abstract": "Bridgmanite, (perovskite-structured (Mg,Fe)SiO3) is the dominant constituent mineral in the Earth’s lower mantle but whose rheological property is largely unknown. Seismic shear wave anisotropy is observed at the Earth’s uppermost lower mantle near Tonga-Kermadec slab (e.g. Wookey and Kendall 2004). The anisotropy caused by deformation-induced crystallographic-preferred-orientation (CPO) of bridgmanite is the most plausible candidates of this feature.\nWe carried out shear deformation experiments of bridgmanite under the lower mantle conditions (25 GPa and 1600°C) employing the deformation-DIA (D-DIA) type multi-anvil press with Kawai-type cell assembly (6-8 tpye). Dense bridgmanite aggregates, which were equigranular with typical grain size of ~15 μm and random crystallographic orientation, were used as starting materials. Both of the crystallographic orientations of the starting and the deformed samples were determined by 2D monochromatic X-ray diffraction pattern method.\nIn the deformation experiment, the total strain and average strain rate were evaluated to be γ ~0.7 and ý ~2 × 10-4 /s, respectively, from the tilting angle of the strain marker. The obtained fabrics are characterized by the a-axis perpendicular to shear plane and the c-axis parallel to shear direction, indicating that the dominant slip system of bridgmanite is [001](100). The observed shear wave anisotropy near Tonga-Kermadec slab is explained by the CPO of bridgmanite induced by lateral flow of the slab with the stagnation above 1000 km depth. Present study shows that the flow direction in the lower mantle can be determined based on the combination of CPO of bridgmanite and seismic observation.",

            "abstract": "The cellular automaton earthquake model by Sacks and Rydelek (1995) is extended to explain spatio-temporal change in seismicity with the regional tectonic stress buildup. Our approach is to apply a simple Coulomb failure law to our model space of discrete cells, which successfully reproduces empirical laws (e.g. Gutenberg-Richter law) and dynamic failure characteristics (e.g. stress drop vs. magnitude and asperities) of earthquakes. Once the stress condition supersedes the Coulomb threshold on a discrete cell, its accumulated stress is transferred to only neighboring cells, which cascades to more neighboring cells to create various size ruptures. A fundamental point here is the cellular view of the continuous earth. We suggest the cell size varies regionally with the maturity of the faults of the region.\nSeismic gaps (e.g. Mogi, 1979) and changes in seismicity such as indicated by b-values have been known but poorly understood. There have been reports of magnitude dependent seismic quiescence before large event at plate boundaries and intraplate (Smith et al., 2013). Recently, decreases in b-value for large earthquakes have been reported (Nanjo et al., 2012) as anticipated from lab experiments (Mogi, 1963). Our model reproduces the b-value decrease towards eventual large earthquake (increasing tectonic stress and its heterogeneous distribution). We succeeded in reproducing the cut-off of larger events above some threshold magnitude (M3-4) by slightly increasing the Coulomb failure level for only 2 % or more of the highly stressed cells. This is equivalent to reducing the pore pressure in these distributed cells. We are working on the model to introduce the recovery of pore pressure incorporating the observed orders of magnitude higher permeability fault zones than the surrounding rock (Lockner, 2009) allowing for a large earthquake to be generated. Our interpretation requires interactions of pores and fluids. We suggest heterogeneously distributed patches hardened by dilatancy eventually break down rapidly and generate a large event. Various reports of macroscopic earthquake precursors may be indicative of this break down stage. We will however need observational means sensitive to aquifer changes to quantify the process.",

However, because of big foot print of OMI, the cloud contamination error was a big issue in the UV aerosol algorithm. In the present study, high resolution UV aerosol optical depth (AOD) over East Asia was derived by collaborating the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite/Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation (GOSAT/TANSO)-Cloud and Aerosol Imager (CAI) and OMI together. AOD of 0.1 degree grid resolution was retrieved using CAI band 1 (380nm) by bring OMI lv.2 aerosol type, single scattering albedo, and aerosol layer peak height in 1 degree grid resolution. Collocation of the two dataset within the 0.5 degree grid with time difference of OMI and CAI less than 5 minute was selected. Selected region becomes wider as it goes to the higher latitude. Also, calculated degradation factor of 1.57 was applied to CAI band1 (380nm) by comparing normalized radiance and Lambertian Equivalent Reflectivity (LER) of both sensors. The calculated degradation factor was reasonable over dark scene, but inconsistent over cirrus cloud and bright area. Then, surface reflectance was developed by compositing CAI LER minimum data over three month period, since the infrequent sampling rate associated with the three-day recursion period of GOSAT and the narrow CAI swath of 1000 km. To retrieve AOD, look up table (LUT) was generated using radiative transfer model VLIDORT NGST.

            "abstract": "The Stanford farm is a small, sustainably run farm that prioritizes producing high-quality crops in an environmentally sustainable way. This experiment focuses on the soil used to germinate and cultivate crops in a controlled greenhouse environment. It was conducted with the objective of determining which ratio of compost to potting mix is most favorable in terms of both cost and biological productivity. The five ratios of compost to potting mix were created as follows: (1) 100% compost; (2) 75% compost and 25% potting mix; (3) 50% compost and 50% potting mix; (4) 25% compost and 75% potting mix; and (5) 100% potting mix. Three different crops with distinct needs were used in the experiment: an Indonesian cultivar of Cosmos flowers (Cosmos sp.), a heritage American Corn cultivar (Zea mays), and Ojo de Cabra beans (Phaseolus vulgaris). Ten pots of the corn, ten pots of the beans, and ten pots of the cosmos flowers were planted in each of the soil ratios mentioned above. The pots were placed in the greenhouse and watered regularly and equally by the greenhouse watering system. The experiment is ongoing and is not yet completed. However, thus far the results indicate that 75% compost and 25% potting mix is the most favorable ratio; the corn, bean, and cosmos plants grown using this ratio not only had the highest germination rate (90% of corn seeds, 90% of bean seeds, and 100% of cosmos seeds) but also had the highest average upward growth. According to data taken August 3, 2015, the corn plants grown using the 75:25 compost to potting mix ratio were the tallest by an average of 10.67cm, the beans grown in this ratio were tallest by an average of 3.96cm, and the cosmos were tallest by an average of 0.14 cm. As compost is a cheaper alternative to potting mix, using a compost-based soil would save the farm money while also maximizing plant growth.",

            "abstract": "Iron-oxidizing bacteria becomes increasingly described in different geological settings from volcanically active seamounts, coastal waters, to diffuse hydrothermal vents near seafloor spreading centers [Emerson et al., 2010]. They have been mostly identified and described in Pacific Ocean, and have been only recently found in hydrothermal systems associated to slow spreading center of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) [Scott et al., 2015].\nDuring the MoMARSAT’13 cruise at Lucky Strike hydrothermal field (MAR), a new hydrothermal site was discovered at about 1.5 km eastward from the lava lake and from the main hydrothermal vents. This active venting site, named Capelinhos, is therefore the most distant from the volcano, features many chimneys, both focused and diffuses. The hydrothermal end-member fluids from Capelinhos are different from those of the other sites of Lucky Strike, showing the highest content of iron (Fe/Mn≈3.96) and the lowest chlorinity (270 mmol/l) [Leleu et al., 2015]. Most of the chimneys exhibit rust-color surfaces and bacterial mats near diffuse flows. During the MoMARSAT’15 cruise, an active chimney, a small inactive one, and rust-color bacterial mat near diffuse flow were sampled at Capelinhos. Observations by SEM of the hydrothermal samples revealed the presence of iron oxides in an assemblage of tubular “sheaths“, assembled “stalks”, helical “stalks” and amorphous aggregates. These features are similar to those described from the Loihi iron-mats deposits and argue for the occurrence of iron-oxidizing bacteria. Cultures under micro-aerobic and neutral pH conditions allowed us to isolate strains from the small inactive chimney.

            "abstract": "Bryce Canyon is a dramatic southeast-facing escarpment located in the transition zone between the Basin and Range Province and the Colorado Plateau. Stream erosion of the Paleocene-to-Eocene Claron Formation generates vast amphitheaters and alcoves replete with elaborate fins, windowed walls, and hoodoos from Fairyland to Bryce Point. Geomorphic models of hoodoo development describe the influence of differential weathering and ice wedging along systematic vertical fractures formed during uplift of the Colorado Plateau. Conjugate shear fractures in the footwall of the south-vergent Rubys Inn thrust fault may provide additional preexisting weaknesses intersecting the predominantly flat-lying strata. During a summer 2015 GeoCorpsTM America internship, we investigated the contribution of joint sets to focused erosion of exposed fins and hoodoo development in Bryce Canyon National Park. Our field mapping documents the nature and spatial distribution of known fractures as well as a previously undocumented third generation characterized by steeply-dipping conjugates and zones of distributed deformation. Evidence for normal reactivation of contractional structures in the Sevier River drainage (MacLean, 2014) suggests that distributed deformation evolved during Basin and Range extension, possibly associated with the nearby Paunsaugunt fault. Cross-cutting relations among fracture sets suggest modest uplift and vertical jointing prior to collapse of the Marysvale volcanic complex (~22-20 Ma) and more recent Basin and Range extension. Spatial trends in fracture density illustrate a systematic increase in vertical, shear fractures, and reactivated zones to the north, proximal to thrust faulting. The increase in fracture density leads to accelerated weathering and erosion, with a corresponding increase in windows, hoodoos, and gentle slopes. While erosional windows commonly develop along vertical fractures intersecting relatively weak lithologies, approximately 60% of the 130 windows also coincide with shear fractures or reactivated zones. South of Bryce Point, high vertical cliffs record the response of relatively competent limestone-rich facies to increased fracture spacing distal from the Rubys Inn thrust.",

A pilot project was presented to the public at the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology’s (SOEST) Biennial Open House weekend in 2013 and, with financial support from the Society of Exploration Geophysicists and National Science Foundation, was developed into a full exhibit for the same event in 2015. Nearly 8,000 people attended the two-day event, including children and teachers from Hawaii’s schools, home school students, community groups, families, and science enthusiasts. Our exhibit demonstrates real-time sonar mapping of a cardboard volcano using a toy size research vessel on a programmable 2-dimensional model ship track suspended above a model seafloor. Ship waypoints were wirelessly sent from a Windows Surface tablet to a large-touchscreen PC that controlled the exhibit. Sound wave travel times were recorded using an ultrasonic emitter/receiver attached to an Arduino microcontroller platform and streamed through a USB connection to the control PC running MatLab, where a 3D model was updated as the ship collected data. Our exhibit demonstrates the practical use of complicated concepts, like wave physics, survey design, and data processing in a way that the youngest elementary students are able to understand. It provides an accessible avenue to learn about sonar mapping, and could easily be adapted to talk about bat and marine mammal echolocation by replacing the model ship and volcano. The exhibit received an overwhelmingly positive response from attendees and incited discussions that covered a broad range of earth science topics.",

The traditional test method for hydraulic parameters usually determines an average value of certain region, and this is always insufficient in the study of fractured porous media. This research developed a method with high performance and accuracy to show the heterogeneity and anisotropy of sample rocks. While permeability measurement was conducted, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) method was incorporated simultaneously to obtain the rock saturation information, which could be used to determine the permeability. Besides, the infiltration process of water infiltrating through the fractured porous media was simulated by TOUGH2 to corroborate the results calculated from the experimental data. The preliminary results showed that the permeability of rock samples was as low as 10-16 m2 and showed high sample variance. By incorporating electrical resistivity tomography into the experiment, the test could specify more details of the infiltration process as well as identify the heterogeneity and anisotropy of sample rocks.",

            "abstract": "Seismic and geodetic observations show that fault slip occurs via a spectrum of behaviors that include slow earthquakes and tectonic tremor. These phenomena have been observed in a variety of tectonic environments worldwide, however the underlying processes are poorly understood. Here we report on lab experiments on simulated fault gouge. We used the double direct shear configuration and varied the loading system stiffness (k) to produce the full spectrum of stick-slip behaviors, with durations ranging from 10-3 to 1 second. We measured frictional rheology and elastic wave properties throughout the stick-slip cycle for slow and fast events. When the loading stiffness is greater than the fault zone critical rheologic stiffness (kc) we observe stable frictional sliding. For k≈kc we document emergent slow-slip events from steady shear. When kc>k we observe audible stick-slip. Stick slip stress drop and event duration vary systematically as a function of the ratio k/kc. For slow-slip events, p-wave velocity (Vp) begins to decrease prior to the stress drop and the maximum slip velocity during failure coincides with the largest drop in Vp. Dynamic stick-slip events do not show precursory changes in Vp prior to failure. We find that fault creep and precursory changes in wave properties vary systematically with stick-slip event duration, with slower events showing larger precursory changes. In general, Vp begins to decrease prior to failure and drops abruptly as slip velocity accelerates to a peak value. The drop in Vp appears to be larger during dynamic stick-slip than for slow-slip events. Our results suggest that slow earthquakes and transient fault slip are governed by the same frictional processes as dynamic stick-slip and represent a continuum in the spectrum of fault slip. We show that fault gouge elastic properties evolve during the pre-seismic stage of slow-slip, which could provide an important means of assessing short term seismic hazard.",

The error is caused by the interaction between runing water and sediment particles, which affect each other in a positive feedback loop. As a consequence, the actual flow conditions around a particle cannot be represented by drag coefficients derived on Earth. This study exmines the implications of such gravity effects on sediment movement on Mars, with special emphasis on the limits of sandstones and conglomerates formed on Earth as analogues for sedimentation on Mars.

The Kori Nuclear Power Plant, nuclear power facility located near Busan, is located in the south-east coast of Korea and about 21km north-east away from the Haeundae and about 25km south away from the Ulsan. An administrative district is Jangan-eup, Gijang-gun, Busan, Korea. A point was selected on the basis of the \"Environmental Radiation Monitoring Plan around Nuclear Power Plants\" and periodically samples were collected and analyzed. The samples were collected from the soils of the surface in the Wolnae area (NW, 1.7km). The soil samples were analyzed by gamma spectrometer with High Purity Germanium detector (HPGe) of 40% relative efficiency and were measured for 80,000 sec. As a results of soil analysis, 137Cs were detected in samples only selected in March 2013. The activity concentration of 137Cs founded in the soil sample was 0.513±0.052Bq/kg-dry. In the other hands, the concentration of 137Cs in the year 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014 were below the minimum detectable activity (MDA). 40K, natural radionuclides which is widely present, was detected in the soil samples and other artificial radionuclides were not detected. The result of overall comparison of the environmental radioactivity survey around Kori Nuclear Power Plant for the last five years is that radioactivity levels are within average range. However, it is necessary to continue to carefully observe a fine change in regional or the monthly radiation concentration.",

KIAPS is developing the KIAPS Integrated Model System (KIM), a backbone for the next-generation operational global numerical weather prediction (NWP) system. The KIM will be a unified model that can be used for global modeling as well as local areas, particularly optimized to topographic and meteorological features of the Korean Peninsula.\nWe have been completed developing major model components based on KIAPS own research and release the KIAPS beta version model on September 2014. We evaluated the results of KIM by using verification system developed KIAPS, it is composed of standard verification score based on WMO report. The system consists of four parts: verification against analysis, observations, vertical verification and quantitative precipitation forecasts.\nThe results of verification against analysis, we found that increase of error for temperature under 700 hPa. In case of MSLP, poor performance except for tropical region is represented, and the increase of error for geopotential height is shown in tropical region. For verification against observations, positive bias is represented for upper level geopotential height, for low level wind speed in tropical region in summer, for all level wind speed in Northern Hemisphere in winter, and for specific humidity in Northern Hemisphere in summer. As previously stated about the result against analysis, cold bias for low level temperature is shown in Northern Hemisphere in summer. In case of verification for rain about KIM, the model value is underestimated in heavy rain category in summer, on the contrary, that is overestimated in heavy rain category in winter. Overall, there is overestimation in ocean for all models. Our findings indicate that continuing efforts should be taken in physics and dynamics of model to improve the skill of NWP.",

We investigate with spacecraft data whether disturbances in the magnetosheath and EMIC waves in the outer magnetosphere are correlated. We present that the flow disturbances affect EMIC wave occurrences and the EMIC frequencies are sensitive to the size and/or intervals of disturbances.

We developed a framework within which we produced a quantitative reconstruction of rainfall based on a δDwax time series, and compared it to records of rainfall in the terrestrial catchment area.

At 25km, the model produces fewer total tropical cyclones but more of the most intense storms in the warmer configurations. Direct tracking of tropical storms in the 100km version of the model produces an increase in the total number of tropical storms in the warmer configurations. This inconsistency cannot be rectified by relaxing the tracking criteria to follow more storms. Furthermore, the standard forms of tropical storm Genesis Potential Indices, based on monthly averages of large scale climatological fields fail to describe the change in the actual cyclogenesis of tracked storms in the high resolution model. Hence, we conclude that conclusions about future changes in tropical cyclone statistics drawn from the CMIP5 database of climate model simulations must be interpreted with extreme caution.",

            "abstract": "Rapid economic development and increased energy demand have resulted in severe air pollution problems throughout China, and the increasing emissions of SO2 and NOx have led to significant deposition of acid rain in China. Despite high SO2 concentrations are observed in both southern and northern China, acid rain is mainly observed in the south area in history. It is believed that high content of alkaline matters in the soil in the North China is one of the key factors that contribute to the neutralization of acidic ions in the rainwater. However, an increasing trend of the precipitation acidity was observed at many sites in North, Central and East China after 2000, with more pronounced trends in the Beijing-Tianjin region and Bohai Sea surrounding area. In this study, precipitations were collected from April to October in 2008 at three non-urban sites (Chicheng, Huailai and Xuanhua) in Hebei Province, North China. The pH values of precipitation events ranged from 4.08 to 7.53 for the three sampling sites. About 61.8% of the total precipitation had a pH value higher than 6.0. The predominant ions in the precipitation were SO42-, NO3- and Ca2+, and their concentrations were significantly higher than other sites in South China. The high concentration of acidic ions reflects that atmospheric pollution has already been severe in this area. The volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentration of major ions and pH value showed obvious seasonal differences, precipitation in dry season had high pH values and VWM concentrations of major ions. According to the equivalent ratio of NP/AP and the results of neutralization factors, the strong acid neutralization is mainly brought about by Ca2+ followed by NH4+ and Mg2+. Using Na as an indicator of marine origin, the proportions of sea salt and non-sea-salt were estimated from elemental ratios. Combining with the results of correlation analysis and enrichment factors, the main acidic ions (SO42- and NO3-) and NH4+ were mainly derived from anthropogenic activities, and Ca2+ and Mg2+ mostly originated from terrestrial sources. The results reflect that terrestrial source is an important source of major cations in rainwater and strongly influence the precipitation chemistry in North China.",

            "abstract": "Debris flow erosion is a powerful and sometimes dominant process in steep channels. Despite its importance, this phenomenon is relatively little studied in the lab. The large drum experiments of Hsu are a notable exception, in which almost-field-scale impact forces were generated at the head of a synthetic debris flow whose properties (grain size, proportion of fines, etc) were varied widely.\nA key challenge in these and similar experiments is to explore how erosion rate varies as a function of the scale of the flow (thereby varying inertial stresses, impact forces, etc). The geometrical limitations of most lab experiments, and their short run time, severely limit the scope of such explorations.\nWe achieve this scale exploration in a set of drum erosion experiments by varying effective gravity across several orders of magnitude (1g, 10g, 100g) in a geotechnical centrifuge. By half-filling our 40cm-diameter drum with dry 2.3mm grains, placing a synthetic rock plate at the back and a glass plate at the front 3cm apart, and rotating the drum at 1-50rpm, we simulate wear in a channelized dry granular flow. In contrast to Hsu’s experiments, we focus on sliding wear erosion at the flow boundary rather than impact/frictional wear at the flow head.\nBy varying effective gravity from 1g-100g we can tune the pressure exerted by the grains at the boundary without having to change the scale of our apparatus. Using a recently developed depth-averaged, kinetic-energy closure theory for granular flow, we can simultaneously tune the drum rotation rate such that the flow dynamics remain invariant. We can thereby explore how changing the scale of a granular flow, and thus the contact forces of grains on the boundary, controls the rate of rock erosion. Using a small apparatus we can simulate the erosion generated by debris flows several meters deep involving grains up to 10cm in diameter.\nOur results suggest that sliding wear is the main erosion process, and are consistent with Archard's equation in which wear rate is proportional to contact force, the speed of sliding, and reciprocal hardness.\nIn these particular experiments grain-wall sliding appears to dominate over impact and rolling. We study further using 3D grain motion simulations executed with specially developed non-smooth contact dynamics code, allied with analysis of high-speed video.",

            "abstract": "Subduction of the Yakutat microplate (YAK) in south-central Alaska may be responsible for regional high topography, large slip during the 1964 earthquake, and the anomalous gap in arc volcanism, but the exact geodynamics and its relationship with the underlying Pacific Plate (PP) are not fully understood. Refraction data support distinct subducting layers, and both GPS and body wave tomography suggest the YAK extends from the Cook Inlet volcanoes in the west to the Wrangell volcanic field in the east. Earthquakes, however, are limited to normal faulting within the PP with an abrupt eastern boundary 80 km west of the inferred YAK edge, and more recent active source seismic data suggest subduction of one homogenous thickened oceanic plateau. Here, I perform a search for tectonic tremor to investigate the role of tremor and slow slip in the system. I scan continuous waveforms from 2007-2015 using all available data from permanent and campaign seismic stations in south-central Alaska. Using envelope cross-correlation, I detect and locate ~9,000 tectonic tremor epicenters, providing a map of the transition zone downdip of the 1964 earthquake. Tremor epicenters occur downdip of discrete slow slip events, and tremor rates do not correlate temporally with slow slip behavior. Depth resolution is poor, but horizontal locations are well constrained and spatially correlate with the velocity images of the YAK. Likewise, tremor extends 80 km further east than intraslab seismicity. Tremor swarms occur intermittently and manifest as ambient tremor. I interpret tremor to mark slow, semi-continuous slip occurring at the boundary between the YAK and North American plates, whose interface continues beyond the eastern edge of the PP. In this model, the YAK is welded to the underlying PP in the west, but extends past the eastern terminus of the PP. This geometry explains the correlation between tremor and the YAK, the discrepancy between deep seismicity and tremor, and the paucity of thrust events – convergence is accommodated by the YAK-North America interface, while earthquakes mark deformation within the PP. Finally, the model corroborates the eastern edge of the YAK and its role in controlling Wrangell magmatism and the gap in Aleutian arc volcanism.",

            "abstract": "It is important to understand the atmospheric aerosols compositions and size distributions since they greatly affect the environment and human health. Particles in the convection layer have been a great concern in global climate changes. To understand these characteristics satellite, aircraft, and radio sonde measurement methods have usually been used. An aircraft aerosol sampling using a filter and/or impactor was the method commonly used (Jay, 2003). However, the flight speed particle sampling had some technical limitations (Hermann, 2001). Moreover, the flight legal limit, altitude, prohibited airspace, flight time, and cost was another demerit. To overcome some of these restrictions, Tethered Balloon Package System (T.B.P.S.) and Recoverable Sonde System(R.S.S.) were developed with a very light optical particle counter (OPC), impactor, and condensation particle counter (CPC). Not only does it collect and measure atmospheric aerosols depending on altitudes, but it also monitors the atmospheric conditions, temperature, humidity, wind velocity, pressure, GPS data, during the measurement (Eun, 2013). In this research, atmospheric aerosol measurement using T.B.P.S. in Ansan area is performed and the measurement results will be presented. The system can also be mounted to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and create an aerial particle concentration map. Finally, we will present measurement data using Tethered Balloon Package System (T.B.P.S.) and R.S.S (Recoverable Sonde System).",

            "abstract": "Magnetic perturbations on ground at high latitudes are directly associated only with the divergence-free component of the height-integrated horizontal ionospheric current. We show how divergence-free horizontal current can be expressed as the total horizontal current minus its curl-free component, the latter being completely determined by the global Birkeland current pattern. Thus in regions where the current is zero, the global Birkeland current distribution alone determines the local magnetic perturbation. We show with observations from ground and space that in the polar cap, the ground magnetic field perturbations tend to align with the Birkeland current contribution in darkness but not in sunlight. We also show that in sunlight, the ground magnetic field perturbations are typically such that the equivalent overhead current is anti-parallel to the convection, indicating that the Hall current system dominates. Thus the ground magnetic field in the polar cap is dominated by different current systems in sunlight and in darkness. Consequently large inter-hemispheric differences in high-latitude magnetic field perturbations can be expected, particularly during solstices. We investigate such differences using magnetically conjugate observations from the two hemispheres. ",

            "abstract": "Cloud-aerosol-precipitation interactions mechanism is heavily dependent upon scale problems, and thus the first thing to understand its mechanism is to quantify the time (or spatial) scale of forcing driver, aerosols. This study is focused on recently occurring dense haze episodes accompanied with severe visibility impairment from 2011 to 2013 at two adjacent monitoring stations (Baengnyeongdo and Seoul) in Korea. Baengnyeongdo is an island being located 200 km west from Seoul. First of all, we have tested various flow charts to classify the various categories of heavy haze events by making use of aerosol scattering coefficient, PM2.5, and time lag difference of PM2.5 increase time at both stations, backward trajectories, and the ratio of PM2.5 to PM10 specifically in the quantitative perspective. One of them is selected for this study. Long range transported haze (LH) and Yellow Sand (YS) show very distinctive time lags of both PM2.5 and PM10 between both stations, but much higher ratio of PM2.5 to PM10 for LH in comparison with YS. Meanwhile urban haze (UH) has a significant increase in PM2.5 only at Seoul as easily expected. Time scales (e-folding time) of aerosol light scattering coefficients for LH and UH are 6-12 hrs and 7-16 hrs, respectively calculated for several episodes according to the criteria developed, which eventually corresponds to spatial scale of 120 - 240 km, 140 - 320 km, respectively by assuming average boundary wind speed, 5.6 m/s (Anderson et al., 2003). In general, long-range transported hazes have larger temporal and spatial dimension (about meso-a scale) than domestic hazes, after carefully designed classification of haze episodes. These results can be an useful basis for the estimation of regional aerosol radiative forcings in East Asia.",

            "abstract": "The intensification of heat waves and of the hydrological cycle due to global climate change pose particularly high risks to urban residents. Cities are already hotter than their surroundings due to the urban heat island effect and are known to result in local intensification of rainfall and flooding due to their coupled impacts on the surface and the lower atmosphere. These interacting local and global changes can adversely affect the health and well being of urban residents, and city administrators are increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to the potential disruptions though various infrastructure and preparedness programs. However, as cities worldwide continue to expand, a key decision is how to manage that urban sprawl and regulate its spatial features to aid in the mitigation and adaptation effort.\nThis study assesses whether alternative zoning regulations that modify the density and extent of a metropolitan region, but have a minimal impact on total population and demographic growth, have an appreciable impact on its response to extreme weather events, and as such, whether they can be used to increase urban resilience. We consider Baltimore (the city and its surrounding suburbs), which in 1967 adopted one of the first urban growth boundaries (UGBs) in the United States, as our test case. Departing from the urban extent circa 1900, we create alternative land use patterns that, compared to the actual current land use baseline, would have resulted from drastically different policy scenarios and approaches to zoning that the city would have undertaken. We consider various alternatives where the city is smaller and denser, due to stricter regulation, versus larger and less dense than the actual baseline, while maintaining the same total population. Our findings indicate that lower densities have significant benefits: compared to the current landscape and to denser patterns, they reduce both extreme temperatures during heat waves and spatio-temporal rainfall peaks. While the particular findings hold for Baltimore and many cities with comparable climates, the conclusion that zoning laws and the resulting spatial patterns for urban density have important implications on a city’s response to changing climate and extreme weather are more broadly applicable.",

Developing a better understanding of the spatiotemporal variability and distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) across a mountain chain has significant societal implications particularly related to water resources and flooding. While orographic precipitation is known to be an important process in mountainous terrain, traditional methods for studying orography (e.g. using sparse in situ measurements over a historical record or distributed observations at a few snapshots in time) generally inhibit a full characterization of orographic processes in complex montane regions such as Sierra Nevada, California. A novel high-resolution spatially-distributed SWE reanalysis dataset is used here to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of SWE accumulation across the Sierra Nevada during water years 1985 to present. Orographic gradients in accumulated SWE are diagnosed at multiple temporal scales. A comparison of orographic processes, gradients, SWE volumes, and SWE accumulation rates is presented for windward versus leeward slopes and northern versus southern basins in the Sierra Nevada. The relationships between orographic enhancement and factors such as the underlying physiography and synoptic atmospheric conditions are investigated to explain variability in the seasonal and inter-annual SWE accumulation across the Sierra Nevada.",

Seawater from the Sea of Japan inflows through Sakai-strait, and river water flows through the Oohashi River into this lake. Lake Nakaumi is characterized with hypoxic and/or anoxic condition of bottom water derived with the distinct stratification of salinity in summer season. In this lake, a public project had been carried out for land reclamation since 1963. Honjo Area located to the north part of Lake Nakaumi, was semi-separated from Lake Nakaumi by reclamation dikes constructed for this project at 1981. However, this public project was aborted with the change of social conditions. To the effective utilization of the area, the partial removal of dike was carried out. Seawater from Sakai-strait flows directly into Honjo Area again. Environmental change of the lake is expected by this inflow of the seawater in Lake Nakaumi and Honjo Area after this restoration.\nIt is well known that the surface sediment reflects the environment of lake bottom. The organic matter and the sulfides in sediment are good indicators of sedimentation environment. In this study, we analyzed them by several methods and grasped the bottom environment of both areas after the removal of dikes. We examined the impact of the restoration to both areas by comparing the observations with the past data.\nSurface sediment samples in Lake Nakaumi and Honjo Area were obtained at 77 and 40 stations, respectively. We collected surface sediment (about 1cm) were for each station, and analyzed total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) as organic matter, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in pore water, total sulfide (TS) and acid volatile sulfide (AVS) as sulfides.\nTOC contents of Lake Nakaumi and Honjo Area range within 0.0-5.1% and 0.2-4.9%, respectively. TN contents range within 0.0-0.6 % and 0.1-0.6 %. TS contents range within 0.1-2.6% and 0.0-2.0 %. H2S contents range within 0.3-119.0 ppm and 0.5-140.4 ppm. AVS contents range within 0.0-9.4 mg/g and 0.0-5.1 mg/g.\nIn comparison between Lake Nakaumi and Honjo Area, the apparent difference was not detected in H2S and AVS contents, but there was a broad distinction in TS contents. This results shows that Honjo Area deposits significantly little FeS2 contents. It was thought that a difference in the form of sulfide showed a characteristic of Honjo Area.",

            "abstract": "Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are widespread prokaryotes which can navigate along the Earth’s magnetic field lines and produce tens to hundreds of nanocrystals of magnetite (Fe3O4) or/and greigite (Fe3S4) aligned in chain(s) within a cell. The remains of MTB (i.e. magnetofossils) within geological records have therefore been considered as potential recorders of paleomagnetic, paleoenvironmental and ancient-life signals. These intracellularly-formed nanocrystals, called magnetosomes, generally have distinctively physical, chemical and crystallographic features from those magnetic minerals produced by abiotic or extracellular mineralization processes, and therefore could be distinguished by rock magnetic and electron microscopic approaches. However, identification and quantification of magnetofossils from sediments or sedimentary rocks are nevertheless not straightforward not only due to their tiny sizes, relatively low concentration, always mixing with abiotic magnetic minerals, but also the chain collapse and crystal maghemization during post-depositional processes. Comprehensive studies on the biomineralization and fossilization of magnetosomes are therefore essential for unambiguously identifying and quantitating magnetofossils from geologic samples. In this presentation, we summarize the biomineralization processes and magnetic properties of magnetosome chains within modern cultured and uncultured MTB. Experimental studies on the effects of the chain aligning and collapsing on the magnetic properties of magnetosomes are discussed, which give useful clues to understand the possible occurrence of magnetofossils within natural materials and their corresponding magnetic changes. Recent findings in magnetofossils from marine and lake sediments, showing how to identify magnetofossils from sediments by using the comprehensive rock magnetism, ferromagnetic resonance, and transmission electron microscopy approaches, as well as their implications for sedimentary magnetism, and paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental processes will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) is one of the most developing technologies in smartphone and IT areas. While various applications have been developed using the AR, there are a few geological applications which adopt its advantages. In this study, a smartphone application to manage boreholes using AR has been developed. The application is consisted of three major modules, an AR module, a map module and a data management module. The AR module calculates the orientation of the device and displays nearby boreholes distributed in three dimensions using the orientation. This module shows the boreholes in a transparent layer on a live camera screen so the user can find and understand the overall characteristics of the underground geology. The map module displays the boreholes on a 2D map to show their distribution and the location of the user. The database module uses SQLite library which has proper characteristics for mobile platforms, and Binary XML is adopted to enable containing additional customized data. The application is able to provide underground information in an intuitive and refined forms and to decrease time and general equipment required for geological field investigations.",

            "abstract": "This study uses analogue experiments to examine the various factors that could influence the dynamic or arrest of a dike prior to an eruption. Dike propagation has been well-studied from the perspective of analogue experiments and it has been shown how various competing forces interact (buoyancy, viscosity, elastic properties, fracture toughness,…). It has been observed that dikes experience acceleration as they approach a free surface, which theoretically is due to increasing stress intensity as distance to the free surface decreases. Other unrelated studies analysed the constant-volume propagation of low-surface-energy liquids (e.g. hydrophilic liquids) in a semi-infinite medium and found the propagation rate to decelerate, as liquid gradually transferred from the head region to the tail and buoyancy abated. In contrast, high-surface-energy fluids transfer negligible quantities of their volume into the tail region, essentially maintain their volume, and experience no such deceleration.\nThis study focuses on the aforementioned factors influencing dike propagation, acceleration due to a free surface and deceleration due to head volume loss, to determine what their combined effect is on magma eruptability. As previous studies used hydrophobic liquids to investigate free-surface effects, and as magma is expected to have a low surface energy with the crust (they are both silicate), hydrophilic liquids (e.g. glucose syrup) are used in this study. Each experiment is arranged to have a free surface condition occupying half of the apparatus, and a no-slip condition occupying the other half, which allows for side-by-side comparison. The results are analysed to determine the minimum volume needed for a dike to erupt; failure to erupt implies that the dike would instead come to arrest in the crust.",

            "abstract": "This study aimed to re-evaluate tsunami hazard in Marmara Sea from earthquake and submarine landslide focusing on the coastal area of Istanbul. For the fault-generated tsunami, the seismic rupture can be propagated along the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) which have evidenced historical tsunami in Marmara Sea. Based on previous research studies, future scenarios are expected to generate tsunami as well as submarine landslide could be triggered by seismic motion which consider fault-generated tsunami and landslide-generated tsunami individually. However, this study want to simulate tsunami propagation generated from the combining earthquake-landslide sources. Therefore, the evaluation of tsunami hazard was discussed in both of the individual case and the combining case of earthquake and submarine landslide through numerical modelling of tsunami wave with mesh size 90 m of bathymetry data. A two-layer numerical model was employed to simulate the landslide-generated tsunami by modeling the interaction between tsunami and submarine landslide with different volume of initial slide. First, tsunami propagation was generated from earthquake sources of Rupture E in the eastern basin and Rupture W in the western basin of Marmara Sea with fault slip 5 m. For Rupture E and Rupture W, maximum tsunami height at shore shoreline could reach 3.4 m and 2.8 m respectively along the coastal area of Istanbul. For combining Rupture E and Rupture W, maximum tsunami height could reach 3.8 m which was a little higher than that of Rupture E. Then, tsunami propagation was generated from landslide sources in the southern neighborhood of Istanbul near Rupture E. For landslide volume of 0.15 m3, 0.6 m3, and 1.5 m3, maximum tsunami height at shore shoreline could reach 3.7 m, 6.9 m and 8.7 m respectively along the coastal area of Istanbul. It was shown that maximum tsunami height from landslide sources was higher than that from earthquake sources depending on the volume of initial slide significantly. Lastly, the combining earthquake-landslide sources are being processed to generate tsunami propagation in order to evaluate tsunami hazard, in which damage is being expected more serious than the landslide-generated tsunami. This combination can be a possible evaluation of tsunami hazard for future scenarios in Marmara Sea.",

            "abstract": "Marine aerosols constitute one of the most important natural aerosol systems globally and play an important role in global climate regulation and the marine biogenic system. One of the major constituents of the marine aerosol system is sea salt. Sea salt aerosols are produced via the bubble-bursting process resulting from whitecap generation (due to high wind speed). The resulting sea salt particles are of sub micrometre sizes and go up to a few micrometres. An increase in sea salt mass is primarily associated with increasing wind speeds. The increase in wind speed not only increases the mass concentration of the small-sized sea salt particles but also that of higher-sized particles. This behaviour is constrained by other factors like temperature and salinity.\nIn the present work, this variability in the change in mass concentration of sea salt aerosol is studied with respect to the wind speed variation over Bay of Bengal (BoB). This work includes measurements from two field experiments held on 2006 ((ICARB) March-April) and 2012 ((CTCZ) July-August) over BoB. An analysis of the mass concentration with the wind history showed the mass concentration increasing with the increase in wind speed. Here wind history is used instead of instantaneous wind speed, because it is a good indicator of dependence of mass concentrations on wind speed. However, the cruise held in 2012 showed the size of particles constraining to 2.5 µm unlike the cruise in 2006. This difference in the size of the particles formed is majorly due to change in salinity. In 2012, the cruise was during summer monsoon season wherein the high runoff associated with high precipitation lead to reduced salinity. Whereas in 2006, the cruise was in summer season during which high evaporation lead to increase in salinity. This shows that with lower salinity the sea salt particles formed will be of smaller size. This also shows that apart from wind speed, salinity also affects the sea salt production.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, environmental scientists have increasingly used low-cost sensors and custom software to gather and analyze environmental data. Included in this trend has been the use of imagery from field-mounted static digital cameras. Published literature has highlighted the challenge scientists have encountered with poor and problematic camera performance and power consumption, limited data download and wireless communication options, general ruggedness of off the shelf camera solutions, and time consuming and hard-to-reproduce digital image analysis options. Data loggers and sensors are typically limited to data storage in situ (requiring manual downloading) and/or expensive data streaming options.\nHere we highlight the features and functionality of a newly invented camera/data logger system and coupled image analysis software suited to plant and ecosystem phenological studies (patent pending). The camera has resulted from several years of development and prototype testing supported by several grants funded by the US NSF. These inventions have several unique features and functionality and have been field tested in desert, arctic, and tropical rainforest ecosystems.\nThe system can be used to acquire imagery/data from static and mobile platforms. Data is collected, preprocessed, and streamed to the cloud without the need of an external computer and can run for extended time periods. The camera module is capable of acquiring RGB, IR, and thermal (LWIR) data and storing it in a variety of formats including RAW. The system is full customizable with a wide variety of passive and smart sensors. The camera can be triggered by state conditions detected by sensors and/or select time intervals. The device includes USB, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, serial, GSM, Ethernet, and Iridium connections and can be connected to commercial cloud servers such as Dropbox.\nThe complementary image analysis software is compatible with all popular operating systems. Imagery can be viewed and analyzed in RGB, HSV, and l*a*b color space. Users can select a spectral index, which have been derived from published literature and/or choose to have analytical output reported as separate channel strengths for a given color space. Results of the analysis can be viewed in a plot and/or saved as a .csv file for additional analysis and visualization.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic mineral diagenesis occurs in all sedimentary environments to varying extents; however, non-steady state diagenesis is relatively poorly understood. We present results of a high-resolution multi-proxy analysis of a hemipelagic sediment core from the western Pacific Ocean in which large down-core magnetic property fluctuations broadly correlate with geochemical and sedimentological variations. Localized stratigraphic intervals of enhanced relative magnetic mineral preservation are linked to millennial-scale variations in supply of organic carbon that gave rise to non-steady state diagenetic variations. We provide the first direct microscopic observations of fine-grained magnetic mineral inclusions that were protected against sulfidic dissolution by their coarse-grained silicate host minerals, and demonstrate that magnetic mineral diagenesis was modulated by millennial-scale environmental and climatic variability. Such environmentally modulated diagenesis is likely to be common in organic-rich marine sedimentary environments with high deposition rates. Non-steady state diagenesis is an important process that can drive modification of magnetic mineral concentration in many types of studies, including high-resolution paleoenvironmental reconstructions, tracing of terrigenous mineral provenance and relative paleointensity analyses. We also present a lagged marine diagenetic record of Asian monsoon intensity. A ~3-5 ka offset between climate and diagenetic response arises from the downward diffusion of pore fluids during diagenesis. Correlation of the diagenetic signature in our record with Heinrich events supports previous hypotheses of teleconnections between the Asian monsoon and North Atlantic climatic events.",

The presence of the gray zone is a problem for numerical weather prediction (NWP) practitioners, both in a research and operational capacity. Generally, the gray zone is considered to span from O(100 m) to O(1 km), however these limits are just approximations. The inadequacies of turbulence models in the gray zone has been shown to have a considerable influence on resolved-scale dynamics. As computational resources become more available, higher resolution atmospheric models are inevitable, so it is important that guidelines exist for choosing an appropriate grid-resolution. Here we consider the behavior of LES closures at intermediate resolutions and deduce some basic criteria for a properly-resolved atmospheric LES. Idealized scenarios for convective and sheared atmospheric cases are considered first, followed by a real case in the Southern Great Plains. ",

            "abstract": "Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a low adsorptive, polar, sulfonamide antibiotic, widely present in aquatic environments. Degradation of SMX in subsurface porous media is spatially and temporally variable, depending on various environmental factors such as in situ redox potential, availability of nutrients, local soil characteristics, and temperature. It has been reported that SMX is better degraded under anoxic conditions and by co-metabolism processes. In this work, we first develop a conceptual model of degradation of SMX under different redox conditions (denitrification and iron reducing conditions), and second, we construct a mathematical model that allows reproducing different experiments of SMX degradation reported in the literature. The conceptual model focuses on the molecular behavior and contemplates the formation of different metabolites. The model was validated using the experimental data from Barbieri et al. (2012) and Mohatt et al. (2011). It adequately reproduces the reversible degradation of SMX under the presence of nitrite as an intermediate product of denitrification. In those experiments degradation was mediated by the transient formation of a diazonium cation, which was considered responsible of the substitution of the amine radical by a nitro radical, forming the 4-nitro-SMX. The formation of this metabolite is a reversible process, so that once the concentration of nitrite was back to zero due to further advancement of denitrification, the concentration of SMX was fully recovered. The forward reaction, formation of 4-nitro SMX, was modeled considering a kinetic of second order, whereas the backward reaction, dissociation of 4-nitro-SMX back to the original compound, could be modeled with a first order degradation reaction. Regarding the iron conditions, SMX was degraded due to the oxidation of iron (Fe2+), which was previously oxidized from goethite due to the degradation of a pool of labile organic carbon. As the oxidation of iron occurred on the goethite surface, the best model to reproduce the SMX reduction was a power law rate. Our model is an attempt to properly formulate the degradation process of an emerging compound considering the real degradation mechanisms, rather than using an upscaled black-box approach based only on the reported concentrations in a given experiment.",

I will first discuss the simulations of the initiation and propagation of 6 consecutive AEWs in late August 2006 and the mean state of the African easterly jet (AEJ) over both Africa and downstream in the tropical Atlantic. By comparing our simulations with NCEP analysis and satellite data (e.g., TRMM), it is shown that the statistical characteristics of individual AEWs are realistically simulated with larger errors in the 5th and th AEWs. Results from the sensitivity experiments suggest the following: 1) accurate\nrepresentations of non-linear interactions between the atmosphere and land processes are crucial for\nimproving the simulations of the AEWs and the AEJ; 2) improved simulations of an individual AEW\nand its interaction with local environments (e.g., the Guinea Highlands) could provide determinism for\nhurricane formation downstream. Of interest is the potential to extend the lead time for predicting\nhurricane formation (e.g., a lead time of up to 22 days) as the 4th AEW is realistically simulated; 3)\nhowever, the dependence of AEW simulations on accurate dynamic and surface initial conditions and\nboundary conditions poses a challenge in simulating their modulation on hurricane activity. In addition to the simulations of AEWs, I will also present the 30-day simulations of selected MJO cases.",

            "abstract": "Vertical crustal displacements over seasonal and inter-annual time scale are mostly associated with variations of surface loading from atmospheric pressure, ocean bottom pressure and terrestrial water storage. Observing crustal displacement and understanding its causes are important for studies of global changes and crustal stress and strain. In this study, we examine vertical crustal displacement in the Korean Peninsula with GPS observations and model predictions. We use 10 permanent GPS stations data during 10 years (Jan. 1, 2005 ~ Dec. 31, 2014) and estimate their positioning time series based on Precise Point Positioning (PPP). Vertical crustal displacements at the GPS stations are also modeled from surface loading data. For atmospheric pressure loading, we combine in-situ data observed by Korean Meteorological Agency (KMA) and ECMWF model output. Since ocean bottom pressure loading is likely important in the Peninsula, we also use ECCO ocean bottom pressure data. We find that the vertical displacements observed by GPS show strong seasonal variations (40~50 mm), and they are in good agreement with model predictions from atmospheric and ocean bottom pressure. In addition, ocean bottom pressure contribution to the vertical displacement is much larger than atmospheric effect due to large seasonal variations of ocean bottom pressure in the Yellow sea.",

EarthScope magnetotelluric data has been inverted to create a 3D resistivity model that shows remnants of the plume to depths of at least 150 km. The mantle plume remnants are imaged as a body of highly conductive material in the lithosphere. It is focused below western Lake Superior and northwestern Wisconsin, and elongated in a NW-SE direction, consistent with plate motion vectors. Recent seismic velocity models from EarthScope data also show an anomaly at this location. The presence of a plume after so much time has passed invites many questions regarding the long-term stability of conductive materials, the thickness of the lithosphere, and the stability of sub-craton mantle over long time periods. The resistivity model also shows features defining the length of the MCR as well as the Grenville orogeny.

            "abstract": "Although hillslope evolution has occupied geoscientists for over a century, the effect of climate on the morphology of soil-mantled, transport-limited hillslopes remained poorly-constrained. In this study we utilize numerical simulations of volcanic cinder cones in the Golan Heights (Eastern Mediterranean) to estimate soil creep efficiency across a strong north-to-south gradient in mean annual precipitation (1100-500 mm). Our model utilizes the cinder cone initial hillslope profile (constrained by the dip of the ash layers), the current hillslope profile (measured with cm scale accuracy) and the known eruption age (K-Ar and Ar-Ar constraints) to predict the best-fit final hillslope profile by changing the soil creep diffusion coefficient. Hillslope evolution is described using a diffusion equation.\nOur results indicate that the best-fit soil creep diffusion coefficient varies from 0.5 to 7 m2/kyr. Soil diffusivity depends on both climate (precipitation) and aspect-related microclimate as the diffusion coefficient decreases with mean annual precipitation and is higher on south facing hillslopes. This climate dependency seems to reflect an increase in the apparent soil cohesion at higher precipitation rates due to vegetation coverage (the density of root networks) which co-varies with rainfall and aspect. We demonstrate this strong co-variance utilizing the spatial distribution of NDVI vegetation index calculated from ASTER images. In addition, 650-750 kyr cinder cones display lower diffusion coefficient relative to late Pleistocene cinder cones (120-150 kyr). This temporal variance may reflect the unique climatic conditions of the last glacial and inter-glacial period. Future analysis of additional cones is expected to contribute further to our understanding of hillslope form-process relation and the morphologic signature of climate.",

            "abstract": "Seismic moment tensors can aid the discrimination between earthquakes and explosions. However, the isotropic component can be found in a large number of earthquakes simply as a consequence of earthquake location, poorly modeled structure or noise in the data. Recently, we have developed a method for moment tensor inversion, capable of retrieving parameter uncertainties together with their optimal values, using probabilistic Bayesian inference. It has been applied to data from a complex volcanic environment in the Long Valley Caldera (LVC), California, and confirmed a large isotropic source component. We now extend the application to two different environments where the existence of non-double-couple source components is likely.\nThe method includes notable treatment of the noise, utilizing pre-event noise to estimate the noise covariance matrix. This is extended throughout the inversion, where noise variance is a “hyperparameter” that determines the level of data fit. On top of that, different noise parameters for each station are used as weights, naturally penalizing stations with noisy data. In the LVC case, this means increasing the amount of information from two stations at moderate distances, which results in a 1 km deeper estimate for the source location. This causes a change in the non-double-couple components in the inversions assuming a simple diagonal or exponential covariance matrix, but not in the inversion assuming a more complicated, attenuated cosine covariance matrix.\nCombining a sophisticated noise treatment with a powerful Bayesian inversion technique can give meaningful uncertainty estimates for long-period (20-50 s) data, provided an appropriate regional structure model.",

            "abstract": "Surface fluxes from land surface models (LSM) have traditionally been evaluated against monthly, seasonal or annual mean states. Previous studies have noted the limited ability of LSMs to reproduce observed evaporative fluxes under water-stressed conditions but very few studies have systematically evaluated LSMs during rainfall deficits. We investigate the performance of the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) LSM in simulating latent heat fluxes in offline mode. CABLE is evaluated against eddy covariance measurements of latent heat flux across 20 flux tower sites at sub-annual to inter-annual time scales, with a focus on model performance during seasonal-scale rainfall deficits. The importance of key model processes in capturing the latent heat flux is explored by employing alternative representations of hydrology, soil properties, leaf area index and stomatal conductance. We demonstrate the critical role of hydrological processes for capturing observed declines in latent heat. The effects of soil, LAI and stomatal conductance are shown to be highly site-specific. The default CABLE performs reasonably well at annual scales despite grossly underestimating latent heat during rainfall deficits, highlighting the importance for evaluating models explicitly under water-stressed conditions across multiple vegetation and climate regimes. A new version of CABLE, with a more physically consistent representation of hydrology, captures the variation in the latent heat flux during seasonal-scale rainfall deficits better than earlier versions but remaining deficiencies point to future research needs.",

            "abstract": "To better understand the variations in phytoplankton biomass and community composition associated with water-column structure and environmental conditions in the East/Japan Sea (EJS), three cruses were carried out along a meridional transect in May 2007 (spring), July 2009 (summer), and October 2012 (fall). The subpolar front (SPF) was formed between warm and cold water mass (37–40 °N). Chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton community composition were studied using HPLC pigment and CHEMTAX analysis and the results showed no significant differences between warm and cold water masses. These results reject our initial hypothesis that different water masses between southern and northern parts of the EJS may lead to different phytoplankton community structure. During the study periods, isotherm layers (≤ 12 °C) fluctuated over 50 m depth between warm and cold water masses on the basis of the SPF. In contrast, the nitracline (i.e. 2.5 μM nitrate isopleths) depth was recorded within the limited depths ranged 20–40 m, 30–50 m, and 40–60 m in spring, summer, and fall, respectively. The chlorophyll a concentrations at the subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCM) in spring and summer (356 ± 233 and 270 ± 182 ng L–1, respectively) were significantly higher than those in fall (117 ± 89 ng L–1). The relative contributions of phytoplankton groups to total chlorophyll a concentration reflected phytoplankton community composition in the SCM layer with showing a dominance of diatoms (58 ± 19, 48 ± 11, and 30 ± 20 % in spring, summer, and fall, respectively). High contribution of diatoms to total biomass may enhance the efficiency of biological pump in the EJS. In addition, canonical correspondence analysis revealed a clear distribution of phytoplankton groups associated with temperature and nutrient concentration which mean prevalence of vertical variation. Finally, our findings suggested that phytoplankton biomass and groups are regulated by surface mixed layer depth and nutricline depth.",

            "abstract": "Currently, hydropower accounts for 16% of the worldwide electricity power supply and 86% of the total renewable electricity energy source due to its low cost, low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, and relatively high reliability. It is well known that the global hydropower has not yet been fully developed, but the future paths of development and corresponding contribution to GHG mitigation in each region combined with socioeconomic activities are less known. Here we investigated following three questions. How much will hydropower generation increase in the future? Will hydropower generation reach the economically exploitable capability (EEC)? If this will be the case, when and where will it occur? How much GHG emission will be reduced by adding new hydropower? In order to address these questions, we used the AIM/CGE model, a dynamic computable general equilibrium model to quantify the global hydropower development paths and corresponding GHG mitigation contribution for 17 regions in the world associated with a socio-economic scenario termed SSP2. We compared two scenarios with different assumptions on EEC. One is BAU which takes EEC from the report of “World Energy Resources”, the other is FIX_BAU which fix EEC at the current hydropower generation amount throughout the research period (2005-2100) or no additional installation of hydropower plants. The comparison between two scenarios indicated that promoting hydropower development contributed to GHG emission reduction globally but the magnitude varied by region. For example we found that in North Africa, hydropower development grew fast because of the rapid economic development, but it reached EEC as soon as in 2040 because of limitation in EEC due to its climatic and geographical conditions. Conversely, in Brazil, it grew steadily and did not reach its abundant EEC. Consequently, GHG mitigation contribution of North Africa is far less than Brazil. This research provides important information for policy makers to realize the contribution potential of hydropower to mitigation.",

The EARS, an active continental rift zone, appears to be a developing tectonic plate boundary and thus, has a number of active as well as dormant volcanoes throughout its extent. These volcanic centers can be used as potential sources for geothermal energy. The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and the GDC deployed seismic sensors to monitor several volcanic centers: Menengai, Silali, and Paka, and Korosi. We identify microseismic, local events, and tilt like events using automatic detection algorithms and manual review to identify potential local earthquakes within our seismic network. We then perform the double-difference location method of local magnitude less than two to image the boundary of the magma chamber and the conduit feeding the volcanoes. In the process of locating local seismicity, we also identify long-period, explosion, and tremor signals that we interpret as magma passing through conduits of the magma chamber and/or fluid being transported as a function of magma movement or hydrothermal activity. We used waveform inversion and S-wave shear wave splitting to approximate the orientation of the local stresses from the vent or fissure-like conduit of the volcano. The microseismic events and long period events will help us interpret the activity of the volcanoes. Our goal is to investigate basement structures beneath the volcanoes and identify the extent of magmatic modifications of the crust. Overall, these seismic techniques will help us understand magma movement and volcanic processes in the region.",

            "abstract": "Large earthquakes may directly connect tectonic activity and chemical fluxes because they trigger landslides that supply fresh minerals for chemical weathering, at the same time that earthquakes and landslides influence the hydrological pathways that regulate solute production. But connections between earthquakes and continental dissolved chemical fluxes have yet to be clearly observed. Here we show increases in the concentration of silicate-derived dissolved ions and in the dissolved 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios in the Min Jiang (Yangtze river, with >20,000 km2 basin area) following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake along the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Specifically, we find large changes in the Na/Ca ratio of the dissolved load of the Min Jiang that represent a ~4x increase in the flux of cations from chemical weathering of silicate minerals above pre-earthquake values. We suggest that this change reflects a significant, earthquake-driven increase in the silicate-derived alkalinity that removes carbon dioxide from the ocean-atmosphere system over geologic timescales. Post-earthquake changes in Min Jiang solute chemistry extend beyond the region of co-seismic landslide activity, suggesting that large-scale hydrologic changes inferred for this earthquake play at least a significant role in driving the observed hydrochemical patterns. Our new empirical evidence demonstrates that a large earthquake can substantially alter river solute chemistry at the continental scale and thus points to a potential mechanistic link between tectonic activity, which regulates earthquake frequency, and fluxes of alkalinity from weathering.",

            "abstract": "The Onion Butte (OB) and Barkley Mountain (BM) groups comprise two linear arrays of volcanic domes at a high angle to the Cascade arc axis (40 km SW of Lassen Volcanic Center). These groups have atypical petrographic and geochemical characteristics compared to other lithologies in the Lassen area. Petrographically, both groups are sparsely phyric containing hornblende and pyroxene, but lacking plagioclase; disequilibrium textures are not observed. The OB group is composed of dacite (64.0-65.2wt. % SiO2) characterized by high Sr (> 1000ppm), with low 87Sr/86Sr (<0.7040), high (Sr/P)N (2.8-3.5), no Eu anomaly, and moderate (La/Yb)N (11-23). The BM group is composed of basaltic andesite to andesite (53.6-62.3wt. % SiO2) characterized by lower Sr (354-611ppm), but higher 87Sr/86Sr (>0.7040), low (Sr/P)N (1.1-2.1), no Eu anomaly, and moderate (La/Yb)N (4.6-11.8). The distinctive characteristics of these two groups mirror those of the two end members of calc-alkaline primitive basalts recognized in the Lassen region (high Sr/P vs. low Sr/P). We invoke different sources and processes to explain the origin and evolution of these groups. The BM basaltic andesites are likely derived from fractionation of low Sr/P basalts and the BM andesites are successfully modeled by fractional crystallization of BM basaltic andesites with a fractionating assemblage that contains <10% plagioclase. In contrast, the OB dacites share geochemical characteristics with some adakites, suggesting an origin by partial melting of the subducting slab. However, partial melting models of the subducting Gorda plate at eclogite facies conditions failed to reproduce the observed trends of the OB dacites. Partial melting of an amphibolitic lower arc crust with a source composition similar to high Sr/P calc-alkaline basalts successfully reproduces observed trends. Geochemical characteristics and results from modeling suggest Sr concentrations may be a useful source indicator in the Lassen region.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring of potential leakages and its effect on the soil environment are essential to ensure long term feasibility of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. When high concentration of CO2 is leaked into the soil system, the soil chemical environment will be changed. We hypothesized that soil pH will decrease sharply in response to the high soil CO2, but we also expect that it would gradually resume because of the buffering capacity of the soil. The mechanisms of the soil’s buffering capacity could be dissolution of carbonate minerals and organic matter, which could result in production of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) in the soil and leachate. In addition, changes in cation exchange capacity (CEC) induced by high CO2 can lead to mobilization of base cations due to replacement by H+, Al3+ and Mn2+. This study aims at investigating changes in soil leachate chemical parameters when the soil was injected with 100% CO2 for four weeks (28 days). Custom made plexiglass pots (30 cm × 20 cm × 20 cm) have been filled with organic rich soil (10 cmm depth) overlaid with mineral soil (15 cm). The pots were injected with 100% CO2 at a flow rate of 400 cm3 min-1. Separate control groups were made with no injection and N2 injection. All the treatments have 9 replicates. The 300 ml of tap water was watered down in the pots three times a week. Leachates collected are analyzed for the soil pH and EC. Leachates are filtered through 0.2 µm membranes for analysis of DOC, DIC, and metal concentrations. After 4 wk of incubation, organic and mineral soils will be destructively sampled and analyzed for total organic and inorganic carbon and CEC. Knowledge of changes in leachate chemistry will allow us to quantify the mobilization of chemical parameters in well-drained soils under the potential influence of high soil CO2. Furthermore, effect on leaching may give indirect information about consequent changes in groundwater chemistry.",

            "abstract": "The aim of present study is finding a method to control sediment erosion at river confluence. The confluences are mixture of two different flows and are common occurrences along the river. River confluences are sites of natural scour phenomenon and also influence reservoir sedimentation. The river confluence is associated with a separation zone, stagnation zone and a mixing layer along which the scour hole is observed. The eroded sediment creates potential problems by depositing at unwanted downstream locations such as barrages, weirs, check dams, reservoirs etc. As per the literature, the storage capacity of major reservoirs in India is going to be reduced nearly half of the storage capacity by 2020. Hence, an experimental study has been conducted on mobile bed (d50=0.28 mm) with a confluence angle of 90o for a discharge ratio (Qr) of 0.5, where, Qr is defined as the ratio between lateral flow discharge (Ql) and main flow discharge (Qm). Circular shape pile models of same diameter are arranged in a systematic manner with constant spacing (5 cm, 10 cm and 15 cm) to change the flow pattern for reducing scour at the confluence. Two types of pile models (8 mm ϕ and 12 mm ϕ) are used to conduct the experiments. The experimental results show that maximum scour depth at confluence is reduced by 60%. In addition, the bed profile modifications are also reported.\nKeywords: Reservoir sedimentation, River confluence, Mobile bed, Scour, Vanes.\n ",

            "abstract": "From aftershocks of the 24 August 2014 Mw 6.0 South Napa earthquake, we observe prominent fault-zone trapped waves (FZTWs) along two 1.9-km-long seismic arrays that were deployed across the northernmost projection (array 1) and the southern part (array 2) of the surface rupture of the West Napa Fault Zone (WNFZ). We also observe FZTWs on an array (array 3) deployed south of the Carquinez Straits across the intersection of the Franklin and Southhampton faults, which appear to be southward continuations of the WNFZ. Arrays 1 and 2 consisted of 20 three-component, short-period seismographs, and array 3, which was 900 m long, consisted of 10 of the same seismographs. We analyzed waveforms from 55 aftershocks in both time and frequency to characterize the fault damage zone associated with the Mw 6.0 South Napa earthquake. Post-S-wave durations of the FZTWs increase with epicentral distances and focal depths from the recording arrays, suggesting a low-velocity waveguide along the WNFZ at depths in excess of 5-6 km. Locations of the aftershocks that generated the FZTWs and 3-D finite-difference simulations demonstrate that the subsurface rupture zone has a remarkable velocity reduction of ~40-50% between arrays 1 and 2, coincident with the ~14-km-long mapped surface rupture zone and a ~500-m-wide deformation zone. The low-velocity waveguide associated with the WNFZ extends further southward to at least array 3, but with a more moderate velocity reduction of 30-35%. The waveguide effect appears to have localized and amplified ground shaking along the WNFZ and along faults farther to the south, consistent with the observations of Baltay and Boatwright (2015). Thus, we suggest that during future major earthquakes, the wave-guide effect may result in localized amplification, extended ground shaking, and increased damage along the WNFZ and its extensions further to the south, even if the surface rupture is limited to only a portion of the WNFZ. Broad-band recordings near the WNFZ for teleseismic earthquakes are in waveform analysis for more information on the deep structure of fault damage zone.",

            "abstract": "Atom interferometers have demonstrated a high sensitivity to accelerations and rotations. This enables their application in gravimetry, creating a new type of instrument for continuous absolute gravity measurements. The Gravimetric Atom Interferometer (GAIN) is a mobile atom interferometer based on interfering ensembles of laser-cooled Rb-87 atoms in an atomic fountain configuration. It has been specifically designed for on-site measurements of the absolute value of g as well as continuous recordings.\nHigh precision applications in geodesy and geophysics, e.g. land uplift near the zero-line, require terrestrial gravimetric measurements with an accuracy of a few tens of a nm/s2 and even lower. Currently, these tasks are performed by classical free-fall absolute (AG) and superconducting gravimeters (SG). The operation of both types of instruments is to some degree interdependent, because AGs are used for SG calibration and drift determination, and SG measurements can improve AG measurements for environmental effects and provide observed tidal parameters. As SGs are operated continuously over extended periods of time, they are also used to determine the long term stability of AGs and identify offsets after repairs or upgrades. Atom interferometers potentially combine the applications of AG and SG by drift-free recording of absolute g.\nWe present the current state of the development of GAIN and the advances made between two campaigns at the geodetic observatories in Wettzell, Germany, in 2013 and Onsala, Sweden, in 2015. Comparisons with the SG and the FG5X-220 show the improvement of precision and of absolute accuracy. GAIN values agree with the FG5X-220 ones at the level of 50-60 nm/s2. The RMS of the difference of GAIN and OSG-54 measurements in Onsala is 5 nm/s2 at an averaging time of 30 minutes. ",

            "abstract": "Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) phenomena represent one of the major components of space weather. Often, but not exclusively associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), they pose a significant scientific as well as practical interest. As these particles originate at such explosive events, they have energies up to several GeV. SEP may cause disruptions in operations of space instruments and spacecrafts and are dangerous to astronauts. For this reason, studies of SEP events and predictions of their impact are of great importance.\nThe motion and acceleration of SEP, though kinetic in nature, is governed by Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) and its disturbances. Therefore, a consistent and accurate simulation and predictive tool must include a realistic MHD model of IMF. At the same time, transport of SEP is essentially one-dimensional as at high energies particles are tied to magnetic field lines. This allows building a model that can effectively map active regions on the solar surface onto various regions of the Solar System thus predicting the affected regions of the at any distance from the Sun.\nWe present the first attempt to construct a model that employs coupling of MHD and kinetic models. The former describes the evolution of IMF disturbed by CME, while the latter simulates particles moving along the field lines extracted from MHD model. The first results are provided.",

            "abstract": "Contrary to other coastal cities (Mumbai, Chennai, Bhubaneswar etc.) in India, Kolkata, the largest city of India until 1990, has been showing a persistent trend of out-migration over the last decade. The situation is more paradoxical when compared to Dhaka in Bangladesh, the other coastal city in Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta. Exacerbating impacts of Climate Change like accelerated sea level rise, impact of cyclones, rising temperature and high rainfall events and waterlogging, vis-à-vis the density of poor population in slums, Kolkata has been assessed as one of the most vulnerable cities of the world. However, Kolkata has long been a preferred destination for migrants for its port based economy, existence of industrial belt with labour intensive industries. The city and its surrounding districts attracted a massive influx of trans-border migrants when India and Bangladesh gained Independence in 1947 and 1971 respectively. The paper attempts to explore reasons behind the present trend of depopulation in the erstwhile preferred migration destination.\nThis paper distinguishes between ‘Kolkata City’ (census district) with 4.5 million residents and ‘Kolkata Megacity’ which encompasses also the peri-urban areas and home to almost 14.1 million people according to Census 2011.\nAnalysing migration as an ongoing research activity under DECCMA project, an overall ‘in-migration’ pattern can be deciphered in Kolkata ‘megacity’. On the contrary, the Kolkata ‘city’ located right in the heart of the megacity exhibits negative net migration (-5.11%) i.e. high ‘out-migration’. Plausible causes can be movement of people from Kolkata ‘city’ to peri-urban areas and satellite towns (urban to urban migration) probably due to closure of labour intensive industries, comparatively lower land prices, availability of space and accommodation, lower costs of living, development of different modes of commutation and communication. Further growth of population in the Kolkata Megacity area is accomplished by rural to urban migration from vulnerable areas of Sundarban. Thus in spite of the declining population in Kolkata city, Kolkata megacity is emerging as a ‘major setting of human habitation’ in a 21st century world stressed by climate change.",

We found seismograms recorded after passing below the southern part of the Hida Mountain Range show longer peak delay than those recorded before passing below the region, while there are no clear difference in peak delay for pairs of seismograms before and after passing below Tateyama volcano. It suggests that causes of the attenuation beneath Tateyama volcano and the southern part of the Hida Mountain Range are different.\nWe used the peak delay values to evaluate the strength of intrinsic absorption.

            "abstract": "Many geophysical phenomena, such as mantle convection, dynamic topography, geoid undulations, and plate motions, arise as a balance between driving gravitational forces and resisting viscous stresses within the Earth's mantle. A good characterization of the present-day buoyancy field of the mantle would allow for tighter constraints on its viscosity. It is possible to derive an estimate for the present-day buoyancy field of the mantle using seismically-derived global tomographic models together with thermodynamically self-consistent models of mantle mineralogy. However, given the uncertainties affecting both seismic and mineralogical models, different choices can be made, which lead to different estimates. Here we explore some of the possible endmembers, looking at the different buoyancy structure they produce and the different implications they have for the dynamic Earth.",

            "abstract": "Data capture is an important process in the research lifecycle. Complete descriptive and representative information of the data or database is necessary during data collection whether in the field or in the research lab. The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Public Access Plan (2015) mandates the need for federally funded projects to make their research data more openly available. Developing, implementing, and integrating metadata workflows into to the research process of the data lifecycle facilitates improved data access while also addressing interoperability challenges for the geosciences such as data description and representation. Lack of metadata or data curation can contribute to (1) semantic, (2) ontology, and (3) data integration issues within and across disciplinary domains and projects. Some researchers of EarthCube funded projects have identified these issues as gaps. These gaps can contribute to interoperability data access, discovery, and integration issues between domain-specific and general data repositories. Academic Research Libraries have expertise in providing long-term discovery and access through the use of metadata standards and provision of access to research data, datasets, and publications via institutional repositories. Metadata crosswalks, open archival information systems (OAIS), trusted-repositories, data seal of approval, persistent URL, linking data, objects, resources, and publications in institutional repositories and digital content management systems are common components in the library discipline. These components contribute to a library perspective on data access and discovery that can benefit the geosciences. The USGS Community for Data Integration (CDI) has developed the Science Support Framework (SSF) for data management and integration within its community of practice for contribution to improved understanding of the Earth's physical and biological systems. The USGS CDI SSF can be used as a reference model to map to EarthCube Funded projects with academic research libraries facilitating the data and information assets components of the USGS CDI SSF via institutional repositories and/or digital content management. This session will explore the USGS CDI SSF for cross-discipline collaboration considerations from a library perspective.",

            "abstract": "The development of hurricane Karl in 2010 was investigated with dropsonde and airborne radio occultation (ARO) measurements from the stage of tropical disturbance within an easterly wave through to genesis of the tropical storm. Infrared imagery showed deep convection with extensive cold cloud tops on 11 September however the storm failed to develop until 3 days later. One possible explanation is the horizontal offset of the mid and lower level circulation centers. We illustrate with airborne radio occultation measurements additional information on the moisture distribution during this stage of development that indicates that average mid-level moisture was lower the following day and then increased again over the next two days prior to development. High sample rate RF data recorded by the GNSS instrument system for multistatic and occultation sensing (GISMOS) was analyzed with a version of the Purdue Software Receiver that has open-loop tracking implemented. Open loop tracking eliminates the feedback loop of conventional receivers that fails in the complex signal propagation environment typical of atmosphere with sharp moisture gradients. The open-loop excess phase profiles routinely sample below 4 km, with half of the profiles extending below 2 km. We retrieve slanted vertical profiles of atmospheric refractivity that can be considered a proxy for moisture in this tropical environment. We illustrate that in the mid to upper troposphere, ARO refractivity profiles sampling different areas within the tropical wave showed characteristics that were consistent with (~150 to 200 km scale) horizontal moisture gradients present in the NWP model representation of the developing tropical storm. Variation in refractivity preceding the development of the pre-Karl system is consistent with increasing moisture near the storm center. The ARO observations almost double the amount of thermodynamic data over that provided by the dropsondes. They provide interesting complementary measurements that sample regions off the flight path, which in some cases could not be sampled by dropsondes because of unsafe flying conditions due to deep convection. We discuss current challenges with geometric optics retrieval methods, which can produce biases in the lower troposphere, and some possible improvements.",

            "abstract": "InSAR is a relatively new technique with a high potential in earth observation, which has made great success in monitoring urban areas deformation. At present, although there are a considerable number of applications in the complicated mountain areas, it is hard to obtain sufficiently high-density stable point targets in these regions. So scientists have been trying to solve this bottleneck problem and improve accuracy in mountain areas.\nIn this work, we present the landslide measurement result in complicated topographic region using ALOS/PALSAR data. The test area is selected around highlands of the boundary between China and India. We choose 13 scenes of ALOS/PALSAR images from May 2007 to February 2011. The main landforms in this experimental region are bare rock and soil, ice and snow, the vegetation in the alpine area. Due to the lithology of the strata and the undulations extent of the terrain, it is prone to cause landslides in the event of rainfall, earthquakes, snow melt or human activities.\nThe traditional PS algorithm has a higher requirement for a long time series data collection, especially in low-coherence area of vegetation cover. As the collected data and stable points are relatively less in this experimental area, we plan to study the time series InSAR analysis coherence model and error model, and extend its application to the extra-urban regions. The approach has been carried out to increase the density of stable points, which are mainly distributed on the top of mountain and ridge areas. And using the 13 images we find several subsidence areas by this technique. The result shows that the top of mountain is relatively stable and the suspected landslide areas are mainly along the ridge, which is in accordance with the actual situation. Then the mechanism and stability analysis of landslide is discussed. Meanwhile, some other measurement data in experimental area is available for cross validation, such as optical data and TerraSAR-X data. And a comparative study of the different data is analyzed as well. This study will extend time series InSAR analysis to landslide monitoring, fault deformation and other geological science research applications. Moreover, this research is also conducive to monitor the periodical changes of surface and climatic and environmental changes over time.",

The 5m DEM, which administered by central government, was used to obtain cross-sections from third and fourth order river of 10 main drainages in Taiwan with an interval of 140 to 150 m.\nWe designed a Cross-Sectional Complex-Index (Ics) to determine the morphological complexity and quantify the degrees of wide-shallow for each sections. This index can be applied to define the location of notch, because it can be knew form river regime that a notch is defined as a narrow-deep cross-section and narrow-deep and relatively large slope to adjacent reach. Therefore, this study defined notch index (Inotch) as the gradient divided by cross-sectional complex-index, and applied it to present the distribution of notch-type sections in study drainages, and the results of field investigation in 22 site showed that a section can be defined as notch while Inotch is lager then 60. The distribution of notch in a drainage shown that the notch which conform our quantitative definitions almost concentrated into several reaches intersecting with some broad-shallow section, and the gradient of these reaches are between 2% to 3%. Therefore, we can define that these reaches are the transition reaches between river and torrent.\nThere are 54 sites of transition reach in our study drainages, 80% of the sites had a watershed area within a range of 2000 to 6000 ha. It proof that our method can define transition reach effectively and consistently. In addition, because of the type of disaster is collapse and debris flow in torrent and flood damages in river. It can be found that type of disaster are derived from the river morphology. Therefore, our method and result can be applied to determine the disaster type and strategic planning of disaster prevention as a reference.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice is changing, and for improving the understanding of the cryosphere, data is needed to describe the status and processes controlling current seasonal sea ice growth, change and decay. We present preliminary results from in-situ observations on sea ice in the Arctic Basin north of Svalbard from January to June 2015. Over that time, the Norwegian research vessel «Lance» was moored to in total four ice floes, drifting with the sea ice and allowing an international group of scientists to conduct detailed research. Each drift lasted until the ship reached the marginal ice zone and ice started to break up, before moving further north and starting the next drift. The ship stayed within the area approximately 80°-83° N and 5°-25° E. While the expedition covered measurements in the atmosphere, the snow and sea ice system, and in the ocean, as well as biological studies, in this presentation we focus on physics of snow and sea ice. Different ice types could be investigated: young ice in refrozen leads, first year ice, and old ice. Snow surveys included regular snow pits with standardized measurements of physical properties and sampling. Snow and ice thickness were measured at stake fields, along transects with electromagnetics, and in drillholes. For quantifying ice physical properties and texture, ice cores were obtained regularly and analyzed. Optical properties of snow and ice were measured both with fixed installed radiometers, and from mobile systems, a sledge and an ROV. For six weeks, the surface topography was scanned with a ground LIDAR system. Spatial scales of surveys ranged from spot measurements to regional surveys from helicopter (ice thickness, photography) during two months of the expedition, and by means of an array of autonomous buoys in the region. Other regional information was obtained from SAR satellite imagery and from satellite based radar altimetry. The analysis of the data collected has started, and first results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology installed permanent ocean bottom observation network called Dense Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) off the Kii Peninsula, southwest of Japan, to monitor earthquakes and tsunamis. We detected the long-term vertical displacements of sea floor from the ocean-bottom pressure records, starting from March 2013, at several DONET stations (Suzuki et al., 2014). We consider that these displacements were caused by the crustal deformation due to a slow slip event (SSE).\nWe estimated the fault geometry of the SSE by using the observed ocean-bottom displacements. The ocean-bottom displacements were obtained by removing the tidal components from the pressure records. We also subtracted the average of pressure changes taken over the records at stations connected to each science node from each record in order to remove the contributions due to atmospheric pressure changes and non-tidal ocean dynamic mass variations. Therefore we compared observed displacements with the theoretical ones that was subtracted the average displacement in the fault geometry estimation. We also compared observed and theoretical average displacements for the model evaluation. In this study, the observed average displacements were assumed to be zero. Although there are nine parameters in the fault model, we observed vertical displacements at only four stations. Therefore we assumed three fault geometries; (1) a reverse fault slip along the plate boundary, (2) a strike slip along a splay fault, and (3) a reverse fault slip along the splay fault. We obtained that the model (3) gives the smallest residual between observed and calculated displacements. We also observed that this SSE was synchronized with a decrease in the background seismicity within the area of a nearby earthquake cluster. In the future, we will investigate the relationship between the SSE and the seismicity change.",

            "abstract": "Hong Kong is a subtropical city which is very hot and humid in the summer. Pedestrians commonly experience thermal discomfort. Various studies have shown that the tall bulky buildings intensify the urban heat island effect and reduce urban air ventilation. However, relatively few studies have focused on modeling the thermal load at pedestrian level (~ 2 m). This study assesses the thermal comfort level, quantified by PET (Physiological Equivalent Temperature), using a GIS - based simulation approach. A thermal comfort level map shows the PET value of a typical summer afternoon in the high building density area. For example, the averaged PET in Sheung Wan is about 41 degree Celsius in a clear day and 38 degree Celsius in a cloudy day. This map shows where the walkways, colonnades, and greening is most needed. In addition, given a start point, a end point, and weather data, we generate the most comfort walking routes weighted by the PET. In the simulation, shortwave irradiance is calculated using the topographic radiation model (Fu and Rich, 1999) under various cloud cover scenarios; longwave irradiance is calculated based the radiative transfer equation (Swinbank, 1963). Combining these two factors, Tmrt (mean radiant temperature) is solved. And in some cases, the Tmrt differ more than 40 degree Celsius between areas under the sun and under the shades. Considering thermal load and wind information, we found that shading from buildings has stronger effect on PET than poor air ventilation resulted from dense buildings. We predict that pedestrians would feel more comfortable (lower PET) in a hot summer afternoon when walking in the higher building density area.",

            "abstract": "The integration of ASTR (Aquifer Storage Transfer and Recovery) and HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) is being attempted to ensure drinking water quality in a delta area. ASTR is a water supply system in which surface water is injected into a well for storage and recovered from a different well. During the process natural water treatment is achieved in the aquifer. ASTR has advantages over surface reservoirs in that the water is protected from external contaminants and free from water loss by evaporation. HACCP, originated from the food industry, can efficiently manage hazards and reduce risks when it is introduced to the drinking water production. The study area is the located in the Nakdong River Delta, South Korea. Water quality of this region has been deteriorated due to the increased pollution loads from the upstream cities and industrial complexes. ASTR equipped with HACCP system is suggested as a means to heighten the public trust in drinking water. After the drinking water supply system using ASTR was decomposed into ten processes, principles of HACCP were applied. Hazardous event analysis was conducted for 114 hazardous events and nine major hazardous events were identified based on the likelihood and the severity assessment. Potential risk of chemical hazards, as a function of amounts, travel distance and toxicity, was evaluated and the result shows the relative threat a city poses to the drinking water supply facility. Next, critical control points were determined using decision tree analysis. Critical limits, maximum and/or minimum values to which biological, chemical or physical parameters must be controlled, were established. Other procedures such as monitoring, corrective actions and will be presented.",

The potential danger caused by sea level rise may escalate if sea level rise is coupled with an increase in frequency and intensity of storms that may strike these regions. These coupled threats present a clear risk to population and critical infrastructure and are concerns for Federal, State, and particularly local response and recovery planners. Understanding the effect of sea level rise on the risk to critical infrastructure is crucial for long planning and for mitigating potential damages.\nIn this work we quantify how infrastructure vulnerability to a range of storms changes due to an increase of sea level. Our study focuses on the Norfolk area of the U.S.A. We assess the direct damage of drinking water and wastewater facilities and the power sector caused by a distribution of synthetic hurricanes. In addition, our analysis estimates indirect consequences of these damages on population and economic activities accounting also for interdependencies across infrastructures.\nWhile projections unanimously indicate an increase in the rate of sea level rise, the scientific community does not agree on the size of this rate. Our risk assessment accounts for this uncertainty simulating a distribution of sea level rise for a specific climate scenario. Using our impact assessment results and assuming an increase of future hurricanes frequencies and intensities, we also estimate the expected benefits for critical infrastructure.",

Due to the lack of a satisfactory global precipitation dataset, MOD16 was originally forced to rely on vapor pressure deficit as water stress input. As high resolution precipitation datasets are becoming available, the logic of MOD16 has been revisited to include a daily 4-km gridded precipitation input and a simple soil moisture model. Estimates yielded by the new model, titled \"regional MOD16\", have been validated against several flux towers in the north central climate region of the United States. Results show that adding a precipitation input and a simple soil moisture model can improve the modeled estimates across multiple biomes and elevation gradients.",

            "abstract": "Human presented significant disturbances on the natural processes of land-ocean interactions in context of global change. Here we illustrate how the signals of human activities in the river basin have been transferred to the coastal ocean along the hydrological pathway and remotely controlled the Yellow River Delta. Dam-orientated water and sediment regulation scheme (WSRS) has resulted in effective erosion of the lower channel and mitigation of siltation within the reservoirs. However, significant impacts have been identified on the delta morphology and coastal ecosystem ten years after the WSRS, which was unexpected at the beginning of engineering efforts. The coarser sediment derived from the channel erosion during the first phase of WSRS was directly contributed to the rapid accretion of present river mouth, whereas the delta was starved and declined due to insufficient sediment supply and regime shift of sediment transport. The fine-grained sediment exported from the Xiaolangdi Reservoir during the second phase of WSRS seemed to be a critical carrier for the nutrients and pollutants. The human-altered hydrological cycle, enhanced delivery of nutrient and pollutants and the changing estuarine environment present unpredictable impacts on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem in the delta region. These confirm that humans are modifying the river-coast system in ways that go well beyond climate change, and an integrated management of the river-coast continuum is crucially important for the sustainability of the river-delta system.",

A crucial question that coatsal geomorphologists and marine scientists need to face is about the fate and impact of this impulsive sediment load, especially with respect to the historical trend and seasonality. A satellite-based analysis of these sediment discharges is a key ingredient for such a study since it represents the primary dataset for the recognition of coastal patterns of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) that may reflect erosional or depositional processes along the coats. On this regard, we developed and implemented an SSC product from remote sensing that is calibrated and validated by in situ measurements collected in the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Sea. We discuss spatial patterns of SSC that we observe during 2012 high river discharge event of the Tiber River in order to give some insights on the short and long term shoreline evolution.",

            "abstract": "Tropical moisture export (TME) events are an important element of the global circulation and contribute significantly to regional precipitation. They are defined here on the basis of trajectories starting in the tropical troposphere and reaching a water vapor flux of at least 100 g kg-1 m s-1 poleward of 35° latitude. TME frequency shows four marked occurrence maxima in both hemispheres with varying seasonal cycles. In some cases TMEs can be linked to similar phenomena of atmospheric flow such as Warm Conveyor Belts (WCBs) or Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). For example, 90% of all ARs affecting the US West Coast during December–May are connected to TME events, but the tropical moisture source is less important during the more active AR season June–November.\nIn addition to these climatological TME characteristics we discuss two aspects of their relationship to extratropical cyclones: Case studies indicate that (i) cyclones traveling along the southern fringes of the midlatitude storm track can instigate the export of tropical moisture ahead of their cold fronts, and (ii) the tropical moisture can fuel latent heat release in the cyclone and therefore contribute to its intensification. A long-term statistical analysis of passages of TME trajectories through areas with closed isobars surrounding active cyclones in the northern hemisphere reveals a surprisingly small number of encounters, particularly in winter. The majority of hits occur south of 40°N and there is no statistically significant relationship with cyclone intensification. The results suggest that TMEs often pass relatively far from cyclone centers where vertical motions tend to be moderate. This prevents an early rainout of the tropical moisture and allows the export into higher latitudes. For the same reasons we expect TMEs to “avoid” WCBs with roots at low latitudes. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that most TME maxima are located along the western flanks of subtropical high-pressure systems.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring the direct impact of aerosol particles on climate requires the continuous measurement of aerosol optical parameters like the aerosol extinction coefficient on a regular basis. Remote sensing and ground-based networks are well in place (e.g., AERONET, ACTRIS), whereas the regular in situ measurement of vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol optical properties remains still an important challenge in quantifying climate change. The European Research Infrastructure IAGOS (In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System; www.iagos.org) responds to the increasing requests for long-term, routine in situ observational data by using commercial passenger aircraft as measurement platform. However, scientific instrumentation for the measurement of atmospheric constituents requires major modifications before being deployable aboard in-service passenger aircraft.\nRecently, a compact and robust family of optical instruments based on the cavity attenuated phase shift (CAPS) technique has become available for measuring aerosol light extinction. While this technique was successfully deployed for ground-based atmospheric measurements under various conditions, its suitability for operation aboard aircraft in the free and upper free troposphere still has to be demonstrated.\nIn this work, the modifications of a CAPS PMex instrument for measuring aerosol light extinction on aircraft, the results from subsequent laboratory tests for evaluating the modified instrument prototype, and first results from a field deployment aboard a research aircraft will be covered. In laboratory studies, the instrument showed excellent agreement (deviation < 5%) with theoretical values calculated from Rayleigh scattering cross-sections, when operated on pressurized air and CO2 at ambient and low pressure (~200 hPa). For monodisperse and polydisperse aerosols, reference aerosol extinction coefficients were calculated from measured size distributions and agreed with the CAPS PMex instrument response within 10% deviation. During the field deployment, aerosol extinction coefficients and associated aerosol size distributions have been measured and will be presented as comparison studies between measured and calculated data.",

            "abstract": "In high relief mountain regions, many glaciers have supraglacial debris in their ablation area, which affects the response of these glaciers to climate change through altering ice melting rates. The thin debris accelerates ice melting and the thick one suppresses it. In order to understand the changes of glacier mass balance and runoff patterns under climate change, it is important to assess the effect of debris-cover on these glaciers. However, the assessment of the debris effect is difficult because it is difficult to measure debris thickness at large scale only from field measurements. Here, we attempted to estimate a global distribution of debris thickness on glaciers by using a thermal resistance of supraglacial debris derived from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite stereo imageries and radiometer products of Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES). The obtained distribution map covers approximately 88% of total glacier area recorded in a global glacier outline of the Randorf Glacier Inventory (RGI). Investigations on several glaciers showed that the ASTER-derived thermal resistances correlated reasonably well with ground-surveyed debris thickness. The results indicate that 11% of total global glaciers are covered by supraglacial debris cover and the regional differences in debris distribution are apparent from region to region. Debris cover is relatively thin and accelerates ice melting in western Himalaya, North America, Canada, and Scandinavia, whereas debris cover is relatively thick and inhibits ice melting in eastern Himalaya, Alps, Caucasus and Andes region.",

Coarse particles were extracted from cores of till for quartz sand gain surface microtexture analysis and pebble shape, texture, and lithology analyses. Limited research has been previously done on the subglacial coarse sediments of subglacial lakes and grounding zones in the Antarctic to infer subglacial sediment transport processes and sources along an ice stream. The subglacial coarse sediment at the three research sites is glacially transported as indicated by quartz sand grain microtexture analysis. Subglacial water drainage does not fluvially transport the coarse sediment as shown by: (1) a lack of V-shaped percussion cracks as surface microtextures on quartz sand grains, (2) high relief, (3) angularity, (4) conchoidal fractures, and (5) arc-shaped steps having high frequency occurrences; all indicating that glacial processes in till dominate coarse sediment subglacial transport at the three sites. Pebble shape and texture analyses concur with those findings with 76% of pebbles spherical or discoid and over 90% subangular to angular at WGZ and SLW. Faceting occurred on 50% of pebbles at upstream Whillans (UpB), 56% at SLW, and 42% at WGZ and striae are present on fine-grained pebbles. No stratigraphic changes in transport mechanisms are apparent from coarse sediment analyses by depth at the three sites. The subglacial sediment lithology from UpB to SLW indicates the same source beds composed largely of low-grade metamorphics and plutonics. Stratigraphic variation at WGZ shown in the compositional analysis indicates the provenance for the sediments vary by depth. Variation in subglacial sediment sources suggest changing source beds due to shifting glacial flow lines or varying input from Mercer Ice Stream at the upstream convergence zone.",

            "abstract": "GPS (Global Positioning System) and InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) observations have their own characteristic: GPS can measure three-dimensional (East, North, Up) ground motion in high accuracy but has relatively sparse station coverage, while InSAR can provide densely spatial measurements of surface displacement but only in one dimension (LOS direction). In this study we adapt a velocity field method to combine InSAR measurements of LOS velocities with available GPS data. This allows us to form a velocity field in the GPS reference frame with higher spatial resolution than is available from the sparse GPS data alone. We first divide study areas into triangular meshes, and assume that the velocity varies linearly with latitude and longitude (i.e., homogeneous strain) within each triangle. Therefore, the geodetic observations within each triangle are related to the velocities of its vertices by an interpolation shape function. Given observed GPS ENU and InSAR LOS velocities, we can solve a system of linear equations for unknown velocities of the triangular vertices. With this velocity field model, we can get a continuous velocity field by interpolation of the vertex velocities and further calculate the strain rate of each triangular mesh. An additional advantage of this method is that it can provide ground motion (and their uncertainties) even in areas of InSAR incoherence. We apply this method to the Taipei area and the northern Longitudinal Valley (LV) of Taiwan by combining continuous GPS data and PSInSAR (Permanent Scatter InSAR) measurements observed by Envisat and ALOS satellites. Results show that the vertical motion in the Taipei basin is episodic, with the largest strain-rate magnitude shown along the hanging-wall of the Sanchiao normal fault and the south of the Tatun volcano area. In the northern LV, ground subsidence of ~5 mm/yr is revealed, with the largest strain-rate magnitude near 23.4°~23.6°N that is consistent with an area of tectonic transition from arc-continent collision to the south to the plate subduction to the east.",

We report physical and optical properties of carbonaceous aerosols from Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) for 60 days during 2014-15 winter season. Mass concentration and size distribution of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) were measured in real time using Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) and High Resolution Time of Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) respectively. Optical properties of aerosols at atmospheric and denuded (heated at 300 ˚C) conditions were also measured using 3 wavelength Photo Acoustic Soot Spectrometer (PASS 3). Analysis shows large scale carbonaceous aerosol loading during winter season in IGP. Multiple biomass burning events combined with trash burning contributed to this high loading along with very low boundary layer height. An inter-comparison shows that Aethalometer over estimates BC by a factor of 3 when compared with that of SP 2 measurement. Enhancement in absorption (Eabs) defined as the ratio of atmospheric absorption to denuded absorption shows presence of absorbing organics known as brown carbon (BrC). Optical closure performed between denuded aerosol absorption measured by PASS 3 and Mie theory derived absorption using SP 2 BC size distribution showed a difference of only 30 % at 781 nm. This difference might be due to the non-spherical shape and presence of residual coating on BC. Refractive index of BrC at 405 and 532 nm were derived using optical closure method for the entire sampling period. Overall results indicates that the impact of BrC on optical absorption is significant in areas dominated by biomass burning such as IGP and such effects needs to be considered in global aerosol modelling studies.",

HadGEM2-AO based two RCP scenarios (RCP4.5/8.5) data have been used for initial and boundary condition to all RCMs. Wind energy density and its annual and seasonal variability have been estimated based on monthly near-surface wind speeds, and the potential electronic production and its change have been also analyzed. As a result of comparison ensemble models based annual mean wind speed for 25-yr historical period (1981-2005) to the ERA-interim, it is shown that all RCMs overestimate near-surface wind speed compared to the reanalysis data but the results of HadGEM3-RA are most comparable. The changes annual and seasonal mean of WED and PEP for the historical period and comparison results to future projection (2021-2050) will be presented in this poster session.

            "abstract": "Earlier studies have illustrated the strong influence of remote forcing from the equator and the Bay of Bengal on the sea-level variability off the west coast of India, especially at the seasonal timescale. More recently, Suresh et al. [2013] demonstrated with a simple, linear, continuously-stratified (LCS) model that the equatorial zonal winds contribute to more than 60% of intraseasonal sea-level variability along the Indian west coast. In the present study, we quantify the contributions from various processes to the sea-level variability along the west coast of India at different timescales with the help of a LCS model through both idealized and realistic sensitivity experiments. We demonstrate that remote forcing dominates the sea-level variability along the west coast of India at intraseasonal to interannual timescales. Sri Lanka and the southern tip of India play an important role on Indian west coast sea-level variability at all timescales for two reasons: First, the geometry of the coast favors a strong alongshore wind-stress forcing of coastal Kelvin waves across timescales there. Second, Sri Lanka interacts with low-order meridional mode equatorial Rossby waves forced by equatorial winds or southern Bay of Bengal wind- stress curl. This interaction of coastal waveguide with equatorial waveguide creates a new pathway for the equatorial signals to arrive at the west coast of India, alternative to the “classical” coastal waveguide around the rim of the Bay of Bengal.\n",

We think data centers may provide researchers with a universal data dissemination service which can handle various kinds of observation data with little effort. For this purpose JAMSTEC Data Management Office has developed the “Information Catalog Infrastructure System (Catalog System)”. This is a kind of catalog management system which can create, renew and delete catalogs (= databases) and has following features,\n- The Catalog System does not depend on data types or granularity of data records.\n- By registering a new metadata schema to the system, a new database can be created on the same system without sytem modification.\n- As web pages are defined by the cascading style sheets, databases have different look and feel, and operability.\n- The Catalog System provides databases with basic search tools; search by text, selection from a category tree, and selection from a time line chart.\n- For domestic users it creates the Japanese and English pages at the same time and has dictionary to control terminology and proper noun.\nAs of August 2015 JAMSTEC operates 7 databases on the Catalog System. We expect to transfer existing databases to this system, or create new databases on it. In comparison with a dedicated database developed for the specific dataset, the Catalog System is suitable for the dissemination of small datasets, with minimum cost. Metadata held in the catalogs may be transfered to other metadata schema to exchange global databases or portals.\nExamples:\nJAMSTEC Data Catalog: http://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/catalog/data_catalog/metadataList?lang=en\nJAMSTEC Document Catalog: http://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/catalog/doc_catalog/metadataList?lang=en&tab=category\nResearch Information and Data Access Site of TEAMS: http://www.i-teams.jp/catalog/rias/metadataList?lang=en&tab=list",

They are molten at relatively low temperatures and have solidus temperatures hundreds of degrees lower than silicate melts at >3 GPa (Dasgupta et al. 2006, Ghosh et al., 2009), dissolve a number of geochemically incompatible elements much better than silicate melts (Blundy and Dalton, 2000). Previous studies of carbonate melt dihedral angles in olivine-dominated matrices yielded 25-30oat 1-3 GPa, relatively independent of melt composition (Watson et al., 1990) and temperature (Hunter and McKenzie, 1989). Dihedral angles of carbonate melts in contact with deep mantle silicate phases (e.g. garnet, wadsleyite, and ringwoodite) which constitute more than 70 % of the deep upper mantle and transition zone have not been studied yet.\nWe have performed multi-anvil experiments on carbonate-bearing peridotites with 5.0 wt% CO2 from 13.5 to 20 GPa 1550 oC to investigate the dihedral angle of magnesio-carbonatite melts in equilibrium with garnet, olivine (and its high-pressure polymorphs), and clinoenstatite. The dihedral angle of carbonate melts in the deep upper mantle and transition zone is ~30° for majorite garnet and olivine (and its polymorphs) dominated matrices. It does not change with increasing pressure in the range 13.5-20 GPa. Our results suggest that very low melt fractions of carbonatite melt forming in the deep upper mantle and transition zone are interconnected at melt fractions less than 0.01. Consistent with geophysical observations, this could possibly explain low velocity regions in the deep mantle and transition zone.",

            "abstract": "We investigated the magnetic properties of the Pleistocene sediments exposed in the Arda river section in southern Po plain, northern Italy. This site contains a complete record of the transition occurring in the greater Po basin between marine sedimentation typical of the Early Pleistocene and continental sedimentation typical of the Middle–Late Pleistocene. The study of the magnetic mineralogy shows a dominance of Magnetite as the main magnetic mineral in almost the whole sequence except for the top where it changes into Hematite and for two minor intervals at the base and the middle of the sequence where the signal is carried mainly by sulphides. Five magnetic polarity reversals were recognized and used to construct an age model of sedimentation for the whole sequence, which was found to span in substantial stratigraphic continuity between ~2.5 Ma in the Matuyama chron across the Olduvai subchron, the Jaramillo subchron to the Brunhes–Matuyama boundary at 0.78 Ma, the correct interpretation of these magnetostratigraphic data has been proven by biostratigraphic data collected at the same time as the paleomagnetic sampling. According to this age model, the age of continentalization occurred in this area between the top of the Jaramillo (0.99 Ma) and the Brunhes–Matuyama boundary (0.78 Ma) and during the late Early Pleistocene climate revolution (EPR). Using magneto-lithostratigraphic data from other sections from the literature outcropping nearby, we reconstructed the timing of continentalization of the greater Po basin area during the EPR. The comparison between data coming form different sections in the Po basin prove a slight diachrony in the marine-continental transtition occurring from the western to the eastern part of the plain due to the gradual infilling by continental sediments. This age for the continentalization of the northern italian area combines well with the age of the best-dated sites with evidence of the earliest peopling of Europe.",

            "abstract": "Accretionary and erosive margins provide tectonic end-members in subduction zone and how these tectonic processes might be recorded and recognizable in ancient subduction complexes remains a challenging issue. Tectonic erosion includes sediment subduction and basal erosion along the plate boundary megathrust and drags down the crust of the upper plate into the mantle. Geologic evidence for the erosion is commonly based on lost geological tectono-stratigraphic data, i.e. gaps in the record and indirect phenomena such as subsidence of the forearc slopes. A topographically rough surface such as seamount has been suggested to work like an erosive saw carving the upper plate. Another mechanism of basal erosion has been suggested to be hydrofracturing of upper plate materials due to dehydration-induced fluid pressures, resulting in entrainment of upper plate materials into the basal décollement. Considering the interaction between the ~30 km thick crust of the upper plate and subducting oceanic plate, a subduction dip angle of ~15°, and convergent rate of ~10 cm/year, at least ~1 Ma of continuous basal erosion is necessary to induce clear subsidence of the forearc because the width of plate interface between the upper crustal and subducting plates is about 115 km (30/cos15°). In several examples of subduction zones, for example the Japan Trench and the Middle America Trench off Costa Rica, the subsidence of a few thousand metres of the forearc, combined with a lack of accretionary prism over a period of several million years, suggest that the erosive condition needs to be maintained for several to tens of million years.\nSuch age gaps in the accretionary complex, however, do not automatically imply that tectonic erosion has taken place, as other interpretations such as no accretion, cessation of subduction, and/or later tectonic modification, are also possible.\nRecent drilling in the forearc of the Nankai Trough suggests that the accretion was ceased between ~12 Ma to ~8 Ma due to the transference of subduction from the Pacific Plate to the Philippine Sea Plate, as opposed to the continuous subduction of the Phillipine Sea Plate with subduction erosion.",

            "abstract": "The main factors controlling δ2H of plant organic compounds are generally assumed to be the plant’s source water and the evaporative deuterium enrichment of leaf water. Hydrogen isotope analyses of plant compounds from sediments or tree rings are therefore mainly applied to assess hydrological conditions at different spatial and temporal scales. However, the biochemical hydrogen isotope fractionation occurring during biosynthesis of plant organic compounds (εbio) also accounts for a large part of the variability observed in the δ2H values. Nevertheless, only few studies have directly addressed the physiological basis of this variability and even fewer studies have thus explored possible applications of hydrogen isotope variability in plant organic compounds for plant physiological research. Here we show two datasets indicating that the plant’s carbon metabolism can have a substantial influence on δ2H values of n-alkanes and cellulose. First, we performed a controlled experiment where we forced plants into heterotrophic and autotrophic C-metabolism by growing them under four different light treatments. Second, we assessed the δ2H values of different parasitic heterotrophic plants and their autotrophic host plants. Our two datasets show a systematic shift in εbio of up to 80 ‰ depending on the plant’s carbon metabolism (heterotrophic or autotrophic). Differences in n-alkane and cellulose δ2H values in plants with autotrophic vs. heterotrophic metabolisms can be explained by different NADPH pools that are used by the plants to build their compounds either with assimilates that originate directly from photosynthesis or from stored carbohydrates. Our results have significant implications for the calibration and interpretation of geological records. More importantly, as the δ2H values reflect the plant’s carbon metabolism involved during the tissue formation, our findings highlight the potential of δ2H values as new tool for studying plant and ecosystem carbon metabolism.",

            "abstract": "A single-column modeling approach is proposed to study interaction between convection and large-scale dynamics using the quasi-geostrophic (QG) framework. Vertical motion is represented by the QG omega equation with the diabatic heating term included. This approach extends the notion of ``parameterization of large scale dynamics\", previously applied in the tropics using the weak temperature gradient approximation and other comparable methods, to the extratropics, where balanced adiabatic dynamics plays a larger role in inducing large-scale vertical motion. The diabatic heating term in the QG-omega equation represents the feedback from convection, coupling the convection and large-scale vertical motion. The strength of the coupling depends on the characteristic wavelength of the large-scale disturbances, a free parameter in the system. This approach is demonstrated using two representations of convection: a single- column model with a convective parameterization, and linear response functions derived by Z. Kuang from a large set of cloud-resolving simulations. The results are qualitatively similar in both cases, though the linear response functions allow for a more thorough analysis of the system dynamics. The behavior of convection that is strongly coupled to large-scale vertical motion is significantly different from that in the uncoupled case in which large-scale dynamics is not present. The positive feedback of the diabatic heating on the large-scale vertical motion reduces the stability of the system, extends the decay time scale after initial perturbations, and increases the amplitude of the convective response to transient large-scale perturbations or imposed forcings. The diabatic feedback of convection on vertical motion is strongest for horizontal wavelengths roughly between 2000 km and 1000 km.",

In this spontaneous reconnection model, the diffusion region is localized and the magnetic reconnection drastically evolves by the positive feedback between the growths of the macroscopic plasma flow and the microscopic resistivity. The localized diffusion region eventually becomes longer in the directions of the reconnection outflow. Then, the secondary reconnection occurs to divide into the two diffusion regions before forming the Sweet-Parker type diffusion region. In this term, background sheath flow helps stretching of the diffusion region and causes the difference of the strength of the reconnection rate at the each x-line.",

            "abstract": "It is observationally known that proton and oxygen ions are main components of the ring current during magnetic storms and that the proton and oxygen ions are considered to have different source and supply mechanisms. However, detailed properties of the ion supply and their dependence on ion species is far from well understood. To characterize the ion supply to the ring current during magnetic storms, we report studies of the properties of energetic proton and oxygen ion phase space densities (PSDs) during the April 23-25, 2013, geomagnetic storm observed by the Van Allen Probes mission. We used energetic ion (~50 - ~600keV protons, ~140 - ~1100keV oxygen) and magnetic field data obtained by the RBSPICE and EMFISIS, respectively, on the Van Allen Probes.\nWe calculated ion PSDs for the specific first adiabatic invariant, mu (0.3 < mu < 12 keV/nT), and ion pitch angles near 90 degrees as a function of L for each spacecraft orbit. The results show that both proton and oxygen ions penetrated directly to L<5 during the main phase of the magnetic storm. Protons with smaller mu values (mu = 0.3 and 0.5 keV/nT) penetrated earlier than those with larger mu values (mu = 1.0 keV/nT). This result appears consistent with the energy dependence of the Alfven layer. The timing of oxygen ion penetration is approximately the same for all mu values (mu = 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 keV/nT). The observations also show that oxygen ions penetrated more deeply in L and earlier in time than protons for the same mu value (mu = 1.0keV/nT). These results suggest that the source of the transported oxygen ions is located closer to the Earth than the inner edge of protons. The results imply the importance of the contribution from subauroral oxygen ions to the storm-time ring current. We will also discuss the possibility of non-adiabatic acceleration of oxygen ions in the inner magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Two billion people today live in drylands, where extreme climatic conditions prevail, and natural resources are limited. Drylands are expected to expand under several scenarios of climatic change. However, relevant adaptation strategies need to account for the aridity level: it conditions the equilibrium tree-cover density, ranging from deserts (hyper-arid) to dense savannas (sub-humid). Here we focus on the evolution of climatically defined warm semi-arid areas, where low-tree density covers can be maintained. We study the global repartition of these regions in the future and the bioclimatic shifts involved.\nWe adopted a bioclimatological approach based on the Köppen climate classification. The warm semi-arid class is characterized by mean annual temperatures over 18°C and a rainfall-limitation criterion. A multi-model ensemble of CMIP5 projections for three representative concentration pathways was selected to analyze future conditions. The classification was first applied to the start, middle and end of the 20th and 21st centuries, in order to localize past and future warm semi-arid regions. Then, time-series for the classification were built to characterize trends and variability in the evolution of those regions.\nAccording to the CRU datasets, global expansion of the warm semi-arid area has already started (~+13%), following the global warming trend since the 1900s. This will continue according to all projections, most significantly so outside the tropical belt. Under the \"business as usual\" scenario, the global warm semi-arid area will increase by 30% and expand 12° poleward in the Northern Hemisphere, according to the multi-model mean. Drying drives the conversion from equatorial sub-humid conditions. Beyond 30° of latitude, cold semi-arid conditions become warm semi-arid through warming, and temperate conditions through combined warming and drying processes. Those various transitions may have drastic but also very distinct ecological and sociological impacts.",

            "abstract": "The extensive rock outcrops spanning the complete basin fill of the South-Pyrenean foreland make this region best suited for magnetostratigraphic analysis. Over the last decades, a biochronological framework, based fundamentally on fossil benthic foraminifera and vertebrates, is being replaced with a magnetostratigraphy-based chronology. The increasing length of the composite record has allowed magnetostratigraphic correlation to work with decreasing dependence on existing biostratigraphic constraints. This has provided integrated basin studies with a time frame of unprecedented resolution, crucial to unravel the interactions and causal relationships between the diverse forcing mechanisms involved in basin formation and filling. In the ideal progress towards an independent magnetochronological framework, a fundamental issue arises recurrently: To which extent biochronological information should limit the solutions of magnetostratigraphy? The answer to this question is not simple since the chronostratigraphic significance and age accuracy of key bioevents needs to be addressed in a case-by-case basis. In the other hand, the continuity and steadiness of the sedimentary record, which is hardly assessed a priori, reveals crucial for magnetostratigraphic correlation to work. Examples from the Eocene to Miocene of the Ebro Basin illustrate the need for an effort of a basin-scale integration of all (lito-, bio- and magneto-) stratigraphic disciplines.",

The aim of this micro-warming experiment is to investigate the direct effect of soil warming on microbial decomposition of soil organic matter. We are testing the feasibility of small, short-term, in situ warming that can be run off batteries for distributed deployment and that preserves plant-soil relations and natural variability in wind, temperature, and precipitation. Based on preliminary results, the approach looks promising. One resistance heater cable per plot (25 cm diameter plots) was inserted vertically to 50 cm, spanning the full active layer (maximum thaw depth was 40 cm in 2014). Heaters were turned on August 1, 2015, and heated plots reached the 4ºC warming target within 1-3 days. We are measuring soil microclimate, thaw depth, CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and 14CO2, and microbial composition, as part of the DOE Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE-Arctic).\nEcosystem respiration increased immediately in the heated plots, and net ecosystem exchange under clear chambers changed from net uptake to net CO2 source in two of the four plots. CH4 flux shifted toward reduced net emissions or greater net uptake in all plots. These rapid responses demonstrate direct changes in decomposition without complications from microbial acclimation, altered community structure or changes in substrate availability. However, future Arctic tundra carbon balance will depend on both short term and long term microbial responses, as well as the links between warming, decomposition, nitrogen mineralization, and plant growth. Thus, we envision that distributed micro-warming plots could be combined with new approaches to aboveground passive warming being developed in NGEE, gradient studies, and modeling.",

Now this mechanism has been developed to first order Fermi acceleration and second order Fermi acceleration. In first order Fermi acceleration, also known as diffusive shock acceleration, particles are confined around the shock through scattering and accelerated by repeatedly crossing shock front. In second order Fermi acceleration, particles gain energy through statistical collisions with interstellar clouds. In this proposed work, we plan to carefully study these two kinds of acceleration numerically and experimentally. We first consider a single relativistic particle and investigate how it gains energy in Fermi-Ulam model and shock wave acceleration model respectively. We investigate collective behavior of particles with different kinds of wall-oscillation functions and try to find an optimal one in terms of efficiency of acceleration. Then, we plan to go further and consider a group of particles statistically, during which we borrow the correct generalization of Maxwell’s velocity distribution in special relativity and compare the results with those in cases where we simply use Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. To this end, we try to provide a scheme to build an accelerator applying both laser technology and mirror effect in Laboratory to reproduce Fermi acceleration, which might be a promising source to obtain high energy particles and further study the mechanism of cosmic rays acceleration.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide capture and geological storage (CCS) is the most feasible method to mitigate the emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. The injected CO2 can be efficiently stored in the underground formations for a very long time because of the seal integrity of caprock. Caprocks can be a heterogeneous multilayered system, in which the permeable shaly-sand layers are interbedded with very-low-permeability shales. When a thick (hundreds meters) single shale formation is not discovered, and instead a heterogeneous caprock system is considered, the issue of seal ability of the caprock system is critical.\nThe purpose of this study was to use an analytical method to study the seal ability of a multilayered caprock system where the shaly-sand and shale layers were interbedded. We modified the Buckley-Leverett frontal advanced equation, and derived the constant-pressure CO2-water two-phase analytical solution to estimate the CO2 front migration in a multilayered caprock system. The CO2 front breakthrough time and the amount of CO2 invaded into the caprock system changing with time were calculated, and the seal ability of the multilayered caprock system was evaluated.\nDifferent multilayered caprock systems were designed to validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical method. We found that the relative permeabilities of shaly-sand and shale layers are critical parameters to the CO2 front breakthrough time. The positive correlation between the permeability and the CO2 migration velocity was observed. The heterogeneous multilayered caprock system can also provide a high seal ability to efficiently lower the risk of CO2 leakage.",

In 2011 and 2013, the multidisciplinary mid-ocean ridge program of Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) conducted a series of geological, geochemical, geophysical, and hydrothermal studies at the segment. Especially, in order to determine the detailed location of the ridge axis, a number of short magnetic cross lines were observed in 2013. In 2015, we additionally collected the magnetic data and the high-resolution shipboard bathymetric data for two 400-km long lines across the ridge segment. Here we utilize the observed magnetic data to estimate spreading rates and its temporal changes along the ridge segment. The half-spreading rates computed using MODMAG with our magnetic data range mostly between 28~34 mm/yr. The southern flank of this ridge segment, which has been added to the Antarctic plate as a trailing side between the Australian and the Antarctic plate, tends to have faster spreading rates compared to the northern flank. According to the previous studies, the Macquarie plate, which is regarded as the intra-plate inside the Australian plate and bounded by the northern flank of the ridge segment in this study, has been rotated relative to the Antarctic plate since about 6 Ma. We revised rotation poles between the Macquarie-Antarctic plates for the chron C2Ay (2.58 Ma), chron C3Ay (6.04 Ma) and the other ages additionally, using Hellinger. In this study, we employed the observed magnetic data with additional constraints from the available shipboard measurements. The synthetic flow-line of Balleny Fracture Zone is used as an input to Hellinger, because the region between the Tasman Fracture Zone and the Macquarie Triple Junction is supposed to be included to the Macquarie plate. We examine relevant tectonic adjustments, if any, near the AAR and Macquarie plate using the revised rotation poles.",

Change of precipitation was regionally diverse, but on average not enough to compensate the high warming rate. Variability of seasonal weather increased with long dry and warm periods. Severe heat waves are regularly observed in different regions of the country. Three available remote sensing products of spatially explicit distribution of burnt area in Russia (GFED4; Institute of Forest SB RAS, Krasnoyarsk; and Space Research Institute, RAS, Moscow) reported rather consistent average burnt areas for the period of 2000-2010 (from 8.3 to 9.4 x 106 ha year-1); however, the differences for individual years, particularly for 2011-2012 are large. Of the total fire area, about 2/3 were on forest land. A typical feature of fire regimes of recent decades is increasing frequency and severity of mega-fires, which envelope vast regions (up to millions of hectares) with numerous simultaneously burning areas, cause large ecological, economic and social losses and often provide irreversible impacts on forest ecosystems. Such fires occurred in different regions of Russia in 1998 (7.7 x 106 ha of burnt areas), 2002 (8.2), 2003 (16.6), 2005 (8.5), 2006 (12.4), 2007 (8.9), 2008 (16.8), 2009 (10.4), 2010 (7.9), 2011 (8.8 x 106 ha), 2012 (15.8 x 106 ha). We present a full fire carbon budget for 2000-2012 as a proxy of severity of fire regimes, based on 1) a country’s Integrated Land Information System, which contains georeferenced land cover, amount of fuel by types and annual burnt areas at resolution of 1km; and 2) regionally distributed models of fire severity. The amount of fuel consumed by fire is estimated at 135 Tg C yr-1 with large interannual variation and uncertainties ~25%. We discuss ecological consequences of fire, its impact on successions, health and productivity of forest ecosystems as well as predicted dynamics of fire regimes over 21st century.",

            "abstract": "Conventional approaches to inverse problems suffer from non-linearity and non-uniqueness in estimations of seismic structures and source properties. Estimated results and associated uncertainties are often biased by applied regularizations and additional constraints, which are commonly introduced to solve such problems. Bayesian methods, however, provide statistically meaningful estimations of models and their uncertainties constrained by data information. In addition, hierarchical and trans-dimensional (trans-D) techniques are inherently implemented in the Bayesian framework to account for involved error statistics and model parameterizations, and, in turn, allow more rigorous estimations of the same.\nHere, we apply Bayesian methods throughout the entire inference process to estimate seismic structures and source properties in Northeast Asia including east China, the Korean peninsula, and the Japanese islands. Ambient noise analysis is first performed to obtain a base three-dimensional (3-D) heterogeneity model using continuous broadband waveforms from more than 300 stations. As for the tomography of surface wave group and phase velocities in the 5-70 s band, we adopt a hierarchical and trans-D Bayesian inversion method using Voronoi partition. The 3-D heterogeneity model is further improved by joint inversions of teleseismic receiver functions and dispersion data using a newly developed high-efficiency Bayesian technique. The obtained model is subsequently used to prepare 3-D structural Green's functions for the source characterization. A hierarchical Bayesian method for point source inversion using regional complete waveform data is applied to selected events from the region. The seismic structure and source characteristics with rigorously estimated uncertainties from the novel Bayesian methods provide enhanced monitoring and discrimination of seismic events in northeast Asia.",

            "abstract": "We have been monitoring the pressure of groundwater at the Kamioka mine in Gifu prefecture, central Japan. Kinoshita et al. (2015) observed a large pressure decrease which is equivalent to over 2 m change in water level after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake(M9.0), although the hypocentral distance is more than 500 km.\nKinoshita et al. (2015) hypothesized that new water paths were made associated with the shaking from the earthquake and the rock mass became more permeable, because the pressure decreases continued for several days. To verify the hypothesis, we calculated the hydraulic diffusivity from the response of the pressure to Earth tides. Earth tides induce expansion and contraction of the crust, and pore pressure responses to this deformation. The pressure change from theoretical strain changes of the Earth tides can be calculated and subtracted from the observed pore pressure data. Then, we can extract the hydrological rocks property from the residual pore pressure.\nWe used the tidal analysis program BAYTAP-G (Tamura et al., 1991) to calculate the Earth tide response and focused on the M2 and O1 constituents which are the largest. The M2 and O1 amplitudes decreased after the Tohoku earthquake. We estimated the hydraulic diffusivity from those results and showed there was remarkable increase after the earthquake. To try to understand the cause of the permeability change, we compared the effects of both static and dynamic strain associated with the earthquake, but there is no clear difference. Kinoshita et al. (2015) could not conclude from those results whether static or dynamic strain has a dominant effect.\nThe Geological Survey of Japan, AIST has developed a network of groundwater monitoring in Japan since 1976 (Itaba et al., 2008). We investigated the groundwater levels and pressure changes before and after the Tohoku earthquake using the AIST boreholes. Among the factors influencing groundwater changes, at first, we focus on the effect of differences in boreholes lengths. Each observation site of AIST used for the present analysis has two or three boreholes with different lengths. We investigated the groundwater responses of each borehole and depth in terms of confined and unconfined aquifers.",

            "abstract": "DOC transport by streamwater is a significant flux that does not consistently show up in ecosystem carbon budgets. In an effort to quantify stream DOC flux, we analyzed three to four years of high-frequency in situ fluorescing dissolved organic matter (FDOM) concentrations and turbidity measured by optical sensors at the five diverse forested and/or alpine headwater sites of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Budgets (WEBB) program. FDOM serves as a proxy for DOC. We also took discrete samples over a range of hydrologic conditions, using both manual weekly and automated event-based sampling. After compensating FDOM for temperature effects and turbidity interference – which was successful even at the high-turbidity Luquillo, PR site -- we evaluated the DOC-FDOM relation based on discrete sample DOC analyses matched to corrected FDOM at the time of sampling. FDOM was a moderately robust predictor of DOC, with r2 from 0.60 to more than 0.95 among sites. We then formed continuous DOC time series by two independent approaches: (1) DOC predicted from FDOM; and (2) the composite method, based on modeled DOC from regression on stream discharge, season, air temperature, and time, forcing the model to observations and adjusting modeled concentrations between observations by linearly-interpolated model residuals. DOC flux from each approach was then computed directly as concentration times discharge. DOC fluxes based on the sensor approach were consistently greater than the sample-based approach. At Loch Vale, CO (2.5 years) and Panola Mountain GA (1 year), the difference was 5-17%. At Sleepers River, VT (3 years), preliminary differences were greater than 20%. The difference is driven by the highest events, but we are investigating these results further. We will also present comparisons from Luquillo, PR, and Allequash Creek, WI. The higher sensor-based DOC fluxes could result from their accuracy during hysteresis, which is difficult to model. In at least one case the higher sensor-based DOC flux was linked to an unsampled event outside the range of the concentration model. Sensors require upkeep and vigilance with the data, but have the potential to yield more accurate fluxes than sample-based approaches.",

            "abstract": "When oceanic basins close after a long period of convergence and subduction, continental collision and mountain building is a common consequence. The eastern Mediterranean basin is the last remainder of a once hemispherical neo-Tethys ocean that has nearly disappeared due to convergence of the India and Africa/Arabia plates with the Eurasia plate.\nNew results from full waveform inversion for Anatolia give an unprecedented view on the crust and the upper mantle of the region. Based on highly accurate spectral-element simulations of seismic wave propagation in heterogeneous Earth models, full waveform inversion exploits complete seismograms – including body and surface waves – for the benefit of improved resolution. Furthermore, 3D structure in both crust and mantle is constrained jointly, thereby avoiding contamination from commonly applied crustal corrections. Second-order adjoint techniques provide quantitative estimates of direction- and position-dependent resolution length, which is essential for the interpretation of the model.\nThe images connect major structures in the crust as documented in the geology, to features in the upper mantle that reflect the remnants of the convergence and collision. The results show a major discontinuity between western Anatolia lithosphere and the region to the east of it. It is the imprint of syn-collisional segmentation of the neo-Tethys slab, and separates the Aegean and west Anatolia regions from central and east Anatolia. While convergence between Africa and Europe continued, this initiated a period of lithospheric extension in the west and flat slab subduction in the east that set the stage for earthquake and volcanic activity in the region today. Slab segmentation is expected to have been relatively common just prior to closure of other oceans in the geological past, and may explain some of the complexity that geologists have documented in, for instance, the Tibetan plateau also.",

            "abstract": "The north Caribbean plate boundary zone is a broad deformation zone with several fault systems and tectonic blocks that move with different velocities. The indentation by the Bahamas Platform (the \"Bahamas Collision\") is generally invoked as a cause of this fragmentation. We propose that a second driver of deformation is the western edge of the south-dipping Puerto Rico slab moving sideways with the North America plate. This proposal derives from our recently imaged tomographic structure of the Lesser Antilles - Puerto Rico slab. The westward motion of the slab edge results in a push on the Caribbean plate further west. We refer to this second mechanism for deformation as \"Slab Edge Push\". The motion of the North America plate relative to the Caribbean plate causes both drivers to migrate from east to west. The Bahamas Collision and Slab Edge Push have been operating simultaneously since the Miocene. The question is the relative importance of the two mechanisms. We use mechanical finite element models that represent the two mechanisms from the Late Oligocene (30 Ma) to the Present. For the Present, both models successfully reproduce observed deformation, implying that both models are viable. Back in time the Slab Edge Push mechanism better reproduces observations. Neither mechanism successfully reproduces the observed Miocene counter-clockwise rotation of Puerto Rico. We use this rotation to tune a final model that includes fractional contributions of both mechanisms. Both mechanisms contribute equally to the motion of the Caribbean plate. We find that the Slab Edge Push was the dominant driver of deformation in the north Caribbean plate boundary zone since 30 Ma.",

            "abstract": "We use a combination of Ka-band Zenith Radar (KaZR) and Multiple-Angle Snow Camera (MASC) observations at the ARM North Slope Alaska Climate Facility Site at Barrow to quantify snowfall. The optimal-estimation framework is used to combine information from the KaZR and MASC into a common retrieval scheme, where retrieved estimates of snowfall are compared to observations at a nearby NWS measurement site for evaluation. Modified from the operational CloudSat algorithm, the retrieval scheme returns estimates of the vertical profile of exponential PSD slope parameter with a constant number density. These values, in turn, can be used to calculate surface snowrate (liquid equivalent) given knowledge of snowflake microphysical properties and fallspeeds.\nWe exploit scattering models for a variety of ice crystal shapes including aggregates developed specifically from observations of snowfall properties at high-latitudes, as well as more pristine crystal shapes involving sector plates, bullet rosettes, and hexagonal columns. As expected, initial retrievals suggest large differences (300% for some events) in estimated snowfall accumulations given the use of the different ice crystal assumptions. The complex problem of how we can more quantitatively link MASC snowflake images to specific radar scattering properties is an ongoing line of research. Here, however, we do quantify the use of MASC observations of fallspeed and PSD parameters as constraint on our optimal-estimation retrieval approach. In terms of fallspeed, we find differences in estimated snowfall of nearly 50% arising from the use of MASC observed fallspeeds relative to those derived from traditional fallspeed parameterizations. In terms of snowflake PSD, we find differences of nearly 25% arising from the use of MASC observed slope parameters relative to those derived from field campaign observations of high-altitude snow events. Of course, these different sources of error conspire to make the estimate of snowfall non-unique. Our initial results, however, do suggest use of the MASC as a means to reduce some of this ambiguity in the snowfall retrieval problem.",

The tendency of anomalies of global mean SST was correlated (0.5) with the global mean RT with half-month leads. Local correlations were significant (95%) over 40% area of the ice-free ocean, mostly in the middle latitudes, when the tendency of SST leads RT by a half month, indicating that the change in SST modifies cloud and atmospheric circulation. The tendency of the global sum of OE above 100 m for trend length of one month has a contemporary correlation (0.7) with the global mean of RT anomalies in the 12-month running mean time series, while the size of storage exceeds the amount explained by RT  as shwon in the attached Figure which covers the period from March 2000 to December 2014. Variances with time scales longer than one year for OE and SST dominated in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, while those of RT were relatively smaller there. The maximum and minimum OE tendencies were found in the tropics, while those of RT were found at off-equatorial latitudes, indicating oceanic and atmospheric processes connect them. The equivalent ocean depth under the influence of inter-annual RT variations is uncertain due to limited accuracy of the current datasets.",

The project's aim is to motivate more diverse young people (especially African Americans) to consider Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers. The program offers intensive summer workshops at community youth centers, afterschool workshops at a local high school, a year-round internship for those who have taken part in one or more of our workshops, public and school outreach, and educator professional development workshops. By adding Art (fine art, graphic art, multimedia, design, and \"maker/tinkering\" approaches) to STEM learning, we wanted to try a unique combination of what's often now called the \"STEAM movement\" in STEM education. We've paid particular attention to highlighting how scientists and artists/tinkerers often collaborate, and why scientists need visualization and design experts. The program values the rise of the STEAM teaching concept, particularly that art, multimedia, design, and maker projects can help communicate science concepts more effectively. We also promote the fact that art, design, and visualization skills can lead to jobs and broader participation in science, and we frequently work with and showcase scientific illustrators and other science visualization professionals.

            "abstract": "Bauxite residue, a byproduct of the Bayer process for alumina refining, is an alkaline, saline tailings material that is generally considered to be inhospitable to microbial life. In situ remediation strategies promote soil formation in bauxite residue by enhancing leaching of saline, alkaline pore water, and through incorporation of amendments to boost organic matter content, decrease pH, and improve physical structure. The amelioration of chemical and physical conditions in bauxite residue is assumed to support diversification of microbial communities from narrow, poorly functioning microbial communities towards diverse, well-functioning communities. This study aimed to characterise microbial communities in fresh and remediated bauxite residues from refineries worldwide, to identify (a) whether initial microbial communities differed between refineries; (b) major environmental controls on microbial community composition; and (c) whether remediation successfully shifts the composition of microbial communities in bauxite residue towards those found in reference (desired endpoint) soils. Samples were collected from 16 refineries and characterised using 16S amplicon sequencing to examine microbial community composition and structure, in conjunction with physicochemical analyses. Initial microbial community composition was similar across refineries but partitioned into two major groups. Microbial community composition changes slowly over time and indicates that alkalinity and salinity inhibit diversification. Microbially-based strategies for in situ remediation should consider the initial microbial community composition and whether the pre-treatment of chemical properties would optimise subsequent bioremediation outcomes. During in situ remediation, microbial communities become more diverse and develop wider functional capacity, indicating progression towards communities more commonly observed in natural grassland and forest soils.",

Pollen zones, identified from temporally constrained cluster analysis, coincide with historic periods developed from well-established ceramic sequences corresponding to the Roman Imperial through Late Antique (1 to 600 CE) Early Medieval (600 to 875 CE), Medieval through Late Medieval (875 to 1400 CE), Renaissance and Modern (1400 to 1725 CE), and Contemporary periods (1725 CE to present). Non-metric dimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination showed that each temporal period occupied a unique ecologic space suggesting that a new landscape was created during each successive historic period. During Roman time, between 1 and 500 CE, a modest decline in forest coincides with a positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and drier climate; however mesophyllous forest is preserved. Steep decline in forest cover between 850 and 950 CE coincides with positive temperature anomalies in Europe and a positive NAO. Although this would seem to suggest climate as a cause, temperature and precipitation changes are modest and the magnitude and rapidity of the vegetation change suggests climate played a small role. Archaeological evidence from across Europe identifies socioeconomic factors that produced forest clearing. In contrast, cooler temperatures and a negative NAO (increased ppt) appears to have been a catalyst for land abandonment and forest recovery in the 13th to 14th centuries. The NAO produces opposite effects on societies in the eastern and western Mediterranean with the negative phase in 1400 CE leading to cool wet climate and land abandonment in central Italy but an abrupt shift to drier conditions and change from sedentary village life to nomadism in Syria.",

There is no river in these remote islands and thus the freshwater supply is relied on the subsurface reservoir. The basin area of the subsurface reservoir is 2.14 km2 , discharge of groundwater is 1.27×106m3 , annual planning water supplies is 7.9×105m3 , which include for domestic agricultural usage. The annual average temperature is 23.3oC, average moisture is 80~85%, annual average rainfall is 913 mm, but ET rate is 1975mm. As there is no single river in the basin; the major recharge of groundwater is by infiltration.\nChi-Ken reservoir is the first subsurface reservoir in Taiwan. Originally, the water quality of the reservoir is good. The reservoir has had the salinity problem since 1991 and it became more and more serious from 1992 until 1994. Possible reason of the salinity problem was the shortage of rainfall or the leakage of the subsurface barrier which caused the seawater intrusion. The present study aimed to determine the leakage position of subsurface barrier that caused the salinity problem. In order to perform the simulation for different possible leakage position of the subsurface reservoir, a Groundwater Modeling System (GMS) is used to define soils layer data, hydro-geological parameters, initial conditions, boundary conditions and the generation of three dimension meshes. A three dimension FEMWATER(Yeh , 1996) numerical model was adopted to find the possible leakage position of the subsurface barrier and location of seawater intrusion by comparing the simulation of different possible leakage with the observations.\n1.By assuming the leakage position in the bottom of barrier, the simulated numerical result matched the observation better than the other assumed leakage positions. It showed that the most possible leakage position was at the bottom of the barrier.\n2.The research applied three dimension FEMWATER and GMS as an interface to input parameter. The simulation of water level and chloride concentration already showed the real situation, and the result can be applied to the future study of the Chi-Ken subsurface reservoir salinity problems.",

It considers the canopy storages for heat, water, and trace gases that are generally neglected in the CLM4.5 surface flux calculation algorithm. Moreover, the CASS introduces prognostic equations for the surface variables and eliminates the CLM4.5 Crank-Nicolson iterative solution for computing surface skin temperature, which usually brings residual errors into the model and causes numerical instability. Two off-line simulations (one with the CASS and the other with the origin CLM4.5 scheme) were conducted and their results were compared with the FLUXNET observations. Preliminary results show that compared with the origin CLM4.5 scheme, the CASS has similar or better skills in representing land surface exchanges for heat, water and carbon under several biome types. The implementation of the CASS into the CLM4.5 not only improves the land model skills, but also provides a modeling framework to incorporate more complex canopy processes into the land surface model, such as bi-directional emission schemes for various trace gases and multi-layer canopy energy balance models.",

            "abstract": "DNA in marine sediment contains both detrital sequences and sequences from organisms native to the sediment. The demarcation between these two pools and their rates of respective turnover as sediment ages are generally unknown. Here we address these issues by quantifying the total extractable DNA pool and comparing it to the fraction of sequenced chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) in sediment from two sites in the Bering Sea. Sediment at both of these sites is initially oxic, but transitions to suboxic and anoxic within approximately hundred years. In our samples, cpDNA as a tracer of detrital DNA is dominated by identifiable phylotypes that match specific siliceous microfossil taxa. The fraction of sequences comprised by cpDNA decreases with increasing sediment age over hundreds of thousands of years (kyr) to 1.4 million years (Ma), but does not reach zero at either site. When we take into account the overall shrinkage of the DNA pool, this cpDNA fraction follows a power-law function, suggesting that the residual cpDNA becomes increasingly recalcitrant with age. This increasing recalcitrance can be explained by biological activity decreasing with sediment age and / or by preferential long-term survival of only the most thoroughly protected DNA. In either case, this trend suggests that DNA persisting beyond an initial period (ca. 100 – 200 kyr at our sites) has an increased chance of preservation at depth. The association of sequenced cpDNA reads with specific siliceous microfossil taxa suggests that microfossils may help to preserve DNA; DNA from such taxa may be useful for studies of paleoenvironmental conditions and biological evolution on timescales that approach or exceed one million years.",

            "abstract": "A dramatic development in subglacial science in recent decades has been the considerable international effort aimed at improving understanding of the hidden subglacial aquatic environments (SAEs) beneath ice sheets. These include a diverse range of lakes, rivers, shallow and deep sediments. Technology challenges associated with the exploration of these environments are substantial because of their remote nature, extreme conditions and the requirement for sterile/clean access and sampling. While two Antarctic subglacial lakes have now been penetrated (Subglacial Lakes Vostok and Whillans), significant challenges remain for a) the clean access and sampling of deeper SAEs, such as deep sediments in lakes and sedimentary basins, and also b) for in situ monitoring of physical, chemical and biological conditions in SAEs. The scientific arguments for deep drilling into subglacial environments are compelling. Data providing clues to glaciation history and past climate are likely to be locked up in these deeper sedimentary strata. They are also likely oases for microbial life, which is actively involved in biogeochemical cycling processes, such as methane hydrate formation within deep sedimentary basins. This talk aims to give an overview of the current challenges and technology solutions for the exploration of SAEs, with a particular focus on in situ sensing technologies. It also presents recent results from the NERC funded programme, DELVE (DEveLopment and Validation of in situ chemical sensors for icy Ecosystems).",

For simulations we use multi-species hybrid (kinetic ions and fluid electrons) three-dimensional model. We consider O++, S++ as the main constituents of the Jovian plasma torus at Europa while its neutral atmosphere is considered to be composed primarily of (neutral) O2 molecules. We consider ionization processes of the neutral O2 atmosphere which is then a source of dense population of pick-up ions at Europa. We calibrate the ionization coefficients according to the comparison between simulated ion densities and densities observed in situ. We examine global structure of the interaction. The plasma composed of pick-up ions represents an obstacle for the Jovian magnetic field resulting in the compression of the magnetic field lines which in return causes development of temperature anisotropies. We study examine the regions where the threshold of temperature anisotropy driven instabilities has been reached and conclude what type of waves is generated in different regions of the interaction. We also focus on the refiling processes of the small cavity formed in the plasma downstream the relative plasma flow between Europa and the magnetospheric plasma. We acquire high resolution simulated data along virtual trajectories of Galileo which allows us to directly compare simulation results to in situ observations.",

            "abstract": "The 3D structure of the upper mantle plays a large role in Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA). Finite-element software is able to model this 3D structure, but knowledge of the upper mantle is needed to make these models realistic. Nowadays, global maps are made of the crustal structure and temperature of the upper mantle from seismic observations. Also, satellite gravity missions, such as GOCE and GRACE, determine global gravity fields. Combining these data sets could give new insights in Glacial Isostatic Adjustment and explain some discrepancies seen in currents geological observations with 1D rheology Earth models.\nWe obtain upper mantle models that fit gravity observations. Then, the upper mantle seismic velocities are converted to temperature profiles; that are used to determine the amount of strain according to diffusion and dislocation creep in the upper mantle. The obtained 3D rheology models are used in a finite element GIA model to observe the effect of the 3D structures during GIA. The GIA model results are compared to geological observations of the sea level change, GPS uplift rates, and ongoing gravity change in the area.\nThis study specifically studies the effect of compositional differences in the upper mantle on the modelled remaining uplift and gravity signal. Molecular conversion relations for primitive mantle rock composition, Garnet Lherzolite rock composition, and Archon, iron depleted rock composition are used to compute the temperature and density profiles. The Fennoscandian lithosphere is believed to contain these three types of composition, yet, it is not yet known in what relative amounts and locations. An iterative approach is used to find the best compositional structure to fit the GIA observables in the Fenoscandian upper mantle.",

Model Dev.) is developed at the KIT with the goal to simulate interactions between trace substances and the state of the atmosphere.\nFor the dynamics (transport and diffusion) of gaseous tracers, the original ICON tracer framework is used. For the model physics, numerical time integration follows a process splitting approach separating physical processes. Each process is called independently via an interface module. Currently, the processes of emission, dry and wet deposition, sedimentation, and first order chemical reactions are included.\nThe new gas-phase chemical module within ICON-ART uses the kpp formalism (Sandu and Sander, 2006, Atmos. Chem. Phys.) and the photolysis module is based on Cloud-J 7.3 (Prather, 2015, Geosci. Model Dev.), which provides online calculation of actinic flux for a wavelength region down to 170nm, depending on the actual state of ozone, temperature, pressure, relative humidity and liquid water path, resulting in photolysis rates which are usable for the simulation of tropospheric as well as stratospheric trace gas distributions.\nIn this study we are presenting the comparison of photolysis rates with TORERO (Tropical Ocean tRoposphere Exchange of Reactive halogen species and Oxygenated VOC) campaign data. The TORERO flight campaign was conducted in the region of Costa Rica and Chile at the beginning of 2012.\nIn addition to that we are comparing results of the simulation of chemical trace gases like ozone with campaign data as well.",

As the solar wind passed through the neutral cometary coma, it experienced charge exchange that was observed as an increase in the ratio of He+/He++. In addition, particles originating from fragments trailing the major cometary objects were ionized and picked up by the solar wind. The cometary material can be identified by the concentrations of water-group pickup ions having a mass-per-charge ratio of 16-18 amu/e, indicating that these are actively sublimating fragments.

A number of studies have been reported how a manager is able to mitigate those impacts of increasing natural hazards induced from climate change such as droughts and floods. Though assessing and mitigating the impacts through climate change scenarios has been widely performed, real case applications to hydrologic structures have not yet been popularly made especially in small basins. The specific difficulty of the application for small basins is the requirement of lower time scale data of hydro- meteorological variables. In the current study, we presented how the design channel width of small basins for a specific region can be reformulated considering climate change scenarios. The scenarios of the hourly rainfall downscaled from daily data were employed for the application of small basins. We used the specific region in South Korea and 162 small rivers and creeks were modeled and the downscaled hourly data of the climate scenarios was tested. A general equation to estimate the average channel width according to the design floods estimated with the climate scenarios is reformulated to reflect the variation influenced by climate change.",

The Alps modulate synoptic flow and introduce circulation systems that reach into the forelands. In addition, the Prealpine landscape is heterogeneous itself, dominated by patches of forestry on the slopes and agriculture on flat areas. That combined complexity is manifest in atmospheric circulations at multiple scales. We investigated the diurnal evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer with focus on the connection between surface exchange processes and atmospheric circulations at the regional to local scale. The experiment is part of an ongoing, multi-disciplinary study on scale dependencies in the distribution of energy and matter (ScaleX) at the TERENO Prealpine observatory in Germany.\nWe observed vertical profiles of wind speed and air temperature up to 1000 m above ground during June and July 2015 in a small shallow Prealpine valley in Bavaria, Germany. Wind vectors and temperature were observed using ground-based optical, acoustic and radiometric remote sensing techniques. Spatial patterns in wind speed and direction were determined using eddy covariance systems, 3D Doppler LIDAR and acoustic sounding (RASS). Three Doppler LIDAR units were configured to form a virtual tower at the beam intersect. Temperature profiles were observed using radio-acoustic sounding (RASS) and a microwave radiometer (HATPRO). The temporal and spatial resolutions of the resulting vertical profiles were between 1-15 min and between 3-100 m, respectively.\nThe observed variability in wind vectors and stability shows evidence of the link between flow phenomena at micro- to mesoscale and local biosphere-atmosphere exchange processes. We present first results and discuss the predictability of the impact of local and regional (alpine) landscape features on flow and structures in the atmospheric boundary layer.",

Evidence from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) true-colour images supports the field measurements. Initialized by the parameters from observations, a two-layer numerical model based on the Regularized Long-Wave (RLW) equation in a homogeneous thermocline is employed to analyze the propagation and evolution of the ISWs, which shows results similar to the observations. The simulation results indicate that ISWs usually fission near the critical region (the coefficient of the nonlinear term, α≈0).

By combining the two lidar datasets, we are able to investigate intra-annual, annual, interannual surface elevation change. We investigate both the high melt season of 2012 and the low melt season of 2013. In addition, the major 2015 IceBridge Arctic campaign provides new crucial data for determining seasonal ice sheet thinning rates. We compare our LVIS/ATM results with surface mass balance outputs from two regional climate models: the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) and the Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR). We also investigate the thinning rates of major outlet glaciers.",

            "abstract": "Whereas seaward-verging thrust faults are, by far, the most common large faults associated with accretionary wedges, the importance of the globally rare, landward verging thrusts has recently been highlighted given the prominence of landward vergence along the Cascadia margin as well as along the Andaman-Sumatra subduction zone, especially in the rupture area of the great 2004 earthquake. The mechanical processes that lead to seaward- versus landward-verging thrusts in accretionary wedges has long been a topic of debate. A weak frictional décollement is one explanation that indeed promotes landward vergence, but not only so, because the typical pattern is of dual verging conjugate faults. A non-brittle, ductile décollement is a second explanation that has been shown in the laboratory to produce a wide sequence of only landward-verging thrusts, but the mechanical causes are not well understood and numerical modeling studies have yet to reproduce this behavior. A seaward-dipping backstop is a third explanation; it promotes landward vergence locally, but more distally the backstop effects diminish and the sense of vergence transitions back to seaward. Mohr-Coulomb and minimum work theory predict that landward vergence should predominate when the direction of maximum principal compression dips landward. We hypothesize that such a condition can arise due to the migration of pore fluids and the associated spatial heterogeneity in frictional strength within the wedge. We test this hypothesis using 2-D numerical models that use a finite-difference, particle-in-cell method for simulating the deformation of an accretionary wedge with a viscoelastic-plastic rheology. With a uniform internal frictional strength, the calculations reproduce many of the faulting behaviors seen in prior laboratory and numerical modeling studies. We are exploring the impacts of heterogeneity in pore fluid pressure and frictional strength on the pattern and vergence of thrust faults.",

            "abstract": "Balerang and Rajabasa are Quaternary volcanic complex with active fumaroles though no historic eruptions were recorded. These volcanoes are stratovolcanoes and located in the volcanic front of Sunda arc. Although some studies reported the geological setting of these volcanoes in these past few years, their detailed volcanostratigraphy and evolution are still unclear. Morphological analysis and field observation were used to understand the detail of volcanostratigraphy and the evolution of volcanic edifices. Morphological characteristics were analyzed by areal and linear analysis using perspective view of DEM. Sample data from Balerang and Rajabasa volcanoes were collected as well and compared each other. By analyzing the both data, it was elucidated that this volcanic complex has erupted from 4 different vents, and produced both lavas and pyroclastics. This result was strengthened by constructing a fence diagram and reconciling each of the layers. The shifting of vents was strongly influenced by active dextral Great Sumatran Fault. Geochemical study was conducted as well, and this study shows that the composition of Balerang’s magma has undergone a reversal evolution from dacite to basaltic andesite. The lavas of the early product shows dacitic (%SiO2~65.76-66.24), middle stage shows andesitic (%SiO2 ~62.19), and the late stage shows basaltic andesite (%SiO2 ~55.19). On the other hand, Rajabasa magma is nearly constant between andesitic to dacitic (%SiO2 ~60.15-65.52).",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing methods based on temperature-vegetation relationships have been widely used to analyze regional evapotranspiration (ET) patterns. These methods essentially rely on the identification of extreme soil moisture conditions (i.e., cold and hot pixels) as determined from the outer boundaries a triangle or trapezoid-shaped scatterplot of radiometric surface temperature and vegetation fraction. However, the validity of these pixels has been increasingly questioned in studies that involve heterogeneous climatic and land cover conditions, compromising the performance of remote sensing-based ET estimates in large areas. Here we developed a geospatial analysis scheme to discretize a targeted area into climate-land zones based on precipitation, radiation, wind, humidity, soil, and vegetation factors. Zonal ET estimates based on temperature-vegetation indexes were spatially aggregated to generate regional ET estimates over different time scales. We applied this approach to Jordan using Landsat and MODIS images over the period 2005-2014 and compared the ET estimates to MOD16 ET products and pan evaporation measurements. We explored contrasting hydrological conditions across a range of bioclimatic regions. Results show that our approach is able to capture regional ET heterogeneity in both water-limited and energy-limited environments and identify the hydroclimatic controls. Our comparisons of different methods shed light on the efficient estimation of agricultural water use in data-scarce, arid/semi-arid regions based on remote sensing.",

            "abstract": "As a key precursor for tropospheric ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx) play an important role in atmospheric chemistry. The NOx distribution in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) is controlled by different sources and processes, such as long-range transport, uplift of emissions from the boundary layer, lightning, and air traffic emissions. The combination of comparatively short lifetime, variety of sources, and complex chemistry entails large spatial variations in the abundance of nitrogen oxides. Insufficient knowledge of the NOx background concentrations in the UTLS implicates uncertainties in the determination of the ozone production, which depends non-linear on the background NOxmixing ratios. To evaluate model simulations, a sound observational data base of nitrogen oxides in the UTLS is required.\nWithin the framework of CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) nitrogen oxide measurements are performed regularly aboard a passenger aircraft. A total of 330 flights were conducted from May 2005 through April 2013 between Frankfurt/Germany and destinations in the USA, Canada, Brazil, Venezuela, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, South Africa, China, South Korea, Japan, India, Thailand, and the Philippines. We present data averages of NO and NOy for the different regions and for different seasons. At mid-latitudes, observed NOy and NO generally show clear seasonal cycles in the upper troposphere with a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter. Mean NOy mixing ratios vary between 1.36 nmol/mol in summer and 0.27 nmol/mol in winter. Mean NO mixing ratios range between 0.05 nmol/mol and 0.22 nmol/mol. Regions in the sub-tropics and tropics show no consistent seasonal dependence of the NO and NOyabundance.\nThese measurements represent one of the most comprehensive NO and NOy dataset presently available for the tropopause region and is a suitable basis for establishing a climatology. It can be used for the evaluation of global chemistry-climate models.",

            "abstract": "Understanding place, including both the environment and its people, is essential to understanding our climate, climate change, and its impacts. For us to develop a sense of our place, we need to engage in multiple ways of learning: observation, experimentation, and opportunities to apply new knowledge (Orr, 1992). This approach allows us to access different sources of knowledge and then create local solutions for local issues. It is especially powerful when we rely on experts and elders in our own community along with information from the global community.\nThe Pacific islands Climate Education Partnership (PCEP) is a collaboration of partners—school systems, nongovernmental organizations, and government agencies—working to support learning and teaching about climate in the Pacific. Since 2009, PCEP partners have been working together to develop and implement classroom resources, curriculum standards, and teacher professional learning opportunities in which learners approach climate change and its impacts first through the lens of their own place. Such an approach to putting place central to teaching and learning about climate requires partnership and opportunities for learners to explore solutions for and with their communities.\nIn this presentation, we will share the work unfolding in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) as one example of PCEP’s approach to place-based climate education. Three weeklong K-12 teacher professional learning workshops took place during June-July 2015 in Majuro, RMI on learning gardens, climate science, and project-based learning. Each workshop was co-taught with local partners and supports educators in teaching climate-related curriculum standards through tasks that can foster sense of place through observation, experimentation, and application of new knowledge. Additionally, we will also share PCEP's next steps in place-based climate education, specifically around emerging conversations about the importance of highlighting stories of place to generate local solutions for local issues, as well as further global awareness about climate change impacts in the Pacific.",

We found a major difference in paleo-geothermal structure and consolidation states between the unconformity in the forearc basin in the Boso Peninsula, central Japan.\nThe geology of the Boso Peninsula, central Japan is divided into three parts; Early Miocene and Late Miocene accretionary prisms in the southern part, the Hayama-Mineoka tectonic belt mainly composed of ophiolite in the middle part, and post-Middle Miocene forearc basin in the northern part. Sediments in the forearc basin are composed of 15-3Ma Miura Group and 3-0.6Ma Kazusa Group. Boundary of the two groups is the Kurotaki Unconformity formed about 3Ma, when convergent direction of the Philippine Sea Plate has been changed (Takahashi, 2006). Vitrinite reflectance (Ro) analyses were conducted and revealed that major variation of paleo-maximum temperature between the Miura and Kazusa groups. The maximum paleo-temperature in the Miura Group is estimated as 70-95˚C, whereas in the lower part of the Kazusa Group is less than 10-35˚C. Given 20˚C/km (Sakai et al, 2011) paleo-geothermal gradient, approximately 2000 m uplifting/erosion of the Miura Group is expected when the unconformity formed. To verify the amount of this uplifting/erosion, we are performing consolidation test of mudstone.\n[",

Petrological, mineralogical and geochemical analyses of iron ores and their wall rock (amphibolite) were conducted to trace the genesis of Yishui BIF. Iron ores of Yishui BIF are mainly composed of SiO2 and Fe2O3T (SiO2+ Fe2O3T= 85.8 to 98.8 wt%) and consistent with major mineral components which are quartz and iron oxide such as magnetite and hematite. Low contents of TiO2 (0.01 to 0.09 wt%) , Al2O3 (0.42 to 1.18 wt%) and HFSE indicate no or little effect of detrital contamination. Iron ores have positive La, Eu, Gd, Er and Y anomalies with enriched HREE in PAAS normalized REY graph. The REY patterns of iron ores were used as a fingerprint to trace the source of iron and silica. Distinctive positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu*= 2.44-4.19), Y anomalies (Y/Y*=0.97 - 4.19), slightly negative Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce*= 0.87-0.97) and enriched HREE ((La/Yb)SN= 0.17-0.32) indicate that mixture of seawater and high-temperature hydrothermal fluid (>250 ◦C).

Based on the batch experiments, OSE(II) was proved as a suitable active agent that solubilizes TPH present as contaminants. The highest recovery (92-95 %) of the contaminants was obtained using a OSE(II) in the batch experiments. The pilot test results revealed that the optimum conditions were achieved with a OSE(II) surfactant solution concentration of 10 % (v/v), a OSE(II) surfactant solution pH of 6.5-7.5 of OSE(II) active agent solution. The maximum removal of contaminants (88 %) was obtained when optimum conditions were simultaneously met in pilot-scale OESW operations.

            "abstract": "Simulations of the spatial-temporal dynamics of wetlands is key to understanding the role of wetland biogeochemistry under past and future climate variability. Hydrologic inundation models, such as TOPMODEL, are based on a fundamental parameter known as the compound topographic index (CTI) and provide a computationally cost-efficient approach to simulate global wetland dynamics. However, there remains large discrepancy in the implementations of TOPMODEL in land-surface models (LSMs) and thus their performance against observations. This study describes new improvements to TOPMODEL implementation and estimates of global wetland dynamics using the LPJ-wsl DGVM, and quantifies uncertainties by comparing three digital elevation model products (HYDRO1k, GMTED, and HydroSHEDS) at different spatial resolution and accuracy on simulated inundation dynamics. We found that calibrating TOPMODEL with a benchmark dataset can help to successfully predict the seasonal and interannual variations of wetlands, as well as improve the spatial distribution of wetlands to be consistent with inventories. The HydroSHEDS DEM, using a river-basin scheme for aggregating the CTI, shows best accuracy for capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of wetland among three DEM products. This study demonstrates the feasibility to capture spatial heterogeneity of inundation and to estimate seasonal and interannual variations in wetland by coupling a hydrological module in LSMs with appropriate benchmark datasets. It additionally highlight the importance of an adequate understanding of topographic indices for simulating global wetlands and show the opportunity to converge wetland estimations in LSMs by identifying the uncertainty associated with existing wetland products.",

            "abstract": "We estimate contrail cirrus radiative forcing (RF) within the climate model ECHAM5-CCMod. The new extension of the contrail cirrus parameterization, including a microphysical 2-moment scheme, allows a more realistic representation of microphysical processes and therefore of the microphysical and optical properties of contrail cirrus. In particular at the beginning of the contrail cirrus life cycle it appears to be crucial to estimate the contrail cirrus volume and the dilution connected with its growth. Water deposition is limited using an estimate for the diffusional growth of ice crystals. This is in particular important in later stages of the contrail cirrus life cycle. The model can resolve the temporal evolution of contrail cirrus properties, starting with many small crystals and a peak in ice water content after a few hours, resembling eventually natural cirrus. We perform simulations for the year 2002 (AERO2k), a base inventory for the year 2006 (AEDT) and for several scenarios for the year 2050 (AEDT) allowing the isolation of effects due to increases in air traffic volume and efficiency and soot reductions. The global RF of contrail cirrus for the year 2002 and 2006 is estimated to be 35.4mW/m2 and 56.1mW/m2, respectively. A strong increase of RF simulated for the year 2050 is the result of an increased air traffic volume and a shift towards higher altitudes. Particularly in the tropics the relation of RF to flight distance increases. In comparison climate change has a very small effect on contrail cirrus RF due to compensation in different regions. The strong increase in contrail cirrus RF for the future air traffic scenario cannot be compensated by a decrease in initial ice crystal numbers due to reduced soot emissions. Contrail cirrus RF appears to be nonlinearly dependent on the initial ice crystal concentration, with larger soot reductions having a large impact on contrail cirrus optical depth and life times.",

            "abstract": "Conceptualization of the fracture network in a disposal site is important for the safety assessment of a subsurface repository for radioactive waste. To consider the uncertainty of the stochastically conceptualized discrete fracture networks (DFNs), the ensemble variability of equivalent permeability was evaluated by defining different network structures with various fracture densities and characterization levels, and analyzing the ensemble mean and variability of the equivalent permeability of the networks, where the characterization level was defined as the ratio of the number of deterministically conceptualized fractures to the total number of fractures in the domain. The results show that the hydraulic property of the generated fractures were similar among the ensembles when the fracture density was larger than the specific fracture density where the domain size was equal to the correlation length of a given fracture network. In a sparsely fracture network where the fracture density was smaller than the specific fracture density, the ensemble variability was too large to ensure the consistent property from the stochastic DFN modeling. Deterministic information for a portion of a fracture network could reduce the uncertainty of the hydraulic property only when the fracture density was larger than the specific fracture density. Based on these results, the DFN modeling domain size for KAERI’s (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute) URT (Underground Research Tunnel) site to guarantee a less variable hydraulic property of the fracture network was determined by calculating the correlation length, and verified by evaluating the ensemble variability of the equivalent permeability.",

            "abstract": "Rheological properties of subduction interface shear zones control several aspects of subduction zone dynamics, including shear tractions along the plate interface, rates and amounts of exhumation, and depths and styles of seismicity. We document the rheological properties of a deep subduction interface using exhumed eclogite and blueschist-facies rocks from Syros Island, Greece. These rocks were subducted to ~60 km depth during the Eocene, were exhumed part way along the top of the subducting slab, and were then exhumed to upper-crustal levels beneath Miocene detachment faults. Localization of strain during exhumation allowed prograde fabrics to be preserved. The PT conditions (400-550°C, 12-16kb) of these fabrics are comparable to conditions of episodic tremor and slow slip (ETS) observed in some modern subduction zones, including Cascadia. Two types of prograde fabrics were distinguished after analyzing macro-scale distributions of strain and microphysical mechanisms of creep in metamafic rocks. Type 1 fabrics contain eclogite pods boudinaged within a blueschist matrix. The eclogites show brittle deformation with cross-cutting veins containing high-pressure minerals. Deformation in matrix blueschists is accommodated by rigid rotation of amphibole and diffusion creep in plagioclase. Type 2 fabrics contain blueschists and eclogites that are isoclinally folded at similar wavelengths, thus are approximately isoviscous. Deformation is again accommodated by diffusion creep in blueschists, but by dislocation creep of omphacite in eclogites. These deformation types characterizing boudin-matrix and isoviscous rheologies of blueschist-eclogite assemblages appear to reflect varying amounts of finite strain, but work is in progress to determine whether they also record different PT conditions. The transition from Type 1 to 2 fabrics represents a significant change in bulk viscosity and seismic anisotropy, and may correspond to a transition from ETS-type behavior—a coupled seismic (brittle)-aseismic (ductile creep) phenomena—to fully ductile aseismic creep. Rheological heterogeneity appears to be an inherent feature of subduction terranes, involving changes in deformation mechanisms from subduction to exhumation and strain partitioning between lithologies in the subduction shear zone.",

            "abstract": "Wetland ecosystems around the world are increasingly being targeted as land use development ‘hotspots’ under growing concerns of climate variability and food security. Anthropogenic encroachment on natural wetland ecosystems can have direct consequences locally through loss of biodiversity and regionally through increased disaster risks associated with, for example, flooding. We consider two regionally-relevant wetland ecosystems in eastern Africa, namely Zambia’s Lukanga Swamps and Tanzania’s Kilombero Valley, experiencing varying trajectories of development under climatic variations. These regions have been targeted for inclusive, multi-stakeholder initiatives that aim at developing agricultural potential through combinations of large and small scale irrigation schemes. Through our data-driven analysis we highlight the potential for shifts in hydrologic regime of each wetland ecosystem which can have significant regional impacts on disaster risks. In the case of the Lukanga Swamps, wetlands maintain water table fluctuations that help mitigate water cycling with implications for the downstream flooding impact of annual rains. With regards to Kilombero Valley, understanding seasonal changes in hydrological processes and storages provides the cornerstone for managing future water resource impacts/feedbacks under different scenarios of land management. This work emphasizes the need to tailor strategies towards sustainable uses of wetlands that reduce disaster risks regionally while contributing to improved community health and wellbeing. It remains an open (and fundamental) question of how to best define management recommendations and activities that not only achieve climate resiliency but also are acceptable for stakeholders without compromising the balance between ecosystem service supply and biodiversity conservation.",

            "abstract": "Fracture spacing data collected from scanlines and wells at various resolutions are commonly analyzed for the purposes of aquifer and reservoir characterization. It has been previously found for a certain set of nested fracture networks with similar fractal dimensions that differences in scale of observation hence, resolution lead to differences in clustering. It remains however, to be established whether differences in resolution of fracture spacing data can lead to significant differences in clustering behavior for a wider range of datasets. Most studies on fracture analysis either consider the cumulative frequency of spacing data without regard to the actual sequence of the spacing values or compute an average spacing that may not delineate clustered fractures. The coefficient of variation parameter, Cv is often used to differentiate between clustered, random, and unclustered fractures in a scanline but does not address the issue of scale-dependent variations. Lacunarity is a parameter that has been previously used for quantifying the scale-dependent clustering of spatial patterns and recently, this technique has also been used for identifying scale-dependent pattern changes from scanline data. The current research illustrates the application of this technique for delineating differences between scale-dependent clustering attributes of data collected at various resolutions along the same scanline. Specifically, data were collected at different resolutions from two outcrop exposures, a cliff-section and pavement, of the Cretaceous turbititic sandstones of the Chatsworth Formation widely exposed in southern California (USA). For each scanline, low resolution aerial photographs and high resolution ground measurements are analyzed for scale-dependent clustering attributes. In terms of scale-dependent lacunarity, higher resolution data show larger values than their respective low-resolution counterparts. It is postulated that lower resolution data captures fracture zones that have relatively uniform spacing while higher resolution data capture both thin and short splay joints and shear joints that form fracture clusters. Therefore, it may be concluded that data resolution is critical for identifying deformation mechanisms and their products.",

            "abstract": "At 10-0 m.y., the evolution of the Death Valley region, SE California, was characterized by repeated extrusion of mafic and intermediate lavas. The volume of these lavas appears to have diminished with time, from the relatively extensive (now faulted) Sheephead, Death Valley, Shoshone, and Funeral basalts to small monogenic volcanic centers (Split Cinder Cone, Ubehebe). A common denominator of these lavas is their transitional alkaline character (in general, trachybasalts to trachydacites with Na > K), relatively low MgO (1.5 to 6 wt.%), varying Fe2O3(tot) (4 to 12 wt.%) and Ni (10 to 80 ppm). They are all strongly enriched in the LREE: Chondrite-normalized La/Yb varies between 10 and 28, with the earlier, more voluminous lavas being less enriched (10 to 18) than the youngest volcanics (27 to 28). The initial Nd isotope composition of the lavas is outstandingly varying and does not correlate with fractionation stage. Their epsilon-Nd values vary from -10 to -2 and none of them thus registers a major asthenospheric component. Overall, these transitional mafic magmas probably represent relatively low-degree melts from the subcontinental lithosphere underneath the cratonic Mojavia crust. The 147Sm/144Nd ratios of the lavas show a restricted range (0.0930 to 0.1140) and, together with the measured 143Nd/144Nd ratios of the lavas, define Meso- to Neoproterozoic depleted mantle model ages between 800 and 1200 Ma. These have now spatial control across the Death Valley region and are clearly lower than those measured for the exposed craton. This suggest that the Mojavia cratonic mantle lithosphere may be a random amalgamation of ultramafic domains that vary in the degree of metasomatism and rejuvenation.",

            "abstract": "Geomagnetic method can be utilized in a wide range of applications, including investigation of small-scale near-surface targets and characterization of large-scale geologic structures. In particular, marine magnetic studies involve with various interpretation approaches to constrain geophysical information regarding the depth of a particular seamount, its size and shape, and the orientation and magnitude of its magnetization. The accuracy of the estimated information is normally governed by the quality and amount of available data and by the sophistication of the employed modeling techniques. Here we aim to advance geomagnetic modeling approaches using the interactive finite element solver, COMSOL Multiphysics, and improve the degree of detail that can be obtained from the measured magnetic field. First, we carried out benchmark tests by comparing the computed results using the analytic solutions for simple bodies. We built two types of synthetic models with rectangular and sphere shaped ore bodies having high intensity of magnetization and we changed magnetized direction in each calculation. Comparisons of FEM-based results with the analytic ones exhibited good agreement in general. Second, marine magnetic data obtained at seamounts can be very crucial to determine the age and location of seamount formation. Traditional magnetic methods often assume the uniformly magnetized seamounts to simplify computational efforts. However, the inner structures of seamounts constrained by seismic data show a clear distinction between the dense core and edifice layers. Here we divide the seamount into the dense core and edifice layers in a synthetic model, assign different magnetization direction and intensity to them, and optimize these parameters by minimizing differences between the observed and numerical computed data. These examined results will be valuable to understand seamount formation processes in detail. In addition, we discuss FEM-based magnetic models to mimic the simplified growth stages of seamount and their effect on magnetic modeling.",

The result of these processes has left fossil raised beach ridge systems several tens of meters above present sea-level. These beach ridge systems were formed during the Holocene, and they represent a proxy for the establishment of relative sea-level curves for this important time period.\nHere, we present ground-penetrating radar images of fossil raised beach ridge systems from western and southern Greenland. The radar images show the overall beach ridge system development and show traces of processes, as for example solifluction, which have disturbed the original beach deposits. Moreover, we interpret the transition from beach face deposits to upper shoreface deposits based on the radar images. The markers obtained in this way probably represent a level close to sea-level at the time of formation of the beach ridge deposits, and thus we suggest to use these markers to form the basis for construction of relative sea-level curves over time. We discuss our interpretation in the light of previous findings from other (micro-tidal) environments in southwest Scandinavia, where the tidal range is much smaller.\nFinally, advantages of using ground-penetrating radar images collected across beach ridge systems for estimation of relative sea-level fluctuations during the Holocene are discussed and the methodology is compared to other methods, for example isolation basin or beach ridge surface morphology studies, which have traditionally been widely used in Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential component involved in the energy balance and water budgeting methods, and its precise assessment are crucial for estimation of various hydrological parameters. Traditional point estimation methods for ET computation offer quantitative analysis, but lag in spatial distribution. The use of Remote Sensing (RS) data with good spatial, spectral and temporal resolution having broad spatial coverage, could lead the estimations with some advantages. However, approaches which requires data rich environment, demands time and resources. The estimation of spatially distributed soil evaporation (Es) and transpiration from canopy (Ec) by RS data, followed by their combination to provide the total ET, could be a simpler approach for accurate estimates of ET flux at macro-scale level. The ‘Extended Three Temperature Model’ (Extended 3T Model) is an established model based on same approach and is capable to compute ET and its partition of Es and Ec within the same algorithm. A case study was conducted using Extended 3T Model and MODIS products for the Brahmaputra river basin within the Northeast India for years 2000-2010. The extended 3T model was used by including its pre-requisite the land surface temperature (Ts), which was separated into the surface temperature of dry soil (Tsm) and the surface temperature of vegetation (Tcm), decided by a derivative of vegetation index (NDVI) called fractional vegetation cover (f). However, NDVI time series which is nonlinear and nonstationary can be decomposed by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) into components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), based on inherent temporal scales. The highest frequency component which was found to represent noise was subtracted from the original NDVI series to get the denoised product from which f was derived. The separated land surface temperatures (Tsm and Tcm) were used to calculate the Es and Ec followed by estimation of total ET. The spatiotemporal variation of Es, Ec and ET from denoised NDVI and original NDVI were analyzed in a comparative manner for different land covers in the study area. This scheme was used to justify the ET flux variation in magnitude and interannual/seasonal patterns during the years 2000-2010 in diversified land covers across ecosystems within the study area.",

            "abstract": "Ecologists have studied the diversity of microbial communities worldwide, largely motivated by the hypothesis that diversity is an important determinant of ecosystem function. However, direct links between microbial diversity and ecosystem function are difficult to demonstrate. Here we use a combination of 16S amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing to determine whether seasonal shifts in microbial diversity correspond to similar shifts in functional potential in Toolik Lake, a deep kettle lake in the Alaskan Arctic. We found that microbial diversity displays a repeating annual cycle set to the date of the spring snowmelt, with the most dramatic shifts in diversity occurring each year during the ten weeks following the onset of snowmelt. Similarly, the functional character of these communities appears to repeat annually, with season a better predictor of gene abundance than year among several gene families. Further, during the ten-week period after spring snowmelt, abundances of several gene families changed substantially. For example, while genes involved in photosynthesis were more abundant in summer than in winter, genes involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds were more abundant in winter than in summer. This pairing of shifts in diversity and metagenomic data suggests that microbial diversity is related to ecosystem function in a predictable way. Seasonally shifting environmental conditions likely drive transitions in both diversity and functional potential of Toolik Lake microbial communities, suggesting that both diversity and function will change in response to long-term shifts in environmental conditions such as those brought on by climate change.",

The field experiments were conducted using a state-of-the-art real-time field technology that allows instant comparison of field data and 3D numerical modelling results of all physical variables at micro and fine scales and phytoplankton concentration at the group level. The results demonstrate that subtropical lakes present special opportunities and challenges for mitigation of water quality problems in face of global warming.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 352 aimed to drill through the entire volcanic sequence of the Bonin fore arc. Four sites were drilled, two on the outer fore arc and two on the upper trench slope. Analysis of structures within drill cores, combined with borehole and site survey seismic data, indicates that tectonic deformation in the outer Izu-Bonin-Mariana fore arc is mainly post-magmatic, associated with the development of syn-tectonic sedimentary basins. Within the magmatic basement, deformation was accommodated by shear along cataclastic fault zones, and the formation of tension fractures, hybrid (tension and shear) fractures, and shear fractures.\nVeins commonly form by mineral filling of tension or hybrid fractures and, generally, show no or limited observable macroscale displacement along the fracture plane. The vein filling generally consists of (Low Mg-) calcite and/or various types of zeolite as well as clay. Vein frequency varies with depth but does not seem to correlate with the proximity of faults. This may indicate that these veins are genetically related to hydrothermal activity taking place shortly after magma cooling. Host-rock fragments are commonly embedded within precipitated vein material pointing to a high fluid pressure. Vein thickness varies from < 1 mm up to 15 mm. The wider veins appear to have formed in incremental steps of extension.\nCalcite veins tend to be purely dilational at shallow depths, but gradually evolve towards oblique tensional veins at depth, as shown by the growth of stretched calcite and/or zeolites (idiomorphic and/or stretched) with respect to vein margins. With increasing depth, the calcite grains exhibit deformation microstructures more frequently than at shallower core intervals. These microstructures include thin twinning (type I twins), increasing in width with depth (type I and type II twins), curved twins, and subgrain boundaries indicative of incipient plastic deformation.",

            "abstract": " The predictability of track and intensity for binary tropical cyclones (TCs) is relatively low due to the interaction between two TCs. In this study, radiance data were assimilated using the Three Dimensional Variational (3D-Var) data assimilation method to improve track and intensity forecasts of binary TCs. In detail, a total of three binary TC cases over the Northwestern Pacific from 2010 to 2015, which affected the Korean Peninsula, were selected. Infrared and microwave radiance data from multiple instruments and satellites were assimilated with the appropriate treatments of quality control, channel selection, bias correction, and cloud detection. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used as a forecasting model, and the resolution of the innermost domain was high (2 km) to capture the structure and intensity of TCs. Background error covariance was calculated using the National Meteorological Center (NMC) method, where background error statistics were from the differences between 24-h and 12-h forecasts for a month-long period.\n Overall, track and intensity errors of three binary TCs are reduced through the assimilation of radiance data. Especially, track forecasts are improved significantly because large-scale environments such as the North Pacific High and mid-latitude trough/ridge are simulated well. Analysis increment and its evolution are investigated to reveal the reason for the improvement of each binary TC’s forecast, focusing on TC’s internal structure and its environment. Additionally, effects of other observational data (e.g. radiosonde, satellite wind) are analyzed through the sensitivity experiments.",

            "abstract": "Inventory estimates of methane (CH4) emissions among the individual sources (mainly agriculture, energy production, and waste management) remain highly uncertain at regional and urban scales. Accurate atmospheric measurements can provide independent estimates to evaluate bottom-up inventories, especially in urban region, where many different CH4 sources are often confined in relatively small areas. Among these sources, livestock emissions, which are mainly originating from dairy cows, account for ~55% of the total CH4 emissions in California in 2013.\nThis study aims to rigorously estimate the amount of CH4 emitted by the largest dairies in the Southern California region by combining measurements from four mobile ground-based spectrometers (EM27/SUN), in situ isotopic methane measurements from a CRDS analyzer (Picarro), and a high-resolution atmospheric transport model (the Weather Research and Forecasting model) in Large-Eddy Simulation mode.\nThe remote sensing spectrometers measure the total column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CH4 and CO2 (XCH4 and XCO2) in the near infrared region, providing information about total emissions of the dairies. Gradients measured by the four EM27 ranged from 0.2 to 22 ppb and from 0.7 to 3 ppm for XCH4 and XCO2, respectively. To assess the fluxes of the dairies, measurements of these gradients are used in conjunction with the local atmospheric dynamics simulated at 111 m resolution. Inverse modelling from WRF-LES is employed to resolve the spatial distribution of CH4 emissions in the domain. A Bayesian inversion and a Monte-Carlo approach were used to provide the CH4 emissions over the dairy with their associated uncertainties. The isotopic δ13C sampled at different locations in the area ranges from -40 ‰ to -55 ‰, indicating a mixture of anthropogenic and biogenic sources.",

            "abstract": "The coastal landscapes of Vietnam are dominated in the north and south by the very large Red and Mekong rivers. Central Vietnam, in contrast, has few large rivers that flow to the coastal zone. This coupled with the high relief (>1500 m) of the granitic Truong Son Range and shallow gradient continental shelf, has produced two different coastal geomorphologies. The first is a shallow basin infilled with a sequence of parallel, arcuate beach ridges, and the second includes the development of shore-parallel spits and coastal lagoons. All systems are Holocene in age and we present evidence of the Holocene evolution of the northward-facing, beach ridge strandplain located in the Chan May embayment, approximately 35 km north of Danang. This embayment is relatively small (5 km long at the beach and with a beach ridge sequence that spans 11 km from the modern beach to the base of the Truong Son Range) compared to other beach ridge strandplains to the north and south and serves as an analogue for the evolution of these larger systems.\nThe Holocene evolution of the embayment was resolved using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), high-resolution sedimentological analysis and quartz Optically Stimulated Luminescence were used to investigate the internal stratigraphy and chronological development of the beach ridges at Chan May. The strandplain contains uniform, clean quartz-rich sediment interspersed by thin heavy mineral rich bands forming shallow-gradient beach ridges that have steadily prograded seaward during the regression after the mid-Holocene sea level highstand. As the beach ridges prograded seaward, a small river feeding directly from the Truong Son Range meandered across the strandplain and significantly modified the embayment. Recently, the river has become much reduced due to anthropogenic modification of the river and landscape. Prior to the Holocene marine highstand, the area was similarly characterized by a surface of prograding beach ridges that were eroded by large river channels.\nThe Chan May embayment is frequently impacted by large typhoons and the associated storm surge has caused significant economic damage. The impact of storm surge has not been adequately investigated or appropriate planning and management protocols developed in light of the ongoing development of a major port and economic hub in this region.",

For the above problem solving, it said that science education plays very important role. Especially learning with direct experience in the field is not only to get the only knowledge, we believe that greater development of science literacy, environmental literacy and disaster prevention literacy.\nIn this presentation, we propose the new teaching method of field learning not only provided by school but also provided by outside school. We show following four studies that are (1) function of running water and origin of the land (science education and disaster prevention), (2) environmental consciousness of student (environmental education), (3) radiation education (scientific technology and its utilization) and (4) astronomical observation (acquisition of time and space concept).\nWe were led to the preliminary conclusion of above four categories in practice research in and out of school. That is, the teacher is teaching the essence and phenomena of science to focus on science learning of school, in addition to environmental awareness, disaster prevention awareness, use of scientific technology are also important to teach at the same time. To do this, it is to make effective use of field learning. It can be said that the field study is a perfect and power place to perform learning such simultaneity. Because, natural field is originally the place can learn along with the feeling through the five senses of human. It is important especially for the growth stage of the student.",

            "abstract": "The Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument suite is part of the payload of the European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft. Part of this suite, the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS) has been analyzing major (e.g., H2O,) as well as minor (CO, CO2, N2, NHx, noble gases) species and elements and some of their isotopes thanks to its high mass resolution of 3,000 at 1% peak height and its high sensitivity. In parallel to the presentation by Rubin et al. (this meeting) who discuss temporal variation of the coma composition as a function of heliospheric distance, we present here the on-going measurements done on the above species and isotopes. Besides temporal variability, one of the goals of ROSINA is to document the composition of cometary volatiles in the context of the formation of planets and of the origin of atmospheres.\nThe first detection of a noble gas, Ar, in a cometary coma (Balsiger et al, in press), together with the measured D/H isotope ratio and carbon species, constrains the origin of the inner planet atmospheres and the terrestrial oceans. Assuming that 67P is representative of the cometary reservoir, major volatiles (H, C, N) of the inner planets are unlikely to have originated from comets, but a cometary origin for atmospheric noble gases is a viable hypothesis. However, these cometary measurements were done during a short interval of time (in autumn 2014) when the comet was at 3.5 AU from the Sun, which raises the question of how well they represent the bulk cometary composition. Further measurements of the bulk composition are planned close to the perihelion. Also of interest is the isotope composition of nitrogen in N-bearing compounds. Spectroscopic measurements of cometary HCN and NH2+ done so far indicate a two-fold enrichment in 15N, that needs to be confirmed by in-situ mass spectrometry. Measurements of other noble gases, in particular Xe (a very difficult measurement), may set stringent constraints on the nature (clathrate vs. amorphous) of cometary ice. Results from these measurements before and after the perihelion will be presented.",

As an important part in global C cycle, how the C cycle of tropical rainforests will be influenced by the N and P deposition should be focused on. This study simulated N and P deposition in a primary and secondary forest of tropical mountain rainforest in Jianfengling, Hainan, China, during five-year field experiment to evaluate the effects of N and P deposition on C cycling processes and relate characteristics. Six levels of N and P treatments were treated: Control, Low-N, Medium-N, High-N, P and N+P.\nThe relative growth rates (RGR) of tree layer in treatment plots were different from that in control plots after years of N and P addition. Simulated N and P deposition also increased ANPP in primary forest. N and P addition changed the growth of trees by altering soil nutrient and microbial activities. N and P addition increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N (TN) content, and significantly increased soil total P (TP) content, not changing soil pH. During the whole process of N and P addition, as net nitrification rate and net N mineralization rate were promoted by N and P addition, and effective N content (nitrate) of soil increased in the plot treated with N treatments compared to the control treatment. The microbial P content was increased by N and P addition, and microbial N was not changed. The increasing N deposition may enhance soil nutrient and stimulate growth of trees, which will lead to an increase of the C sequestration.",

According to large-scale model simulations, the direct and indirect radiative effects of the BSOA are potentially large, yet poorly quantified. We used more than 5 years of continuous aerosol measurements to estimate the direct radiative feedback associated with the formation of biogenic secondary organic aerosol at a remote continental site at the edge of the boreal forest zone in Northern Finland. Our upper-limit estimate for this feedback during the summer period (ambient temperatures above 10 °C) was −97±66 mW m−2 K−1 (mean ± STD) when using measurements of the aerosol optical depth (fAOD) and −63±40 mW m−2 K−1 when using measurements of the “dry” aerosol scattering coefficient at the ground level (fσ). Here STD represents the variability in f caused by the observed variability in the quantities used to derive the value of f. Compared with our measurement site, the magnitude of this direct radiative feedback is expected to be larger in warmer continental regions with more abundant biogenic emissions, and even larger in regions where biogenic emissions are mixed with anthropogenic pollution.",

            "abstract": "A dynamical downscaling method for probabilistic regional scale climate change projections was developed to cover an uncertainty of multiple general circulation model (GCM) climate simulations. The climatological increments (future minus present climate states) estimated by GCM simulation results were statistically analyzed using the singular vector decomposition. Both positive and negative perturbations from the ensemble mean with the magnitudes of their standard deviations were extracted and were added to the ensemble mean of the climatological increments. The analyzed multiple modal increments were utilized to create multiple modal lateral boundary conditions for the future climate regional climate model (RCM) simulations by adding to an objective analysis data. This data handling is regarded to be an advanced method of the pseudo-global-warming (PGW) method previously developed by Kimura and Kitoh (2007). The incremental handling for GCM simulations realized approximated probabilistic climate change projections with the smaller number of RCM simulations. Three values of a climatological variable simulated by RCMs for a mode were used to estimate the response to the perturbation of the mode. For the probabilistic analysis, climatological variables of RCMs were assumed to show linear response to the multiple modal perturbations, although the non-linearity was seen for local scale rainfall. Probability of temperature was able to be estimated within two modes perturbation simulations, where the number of RCM simulations for the future climate is five. On the other hand, local scale rainfalls needed four modes simulations, where the number of the RCM simulations is nine. The probabilistic method is expected to be used for regional scale climate change impact assessment in the future.",

            "abstract": "In wide-angle seismic surveys with ocean bottom seismograph (OBS) and airgun, surface-related multiple reflections and upgoing P-to-S conversions are frequently observed. We applied two interferometric imaging methods to the multicomponent OBS data in order to highly utilize seismic signals for subsurface imaging.\nFirst, seismic interferometry (SI) is applied to vertical component in order to obtain reflection profile with multiple reflections. By correlating seismic traces on common receiver records, pseudo seismic data are generated with virtual sources and receivers located on all original shot positions. We adopt the deconvolution SI because source and receiver spectra can be canceled by spectral division. Consequently, gapless reflection images from just below the seafloor to the deeper are obtained.\nSecond, receiver function (RF) imaging is applied to multicomponent OBS data in order to image P-to-S conversion boundary. Though RF is commonly applied to teleseismic data, our purpose is to extract upgoing PS converted waves from wide-angle OBS data. The RF traces are synthesized by deconvolution of radial and vertical components at same OBS location for each shot. Final section obtained by stacking RF traces shows the PS conversion boundaries beneath OBSs. Then, Vp/Vs ratio can be estimated by comparing one-way traveltime delay with two-way traveltime of P wave reflections.\nWe applied these methods to field data sets; (a) 175 km survey in Nankai trough subduction zone using 71 OBSs with from 1 km to 10 km intervals and 878 shots with 200 m interval, and (b) 237 km survey in northwest pacific ocean with almost flat layers before subduction using 25 OBSs with 6km interval and 1188 shots with 200 m interval. In our study, SI imaging with multiple reflections is highly applicable to OBS data even in a complex geological setting, and PS conversion boundary is well imaged by RF imaging and Vp/Vs ratio distribution in sediment is estimated in case of simple structure.",

            "abstract": "The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is responding rapidly to climate change. Marine terminating outlet glaciers that drain the GrIS have responded especially sensitively to present-day climate change by accelerating, thinning and retreating. In southeastern Greenland several outlet glaciers are undergoing rapid changes in mass balance and ice dynamics. To improve our understanding of the future, long-term response of these marine-terminating outlet glaciers to climate change, we focus on the response of three outlet glaciers to climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum.\nThe timing and rates of late-glacial and early Holocene deglaciation of the southeastern sector of the GrIS are relatively unconstrained due to the inaccessibility of the region. Using a helicopter and a sailboat, we collected samples for 10Be surface exposure dating from three fjords in southeastern Greenland: Skjoldungen (63.4N), Uvtorsiutit (62.7N), and Lindenow (60.6N). These fjords drain marine terminating glaciers of the GrIS. Here we present 18 new 10Be ages from ~50 km long transects along these fjords that mark the timing of deglaciation from the outer coast inland to the present-day GrIS margin.\nTogether with previously constrained deglaciation chronologies from Bernstorffs, Sermilik, and Kangerdlussuaq fjords in southeastern Greenland, these new chronologies offer insight into the late-glacial and early Holocene dynamics of the southeastern GrIS outlet glaciers. We compare the timing and rate of deglaciation in southeastern Greenland to climate records from the region to examine the mechanisms that drove deglaciation during late-glacial and early Holocene time. These new 10Be ages provide a longer-term perspective of marine terminating outlet glacier fluctuations in southeastern Greenland and can be used to model the ice sheet’s response to late-glacial and early Holocene climate changes.",

Understanding the effect of land-use conversion on soil microbial communities and its influencing factor is important for greenhouse gas emission reduction and soil organic carbon and nitrogen sequestration and stability. The influence of land use conversion on soil process was undergoing a dynamic change, but little research has been done to understand the effect on soil microbial communities during the initial years after land conversion. In the study, the influences of land-use conversion from double rice cropping (RR) to maize-maize (MM) and soybean-peanut (SP) double cropping systems on soil physical and chemical properties, and microbial community structure was studied after two years of the conversion in southern China. The results showed that land use conversion significantly changed soil properties, microbial communities and biomass. Soil pH significantly decreased by 0.50 and 0.52 after conversion to MM and SP, respectively. Soil TN and NH4-N also significantly decreased by 9%-15% and 60% after conversion to upland fields, respectively. The total PLFAs, bacterial, gram-positive bacterial (G+), gram-negative bacterial (G-) and actinomycetic PLFAs decreased significantly. The ng g-1 soil concentration of monounsaturated chain PLFAs 16:1ω7c and 18:1ω9t were significantly higher at paddy fields than at upland fields. No significant differences in soil properties, microbial communities and biomass were found between conversed MM and SP. Our results indicated that land use conversion, not crop type conversed had a significant effects on soil properties and microbial communities at the initial of land conversion. And soil pH was the key factor regulating the variations in soil microbial community structure after land use conversion from paddy to upland fields.",

            "abstract": "Methane is the second most powerful greenhouse gas with a highly positive radiative forcing of 0.48 W/m2 (IPCC 2013). Global concentrations of methane have been steadily increasing since 2007 (Bruhwiler 2014), raising concerns about methane’s impact on the future global climate. For about the last decade, the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) on the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura spacecraft has been detecting several trace gas species in the troposphere including methane. The goal of this study is to compare TES methane retrievals to that of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the EOS Aqua spacecraft so that scientific investigations may be transferred from TES to AIRS. The two instruments fly in the afternoon constellation (A-Train), providing numerous coincident measurements for comparison. In addition, they also have a similar spectral range, (3.3 to 15.4 µm) for TES (Beer, 2006) and (3.7 to 15.4 µm) for AIRS (Chahine, 2006), making both instruments sensitive to the mid and upper troposphere. This makes them ideal candidates to compare methane data products. However, because AIRS spectral resolution is lower than that of the TES, there may be a difference in vertical sensitivity. In addition, the retrieval techniques and error characteristics are different for the two data sets. The current state of validation for these data products will be presented. To identify conditions in which the data sets agree and dis agree, we present global maps of methane concentrations from monthly level 3 (L3) data products. We also investigate the temporal stability between the two datasets by comparing global zonal averages derived from L3 over the last decade. Finally, we compare L2 retrieval profiles from representative granules in the tropical, mid-latitude and northern latitudes.",

            "abstract": "The magnetometer onboard the Rosetta spacecraft (RPC-MAG) has been measuring the evolution of the plasma interaction region at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko since its arrival in August 2014. After a weak phase with low gas-production rates, the activity increased and has resulted in the build up of the magnetic field strength. At the end of July 2015, the average magnetic field strength was ~40 nT with turbulence in the order of up to ~40nT. In this regime, RPC-MAG has detected short intervals (2-25 minutes) where the magnetic field strength drops below 5nT and all wave activity ceases. These signatures are interpreted as the presence of a diamagnetic cavity. This type of field-free region has only been observed once before at comet 1P/Halley during a fast flyby, but the Rosetta mission now affords the opportunity to study several such intervals where the cavity region is expanding due to higher gas production rates and thus measurable by RPC-MAG at a radial distance of 200 km from the comet. The observations are well supported by theoretical predictions and numerical simulations.",

In our experiments we use numerical weather model data from the Global Forecast System. In the Observation System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) we extract ZTDs and horizontal delay gradients from the operational analysis, add noise to mimic observation errors, and assimilate these simulated observations into the 24h forecast valid at the same time. The impact is measured in terms of the refractivity profiles surrounding the considered station. In the Observation System Experiment (OSE) the simulated observations are replaced by real observations.

In support of these issue, efforts in investigating the nighttime chemical mechanisms has been made during MAPS 2015 (Megacity Air Pollution Study 2015) at Seoul in Korea from May 18th to June 12th of 2015.\nBy deploying NOAA’s state-of-the-art instrument, ARNOLD (Airborne Ring-down Nitrogen Oxide Laser Detector), high time resolution in-situ measurement of nitrate (NO3), dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) as well as other related trace gases species (e.g. NO, NO2, NOy, and O3) were made on the Seoul N Tower (inlet height: 362m ASL). The in-situ measurements of NO3 radical will provide good observational constraints on night time oxidation processes. The NO3 and N2O5 equilibrium and reactivity will be analyzed by comparison of their lifetimes to those calculated from VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) measurements and kinetic calculations. Implications for nitrogen oxides species will be discussed.",

In this study, we investigate the climatology of global dust associated with dust and polluted dust aerosol types represented by 6-year CALIPSO data. The significant meridional and vertical distributions of dust are observed over most areas during boreal spring and summer. Furthermore, considering changes of dust optical and microphysical properties during long-range transport, layer-mean particulate depolarization ratio of dust, polluted dust and other aerosols are analyzed. Then we define the threshold of layer depolarization ratio of dust aerosol and non-dust aerosols over different regions. Based on these threshold and assumption of dust mass extinction efficiency, observation-based global dust mass flux over all-sky condition is firstly estimated, except for dust below low-level cloud. Finally, the uncertainties of dust mass flux are analyzed in the different conditions.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol has played an important role in air quality for short term and climate change for long term. Especially, it is important to understand how aerosol optical depth (AOD) has changed to date for the prognosis of future atmospheric state and radiation budget which are related to human life. In this study, the trend of AOD at 550 nm from MODIS Aqua (MYD08) was estimated for 10 years from 2004 to 2014 using linear regression method and ensemble empirical mode decomposition method (EEMD). Search region was selected to East Asia [18.5°N-51.5°N, 85.5°E-150.5°E] which is considered to be of great interest in emission source. The result of linear regression shows remarkably increasing trend in North and East China including Sanjiang, Hailun, Beijing, Beijing forest and Jinozhou Bay, than rather downward trend in other neighboring regions. Actually, however, AOD has seasonality itself and its trend is also affected by external source consistently, so non-linear trend analysis was conducted to analyze the changing tendency of AOD trends. Consequently, secular trends of AOD defined by EEMD showed almost similar values over the entire region, but their shapes over time are quite different with those of linear regression. Here, AOD linear trend in Beijing has monotonically increased [0.03% yr-1] since 2004, but its non-linear trend shows that initial increasing trend has alleviated and even turned into downward trend from about 2010. Lastly, the validation of MODIS AOD with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) was conducted additionally which showed fairly good agreement with those of AERONET (R=0.901, RMSE=0.226, MAE=0.031, MBE=-0.001).",

            "abstract": "The natural subsurface is gaining in importance for a variety of engineering applications related to energy supply. At the same time it is already utilized in many ways. On the one hand, the subsurface with its groundwater system represents the most important source of drinking water; on the other hand, it contains natural resources such as petroleum, natural gas and coal. In recent years, the subsurface has been gaining importance as a resource of energy and as an energy and waste repository. It can serve as a short-, medium- or long-term storage medium for energy in various forms, e.g. in the form of methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2) or compressed air. The subsurface is also attracting increasing interest as a natural source of energy, regarding, for instance, the extraction of fossil methane by hydraulic fracturing or the utilization of geothermal energy as a renewable energy source. As a result, with increasing exploitation, resource conflicts are becoming more and more common and complex. Modeling concepts for simulating multiphase flow that can reproduce the high complexity of the underlying processes in an efficient way need to be developed. The application of these model concepts is of great importance with respect to feasibility, risk analysis, storage capacity and sensitivity issues. This talk will give an overview on possible utilization conflicts in subsurface systems and how the groundwater is affected. It will focus on presenting fundamental properties and functions of a compositional multiphase system in a porous medium and introduce basic multiscale and multiphysics concepts as well as formulate conser­vation laws for simulating energy storage in the subsurface. Large-scale simulations that show the general applicability of the modeling concepts of such complicated natural systems, especially the impact on the groundwater of simultaneously using geothermal energy and storing chemical and thermal energy, and how such real large-scale systems provide a good environment for balancing the efficiency potential and possible weaknesses of the approaches will be discussed.",

The Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) sensor DFMS is a double focussing mass spectrometer with a mass range 13–140 u/e. It is optimized for high mass resolution and large dynamic range and is an invaluable tool for the characterization of neutrals in the coma (1).\nHydrogen fluoride (HF) and hydrogen chloride (HCl) are expected to be the main reservoirs of fluorine and chlorine wherever hydrogen is predominantly molecular in the interstellar medium (2). The strong depletion of these compounds in dense molecular clouds suggests freeze-out of these compounds onto grains in cold environments (3, 4). Therefore, one can expect that HCl and HF were also incorporated into comets.\nThe halogens HF, HCl and also HBr (hydrogen bromide) have been measured using ROSINA-DFMS and this contribution will focus on the presence, abundance and variability of halogens in the coma of comet 67P. These results may provide insights on the halogen chemistry in the early solar nebula.\n(1) Balsiger et al., Space Science Reviews 128, 745.\n(2) Neufeld & Wolfire, ApJ 706, 1594.\n(3) Peng et al., ApJ 723, 218.\n(4) Emprechtinger et al., ApJ 756, 136.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity is currently moving upslope on Mt. Sharp in Gale Crater toward a hematite-bearing ridge. This hematite exposure was originally detected in CRISM spectra and subsequently mapped as part of a ~200 m wide, 6.5 km long ridge extending roughly parallel to the base of Mt. Sharp. CRISM spectra in the region suggest that hematite, smectite, and hydrated sulfates occur as secondary phases in lower layers of Mt. Sharp, separated by an unconformity from overlying anhydrous strata. A potential process and mineralogical analog is a hematite-bearing and weathering-resistant stratum (ridge) is exposed on the Puu Poliahu cinder cone on Mauna Kea (MK) volcano, Hawaii. The MK ridge is the product of hydrothermal alteration of basaltic precursors under acid-sulfate conditions. We are acquiring chemical and mineralogical (VNIR, Mid-IR, and backscatter Moessbauer spectroscopy, and transmission XRD) data on the MK ridge area that correspond to rover and orbiting spacecraft measurements at Gale Crater and elsewhere. The hematite-bearing stratum does not have detectable sulfate minerals by XRD, and hematite is variably present as up to mm-sized black crystals which, together with associated trioctahedral smectite and K-feldspar (from XRD), imply hydrothermal conditions. Adjacent to the MK hematite-bearing stratum are sulfates (jarosite and alunite) that are evidence for aqueous alteration under acid-sulfate conditions, and more soluble sulfates are absent but such phases would not persist if formed because of annual precipitation. Dioctahedral smectite is associated with red hematite and alunite-rich samples. The black and red hematite zones have the highest and lowest MgO/Al2O3 and K2O/Na2O ratios, respectively. Hematite, smectite, jarosite, and K-feldspar have been detected by Curiosity XRD downslope from the Mt. Sharp hematite ridge. MK field work and samples were obtained with PISCES partnership and OMKM, MKMB, BLNR, and KKMC permissions.",

            "abstract": "Both aseismic and seismic slip accommodate relative motion across partially coupled plate boundary faults. In the northeastern Japan subduction zone, aseismic slip occurs in the form of decelerating afterslip following large earthquakes and as relatively steady slip on uncoupled areas of the subduction thrust between great ruptures. Here we report on a new quasi-periodic slow-slip behavior that is widespread in the megathrust zone inferred from offshore small repeating earthquakes and on-land GPS data. The two independent data sets show that much of the subduction zone experiences periodic slip accelerations at periods ranging from 1 to 6 years, which often coincide with or precede clusters of large (M ≥ 5) earthquakes. The examination of the spatio-temporal distribution of small repeating earthquakes with respect to the M ≥ 5 earthquakes suggests that the slow-slip pulses trigger the M ≥ 5 seismicity. We also show that the clustering of M ≥ 5 earthquakes with a ~3-year period in the off-Sanriku area has persisted since 1930 (81 years). These results suggest that inherently periodic slow-slip events along the megathrust result in periodic stress perturbations and modulate the occurrence time of larger earthquakes. The periodicity in the slow-slip rate has the potential to help refine time-dependent earthquake forecasts.",

Calculated by a sectional aerosol activation scheme based on the information of size and mass from CUACE and the thermal-dynamic and humid states from the weather model GRAPES at each time step, the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) is fed online interactively into a two-moment cloud scheme (WDM6) and a convective parameterization to drive the cloud physics and precipitation formation processes. The modeling system has been applied to study the ACI for January 2013 when several persistent haze-fog events and eight precipitation events occurred.\nThe results show that interactive aerosols with the WDM6 in GRAPES/CUACE obviously increase the total cloud water, liquid water content and cloud droplet number concentrations while decrease the mean diameter of cloud droplets with varying magnitudes of the changes in each case and region. These interactive micro-physical properties of clouds improve the calculation of their collection growth rates in some regions and hence the precipitation rate and distributions in the model, showing 24% to 48% enhancements of TS scoring for 6-h precipitation in almost all regions. The interactive aerosols with the WDM6 also reduce the regional mean bias of temperature by 3 °C during certain precipitation events, but the monthly means bias is only reduced by about 0.3°C.",

In this study we used a combination of remote sensing, field surveys and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to reconstruct the recovery of beaches at Phra Thong Island, Thailand. The study site was severely impacted by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Here we show that within a decade the beaches have completely recovered without any human intervention. We apply GPR to image periods of aggradation, progradation and washover sedimentation and match these with local events including a storm in 2007. At one location the beach has locally prograded at least 10m after partially blocking the mouth of a creek that was reamed out by the retreating tsunami. Here we also used GPR to image the scour and recovery of the coastal system (see figure). The rapid recovery of the barrier beach and local progradation indicate that sediment scoured by the tsunami was not transported far offshore but remained in the littoral zone within reach of fair-weather waves that returned to the beach naturally. In both cases coastal processes have reconstructed the beach-dune system to an almost identical pre-tsunami state in under a decade.",

Recent ground-based observations of Ceres suggested possible global spectral variability that was attributed to changing amount of water ice on the surface. These observations suggest a possibly changing amount of water ice caused by outgassing on time scales of months to decades. We combined the imaging and spectral data of Ceres collected in the past three decades from ground-based telescopes, Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Dawn FC during its approach to Ceres to search for global and local variabilities on the surface, and did not find evidence supporting changes in the albedo or spectrum of Ceres. The global albedo of Ceres remains unchanged within 3% of its geometric albedo of 0.09 over the time scale of 10 years. The spectral variability of Ceres recently reported can be mostly explained by changes in the observing geometry. By comparing the spatially resolved images from HST and Dawn FC, if water outgassing causes any variations on the albedo of its sources or changes in size of albedo markings, then such change must be smaller than 15% over 10 years. The stable surface of Ceres under water sublimation activity is consistent with the nearly unchanged albedo and spectral properties of comets, although no liquid water is expected on comets and the sublimation mechanism on comets is completely different from that on Ceres. The bright spots on Ceres thus must be built up over a long period of time. It also possible that the sublimation activity on Ceres either occurs in subsurface, or at size scales of <1 km.",

            "abstract": "Light-absorbing aerosols, such as black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC), have a significant effect on the Earth’s energy budget by reducing solar radiation reaching at the earth’s surface. However, the reliable determination of BC and BrC properties is difficult mainly due to the uncertainties and the large variability in the mass absorption cross section (MAC), which is an important factor to calculate mass concentration from aerosol light absorption coefficient measurement. In this study, MAC of BC was determined to calculate BC mass concentration from co-located Continuous Soot Monitoring System (COSMOS) and Sunset EC-OC analyzer at Gosan, Korea. The optical properties and mass concentration of BC derived from COSMOS were compared with those from Continuous Light Absorption Photometer (CLAP) to estimate the contribution of volatile aerosols in light absorption. Aerosol optical properties such as absorption and scattering coefficient showed distinct seasonal variations. Aerosol absorption coefficient and BC mass concentration derived from COSMOS were approximately 40 % lower than those from CLAP. This difference can be attributable to the removal of volatile aerosols (i.e., BrC) coexisting with BC. BC and BrC mass concentrations simulated by GEOS-Chem model were also presented. On the other hand, BC mass concentration measured at four regional background sites, Gosan, Korea and Fukue, Fukui and Hedo in Japan, by an identical COSMOS from January 2012 to March 2014 were analyzed. BC mass concentration at Gosan (0.29±0.29 μg m-3) was the highest among the other sites but there was no significant difference statistically.",

            "abstract": "Typhoon (TC) Talas (2011), which caused Japan catastrophic disaster, landed the western part of Japan. The TC suddenly turned northwestward, and then landed on Japan. A reason for the occurrence of the disaster is that Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) failed to predict the TC’s sudden left turn, JMA predicted that the TC would not turn northwestward but would move northeastward. The actual course was opposite to the JMA numerical weather prediction. The timing when the TC started to turn northwestward was the same as another TC, Nanmadol, crossed Taiwan Island. Here we find that whether TC Nanmadol landed Taiwan Island or not determines whether the TC Talas turned left or not. If Nanmadol had not landed on Taiwan, Talas would not have landed on Japan. A small island controls the course of a remote TC. Therefore, the presence of the Island of Taiwan is important for the determination of the course of a typhoon.\nThe utilization of two-way Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulation with moving nesting, which allows the influence of a TC upon surrounding environmental large-scale atmospheric flow in comparison with one-way moving nesting shows that Talas remotely strengthened the subtropical high located to the east of Talas. This strengthened subtropical high somewhat blocked the eastward movement of Talas. In addition, Nanmadol remotely strengthened the high pressure system that was between Talas and Nanmadol. This strengthened high blocked westward movement of the Talas. The WRF showed that the deeper the typhoon developed, the stronger the high pressure system. When Nanmadol landed Taiwan, this remote strengthening of the high suddenly weakened because of decay of landed Nanmadol. The weakened high no longer blocked the westward movement of Talas. Therefore, Talas started to turn westward when Nanmadol landed on Taiwan. In some WRF members without landed on Taiwan, neither Nanmadol nor the high between Talas and Nanmadol did weakened. Also, Talas did not turn west. In consequence, the decay of a typhoon due to the landing on an island makes another typhoon turn. This might be a mechanism of the chain-reaction of the two typhoons, which frequently appears simultaneously over the Western Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) plays a central role in the troposphere as a toxic substance for the respiratory system and a precursor for ozone and aerosols. Furthermore, the OH concentration is dependent on the NO2 concentration. While trend analysis for tropospheric NO2 concentrations in several specific regions all over the world was made in literature for period until 2011, the latest trends after 2011 have not been reported yet. The time period after 2011 is of interest, because it corresponds to the 12th 5-year-plan regulating NOx emissions in China and the period with the power substitution of thermal power generation for the nuclear power generation in Japan. In this study, we first compared satellite-observed tropospheric NO2 VCDs (Vertical Column Densities) with those observed by ground-based Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instruments installed at Chiba University in order to clarify whether or not there is degradation in OMI and GOME-2 NO2 VCDs data after 2011. We concluded that there is no significant degradation in OMI and GOME-2 data, since the comparison results are similar to those reported by previous validation studies. Based on the results, tropospheric NO2 VCD trends over Central Eastern China (CEC; 30-40°N, 110.0-123.0°E) and Japan (JPN; 33.5-37.0°N, 133.0-141.0°E) regions were estimated using the regression analysis for annual mean values. Although an increase in NO2 VCDs occurred at a rate of 6%(8%) per year in OMI (GOME-2) data from 2005(2007) to 2011 over CEC, we found a decrease at a rate of 10%(11%) per year from 2011 to 2014. This reduction may be a result from the regulation of NOx emissions from coal fired power generation, iron foundry, cement plant, etc., and installation of the denitrification units during the period of 12th 5-year-plan. For JPN, both OMI and GOME-2 data sets showed that the NO2 VCDs decreased at a rate of 4% per year before 2011. The decreasing trends continued until 2014, with a rate of 1-7% per year for 2011-2014. Thus, we concluded that there is no significant impact of the power substitution of thermal power generation for the nuclear power generation in the JPN region covering urban areas in Japan.",

            "abstract": "The North Anatolian Fault (NAF) get across the mainland of Turkey is known as a quite active strike slip fault. The earthquake recurrence period for individual segment is estimated roughly 300 years based on historical records. The Marmara Segment is the major seismic gap since the last earthquake in 1766, while the Murefte earthquake occurred in 1912 at its west side and the Izmit earthquake in 1999 at its east side. The relative motion across the NAF is ~22 mm/yr based on the data from space geodesy. Investigating how much degree of this displacement is released by aseismic creep or accumulated by slip deficit in the Marmara Segment is crucial to know the total seismic risk in this region. Because the NAF is submerged in the Sea of Marmara and is inaccessible by space geodesy, we employed seafloor geodetic technique using extensometers, which acoustically monitor baseline length across a strain-localized zone, such as surface trace of a fault. In 2014, we installed five extensometers at the Western High crossing the NAF one after the other, where the surface trace of the NAF is prominent and gas emission from the seafloor is reported in. Totally four beselines of ~1 km range are successfully formed and quality of initial test data was promising. Based on the initial data, detectable level of the baseline change is estimated to be ~2mm, which owing to quite stable seawater near the bottom due to strong density stratification in the Sea of Marmara. The extensometers are designed that data can be recovered via acoustic modem without disrupt the monitoring. Since the installation, we have visited the site twice and have recovered the data for ten months in total. Temperature measured by thermistor equipped on each extensometer showed coherent change and gradual increase by 0.007 degree during the period. This reflects apparent beseline shortening due to the corresponding increase of the sound speed. In the preliminary temperature correction, difference of the change in the length between NW-ward and NE-ward baselines is ~5 mm in the period. This indicates roughly 3 mm/yr of right-lateral displacement. To confirm the results, monitoring must be further continued and the temperature correction should be refined accounting for sub-resolution information (< 0.001 degree).",

            "abstract": "Seismology permits direct observation of structure within the Earth. Different seismological techniques allow features of a range of sizes to be resolved. Observations of unpredicted high frequency energy (e.g. > 1 Hz) provide evidence for the presence of small-scale heterogeneities (e.g. 1-13 km) within the Earth. Small-scale heterogeneities with anomalous elastic properties compared to the surrounding medium can scatter seismic waves thus generating unpredicted seismic arrivals that carry information about the scattering heterogeneities. Using small aperture seismic arrays and high-resolution processing methods we observe scattered P-waves that travel into the core (along a PKP path), but upon exiting the core are scattered back into the core and to the surface along a second path. The paths from the earthquake-to-scatterer and scatterer-to-array are both out of the great-circle plane. We call this PK*KP, and use it to deterministically locate heterogeneities within the lowermost 300 km of the mantle across nearly the whole globe. We find scattering heterogeneities to be distributed unevenly across the CMB both laterally and vertically with the majority of heterogeneities located close to the CMB and heterogeneities higher up into the mantle limited to a few regions. Heterogeneities concentrate within regions associated with the edges of the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces in the lower mantle (LLSVPs). Using broadband records and analysis in different frequency bands we find scattered energy to be strongest in the 2-4 Hz band indicative of strong heterogeneities of ~4-7 km in size, although the heterogeneities show a wide spectrum of scales. The size and distribution of heterogeneities agrees with predictions of the scale and dynamic behaviour of viscously entrained subducted basaltic oceanic crust in the lowermost mantle. Thus, the observed scattering heterogeneities likely reveal the influence of convective processes on crust subducted into the lowermost mantle.",

            "abstract": "A great shock occurred at an unusual depth of 678 km far away from the well-defined Wadati-Benioff zone of the Izu-Bonin arc (Fig.1). To the north of this region the slab is stagnant above the 660 km discontinuity and to the south it penetrates the discontinuity (Fig.2). Thus, the slab in this region can be viewed as in a transitional state from the stagnant to penetrating slab. Here, the steeply dipping part of the slab bends sharply to horizontal and the great shock happened at the lowest corner of this bending. The CMT indicates a pure normal faulting with the trench-normal near horizontal tensional axis and the near vertical compressional axis (Fig.1). We suggest that this mechanism reflects a transitional state of slab deformation from the bending-dominant mode to the penetration-dominant mode. The mechanism is consistent with either of these two two modes. We show that the mechanism is also consistent with the resultant stress field generated by many deep shocks occurring along the Wadati-Benioff zone. The calculated stress field changes rapidly along a trench-normal profile at a depth of 680 km and becomes similar to that generated by the great shock at points near the hypocenter (Fig.3). Thus, the stress field due to the Wadati-Benioff zone earthquakes works to enhance the occurrence of deep shocks of the type of the 2015 great shock, which represents slab deformation associated with the transition from stagnant to penetrating slab.",

            "abstract": "Magnetite-rich Cyprus type VMS deposit has been recently discovered from the Ortaklar-Gaziantep region within Koçali complex, SE Turkey. Magnetite rich sulfide ore bodies are in close contact with underlying footwall spilitic basalts. These basalts are part of Koçali mélange, which represents an accreted oceanic complex during closing of southern Neotethys. These extrusives are low-K, low alkali tholeiites with Ca rich, partially sericitized plagioclase subophitically enclosed by augite with disseminated Fe-Ti oxides and pyrite. Mineral crystallization sequence of plagioclase followed by augite and opaque is typical of MORB.\nMajor and trace element analyses for least altered basalts based on LOI (1.5~3.6 wt%), Ce/Ce* (0.9~1.1) exhibit limited range of element abundances. Low Mg# (59~60) suggests that basalts were derived from moderately evolved magma with fractional crystallization. HFSE (Th, Nb, Hf, Zr) were used for tectonic discrimination and basalts were plotted within MORB end spectrum, near MORB-IAT boundary. N-MORB normalized La to Lu ranges from 0.4 to 0.9 times N-MORB with LREE depletion [(La/Sm)N = 0.58~0.67] and flat HREE [(Tb/Lu)N = 0.95~1.05]. Chondrite normalized REE patterns resemble those of N-MORB but characterized by severe LREE depletion [(La/Sm)CN = 0.35~0.45]. LREE depletion coupled with high Sm/Nd (0.36~0.43), high CaO/Na2O (5.0~6.2) and low Nb/Yb (0.23~0.39) suggest depleted N-MORB composition derived from the refractory mantle source.\nAnalyzed basalts are similar to those found from other rift (Costa Rica Rift Hole 504b) and intra-transform fault (Siqueiros transform). Magnetite emplacement occurring close to the ore-host boundary and lack of pyrrhotite from hosting basalts imply an involvement of oxidized hydrothermal fluids. Basalts probably have formed by late stage, partial melting of the refractory mantle at low pressure, shallow depth, and H2O rich environment. Possible source of mantle heterogeneity can be identified by isotope analyses.",

            "abstract": "The solar acoustic emission is closely related to solar convection and magnetic field. Understanding the relation between the acoustic emission and the phase of a solar cycle is important to understand the dynamics of solar cycles and excitation of acoustic waves. In this work we use 4 years of SDO/HMI data from 05/2010 to 04/2014, covering the growing phase of the solar cycle 24, to study the acoustic emissions of the whole sun and of only the quiet sun regions respectively, at multiple frequency bands. We also analyze the correlations between the acoustic emissions and solar activity level indexed by daily sunspot number and magnetic flux. The results show that the correlation between the whole-sun acoustic emission and solar activity level is negative for low frequencies at 2.5-4.5 mHz, with a peak value around -0.9, and is positive for high frequencies at 4.5-6.0 mHz, with a peak value around 0.9. For high frequencies, the acoustic emission excess in sunspot halos overwhelms the emission deficiency in sunspot umbrae and penumbrae. The correlation between the quiet-sun acoustic emission and solar activity level is negative for 2.5-4.0 mHz and positive for 4.0-5.5 mHz, with peak values over ±0.8. This shows that the solar background acoustic power, with active regions excluded, is indeed varying during a solar cycle, implying the excitation frequencies or depths are highly related to the solar magnetic field.",

            "abstract": "From June 2014 through March 2015, Kīlauea Volcano’s Puʻu ʻŌʻō vent on the East Rift Zone produced a tube-fed pāhoehoe lava flow –the “June 27th flow” – that extended 20 km downslope. Within 2 months of onset, flow trajectory towards populated areas in the Puna District caused much concern. The USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) issued a news release of increased hazard on August 22 and began participating in public meetings organized by Hawai`i County Mayor and Civil Defense two days later. On September 4, HVO upgraded the volcano alert level to WARNING based on an increased potential for lava to reach homes and infrastructure. Ultimately, direct impacts were modest: lava destroyed one unoccupied home and one utility pole, crossed a rural roadway, and partially inundated a waste transfer station, a cemetery, and agricultural land. Anticipation that lava could reach Pāhoa Village and cross the only major access highway, however, caused significant disruption. HVO scientists employed numerous methods to communicate science and hazard information to officials and the at-risk public: daily (or more frequent) written updates of the lava activity, flow front locations and advance rates; frequent updates of web-hosted maps and images; use of the ‘lines of steepest descent’ method to indicate likely lava flow paths; consistent participation in well-attended community meetings; bi-weekly briefings to County, State, and Federal officials; correspondence with the public via email and recorded phone messages; participation in press conferences and congressional briefings; and weekly newspaper articles (Volcano Watch).\nCommunication lessons both learned and reinforced include: (1) direct, frequent interaction between scientists and officials and at-risk public builds critical trust and understanding; (2) images, maps, and presentations must be tailored to audience needs; (3) many people are unfamiliar with maps (oblique aerial photographs were more effective); (4) uncertainties in forecasting lava flow advance can be easily misunderstood; (5) simple, jargon-free language reaches the largest audience; (6) repetition of information and using different approaches is helpful; and (7) embedding scientists within the emergency management and communication framework helps unify critical messages.",

            "abstract": "Periodic and flash flood is one of major natural disasters happened annually in mainland South Asia, especially for countries within the basin of Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Mekong River. The flood either caused by massive rainfall or melting glacier/snow water has combined with land subsidence and results in exacerbated economic loss in adjacent regions. A monitoring system based on satellite observation is thus necessary for early warning and precautionary estimate of inundation area since it is difficult to build river gauges and collect data in remote areas. The knowledge of water level along the river is thus important for monitoring the anomalous rise of water flow that potentially causes floods downstream. The satellite altimetry, which was widely used for open ocean sea-level measurements, had been applied for monitoring inland waters, such as rivers, reservoirs, and even glaciers surface elevation change. In this study, we utilized and compared a series of altimetry satellites along the Yaluzangbu River, upstream of the Brahmaputra River, located in the southern Tibetan Plateau with its origin located at Angsi Glacier. These satellites include Envisat, Jason-2, and SARAL/AltiKa. The detectability of water level has been examined in terms of the backscattering coefficient in radar echo, radar waveform pattern, height retrieval, stability of measurement over water surface, and percentage of detectable crossovers. Our preliminary result shows that the Ka-band AltiKa is more stable over narrow (<500 m) rivers section with height uncertainty in each cycle less than 10 cm, in contrast to Jason-2 and Envisat which are limited to tens of centimeters level.",

            "abstract": "The Hawaii-Emperor and Louisville hotspot tracks have long dominated the data set constraining absolute plate motion models. However, prior to ~80 Ma, multiple shorter, discontinuous hotspot trails and oceanic plateaus have been used to constrain absolute plate motion. Based on this earlier work, a clear Hawaii-Emperor style bend seems apparent around 100 Ma in the West Pacific Seamount Province (WPSP). More importantly, the ongoing debate on a plate versus plume motion origin for the Hawaii-Emperor Bend is applicable here, as the ~100 Ma bend may correspond to a global plate reorganization (Matthews et al., EPSL, 2012). Data for a comparison of bends comes from three groups with similar geographic patterns: 1) Mid-Pacific Mountains, Line Islands; 2) Shatsky Rise, Hess Rise, Musician and Wentworth Seamounts; and 3) Wake Seamounts, Marshall Islands, Magellan Seamounts. Both groups 1 and 2 feature a large igneous province (LIP) at their oldest end: Shatsky Rise and the Mid-Pacific Mountains. According to plate reconstructions these LIPs were constructed near all-ridge triple junctions, thus potential plume-ridge interactions need to be clarified before these LIPs can be used to define an absolute mantle reference frame. In contrast, the volcanoes of the third group (Wake, Marshall, Magellan) did erupt truly intra-plate and we therefore argue that this group provides a constraint on plate motion beyond 80 Ma that is independent of plume-ridge interactions. Since the volcanoes in this group are part of the WPSP, which is densely populated with seamounts, a combination of 40Ar/39Ar ages and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopes is needed to distinguish different hotspot tracks in this region. Backtracking each volcano through its age to its original eruptive location and using compositional color-coding, reveals groupings and patterns that vary by plate motion model, while the temporal patterns of backtracked locations inform us about potential plume motions.",

            "abstract": "Boreal forests has important role for the mitigation of adverse effects of climate change. They form 1/5 of terrestrial carbon sink and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) production through biogenic volatile organic carbon emissions further increase the cooling effect of this biome. The balance between these and the warming effect through surface albedo effects is still unclear. Moreover, boreal forests provide up to 17% of the global industrial roundwood harvest thus substituting other carbon intense materials. Here we modeled this integrated effect of boreal forest management on Earth radiative forcing (RF) using Finland as a case. We made analyses both in current climate and in the projected climate of year 2050.\nAt the stand level, the carbon sequestration effect and avoided CO2 emissions due to substituted materials dominated in net RF in current climate. The warming effect of low surface albedo of forest cover was lower or of same magnitude than cooling effect of SOAs. The cooling effect of net radiative forcing increased along the increasing site fertility. Although the carbon stocks of broadleaved trees were smaller than that of conifers their total radiative cooling effect was larger due to the integrated albedo and aerosol effects. In the projected climate of 2050, the radiative cooling of aerosols increased to the level equaling forest carbon fixation.\nLandscape level analyses emphasized the broad range of options to reach the cooling effect. The lowest harvest regime, 50% of current annual increment (CAI), yielded the largest cooling effect. Yet, harvests up to CAI produced only slightly less cooling RF if avoided emissions were considered. This result was highly sensitive to used substitution factors. If the goal is to mitigate climate change, boreal forest management should favor mixed forest stands and intensive harvests are preferable only if coupled with long lasting end products.",

            "abstract": "Increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide are expected to affect carbon assimilation, evapotranspiration (ET) and ultimately plant growth. Direct leaf biochemical effects have been widely investigated, while indirect effects, although documented, are very difficult to quantify in experiments. We hypothesize that the interaction of direct and indirect effects is a possible reason for conflicting results concerning the magnitude of CO2 fertilization effects across different climates and ecosystems. A mechanistic ecohydrological model (Tethys-Chloris) is used to investigate the relative contribution of direct (through plant physiology) and indirect (via stomatal closure and thus soil moisture, and changes in Leaf Area Index, LAI) effects of elevated CO2 across a number of ecosystems. We specifically ask in which ecosystems and climate indirect effects are expected to be largest. Data and boundary conditions from flux-towers and free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments are used to force the model and evaluate its performance. Numerical results suggest that indirect effects of elevated CO2, through water savings and increased LAI, are very significant and sometimes larger than direct effects. Indirect effects tend to be considerably larger in water-limited ecosystems, while direct effects correlate positively with mean air temperature. Increasing CO2 from 375 to 550 ppm causes a total effect on Net Primary Production in the order of 15 to 40% and on ET from 0 to -8%, depending on climate and ecosystem type. The total CO2 effect has a significant negative correlation with the wetness index and positive correlation with vapor pressure deficit. These results provide a more general mechanistic understanding of relatively short-term (less than 20 years) implications of elevated CO2 on ecosystem response and suggest plausible magnitudes for the expected changes.",

            "abstract": "Under a severe storm condition over a complex terrain, enhanced flow due to such a terrain leads to heavy damage on a local field. To understand the variety of flow caused by a complexity of surface geometry, reproduction of the flow using a numerical model is useful, but the simulated flow would vary depending on resolutions of the model. In this study, to clarify a sensitivity of storm over a complex terrain to model resolution, we compared results simulated using a different horizontal resolution over the northern part of Japan. The winds are caused by Typhoon SONGDA in 2004. Numerical experiments to represent airflows over complex terrain were conducted with the use of the WRF model with its nesting capability employed at 9-km, 3-km, 1-km, and 200-m resolutions.\nComparing terrains represented by the model with 1-km resolution and by that with 200-m resolution, the higher altitude area can be seen in the high resolution model and the lower altitude area also are more clearly distinguished. The maximum and minimum angle of slope is 9.5° and 0.4° for the low resolution and 31.6° and 0.04° for the high resolution, respectively. Wind velocity at 10 m height from the surface over an analyzed area at each calculated time highly concentrates at a certain velocity in the lower resolution model. And on the other hand, the velocity widely distributed from a low velocity to a high velocity across the velocity which is most recorded in the lower resolution model. It is because the high resolution model can express the change of wind due to the complex terrain. Mean velocity and the maximum velocity over the period of the typhoon approach become strong in the high resolution model. Relationship between the velocities and slope angle indicates the velocities increase over a steeper terrain regardless of the model resolution. However, the mean velocity shows highly variable for the high resolution. And, the maximum wind during the period shows weak for the high resolution model within a range of slope angle which is represented in both models.",

Increasing frequency and severity of fires, either through management actions or wildfires, is expected with changing climates in the Western United States. When burning is used as a management tool, it may be beneficial and control the growth of nuisance vegetation, promote the regeneration of grasses and forage species, and reduce hazardous fuel loads to minimize the risk of future wildfires. However, high intensity wildfires often have a negative effect, resulting in a loss of carbon storage and a shift of vegetation communities. This delays recovery of the ecosystem for years or decades and alters the historic fire regime.\nA 2000 acre prescribed burn in the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory provided the opportunity to quantify pre and post-burn soil carbon stores and soil carbon losses by heterotrophic respiration. Pre and post-burn soil samples were collected for physical and biogeochemical characterization to quantify substrate availability and possible limitations for heterotrophic respiration. CO2 fluxes were continuously monitored in situ before and immediately after the fire to understand the short-term response of soil respiration to varying burn severities.",

Drilling at IODP Expedition 350 Site U1437 in the Izu Bonin rear arc obtained volcaniclastic material that was deposited from at least 13.5 Ma to present. IODP Expedition 350 represents the first drilling mission in the Izu Bonin rear arc region.\nThis study presents fresh glass and mineral compositions (obtained via EMP and LA-ICP-MS) from unaltered tephra layers in mud/mudstone (Lithostratigraphic Unit I) and lapillistone (Lithostratigraphic Unit II) <4.5 Ma to examine the geochemical signature of Izu Bonin rear arc magmas. Unit II samples are coarse-grained tephras that are mainly rhyolitic in composition (72.1-77.5 wt. % SiO2, 3.2-3.9 wt. % K2O and average Mg# 24) and LREE-enriched. These rear-arc rhyolites have an average La/Sm of 2.6 with flat HREEs, average Th/La of 0.15, and Zr/Y of 4.86. Rear-arc rhyolite trace element signature is distinct from felsic eruptive products from the Izu Bonin main volcanic front, which have lower La/Sm and Th/La as well as significantly lower incompatible element concentrations. Rear arc rhyolites have similar trace element ratios to rhyolites from the adjacent but younger backarc knolls and actively-extending rift regions, but the latter is typified by lower K2O, as well as a smaller degree of enrichment in incompatible elements. Given these unique characteristics, we explore models for felsic magma formation and intracrustal differentiation in the Izu Bonin rear arc.",

Many studies assumed the interplate coupling ratios using the onshore geodetic data only. However, the offshore region that has a potential to derive a devastating tsunami cannot be resolved enough due to the observation network that is biased to land area.\nThe Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of Japan (JHOD) have constructed the seafloor geodetic observation network on the seafloor surface using a GPS-acoustic combination technique (GPS-A) [e.g., Sato et al., 2011, Science] and observed seafloor crustal movements directly above the Nankai and Sagami Troughs subduction zones. We have set 17 sites off the western Japan to lead an undersea interplate coupling distribution.\nThe observations around the Sagami Trough are consistent with the block motions presented by Nishimura [2011, Tectonophysics]. On the other hand, our seafloor geodetic observation network along the Nankai Trough revealed heterogeneity and complexity interplate coupling off the western Japan. The fast displacement rates observed in the eastern area indicate a strong interplate coupling around not only the future Tokai earthquake source region but also the Paleo-Zenisu ridge. Our observations in the westernmost area also suggest that the area off the Cape Ashizuri has a high-coupling ratio. The slow displacement rate observed in the shallower area than the 1946 Nankaido earthquake source region off the Cape Muroto-zaki reflects a weakening interplate coupling probably due to a subducting seamount.\nThe observation in the westernmost area differs depending on the depth. The north deep area below Bungo-channel has a high-coupling ratio. The south shallow area has a low-coupling ratio. In these deep and shallow areas, VLFEs, long-term slow slip events, and tremors are activated broadly [e.g., Hirose et al., 2010, Science; Yamashita et al., 2015, Science]. A difference of interplate coupling observed by GPS-A might be related with the activation of these slow events spatially.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale models are increasingly being used to estimate wind conditions to identify perspective areas and sites where to develop wind farm projects. Mesoscale models are useful because they give information over extensive areas with various terrain complexities where measurements are scarce and measurement campaigns costly. Various mesoscale models and families of mesoscale models are being used, with thousands of setup options. Since long-term integrations are expensive and tedious to carry out, only limited comparisons exist. We have carried out a blind benchmarking study to evaluate the capabilities of mesoscale models used in wind energy to estimate site wind conditions: to highlight common issues on mesoscale modeling of wind conditions on sites with different characteristics, and to identify gaps and strengths of models and understand the root conditions for further evaluating uncertainties. Three experimental sites with tall mast measurements were selected: FINO3 (offshore), Høvsøre (coastal), and Cabauw (land-based). The participants were asked to provide hourly time series of wind speed and direction, temperature, etc., at various heights for 2011. The methods used were left to the choice of the participants, but they were asked for a detailed description of their model and many other parameters (e.g., horizontal and vertical resolution, model parameterizations, surface roughness length) that could be used to group the models and interpret the results of the intercomparison. The analysis of the time series includes comparison to observations, summarized with well-known measures such as biases, RMSE, correlations, and of sector-wise statistics, and the temporal spectra. The statistics were grouped by the models, their spatial resolution, forcing data, various integration methods, etc. The results show high fidelity of the various entries in simulating the wind climate at the offshore and coastal site. Over land and the statistics of other derived fields (e.g. wind shear distributions) show much less similarities among the models and with the observations. Cloud computing now allows the use of mesoscale models by non-experts for site assessment. This tool is very useful and powerful, but users must be aware of the different issues that might be encountered in working with different setups.",

Nigde massif is a crystalline dome close to Inner-Tauride suture at the southern part of Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex. The sinistral CAFZ (in the south it is called Ecemis fault) is a ~700 km long, 2 to 80 km wide zone with an offset of 60 to 80 km. Northwest-southeast aligned Tuz Gölü (Salt Lake) and Derinkuyu faults are other major features that shape up the study area. A three-dimensional numerical modeling routine based on data-space modeling (WSINV3DMT) was used to invert the MT data collected at 85 high quality soundings. A mesh with 76 x 74 x 40 (7 layers for air) cells was used during the inversions. The resulting models suggest that (i) there is a low conductivity dome-like anomaly that coincides with the Nigde massif (presumably matches with Uckapili granite). (ii) Beneath this low conductivity anomaly there is a deeper (>20 km) high conductivity zone caused by partial melting (iii) Ecemis fault near Pozanti appears as a low to high conductivity interface. (iv) Likewise, Tuz Gölü and Derinkuyu faults appear as a low to high conductivity interfaces representing barriers for fluid flow (v) Adana basin sediments show high conductivity values (vi) Mt. Hasan and Mt. Karaca and the volcanic complexes in between them show highly conductive features in their roots, but (vi) older Mt. Erciyes lacks such a deep conductor.",

Despite very low convergent rate observed across his belt, it is active as attested by the Wenchuan earthquake Mw 7.9 (2008) that rupture and out of sequence thrust in this belt. The formation of this mountain bet results from two orogenic phase, one at the end of Trias (due to the closure of the Paleotethys), and one during Cenozoic time following the Indian Asia collision. This study aims to identify the deformation and metamorphism related to Mesozoic event and those relate to Cenozoic evolution. Structural, microstructural, metamorphic observations, PT estimates (graphitization of carbonaceous material, quantified X-ray images, chlorite-phengite-quartz-water multi-equilibrium and thermodynamic modelling) and U-Pb geochronology are used to describe the tectono-metamorphic evolution of the Xuelongbao area in the internal part of the Longmen Shan belt (eastern border of the Tibetan plateau, Sichuan, China). The Xuelongbao granite is dated at 765±7 Ma (in situ U/Pb dating on zircon), indicating that it forms part of the western Neoproterozoic South China block basement. The deformation in the western sedimentary cover above the Xuelongbao massif is intense, with step cleavage, twisted fold axes and CS structures with top to the SE thrusting vergence. Four stages of deformation are described, three of them are related to the Mesozoic wedge thickening, and the last one is due to the Cenozoic deformation. An inverted metamorphic gradient from 470°C, 8 kbar to 620°C, 13 kbar is identified in the cover above the Xuelongbao basement, suggesting a stack of sedimentary slices during the propagation of the Mesozoic accretionary wedge on the South China block margin. This decollement zone has been exhumed during the Cenozoic D4 exhumation of the Xuelongbao basement along the Wenchuan thrust, where greenschist overprint is observed.",

In 2013, the first methane hydrate offshore production test was conducted in Japan, and it was recognized in the production of about 20000m3/day of methane gas from methane hydrate bearing sand sediment in deep marine sediment. In methane hydrate development, depressurization method has been proposed for gas extraction. This method is a method to reduce the bottom hole pressure by submersible pump lowering water level in the production well, and gas and water is recovered by methane hydrate dissociation at the in situ. At that time, a phenomenon that sand flows into the wells is feared. In actually, sand production phenomenon occurred after 6 days from production start in offshore production test. A mechanism of sand production has not yet been resolved in case of methane hydrate development. Therefore, we developed large scale laboratory test apparatus for the purpose of elucidation of the mechanism of sand production phenomenon. In this presentation, we introduce basic performance of this apparatus, and usefulness is made mention by representative test results.",

Sharp gradients in chemical tracer mixing ratios were observed at the boundary of the anticyclone. In particular, sulfur dioxide and aerosols were enhanced inside the anticyclone. Ozone and carbon monoxide were enhanced or reduced in the anticyclone depending on the degree of in-mixing of air from the stratosphere inferred from observations of the stratospheric tracer hydrochloric acid. Backward trajectory analysis, tracer dispersion calculations, and simulations with the chemistry-climate model EMAC, nudged to the meteorological conditions of the measurements, were used to investigate the origin and transport of trace gases in and in the vicinity of the anticyclone.

            "abstract": "Subducting hydrous oceanic plates carry water by hydrous minerals into the Earth and contribute to melt generation. Aqueous fluids that are dehydrated from a subducting oceanic plate play an important role in magma generation. To understand water circulation, magmatism, huge numbers of geophysical studies have been conducted in subduction zones. The Japanese Islands are located at subduction zones where the Philippine Sea (PHS) plate and the Pacific plate, and have a high density of seismic stations. Many seismic tomography studies using land seismic station data were conducted to reveal the seismic structure such as subducting slabs and the existence of a low-velocity zone in the mantle beneath the Japanese Islands. These studies discussed the relationship between heterogeneous structures and the release of fluids from the subducting slab, magma generation and movement in the subduction zone. However, regional tomography using the land station data did not have a sufficient resolution to image such a deep seismic structure because the deeper part of the subducting slab is located beneath the Japan Sea. This information regarding the deep mantle wedge structure is important to understand the transportation and circulation of water and melt generation in subduction zones. To obtain the deep structure with high spatial resolution, observations of natural earthquakes such as deep earthquakes and teleseismic events within the Japan Sea are essential. Therefore, we started the repeating long-term seismic observations using ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) in the southern part of the Japan Sea. In 2013, we started the observation consisted of 3 broadband OBSs and 3 LT-OBSs. In 2014, all OBSs were recovered and the data from one of broadband OBS were not retrieved due to recorder trouble. And we also started second observation period. In August 2015, we will finish second observation period. In this presentation, we will present a three-dimensional P and S wave tomography model across the margin in the southern part of the Japan Sea using arrival-time data obtained by the long-term ocean bottom seismometer observations and the land seismic stations.\nThis study was supported by “Integrated Research Project on Seismic and Tsunami Hazards Around the Sea of Japan” conducted by the MEXT of Japan.",

We have implemented the comprehensive analysis of these simulations and discuss the diversity of convection characteristics. Less difference is found in the essential change of the simulated convection characteristics around 2 km grid spacing in between Land and Ocean. However, that change is more remarkable over the mid-latitude than tropics. We also categorized the convection based on the cloud disturbance; Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), tropical cyclones, mid-latitudinal low depressions, and fronts. The convection in MJO has strong upward motion and larger core than other convections. It leads to less change of convection characteristics in MJO around 2 km grid spacing. This would be attributed with the strong thermodynamic background condition; large convective available potential energy and weak convergence. Convection with strong low-level convergence largely contributes the global mean convection features.",

            "abstract": "Reanalysis precipitation is routinely used as a surrogate of observations due to its high spatial and temporal resolution and global coverage, and thus widely used in hydrologic and agricultural applications. The resultant product and analysis are largely dependent on the accuracy of reanalysis precipitation dataset. In this study, we aim to address the uncertainties in reanalysis rainfall products and associated impact on drought monitoring and drought risk estimation. We evaluated five reanalysis precipitation datasets (CFSR, NCEP/NCAR R1 and R2, 20CR and MERRA) against reference precipitation from a satellite-gauge-based dataset (Princeton Global Forcings, PGF) on their depiction of soil moisture drought during 1979 to 2012 estimated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity model. Results show that reanalysis precipitation products reasonably reproduce major drought episodes in sub-Saharan Africa. However, some discrepancies are found in the representation of the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought events. Drought events tend to be more spatially scattered in CFSR and temporally less persistent in MERRA. By evaluating the depiction of meteorological drought based on Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), discrepancies are attributed to an overestimation in seasonal rainfall variability in the reanalysis products. The false overestimation further increases after ~1999 due to changes in the input (assimilation) observations. The analysis examined the impact of uncertainties in reanalysis precipitation on drought monitoring, suggesting the need for improved bias correction schemes for errors in both the mean (systematic) and variability from the reanalysis products, as well as concerns with the temporal evolution of observation systems used in data assimilation systems.",

            "abstract": "At the end of March 2015 the onboard configuration of the AGILE satellite was modified in order to disable the veto signal of the anticoincidence shield for the minicalorimeter instrument. The motivation for such a change was the understanding that the dead time induced by the anticoincidence prevented the detection of a large fraction of Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs), especially the short duration ones. We present here the characteristics of the new TGF sample after several months of stable operations with the new configuration. The configuration change was highly successful resulting in the detection of about 100 TGFs/month, an increase of a factor about 11 in TGFs detection rate with respect to previous configuration. As expected, the largest fraction of the new events has short duration, with a median duration of 80 microseconds. We also obtain a sample of events with simultaneous association, within 100 microseconds, with lightning sferics detected by the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN), confirming previous results reported by the Fermi mission. Given the high detection rate and the AGILE very low (+/-2.5°) orbital inclination, the new configuration provides the largest TGF detection rate surface density (TGFs / km2 / year) to date, opening space for correlation studies with lightning and atmospheric parameters on short spatial and temporal scales along the equatorial region. Eventually, the events with associated simultaneous WWLLN sferics provide a highly reliable sample to probe the long-standing issue of the TGF maximal energy.",

            "abstract": "Localized carbon dioxide (CO2) emission structures covering spatial domains of less than 50km diameter include cities, transportation infrastructure, fossil fuel production, upgrading and consumption sites. Anthropogenic sources upset the natural balance between carbon sources and sinks. Mitigation of resulting climate change impacts requires management of emissions, and emissions management requires monitoring, reporting and verification. Space-borne measurements provide a unique opportunity to detect, quantify, and analyze small scale and point source emissions on a global scale.\nIn 2014, NASA launched its first satellite dedicated to atmospheric CO2 observation, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2). Its observation strategy differs from sparse point-wise measurements from the Japanese Greenhouse gas Observation SATellite (GOSAT) instrument. At the expense of GOSAT’s fast time series capability (3-day repeat cycle, vs. 16 for OCO-2), its 8-footprint continuous swath of 2 to 10 km in width can slice through emission plumes and possibly provide momentary cross sections. While GOSAT measured approximately circular ~10.5 km diameter single-shot footprints, OCO-2 can provide hundreds more soundings per area at single kilometer scale footprint resolution.\nFirst OCO-2 results demonstrate that we can detect localized source signals in the form of urban XCO2 enhancements of ~2 ppmv against suburban and rural backgrounds. OCO-2’s multi-sounding swath observing geometry reveals intra-urban emission spatial structures previously unobserved from space. The transition from single-shot GOSAT soundings detecting urban/rural differences (Kort et al., 2012) to hundreds of soundings per OCO-2 swath opens up the path to future capabilities enabling urban greenhouse gas tomography.\n © California Institute of Technology",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are of high concern in California, bringing significant rain to the region over extended time periods of up to 5 days, potentially causing floods, and more importantly, contributing to the Sierra snowpack that provides much of the regional water resources. The CalWater project focuses on predicting the variability of the West Coast water supply, including improving AR forecasting. Unfortunately, data collection over the ocean remains a challenge and impacts forecasting accuracy. One novel technique to address this issue includes airborne GPS radio occultation (ARO), using broadcast GPS signals from space to measure the signal ray path bending angle and refractivity to retrieve vertical water vapor profiles. The Global Navigation Satellite System Instrument System for Multistatic and Occultation Sensing (GISMOS) system was developed for this purpose for recording and processing high-sample rate (10MHz) signals in the lower troposphere. Previous studies (Murphy et al, 2014) have shown promising results in acquiring airborne GPS RO data, comparing it to dropsondes and numerical weather models. CalWater launched a field campaign in the beginning of 2015 which included testing GISMOS ARO on the NOAA GIV aircraft for AR data acquisition, flying into the February 6th AR event that brought up to 35 cm of rain to central California. This case study will compare airborne GPS RO refractivity profiles to the NCEP-NCAR final reanalysis model and dropsonde profiles. We will show the data distribution and explain the sampling characteristics, providing high resolution vertical information to the sides of the aircraft in a manner complementary to dropsondes beneath the flight track. We will show how this method can provide additional reliable data during the development of AR storms.",

            "abstract": "The transition of stratospheric circulation at Antarctic latitudes from winter to summer conditions is highly variably from year to year. As has been realized recently, this also affects the winter/summer transition at mesopause altitudes. The Antarctic middle atmosphere therefore offers the unique possibility to study the physical processes involved in the vertical coupling between the stratosphere and the mesosphere\nduring winter/summer transition, in particular the role of gravity waves. We present new results from the mobile scanning iron lidar of the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics in Kühlungsborn (IAP) which was in operation at Davis, Antarctica, from December 15, 2010, until December 31, 2012. It measured temperatures in the iron layer (~80-100 km). The lidar can operate under daylight conditions. At Davis, the lidar has achieved at total of 2900 hours of temperature measurements which is presumably the largest nearly continuous data set in Antarctica. In this presentation we concentrate on the winter/summer transition and compare with circulation changes in the stratosphere derived from MERRA. We also compare with the northern hemisphere (NH). The thermal structure around the mesopause at Davis is closely coupled to the general circulation in the stratosphere, more precisely to the transition from winter to summer conditions. In contrast to theoretical expectations we occasionally find the mesopause significantly higher and colder(!) compared to the NH. The mesopause altitude\nchanges by several kilometers throughout the summer season, which is significantly different from the summer in the northern hemispheric. Depending on altitude, temperatures can be warmer or colder compared to the NH summer. We studied the seasonal variation of polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE). PMSE are strong radar echoes related to ice particles and therefore require very low atmospheric temperatures. The VHF radar frequently detected PMSE. We compare the seasonal variation of PMSE with stratospheric circulation, both at Davis and at ALOMAR (69°N). We also compare with winds in the upper mesosphere measured by a MF radar also located at Davis. Model calculations applying the Kühlungsborn Mechanistic Circulation Model (KMCM) are used to better understand the stratosphere/mesosphere coupling.",

            "abstract": "The study of global vegetation dynamics contributes to a better understanding of global change drivers and how these affect ecosystems and ecological diversity. Land-surface phenology (LSP) is a key response and feedback of vegetation to the climate system, and hence a parameter that needs to be accurately represented in terrestrial biosphere models [1]. However, the effects of climatic changes on LSP depend on the relative importance of climatic constraints in specific regions – which are not well understood at global scale.\nIn this study, we analyzed a Phenology Reanalysis dataset [2] to evaluate shifts in three climatic drivers of phenology at global scale and over the last 30 years (1982-2012): incoming radiation, evaporative demand and minimum temperature. As a first step, we compared LAI as modeled from these three factors (LAIre) to remotely sensed observations of LSP (LAI3g, [3]) over the same time period. As a second step, we examined temporal trends in the climatic constraints at Start- and End- of the Growing Season.\nThere was good agreement between phenology metrics as derived form LAI3g and LAIre over the last 30 years – thus providing confidence in the climatic constraints underlying the modeled data. Our analysis reveals inter-annual variation in the relative importance of the three climatic factors in limiting vegetation growth at Start- and End- of the Growing Season over the last 30 years. High northern latitudes, as well as northern Europe and central Asia, appear to have undergone significant changes in dominance between the three controls. We also find that evaporative demand has become increasingly limiting for growth in many parts of the world, in particular in South America and eastern Asia.\n [1] Richardson, A.D. et al.

            "abstract": "Tropospheric OH is the most important oxidant in the chemical degradation of atmospheric pollutants leading to a large variety of oxidised products. Often, OH reactions produce hydroperoxy radicals (HO2) which can recycle OH by reaction with NO or O3. The chemical interconversion of OH and HO2(collectively HOx) occurs on a fast time scale of seconds to minutes. Owing to their high reactivity and short chemical lifetime, substantial spatial variability of HOx is expected in ambient air with inhomogeneous trace-gas distribution. This is particularly the case in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) where most tropospheric pollutants are emitted near Earth's surface and are then distributed by transport.\nIn summer 2012, a Zeppelin NT was used as an airborne platform to investigate the spatial variation of HOx and other trace gases in the PBL in the Po Valley (Italy) as part of the Pan-European Gas-AeroSOls-climate interaction Study (PEGASOS). HOx and OH reactivity were measured by laser-induced fluorescence. Other on-board measurements included O3, CO, NO, NO2, HCHO, HONO, VOCs, photolysis frequencies, particle number concentration, and meteorological parameters. Due to the slow flight speed and precise navigation of the Zeppelin, the concentrations of HOx and trace gases could be measured with high spatial resolution. Vertical profiles were recorded repeatedly at altitudes between 75 m and 900m above ground. In the morning, measured vertical distributions of trace gases such as CO, NOx or VOCs visualise the dynamically evolving structure of the PBL. They show a pronounced effect on the radical cycling of HOx and therefore on the concentration profiles of OH and HO2. This presentation will show examples of the Zeppelin-based observations and discuss the role of HOx radical recycling in the evolving PBL.",

            "abstract": "In the satellite remote sensing of CO2, incorrect aerosol information could induce large errors as previous studies suggested. Many factors, such as, aerosol type, wavelength dependency of AOD, aerosol polarization effect and etc. have been main error sources. Due to these aerosol effects, large number of data retrieved are screened out in quality control, or retrieval errors tend to increase if not screened out, especially in East Asia where aerosol concentrations are fairly high. To reduce these aerosol induced errors, a CO2 retrieval algorithm using the simultaneous TANSO-CAI aerosol information is developed. This algorithm adopts AOD and aerosol type information as a priori information from the CAI aerosol retrieval algorithm. The CO2 retrieval algorithm based on optimal estimation method and VLIDORT, a vector discrete ordinate radiative transfer model. The CO2 algorithm, developed with various state vectors to find accurate CO2 concentration, shows reasonable results when compared with other dataset. This study concentrates on the validation of retrieved results with the ground-based TCCON measurements in East Asia and the comparison with the previous retrieval from ACOS, NIES, and UoL. Although, the retrieved CO2 concentration is lower than previous results by ppm’s, it shows similar trend and high correlation with previous results. Retrieved data and TCCON measurements data are compared at three stations of Tsukuba, Saga, Anmyeondo in East Asia, with the collocation criteria of ±2°in latitude/longitude and ±1 hours of GOSAT passing time. Compared results also show similar trend with good correlation. Based on the TCCON comparison results, bias correction equation is calculated and applied to the East Asia data.",

            "abstract": "ISUAL has recorded many mystic blue luminous events (BLEs) that emit clear middle ultraviolet to blue emissions (230−450 nm) but contain dim red emissions (653−754 nm). Most BLEs appear to be dot-like on the ISUAL images, and a few BLEs develop further into blue jets or type II gigantic jets (GJs). The associated sferics of the BLEs in the extremely low frequency to the very low frequency (ELF/VLF) band and the low frequency (LF) band exhibit similar features to those of the VLF/LF waveform for the narrow bipolar events (NBEs). The ISUAL BLE is conjectured to be the accompanied light emissions from the NBE-like event. Both positive and negative discharge polarity-types for the BLEs have been found. Based on the sferics and the ISUAL optical data, a NBE-like event is found to be related to a rapidly-flowing current of the initiation discharge in the thunderstorm, while a blue jet or a type II GJ is suggested to be associated with the slowly-varying current of the ensuing discharge. The selected six blue jets and one type II GJ occurring within 3,500 km from the NCKU sferics-detecting stations are inferred to be positive upward discharges. The spectral characteristics of BLEs resemble those of the emissions mostly from the non-thermal air plasmas produced by the locally-enhanced electric field, rather than those from the hot air plasmas in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).",

            "abstract": "The spectral dependence of aerosol properties, such as aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA), can be used to infer aerosol composition. In particular, aerosol mixtures dominated by dust absorption will have monotonically increasing SSA with wavelength while that dominated by black carbon absorption has monotonically decreasing SSA spectra. However, spectral AAOD and SSA measured in reality may differ from these extreme cases, due to the complicated composition and mixing states. In this study, we use spectral SSA and AAOD retrieved from AERONET measurements, assisted by CALIPSO aerosol type product and Mie calculations, to characterize aerosol mixtures over representative regions. Moreover, in addition to the monotonically increasing or decreasing AAOD and SSA spectra, we find the spectral dependence of these two parameters are frequently peaked (at 675 nm or 870 nm) over several places including East Asia, India, West Africa and South America. We thus suggest that SSA spectral curvature, defined as the negative of the second derivative of SSA as a function of wavelength, can provide additional information on the composition of these aerosol mixtures. Further analysis indicates that moderate mixing of black carbon with dust or organic carbon is mainly responsible for producing the SSA curvature. An optimization scheme was developed to match the observed AAOD and SSA spectra with Mie calculations assuming different aerosol composition and mixing states. Results suggest that while external mixing can explain most of the observed AAOD and SSA spectral dependence, internal mixing or core-shell mode is also likely under many circumstances, such as East Asia during winter and post-monsoon and winter seasons over India. This method offers the potential to quantitatively infer aerosol composition from these spectral measurements of aerosol optical properties.",

As a consequence, ecosystem structure is assumed to be mainly controlled by these vertical processes. In particular in permafrost-dominated high-latitude landscapes, several lateral processes such as thermoerosion or cryoturbation equally dominate ecosystem structure and hence ecosystem functions. In order to be able to represent such lateral processes in a land surface model, fine-scale subgrid heterogeneity of soil and vegetation properties need to be represented. Based on data from the Harmonized World Soil Database, several 0.5-degree grids will be setup for the land surface model JSBACH in order to study the effect of subgrid soil properties heterogeneity on the spatial variation of physical state variables such as soil temperature, moisture and ice content. Effects on grid cell-level energy-water-carbon coupling in high latitude ecosystems will be discussed.",

The TCs came to Japan one after another during late July to early August 2014. The tracks of these TCs were similar, i.e., the TCs followed the western edge of the subtropical northwestern Pacific high (SNPH). However, the tracks gradually reached to Japan, which were associated with weakening the westward expansion of the SNPH. It was found that the changes in westward expansion of the SNPH were associated with TC-induced sea surface cooling of previous Typhoon. It has previously been reported that TC-induced sea surface cooling is mainly caused by Ekman upwelling and vertical turbulent mixing. The TCs MATMO, HALONG, and NAKRI passed around the Philippines, and induced sea surface cooling of this area. The sea surface temperatures of this area are important for Pacific-Japan pattern, which was associated with the westward expansion of the SNPH. Consequently, previous Typhoon induced sea surface cooling around the Philippines, which weakening the westward expansion of the SNPH. Then, the tracks of next Typhoon were changed, and gradually reached to Japan.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) can provide valuable information that can be used to improve our understanding of the hydrological cycle and the impact of extreme climate events. Global TWS observations are currently only available from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment satellite mission (GRACE) at monthly time scales. In this study, we present a new approach to derive the sub-monthly TWS variation over a regularly inundated area by using MODIS reflectance data in addition to GRACE solutions. In the “training” phase, monthly TWS are computed from filtered GRACE solutions. A signal restoration method is applied to correct for signal leakage caused by filtering. In parallel, a time-series of mean monthly inundated area estimates is computed based on the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), derived from MODIS data. The training phase completes by finding an empirical relationship between the inundated area and the GRACE-based TWS variations, using a regression analysis. Then, the estimated parameters can be used to convert inundated area estimates into TWS variations without a further need in GRACE data. This approach has 3 major advantages over the usage of GRACE data alone. First, it can be used to cross-validate GRACE and MODIS reflectance data in order to identify and eliminate unreliable estimates. Second, it can provide sub-monthly (e.g., 8-day) TWS variations without loss of spatial resolution. Lastly, it can be used to fill gaps in TWS estimates based on GRACE data and to extend the time-series of TWS estimates beyond the time interval when GRACE data are available. The methodology is demonstrated using the Tonlé Sap floodplain located in Central Cambodia as a test case. The analysis shows an excellent agreement between the 8-day NDWI-based TWS estimates averaged over monthly intervals and the GRACE-based monthly TWS variations. The approach developed would have similar application in other areas that experience regular large-scale inundation.",

            "abstract": "The Palaeoproterozoic Hotazel Formation in the Transvaal Supergroup of South Africa represents an unusual sequence of banded iron formation interbedded with Mn-rich layers, in the form of three sedimentary cycles. The sequence has been interpreted as the product of cyclic Fe and Mn deposition in a marine environment that post-dated the first major event of atmosphere oxygenation at ~2.3Ga, known as Great Oxidation Event (GOE), despite the fact that geochronological constrains for the Hotazel rocks are still conjectural. The Hotazel deposits are thought to represent the products of anaerobic redox processes involving organic carbon and high-valence Fe/Mn-precursor species in the diagenetic environment; key evidence for such processes is provided by the low δ13C values of Fe- and Mn-rich carbonates contained in the Hotazel rocks (average δ13C: -9.6 per mil), which also typify other BIFs of the world. Here we show that the bulk carbonate fraction of the Hotazel Formation displays characteristically invariant carbon isotope signatures across large portions of the stratigraphy, irrespective of changes in bulk modal mineralogy, carbonate mineral chemistry, bulk Fe/Mn ratio or oxidation state of the rocks. This is inconsistent with traditional diagenetic models and points to a common and isotopically homogeneous source of dissolved carbon for carbonate formation in the Hotazel strata. The possibility emerges that the carbonate fraction in the Hotazel rocks initially precipitated as primary particles out of the ambient oceanic water-column, in response to processes of organic carbon cycling by Fe(III) and possibly Mn(IV) oxy-hydroxide species generated at the photic zone. Such a model precludes major atmosphere and shallow ocean oxygenation as a driver for primary oxide formation at post-GOE times, and suggests that the Hotazel deposits may in fact represent a highly evolved – chemically, isotopically and possibly biologically – marine environment that predated the GOE.",

            "abstract": "The incentive for this study is the ongoing explosive eruption of Nishinoshima volcano, located about 1,000 km south of Tokyo along the Ogasawara (Bonin) Arc. The straightforward but unexpected relationship presented here relates crustal thickness and magma type in the Izu-Ogasawara Oceanic Arc. Volcanoes along the Ogasawara segment of the arc, which include Nishinoshima, are underlain by thin crust (16-21 km)—in contrast to those along the Izu segment, where the crust is ~35 km thick. Interestingly, andesite magmas are dominant products from the former volcanoes and mostly basaltic lavas erupt from the latter.\nWhy and how do volcanoes on the thin crust erupt andesite magmas? An introductory petrology textbook might answer this question by suggesting that, under decreasing pressure and hydrous conditions, the liquidus field of forsterite expands relative to that of enstatite, with the result that, at some point, enstatite melts incongruently to produce primary andesite melt. According to the hypothesis presented here, however, rising mantle diapirs stall near the base of the oceanic arc crust at depths controlled by the thickness of the overlying crust. Where the crust is thin, as along the Ogasawara segment of the arc, pressures are relatively low, and magmas produced in the mantle wedge tend to be andesitic. Where the crust is thick, as along the Izu segment, pressures are greater, and only basaltic magmas tend to be produced.\nTo examine this hypothesis, JAMSTEC cruise NT15-E02 on the R/V Natsushima took place from 11 June to 21 June 2015 to Nishinoshima. It’s present island has an elevation of only ~150 m, but its submarine flanks extend to ocean depths of 2,000-3,000 m, so the great bulk of the volcano is submarine and yet-to-be explored. We present the new hypothesis and its evidence from Nishinoshima based on the primitive lavas collected from the submarine parts of the volcano.",

These processes occur over a wide spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. Confronting atmospheric transport models and ultimately improving the fidelity of surface flux estimates demands an integrated observing system that captures these scales. We will discuss using data the role of GHG remote sensing instruments and argue that our ability to deploy them from the ground and to fly them on satellite, aircraft, and unmanned airborne vehicles (UAV) mean that they represent the ideal technology to bridge the observed scales of variability. We will discuss a five-year record of global-scale column observations of CO2 and CH4 from the Japanese GOSAT satellite instrument that is available from University of Leicester as part of the ESA Climate Change Initiative. We will showcase new CO2 and CH4 column data that was collected by our shortwave infrared spectrometer GHOST oboard the NASA Global Hak during a regional survey over the eastern Pacific during early spring 2015, which included coincident overpasses from GOSAT and the NASA OCO-2. These data are being used to test atmospheric transport models over remote regions and to help validate satellite observations over the oceans. We will also discuss GHOST data collected on the UK Dornier 226 research aircraft to measure local-scale measurements over Leicester city centre, a major power plant, and downwind of a controlled Cumbrian heathland fire. Finally, we will report preliminary results from a new ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer station at Harwell (80 km west of London). We anticipate that this site will eventually join the TCCON network, which has been used to validation of satellite observations.",

            "abstract": "Drylands are extensive, covering 30% of the Earth’s land surface and 50% of Africa. Projections of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007) indicate that the extent of these regions have high probability to increase with a considerable additional impact on water resources, which should be taken into account by water management plans.\nIn these water-controlled areas, vegetation plays a key role in the water cycle. Ecohydrological models provide a tool to investigate the relationships between vegetation and water resources. However, studies in Africa often face the problem that many ecohydrological models have quite extensive parametrical requirements, while available data are scarce. Therefore, there is a need for assessments using models whose requirements match the data availability.\nIn that context, parsimonious models, together with available remote sensing information, can be valuable tools for ecohydrological studies. For this reason, we have focused on the use of a parsimonious model based on the amount of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation (APAR) and the Light Use Efficiency index (the efficiency by which that radiation is converted to plant biomass increment) in order to compute the gross primary production (GPP).This model has been calibrated using only remote sensing data (particularly, NDVI data from Modis products) in order to explore the potential of satellite information in implementing a simple distributed model. The model has been subsequently validated against stream flow data with the aim to define a tool able to account for landuse characteristics in describing water budget. Results are promising for studies aimed at the description of the consequences of ongoing land use changes on water resources.",

A limnogeological case study from Lake Heihai, situated at 4440 m a.s.l. on the northern Tibetan Plateau, gives evidence for marked changes in the depositional environment related to climatic and orographic effects. The 10 km long, 4 km wide, and 22 m deep lake is situated in a basin north of the Kunlun Mountain Range. Sub-bottom profiling revealed the presence of subaquatic terraces and ancient fan systems from a former low lake stand, draped by younger sediments. Sediment cores above basal sands comprise lacustrine sediments of late glacial to Holocene age. Proxy records document marked changes in allogenic sediment provenance and endogenic carbonate precipitation during the last 12 ka. The interpretation of these changes points to dominant detrital sediment and water supply from proximal alluvial fans during times, when precipiation was not blocked by the Kunlun Mountains. After a prolonged dry and cold phase during the Late Glacial, the situation of enhanced precipitation-generated sediment supply ocurred between 10.7 cal. ka BP and 7.9 cal. ka BP and decreased afterwards. The moist stage is also documented by a prominent lake terrace about 6 m above modern level that gives evidence of a higher lake level. The terrace structure includes fossil lake sediments, which were invaded by ground ice after lake-level fall and today reveal marked permafrost structures.The Holocene trend in lake hydrology is in phase with known variations in atmospheric circulation systems over monsoonal Asia.",

            "abstract": "After the phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) as ozone-depleting substances pursuant to the requirements of the Montreal Protocol, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are worldwide used as substitutes although the bulk of them are potent greenhouse gases (GHGs). Therefore, the alternation may bring side effect on global climate change. The trade-off of its environmental impacts between the ozone depletion and climate change regimes necessitates a quantification of the past and future consumption and emissions of both the original HCFCs and their alternative HFCs. Now a dilemma arise in China’s RAC industry that HCFC-22, which has an ozone-depleting potential (ODP) of 0.055, has been replaced by HFC-410A, which is a blended potent GHG from respective 50% HFC-32 and HFC-125 with a global warming potential (GWP) of 1923.5. Here, we present our results of estimates of consumption and emissions of HCFC-22 and HFC-410A from 1994 to 2050. Historic emissions of HCFC-22 contributed to global total HCFCs by 4.0% (3.0%-5.6%) ODP-weighted. Projection under a baseline scenario shows future accumulative emissions of HFC-410A make up 5.9%-11.0% of global GWP-weighted HFCs emissions, and its annual contribution to national overall CO2 emissions can be 5.5% in 2050. This makes HCFC-22 and HFC-410A emissions of significant importance in ozone depletion and climate change regimes. Two mitigation scenarios were set to assess the mitigation performance under the North America Proposal and an accelerated schedule. In practice of international environmental agreement, “alternative to alternative” should be developed to avoid regrettable alternations.",

            "abstract": "The Ore Mountains are an example of the region that suffered from severe environmental pollution caused by long-term coal mining and heavy industry leading to massive dieback of the local Norway spruce forests between the 1970’s and 1990’s. The situation became getting better at the end of 1990’s after pollution loads significantly decreased. In 1998 and 2013, airborne hyperspectral data (with sensor ASAS and APEX, respectively) were used to study recovery of the originally damaged forest stands and compared them with those that have been less affected by environmental pollution. The field campaign (needle biochemical analysis, tree defoliation etc.) accompanied hyperspectral imagery acquisition. An analysis was conducted assessing a set of 16 vegetation indices providing complex information on foliage, biochemistry and canopy biophysics and structure. Five of them (NDVI, NDVI705, VOG1, MSR and TCARI/OSAVI) showing the best results were employed to study spatial gradients as well as temporal changes. The detected gradients are in accordance with ground truth data on representative trees. The obtained results indicate that the original significant differences between the damaged and undamaged stands have been generally levelled until 2013, although it is still possible to detect signs of the previous damages in several cases.",

            "abstract": "The Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory is a Northern Appalachian catchment site where a series of geochemical tracers have been applied in order to build a multi-isotope integrative model (referred to as “CZ-tope”). The catchment is small (8ha) and relief is about 30 m. It receives about 107 cm of precipitation per year. Mean annual temperature is 10°C. Shales Hills observatory has a relatively simple lithology consisting of organic-poor shales rich in illite and relatively infrequent interbedded carbonates and sandstones. Vegetation consists mainly of deciduous trees. Soil thickness ranges from 0.3 m at the ridgetop to 3 m in the valley floor.\nFollowing the CZ-tope concept, boron isotopes were analysed in the main geochemical reservoirs of the SH catchment (stream, vegetation, soil pore waters, solid phases, groundwaters). Measurements were conducted using MC-ICPMS and a direct injection system after a chemical procedure aiming at isolating boron from geological matrix. Results are expressed as δ11B. Error bars are better than 0.5‰\nBoron isotopes in Shale Hills catchment show a large range of variation. While bedrock values are within a narrow range around -5‰, stream waters range between 10‰ and 15‰, and exhibit temporal variations. This very strong 11B enrichment is also observed in the vegetation, groundwater and rainwater reservoirs but with a much larger range of variation. The input of 11B-enriched water by precipitation is contributing to the B budget at the catchment outlet but cannot explain all the 11B enrichment with respect to parent bedrock. The solid phases collected along two different soil profiles and as suspended sediments in the stream are close to the bedrock value or slightly 10B-enriched. The most important conclusion from boron isotope investigation at Shale Hills CZO is that a simple mass budget is not able to reconcile the strong 11B-enrichment measured in the water phases and vegetation with the isotopic signature of the bedrock, soil and sediments. Boron isotopes, like previously inferred for other isotopic systems at the CZO, are therefore consistent with a missing reservoir, such as fine particles that have not been sampled and analysed or a non-steady state behavior of the critical zone at Shale Hills for boron.",

            "abstract": "Low-lying oceanic islands host thin freshwater lenses subject to long-term aquifer salinization by seawater overwash. The lens is often the sole-source water supply for inhabitants. As maximum elevation for these islands is only a few meters above sea level, overwash can occur during high tides and storm surges. Sea level rise due to climate change will make overwash events even more common.\nThe thin freshwater lenses, a few meters thick, are underlain by seawater, so pumping must be done carefully, often with horizontal skimming wells. Even a small amount of downward seawater infiltration from an overwash event can render the water supply non-potable. Where permeability is high, seawater infiltrates quickly, but seawater that infiltrates lower-permeability zones may remain for many months causing groundwater to remain non-potable, leaving residents without a reliable freshwater source.\nInitial post-overwash salinization is driven by the higher density of the invading saltwater, which sinks and mixes into the fresher water in potentially-complex patterns determined by: distribution of flooding and post-flood ponding, locations of permeable paths, and the inherently complex flow fields generated when fluid of higher density overlies lower-density fluid. The flow patterns cannot generally be measured or predicted in detail.\nThis study develops basic understanding of overwash salinization processes impacting water supply on low-level islands, using a rare example of a monitored seawater overwash event that occurred in December 2008 at Roi-Namur Island in Kwajalein Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands, in which the salinity evolution of well water was measured. Due to typical lack of field data on such islands, a set of plausible alternative simulation-model descriptions of the hydrogeology and overwash event are created for analysis of the monitored salinization and recovery. Despite inability to know the ‘true and complete’ description of the event and the hydrogeology, the alternative models provide a range of possible evolutions of aquifer salinity. This allows identification of the controls on the rate and extent of initial salinization and of salinity persistence, which can be used as a basis for development of strategies to manage groundwater resources on low-lying islands.",

            "abstract": "Beppu Bay is located at the western end of the arc-bisecting dextral fault (Median Tectonic Line) associated with the northwestward subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate. According to Itoh et al. (1998) and Itoh et al. (2014), the process of formation of the bay was divided into two stages. The older stage (5 to 1.5 Ma) was dominated by a northward-inclined half-graben, while a pull-apart stress resulting from the right-stepping of the MTL developed during the younger stage (1.5 Ma to present in particular, 0.7 Ma to present), so seamless sediments were clearly preserved in the bay. Recently, Kuwae et al. (2012) revealed that the hemipelagic sediments accompanied with some event layers (18 major event layers (> 1 cm thick) and 55 minor event layers (< 1 cm thick)) were deposited. The core was well dated based on AMS 14C ages of 42 bivalves. In this study, we investigated the lithology of the event layers to understand how the layers were deposited. As a result, major event layers are classified into five types based on difference in the grain composition and facies: turbidites (type A–C), tephras (type D), and others (type E). Type A (4 layers) is thick event layers with a basal sand division, middle laminated silt division, and upper clay division. Relatively heavy particles, such as minerals, are concentrated in the basal division with clear erosion. Type B (7 layers) is similar to type A, but lack the basal division. Type C (5 layers) is almost the same as type B, but contains gypsum. Type D (2 layers) consists of a large amount of volcanic glass without bottom erosion. Type E (1 layer) is different from all other types and distinguishes by black color coarse particles and relatively high magnetic susceptibility. In particular, type A event layers are deposited in 334, 617, 1685, and 1893 cal. yrs BP using our age-depth model. The deposition age of an event layer corresponds to Keicho-Bungo historical earthquake occurred in 354 cal. yrs BP (Usami, 1996). The ages of other three layers are also not inconsistent with the ages of three fault events estimated by previous on-fault studies (Oita Prefecture, 2001; Chida et al., 2004). We thus concluded that the type A event layers were likely induced by earthquakes.",

A 77 cm piston push core was taken from the Juan de Fuca Ridge Axial Seamount using a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) (2213m, 45.55º N, 130.08º W), an active submarine volcano ~480 km off Oregon’s coast. Five radiocarbon dates indicate that the sediment ranges from 42.6 ka at 77 cm to 17.6 ka at 15 cm, with an average sediment accumulation rate of 2.47 cm/ka from 77–15 cm, and an average rate of 0.85 cm/ka during the postglacial period (<17.6 ka). Multiple species of planktic foraminifera from the core representing subtropical, subartic, and arctic fauna have been used to constrain changes in vertical and seasonal temperature since Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3). Measurements of δ18O of the upwelling species Globigerina bulloides, the thermocline dwelling species Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, and the warm mixed-layer species Orbulina universa are offset from each other, reflecting vertical and seasonal variation among the planktonic foraminifera. Of the three species, G. bulloides shows the least variation in δ18O, possibly indicating that marked changes in temperature are masking changes in the δ18O of seawater due to global ice volume changes. G. bulloides and O. universa δ18O values are similar in MIS 3 and diverge with time, indicating the development of strong seasonal succession of species, since the last glacial maximum. Bulk nitrogen isotopes and nitrogen flux provide additional constraints on upwelling strength and insight into local biological productivity and nutrient dynamics. Obtaining Mg/Ca data will clarify the δ 18O interpretation except deep in the core where metal-bearing authigenic precipitates affect Mg concentrations. These climatic proxies together provide insight into how global climate change and local seamount volcanism impacts regional productivity in the California Current.",

As exposure of more than 20 years under atmospheric conditions of Kuwait, the crude oil has volatile hydrocarbons and covered heavy oily sludge under the crude oil lake. One of crude oil contaminated soil which located Burgan Oilfield area was collected by Kuwait Oil Company and got by H-plus Company.\nThis contaminated soil has about 42% crude oil and could not biodegraded itself due to the extremely high toxicity. This contaminated soil was separated by 2mm sieve for removal oil sludge ball. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) was analysis by GC FID and initial TPH concentration was average 48,783 mg/kg. Ten grams of the contaminated soil replaced in two micro reactors with 20mL of bio surfactant produce microorganism. Reactor 1 was added 0.1g powder hemoglobin and other reactor was not added hemoglobin at time 0 day. Those reactors shake 120 rpm on the shaker for 7 days and CO2 produced about 150mg/L per day. After 7 days under the slurry systems, the rest days operated by hemoglobin as primary carbon source for enhanced biodegradation.\nThe crude oil contaminated soil was degraded from 48,783mg/kg to 20,234mg/kg by slurry process and final TPH concentration degraded 11,324mg/kg for 21days.

This work focused on the application of quantitative integration approaches, which involve the mathematical and statistical integration techniques, on the archaeo-geophysical data obtained in Aizanoi Archaeological Site,Turkey. Two geophysical methods were applied as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Magnetometry for archaeological prospection on the selected archaeological site. After basic data processing of each geophysical method, the mathematical approaches of Sums and Products and the statistical approach of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have been applied for the integration. These integration approches were first tested on synthetic digital images before application to field data. Then the same approaches were applied to 2D magnetic maps and 2D GPR time slices which were obtained on the same unit grids in the archaeological site. Initially, the geophysical data were examined individually by referencing with archeological maps and informations obtained from archaeologists and some important structures as possible walls, roads and relics were determined. The results of all integration approaches provided very important and different details about the anomalies related to archaeological features. By using all those applications, integrated images can provide complementary informations as well about the archaeological relics under the ground.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thanks to Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), Fellowship for Visiting Scientists Programme for their support, Istanbul University Scientific Research Project Fund, (Project.No:12302) and archaeologist team of Aizanoi Archaeological site for their support during the field work.",

Additionally, Pangea is our best reference in the supercontinent enigma.\nPangea is the latest in a series of supercontinents that formed repeatedly since the Archean, only to break up and reform again. Although the mechanisms responsible are controversial, many geoscientists agree that repeated cycles of supercontinent amalgamation and dispersal have had a profound effect on the evolution of Earth's crust, atmosphere, climate, and life. Yet constrain to a first order, the amalgamation of Pangea show a major kinematic problem: the paleomagnetic database for the Late Carboniferous supports a continental- scale orocline, predicting large amounts of shortening/extension yet to be reconstructed. Results from a multidisciplinary approach suggest that the formations of a huge orocline change had profound influence in the amalgamation of the supercontinent changing Pangea's fate.",

            "abstract": "Using heat as an active tracer in different types of aquifers is a topic of increasing interest. In this study, we investigate the potential interest of using heat tracer tests for characterization of a shallow alluvial aquifer. A thermal tracer test was conducted in the alluvial aquifer of the Meuse River, Belgium. The tracing experiment consisted in simultaneously injecting heated water and a dye tracer in a piezometer and monitoring the evolution of groundwater temperature and tracer concentration in the recovery well and in monitoring wells. To get insights in the 3D characteristics of the heat transport mechanisms the space-filling arrangement of observation wells was used. The breakthrough curves measured in the recovery well showed that heat transfer in the alluvial aquifer is slower and more dispersive than solute transport. Recovery is very low for heat while in the same time it is measured as relatively high for the solute tracer. This is due to the fact that heat diffusion is larger than molecular diffusion, implying that exchange between groundwater and the porous medium matrix is far more significant for heat than for solute tracers. Temperature breakthrough curves in other piezometers are contrasted with what would be expected in an ideal layered aquifer. They reveal strongly unequal lateral and vertical components of the transport mechanisms. The observed complex behavior of the heat plume was explained by the groundwater flow gradient on the site and heterogeneities of hydraulic conductivity field. By using numerical model of heat and flow coupled with pilot points inverse approach main preferential paths were characterized.",

            "abstract": "Climate models are a key provider to investigate impacts of projected future climate conditions on regional hydrologic systems. However, there is a considerable mismatch of spatial resolution between GCMs and regional applications, in particular a region characterized by complex terrain such as Korean peninsula. Therefore, a downscaling procedure is an essential to assess regional impacts of climate change. Numerous statistical downscaling methods have been used mainly due to the computational efficiency and simplicity. In this study, four statistical downscaling methods [Bias-Correction/Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD), Bias-Correction/Constructed Analogue (BCCA), Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA), and Bias-Correction/Climate Imprint (BCCI)] are applied to downscale the latest Climate Forecast System Reanalysis data to stations for precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature over South Korea. By split sampling scheme, all methods are calibrated with observational station data for 19 years from 1973 to 1991 are and tested for the recent 19 years from 1992 to 2010. To assess skill of the downscaling methods, we construct a comprehensive suite of performance metrics that measure an ability of reproducing temporal correlation, distribution, spatial correlation, and extreme events. In addition, we employ Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to identify robust statistical downscaling methods based on the performance metrics for each season. The results show that downscaling skill is considerably affected by the skill of CFSR and all methods lead to large improvements in representing all performance metrics. According to seasonal performance metrics evaluated, when TOPSIS is applied, MACA is identified as the most reliable and robust method for all variables and seasons. Note that such result is derived from CFSR output which is recognized as near perfect climate data in climate studies. Therefore, the ranking of this study may be changed when various GCMs are downscaled and evaluated. Nevertheless, it may be informative for end-users (i.e. modelers or water resources managers) to understand and select more suitable downscaling methods corresponding to priorities on regional applications.",

Experimental verification of these phenomena remain a major target of glass-melt studies. Here, we provide an overview of the recent progress by solid-state NMR and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) into structures of multi-component silicate and oxide glasses with varying pressure, composition (with fluid contents), and confinement [e.g., Lee et al. Rev. Min. Geochem. 2014, 78, 139; Lee and Ahn, Sci. Report, 2014, 4, 4200; Lee and Kim, J. Phys. Chem. C. 2015, 119 748].\nO-17 NMR studies reveal the presence of metal-bridging oxygen in orthosilicate glasses (an analogue to peridotite melts) and allow direct quantification of the degree of Metal/Si disorder with composition and pressure. Despite the pronounced paramagnetic effect, detailed structural changes in iron-bearing silicate glasses can now be probed using solid-state NMR techniques. NMR results for the multi-component silicate glasses melts at high pressure highlight the moderate deviation from the degree of Al avoidance among framework cations (Si and Al) and preferential proximity between non-network cations and non-bridging oxygen. In contrast to an expected complexity in densification, experimental NMR and IXS results for glasses demonstrate that the pressure-induced changes in melt structures show a simple trend where the effect composition and pressure can be predicted with network flexibility.\nSolid-state NMR techniques revealed the unknown structural details of oxide glasses and melts near surfaces and interfaces: the coordination environments in the surface confined oxide glasses are distinct from those of bulk, highlighted by a decrease in the fractions of high-energy clusters (and thus the degree of disorder) near interface. The structure of glass surfaces is also affected by the types of interfaces (e.g. crystalline vs. melts), demonstrating that a wide range of variations in structure of glasses and melts in contact with other coexisting phases can be experimentally identified.",

The ongoing EPN (EUREF Permanent Network) densification targets the integration of the national CORS networks and a homogeneous, dense position and velocity product is derived using the EPN as backbone infrastructure. The homogeneous cumulative solution relies on the national weekly SINEX products in order to minimize inconsistencies (e.g. site naming, discontinuities). The integration is done with the CATREF software (Altamimi et al, IGN) using the Minimum Constraint approach. The derived position and velocity product will be an essential material for various geokinematic studies (PGR, intraplate and plate boundary zone investigations), and also for the better realization of ETRS89 over tectonically active regions. This work is very well inline with the goals of other European initiatives as EPOS and EUPOS.\nThe preparatory work is well in progress, several years of weekly SINEX files are already available and analyzed. The database contains more than 2000 stations stemming from 15 contributing Analysis Centres. A significant effort is devoted to the cleaning and organization of the station metadata and publish on the EPNCB website, which is necessary to improve the quality and reliabilty of the combination product.\nThis presentation, beyond the publication of the state-of the-art combination results partly focuses on the analysis of existing reference frame realization issues caused by the GNSS antenna PCV updates not yet eliminated on the national CORS level.",

Because stable carbon isotope ratio is used to trace carbon source, several analytical techniques likes IRMS (Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry) and LAS (Laser Absorption Spectrometry) were extensively used. Off-axis ICOS, a kind of LAS, has merits on long-term stability and field application, therefore it is widely being used in CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) field. The aim of this study is to extend the application scope of OA-ICOS to determine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Because OA-ICOS showed dependence of δ13C on CO2 concentration, data processing is required. We tested CO2 Carbon Isotope Analyzer (CCIA-36-EP, Los Gatos Research) with both reference gas (δ13C= –28.28‰) and aqueous solutions prepared by dissolving sodium bicarbonate standards (δ13C= –12.26‰ and +3.96‰). The differences of δ13C between reference and measurement values are plotted by CO2 concentrations, then compared. At first, we checked the similarity between our curve pattern for reference gas and Guillon’s research (δ13C= –43.99‰) by other Analyzer. To analyze aqueous samples, more errors can be caused than gas analysis. The carbon isotope fractionation occurs during dissolving standard reagents and extracting DIC as CO2 gas form. This effect is mixed with CO2 concentration dependence effect, therefore the curve patterns are different with that for reference gas. Our experiments are done for various δ13C values. It could be an important point to use OA-ICOS to analyze DIC, too.",

Of these high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions, the Southern Ocean is the region where variations in iron availability can have the largest effect on Earth’s carbon cycle through its fertilizing effect on marine ecosystems, both in the modern and in the past.\nRecent work in the Subantarctic South Atlantic (Martínez-Garcia et al., 2009, 2014, Anderson et al., 2014) suggests that dust-driven iron fertilization lowered atmospheric CO2 by up to 40 ppm in the latter half of each glacial cycle of the late Pleistocene, with the increase in Subantarctic productivity consuming a greater fraction of the surface nutrients and thus driving more storage of carbon in the ocean interior.\nThe other sectors of the Southern Ocean remain poorly constrained, including the Pacific Sector, that accounts for the largest surface area of the Subantarctic Southern Ocean. Here we report records of dust deposition, iron supply and export production from a set of cores from the Subantarctic Pacific (PS75, Lamy et al 2014) and initial results about the origin of dust transported to the Subantarctic Pacific Ocean from radiogenic isotopes and rare earth elements. We test how tightly dust and biological productivity are coupled over glacial/interglacial and millennial timescales in the Subantarctic Pacific and place the region in a context of global patterns of biological productivity, nutrient utilization and iron fertilization by dust, including comparisons to the other Pacific HNLC regions, the Subarctic North Pacific and equatorial Pacific.",

Although numerous studies had investigated the effects of warming on C processes from leaf to plant and ecosystem levels, how leaf-level responses to warming scale up to biomass responses at plant, population, and community levels are largely unknown. In this study, we compiled a dataset from 468 papers at 300 experimental sites and synthesized the warming effects on leaf-level parameters, and plant, population and ecosystem biomass. Our results showed that responses of plant biomass to warming mainly resulted from the changed leaf area rather than the altered photosynthetic capacity. The response of ecosystem biomass to warming was weaker than those of leaf area and plant biomass. However, the scaling functions from responses of leaf area to plant biomass to warming were different in diverse forest types, but functions were similar in non-forested biomes. In addition, it is challenging to scale the biomass responses from plant up to ecosystem. These results indicated that leaf area might be the appropriate index for plant biomass response to warming, and the interspecific competition might hamper the scaling of the warming effects on plant and ecosystem levels, suggesting that the acclimation capacity of plant community should be incorporated into land surface models to improve the prediction of climate-C cycle feedback.",

We test potential scaling of observed maximum earthquake magnitudes along thirty strike-slip fault sections worldwide with various properties including cumulative displacement, mapped fault length, seismogenic thickness and angle between fault strike and maximum horizontal shear stress. For 70-80% of the total dataset associated generally with interplate events, the maximum magnitude scales logarithmically with the seismogenic thickness times either cumulative displacement or mapped fault length. Most faults in this population have slip rate > 5mm/yr, cumulative displacement >10 km and relatively high angles to the maximum compressive stress direction. The remaining 20-30% dataset involves events at some distance from a plate boundary proper on faults with slip rate < 5mm/yr, cumulative displacements <10 km and 40-45° to the maximum horizontal stress. These earthquakes have larger magnitudes than expected from the scaling relations of the previous population, likely because of larger stress drops and rupture of multiple fault segments.",

Knowledge of deep structure beneath the N-S trending rifts is key to evaluating models proposed for their origin, including gravitational collapse, oblique convergence along the arcuate plate boundary, and mantle upwelling. We model direct S and Moho-reflected SsPmp phases at teleseismic distances to constrain variations in crustal thickness across the major rifts crossed by a ~900-km long, W-E broadband array in the Lhasa Terrane. Crustal thicknesses are ~70–80 km. However, Moho depth decreases by ~10 km within a horizontal distance of 100 km west of the Yadong-Gulu rift (YGR) and Nyainquentanghla mountains (NQTL). This Moho uplift, taken with deep, extensional focal mechanisms and reduced seismic velocity in the upper mantle, suggests that asthenospheric upwelling has significantly contributed to the pattern of extension across the YGR and NQTL. The ~100-km separation between surface rift and Moho uplift is likely enabled by partial decoupling across a ductile middle crust.",

            "abstract": "Global land use models are driven by demands for food and urban space. However, at the same time many transitions in land use and land cover are driven by societal changes and the demand for a wide range of landscape functions or ecosystem services, including the conservation of biodiversity, regulation of climate and floods, and recreation. Some of these demands lead to tele-connected land use change through the transport of good and services, others are place-based and shape the local realities of land system change. Most current land use change models focus on land cover changes alone and ignore the importance of changes in land management and landscape configuration that affect climate, biodiversity and the provisioning of ecosystem services. This talk will present an alternative approach to global land use modelling based on the simulation of changes in land systems in response to a wide set of ecosystem service demands. Simulations at global scale illustrate that accounting for demands for livestock products, carbon sequestration and biological conservation (following the Aichi targets) leads to different outcomes of land change models and allows the identification of synergies between carbon and biodiversity targets. An application in Laos indicates the complex transitions in land systems and landscapes that occur upon the transition from shifting cultivation to permanent agriculture and tree-crop plantations. We discuss the implications of such land system representations for Earth system modelling.",

            "abstract": "The Ore Mts. located in the western part of the Czech Republic suffered during 1950’s-1990´s heavy atmospheric pollution due to the mining activities and brown coal combustion. Acidic deposition in combination with harsh climatic conditions led there to large-scale forest decline. Although the load of SO2 has significantly decreased since 1991, tree damage was still visible in 1998 in terms of high defoliation or dead trees. Nowadays Norway spruce trees do not exhibit visible symptoms of damage but the full recovery of Norway spruce forests is not complete yet due to persisting adverse soil conditions.\nThe temporal changes in the physiological status of Norway spruce forests in the Krušné Hory Mts. were evaluated using two sets of spectral images acquired in 1998 (ASAS) and in 2013 (APEX) and ground truth data (LAI, tree crown status, photosynthetic pigment contents, leaf spectral properties measured by spectroradiometer, soil properties – pH, contents of basic cations, heavy metals, etc.). Ground truth data were evaluated by unconstrained and constrained multivariate analyses using Canoco 5. The high resolution spectral images (ASAS and APEX) enabled the identification of a gradient of forest conditions and their comparison.\nIn 1998 the stands exhibited different physiological status corresponding to the pollution gradient with healthier trees at the western part of the mountains. Analysis of the foliar chemistry in 2013 show a slight improvement of the Norway spruce physiological status in the eastern part of the mountains while the status of the western-located stands slightly worsened. In 2013 we also studied the differences in soil geochemical conditions, which appeared to be less favorable in the western part of the mountains characterized by a low base cation contents in the top organic horizon and a very low pH (pH<3).",

Each mode of polarized light provides information about the scattering medium, from atmospheres to search for signatures of habitability. Linear polarization in the optical and near-infrared windows are optimum to study changes in cloud/hazes in planetary atmospheres. Circular polarization is important to understand the influence of multiple scattering in the atmosphere. Linear and circular polarization of comets provides information about the composition and wavelength dependence of the dust, indicative of new, active comets vs. older comets. Changes in magnetic fields (as in aurorae) can be explored with polarimetry. Atmospheric phenomena such as rainbows,clouds and haloes exhibit polarimetric signatures that can be used as diagnostics to probe the atmosphere and may be possible to extend this approach to other planets and exoplanets. Biological molecules exhibit an inherent handedness or circular polarization or chirality, assisting in search for the identification of astrobiological material in the solar system.

            "abstract": "A suite of partial coupling experiments have been devised under a coupled GCM framework to isolate the effects of the feedbacks from the change of the wind-driven ocean circulation and air–sea heat flux in the global climate response to the forcing of increasing CO2. Specifically, the SST response has been examined in the tropical Indo-Pacific. An El Nino-like SST warming emerges in the tropical Pacific, together with an overall shoaling of the equatorial thermocline. The wind stress change plays the leading role in weakening the surface westward currents as well as for the oceanic changes in the equatorial thermocline while the effect of the wind speed change is mainly confined to the surface. In the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO), an Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) like warming pattern is generated, and the development of the dipole pattern shows a pronounced seasonal evolution. Results from overriding experiments show that the wind-evaporation-sea surface temperature (WES) feedback accounts for most of the enhanced warming in the western and central TIO during May–July with the reduced southerly monsoonal wind and partially contributes to the reduced warming in the eastern TIO during June-September. The Bjerknes feedback explains most of the reduced warming in the eastern TIO during August-October, accompanied by reduced precipitation in the eastern TIO, easterly wind anomalies and a thermocline shoaling along the equator. Both feedbacks facilitate the formation of the dipole warming pattern in the TIO.",

            "abstract": "We present results of a Receiver Function (RF) study of the mantle transition zone (TZ) in Central-Eastern Greenland. The base of this study is data from 19 broad-band seismometers, which were temporarily installed from 2009 to 2012 in the region between Scoresbysund and Summit (~ 70º N) plus 5 permanent stations from the GLISN network. One half of these stations were installed on the ice, the other half on bedrock.Our analysis is based on low frequency PRF, which use the difference in travel times between converted and not converted phasesat discontinuities. Most of our RFs show clear signals for P410s and P660s. Their delay times suggest a surprisingly thin mantle transition zone for most parts of the study area in comparison to standard Earth models, and much thinner than below other continental shield and platform areas. This could indicate a fairly recent heating of the TZ.\nAnother observation is an M-shaped signal around the 410 km – discontinuity at some of the stations mainly in the western part around Summit. This observation is contrary to the expected simple negative signal. It may indicate a thin low velocity layer between 410 km and 520 km, as it has previously been observed in several settings based on converted waves and also explosion data.\nMost of our stations show positive travel time anomalies for the upper mantle, which again is contrary to simple models of old continental shields.",

            "abstract": "The Perth Regional Aquifer Model (PRAMS) framework has been used for about a decade now to evaluate the potential anthropogenic impacts associated with management decisions that affect Perth’s groundwater resources. A great wealth of data, expertise and numerical analysis have gone into the development of PRAMS over the years. However, there has been little quantitative work conducted on systemically addressing the uncertainty in the model’s structure and predictions. PRAMS is designed to make a variety of regional and local-scale predictions and, both the nature and magnitude of the uncertainty associated with these predictions can vary significantly. A primary prediction to be addressed using the PRAMS framework, will be the effects of various deep-aquifer groundwater management scenarios on both the environmental and social concerns surrounding the superficial aquifer, which supports sensitive wetlands, and the negative impacts of seawater intrusion into the deep aquifers. A particular model-structure component that greatly affects the predictions associated with deep-aquifer groundwater extraction is the characterization of the local fault structure, i.e., whether or not faults are acting as barriers to groundwater flow. Therefore, uncertainty in fault characterization can subsequently lead to significant predictive uncertainty. However, new observation data can be obtained to reduce this uncertainty. In this study, an experimental design methodology is employed to optimally acquire new observations of state in such a way as to maximize the information obtained about the hydraulic properties of faults. Various information criteria are employed to develop optimal locations of new observation wells. The A-optimality criterion was found to be the most effective for comparing sampling strategies given the design assumptions, which include the parameter sets employed, hydraulic forcing, temporal considerations, and the use of the existing observation network. A binary-integer formulation of the particle swarm optimization technique is employed to evaluate the optimal design.",

            "abstract": "Recent multi-spacecraft Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) observations have challenged the traditional view of SEP production and interplanetary transport, with the observations suggesting fast SEP access to a wide range of heliographic longitudes. For many events the anisotropy of the SEPs has been found to depend on the observer's longitude, being stronger at locations that are well magnetically connected to the assumed SEP source region, as compared to wider longitudinal reaches. This suggests that interplanetary transport is an important factor for the SEP cross-field extent. For some events, on the other hand, strong anisotropies are observed at a wider longitudinal range. In this report, we study the temporal and spatial evolution of SEP anisotropy using a new SEP transport model which incorporates field-line meandering into the Fokker-Planck (FP) transport modelling framework. The new model, FP+FLRW, was introduced by Laitinen et al (2013), who found using full-orbit simulations that the cross-field propagation of particles early in an SEP event is not diffusive, but dominated by deterministic propagation along turbulently meandering field-lines. We have recently incorporated the FP+FLRW model into the Parker spiral geometry, and shown that it is able to reproduce the observed fast access of SEPs to a wide range of longitudes, and the observed longitudinal peak intensity range with σ=30-50°, already for a narrow source region, while using realistic interplanetary transport conditions. Here, we compare the anisotropy evolution of an SEP event given by the FP+FLRW model to that given by the traditional FP approach, and discuss the implications of our findings for the SEP event origins, source width and the role of interplanetary turbulence in the interpretation of the SEP observations.",

            "abstract": "The recent rapid increase in mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet has been primarily attributed to the acceleration of outlet glaciers. Helmheim-Sermilik is one of the major glacier-fjord systems in southeast Greenland that has been observed to retreat and nearly double its flow speed during the past decade. One possible cause of this acceleration is enhanced melting at the glacier terminus driven by the advection of warm waters of Atlantic origin over the East Greenland Shelf and into the Sermilik fjord (38E,66N).\nWe use a high resolution configuration of the MITgcm circulation model (2km- and 15m grid spacing in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively), forced by Era-Interim winds and with a bathymetry updated by recent ship- and seal-borne measurements, to study intra-seasonal variability of the intrusions of the warm Atlantic water on the East Greenland Shelf advected toward the Sermilik fjord. The modeled T-S properties in the vicinity of the fjord sill are in good agreement with available observations. The warm inflow into the fjord occurs in quasi-oscillatory pulses of 1-10 day periodicity and of 50-200m vertical extent. The inflow occurs for (10-40)% time of the year (depending on depth), with a slight preference for winter months. The velocity and heat flux distributions are nearly Gaussian at 300m depth and non-Gaussian (Kurtosis>7) at greater depths, with a long positive tail corresponding to high (>0.4m/s) inflow events in winter. We quantify the relative importance of synoptic winds and internal dynamics in generating this variability. The Eulerian analysis is supplemented by backward tracing of O(10,000) Lagrangian particles revealing pathways and water-mass transformation of the inflow that is primarily fed by Irminger Current intruding on the shelf in the vicinity of the Spill Jet section (32E,65N) and channeled through the Sermilik Deep Opening. We ephasize the importance of proper representation of topographic features on the shelf steering the modeled inflow, and of proper temporal and spatial resolution of the warm inflow events into the fjord.",

            "abstract": "In contrast of the 1975-76 Tolbachik eruption, the 2012-2013 Tolbachik eruption was not preceded by any striking change in seismic activity. By processing the Klyuchevskoy volcano group seismic data with the Seismic Amplitude Ratio Analysis (SARA) method, we gain insights into the dynamics of magma transfer prior to this important eruption. We highlighted a clear migration of the source of the microseismicity within the seismic swarm, starting 20 hours before the reported eruption onset (05:15 UTC, 26 November 2012). This migration proceeded in different phases and ended when eruptive tremor, corresponding to lava extrusion, was recorded (at ~11:00 UTC, 27 November 2012). In order to get a first order approximation of the location of the magma, we compare the calculated seismic intensity ratios with the theoretical ones. As expected, the observations suggest a migration toward the eruptive vent. However, we explain the pre-eruptive observed ratios by a vertical migration under the northern slope of Plosky Tolbachik volcano that would interact at shallower depth with an intermediate storage region and initiate the lateral migration toward the eruptive vents. Another migration is also captured by this technique and coincides with a seismic swarm that started 16-20 km to the south of Plosky Tolbachik at 20:31 UTC on November 28 and lasted for more than 2 days. This seismic swarm is very similar to the seismicity preceding the 1975-76 Tolbachik eruption and can be considered as a possible aborted eruption.",

            "abstract": "Since 2013 we have been operating a temperature-controlled plunging-jet sea spray aerosol chamber at Stockholm University using inorganic artificial seawater. Using size-resolved measurements of the foam bubbles responsible for the aerosol production we were able to show that it is changes to these foam bubbles which drive the observed changes in aerosol production and size distribution as water temperature changes (Salter et al., 2014). Further, by combining size-resolved measurements of aerosol production as a function of water temperature with measurements of air entrainment by the plunging-jet we have developed a temperature-dependent sea spray source function for deployment in large-scale models (Salter et al., 2015).\nWe have also studied the hygroscopicity, morphology, and chemical composition of the inorganic sea spray aerosol produced in the chamber. The sea spray aerosol generated from artificial seawater exhibited lower hygroscopic growth than both pure NaCl and output from the E-AIM aerosol thermodynamics model when all relevant inorganic ions in the sea salt were included. Results from sensitivity tests using a large-scale earth system model suggest that the lower hygroscopicity observed in our laboratory measurements has important implications for calculations of the radiative balance of the Earth. In addition, size-dependent chemical fractionation of several inorganic ions was observed relative to the artificial seawater with potentially important implications for the chemistry of the marine boundary layer.\nEach of these studies suggest that there is still much to be learned from rigorous experiments using inorganic seawater proxies.\nSalter et al., (2014), On the seawater temperature dependence of the sea spray aerosol generated by a continuous plunging jet.

            "abstract": "During the last several years, many studies have tried to reconstruct the paleoelevations of sedimentary basins and paleosol sequences using the mass-47 clumped isotope thermometer. Ideally, this technique directly preserves the temperature of carbonate formation, avoiding any speculation on the composition of surface or water from which the carbonate precipitated. Recently, however, concerns about post-depositional alteration of the mass-47 isotope signature, due to the effects of burial, O and C volume diffusion, and/or diagenetic alteration have arisen, potentially complicating the application of the clumped thermometer for determining paleo-surface conditions.\nHere we investigate the effect of burial depth on mass-47 bond reordering. To this purpose we collected samples, from the surface and from drill cores, in two different areas of the Greater Green River basin: the Washakie Basin near Rock Springs, Wyoming and Green River basin near Pinedale, Wyoming. Both basins are filled with a thick Eocene lacustrine series that include numerous limestone beds. The thermal histories of the basins are well documented from petroleum prospecting studies. The Δ47 composition of lacustrine limestones with peak burial depths ranging from 1 to 6 km have been measured and compared to values derived from temperature history reordering models (THRMs). These results show that the THRMs does not predict the observed clumped isotope composition, suggesting than parameters other than temperature are controlling the Δ47 reordering. In order to refine the predictive model, we propose to independently model the best k0 factor of each analyzed sample starting from their final measured Δ47 values and implementing the thermal history from current depth to the period of deposition. Resulting k0 values are surprisingly well correlated with depth, suggesting that pressure and/or depth have a strong influence on the k0factor, and consequently on Δ47 bond reordering.\nThese results suggest that temperature may not be the sole factor controlling Δ47 reordering, and that other depth-dependent parameters, such as pressure or XCO2, especially in organic rich basins, could also influence the rate of solid-state Δ47 reordering and thus may need to be considered in alternate THRMs.",

            "abstract": "Carbon flux measurements using the eddy covariance method rely on several assumptions, including reasonably uniform terrain and homogenous vegetation. These are not always possible in complex terrain, structurally variable native vegetation or in disturbed ecosystems. Consequently, an increasing number of flux sites are located over not fully homogeneous areas. This implies that observed year-to-year variations in CO2 budgets may not always be related only to changes in the key driving factors such as weather, canopy state and physiology, but may also be affected by differences in the flux footprints between years. This may bias budget estimates over many locations, since a large number of flux sites are affected by wind channelling, contrasting climatic conditions with wind direction (e.g. maritime sites) and by variations of continental-scale climate patterns that modify prevailing wind directions. We tested the effects of a non-homogeneous footprint on annual carbon estimates for an evergreen forest, where the combination of terrain, weather and anthropogenic management shaped the local forest structure. Interactions among these factors caused the key drivers regulating carbon fluxes (such as LAI, temperature, VPD and turbulence) to vary significantly with wind direction, and their combinations resulted in pronounced carbon sequestration ‘hotspots’ that impacted instantaneous fluxes. These were most distinctive during the summer months, and they varied in extent and magnitude depending on prevailing weather. Consequently, interannual variations in footprints affected up to 18.9% of seasonal estimates during the summer months, and up to 23.1% of annual carbon budget estimates. The footprint-related bias was largest at 48.7% under ‘ideal’ uptake conditions (clear sky, mid-day during summer). We further present a procedure to recognise and quantify the apparent interannual variations in carbon estimates attributable to year-to-year variations in flux footprint.",

            "abstract": "Severe water shortages have been observed globally and the damage from climate change is predicted to increase consistently. Especially, groundwater which accounts for 95% of water resources that ecosystems rely on is very important. In order to protect the health of ecosystems from groundwater, research on climate change adaptation is necessary. This research aims at analyzing the effects of baseflow on Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems(GDEs) through Baseflow Index(BFI) utilizing run-off discharge according to the climate change. In order to analyze the effects on GDEs, Nakdong basin was selected for demonstration. So as to compute the baseflow in the basin, Soil and Water Assessment Tool(SWAT) was employed. This research compared and analyzed distribution of BFI over the past 30 years and expected BFI in connection with climate change. RCP 8.5 provided by IPCC was utilized and the result showed that changes of BFI in four periods, P1(1980-2009), F1(2010-2039), F2(2040-2069) and F3(2070-2099), varied according to weather conditions. So as to analyze the correlation between baseflow each period and GDEs, this research employed ecosystems health index and carried out correlation analysis according to each GDEs. Analysis showed that correlation between baseflow and Benthic Macro-invertebrate(BMI) was over R2 0.7 and correlation to the rest was low. This means BMI prove to be sensitive in BFI. The purpose of this research is to figure out the characteristics of baseflow about the impact of climate change and analyze the impact of baseflow on GDEs through the correlation analysis between baseflow and ecosystems health index. BMI has high correlation to baseflow and the rest do not. Generally, however, GDEs are hugely inter-related to water so that baseflow which accounts for over 40 percent cannot be excluded. Therefore, based on this research, management system on baseflow ought to be established with more endeavors to protect and preserve ecosystems.",

Studies suggest that in some environments a large fraction of missing reactivity, comparing calculated Rtotal with ambient total OH reactivity measurements (Di Carlo et al., 2004; Hofzumahaus et al., 2009).\nIn this study Rtotal has been measured using the Comparative Reactivity Method (Sinha et al., 2008). Levels of the reference compound (pyrrole, C4H5N) are monitored by gas chromatography every 2 minutes and Rtotal is derived from the difference of reactivity between zero and ambient air.\nRESULTS Around 36 hours of preliminary total OH reactivity data (30 May until 2 June 2015) are presented in Fig. 1. Its range matches previous studies for this site (Nölscher et al., 2012; Sinha et al., 2010) and is similar to values in another pine forest (Nakashima et al., 2014).

            "abstract": "We successfully give contribution in discriminating the 2013 North Korea underground nuclear test from natural earthquakes by using analysis of ratio of seismic energy and seismic moment (Ɵ) and analysis of the rupture duration. We used the waveform data of the shallow seismic event which occurred in the region of North Korea mainland and vicinity in last decade. We conclude that this earthquake was a shallow seismic event with explosion characteristics and can be discriminated from a natural or tectonic earthquake. The 2013 North Korea test earthquake had 2.817822 x 1019 N.m of the seismic moment and 7.652314 x 1014 N.m of radiated seismic energy and -4.56 of the Ɵ value. The equivalent Ɵ value with the two previous nuclear events and differences with natural earthquakes was considered as an implication of the explosion event. The rupture duration value of this event was 11.13 s. The very low value of the rupture duration from the three nuclear tests event shows us the characteristic of the explosion. We also give contribution in determining the high precision location of the 2013 nuclear test earthquake using relocation algorithm of Modified Joint Hypocenter Determination (MJHD) and double difference using IMS CTBTO, BMKG, regional and global seismic stations respectively. We also compared the relative location results with absolute location method of Simulated Annealing (SA). Results of the all relocation method in this study show the locations with distance less than 7 km from the Punggye-ri nuclear test facility. A result was compared with the relocation results by all possible combination of seismic phase data and stations and by previous researchers and analyzed using topographic data satellite imagery. We proposed that the northwest of the Punggye-ri facility (named “A” location) in coordinate 129.04 E and 41.29 N with elevation around 2050-2150 meter is the high possibility location of the 2013 North Korea underground nuclear test.",

            "abstract": "Assessing the sensitivity of the surface mass balance of glaciers to climate variables is crucial in order to build numerical models and simulate accurately their future evolution. In this study, a large set of surface mass balance measurements made on four French alpine glaciers with distinctive features, over more than 20 years is used to investigate accumulation and ablation sensitivities. Results show that the temporal variability of accumulation is fairly well explained by the temporal variability of precipitation, with the spatial patterns of accumulation well reproduced from one year to another. Statistical analyses of the elevation, slope, curvature, Topographic Position Index (TPI), distance to a steep slope and to the next ridge are performed and show thatonly altitude plays a significant role on the spatial distribution of snow accumulation. Also, temporal variability of snow and ice ablation is mainly driven by temperature and the spatial variability of summer surface mass balance is largely explained by solar radiation. Based on these sensitivities, a simplified energy balance model issuggested and compared to other melt models. Models show a similar level of performance, but this performance is highly variable between glaciers. Two decades-long simulations using the simplified model proposed here and assuming a temporally stable temperature relationship show steady empirical parameters, thereby suggesting that a set of parameters calibrated over a short period of time can be used for long term melt modeling. We additionally tested the consistency of parameters between glaciers of the French Alps. The results of applying a set of parameters computed using data measurements over one glacier, to another, suggest a good transferability, with only a small decrease in the model performances.",

            "abstract": "Asian dust is often transported over a long range from the deserts in East Asia to the North Pacific region. The long range transport of the dust has a relationship with the vertical distribution of the dust in the source regions. If the dust reached to the free troposphere, it can be transported over a long range by the westerlies. Therefore, we have conducted a ceilometer observation since May 2013 in the Gobi Desert, which is one of the source regions. On 22-23 May 2013, a dust event occurred in the Gobi Desert as a result of strong wind caused by a developing low pressure system and a cold front. A dust layer was observed near the ground surface by the ceilometer. The maximum top height of the dust layer was 1.8 km above the ground level (AGL). After the cold front passed, a cold air mass advanced, and the dust layer disappeared. The maximum top height of the cold air mass was 1.8 km AGL. The vertical structure of the cold air mass is similar to that of gravity currents. Some dust was transported from the dust layer to the free troposphere by a warm air ascending along the surface of the cold front. This transport is one of the mechanisms that transport dust from the atmospheric boundary layer to the free troposphere, which can cause the long range transport of the dust.",

The Wenchuan earthquake ruptured from epicenter at (31.01°N, 103.42°E) largely northeastward while the Lushan earthquake ruptured from epicenter at (30.3°N, 103.0°E) largely southwestward. The region between the two earthquakes recorded very few aftershocks and cataloged seismicity before and after the two big earthquakes compared to neighboring segments. As one small segment of the 500KM long Longmen Shan fault system, its absence of seismicity draws hot debate on whether a big one is still in brewing or steady creeping is the mechanism to release strain energy. The dense array is deployed in a 70Km by 40km region primarily aimed to detect events that are much smaller than cataloged events and then further to determine if the segment is experiencing constantly creeping. The preliminary findings include: (1) source mechanisms show that the seismic gap appears to be a transition zone between north and south segment. The events to the south are primarily thrust-type while events to its north have more or less striking-slip components. This is also the case for both Lushan earthquake to south and Wenchuan earthquake to north; (2) the event depths show two tilted planes with one dipping to south and another dipping to north with the seismic gap in between. This may indicate a dome or an anticline structure being associated with the seismic gap; (3) tomography indicates the velocity down to 20KM of the gap is relatively smaller than its surrounding regions. More data should be collected and further examinations should be conducted before we can make a sounding conclusion on what mechanism is in control of the seismicity in this region.\nThis project is primarily suppoerted by the State Key Laboratory of Geohazards Prevention and Geoenviroment Protection (run by Chengdu University of Technology)\nThis project is also partially supported by China NSF Grant No. 41374058 and 41340009.",

Experiments are carried out at full scale (0.85 m wave height, 4 s period) in the CIEM wave flume above a mobile sand bed (d10, d50, d90 = 0.15 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.37 mm). Vertical profiles of co-located, two component (u, w) velocity and particle concentration are measured in the bottom boundary layer (BBL) using a multi-frequency acoustic concentration velocity profiler (ACVP) at several locations along the beach. The intra-wave free stream velocity measurements are provided as input to three dimensional Euler-Lagrange point-particle simulations of the BBL. Using a series of feedback controllers, the simulation forcing is adjusted to match the measured orbital velocity and turbulent intensities at an elevation of z~8 cm above the bed. The simulations treat sand grains both in the bed and in suspension as Lagrangian particles that respond to hydrodynamic and inter-particle forces. Particles are coupled to the near-bed hydrodynamics through the volume filtered Navier Stokes equations, which are solved in a finite volume LES framework at near particle scale. Several wave cycles are simulated in order to make direct comparisons of the mean and turbulent statistics with the measurements and to explore the near-bed particle response to wave breaking. Statistics of the space-time dependent grain-size distribution, a natural output of the particle-based simulations, are fed back into the acoustic calibration of the ACVP, improving the instrument's response to grain size sorting induced by the near bed flow. This cross validation and calibration of measurement and simulation allows for detailed interrogation of near-bed transport processes with minimal empirical assumptions relating to bed shear, particle pickup, or surface wave breaking.",

            "abstract": "The collision of India with Asia continues to uplift the highest mountain range in the world. The April 25th 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake, largest recent thrust event in the range, ruptured the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), which dips gently northwards beneath central Nepal and forms the boundary between the Indian and Eurasian plates. Although the geology of the range has been studied for decades, fundamental aspects of its deep structure remain disputed. Here we develop a 3D, geologically informed, model of the MHT that is consistent with seismic observations from the Gorkha earthquake. The model is based on the existence of two deep ramps on the MHT that link segments of décollement, one to produce the Gorkha-Pokhara anticlinorium and the other to explain the deeper rocks exposed by the Main Boundary Thrust compared to the Main Frontal Thrust. Comparing our model to a joint slip inversion based on GPS, InSAR and seismic data from the earthquake shows that the slip patch matches closely with an oval-shaped, gently dipping fault surface bounded on all sides by steeper ramps. The Gorkha earthquake rupture seems to have been limited by the geometry of that fault segment. This is a significant step forward in understanding the deep geometry of the MHT, and suggests that subsurface geometry may play a key role in limiting earthquake ruptures. Such an approach can be extended along strike to identify other slip patches consistent with historical earthquake magnitudes, and could be used in conjunction with dynamic modeling to assess the likelihood of single or multiple-segment events. Our result emphasizes the importance of adequately constraining subsurface fault geometry in mega-thrust or subduction zones, in order to better assess the sizes and locations of future earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Stable isotope paleoaltimetry exploits systematic changes in the oxygen or hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation that occur when lifting of moist air masses over topography induces orographic precipitation. Stable isotope-based reconstructions of topography, therefore, have greatly expanded what used to be very sparse global paleoaltimetric information. The topography of mountain ranges and plateaus, however, not only reflects the geodynamic processes that shape the Earth’s surface; it also represents a key control for continental moisture transport, atmospheric circulation and the distribution of biomes and biodiversity. The challenge now lies in disentangling the surface uplift component from the impact of long-term climate change on paleoaltimetry records. The robustness of stable isotope paleoaltimetry reconstructions can be greatly enhanced when high-elevation isotope proxy data are referenced against low-elevation records that track climate-modulated oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation through time. In addition, evaluating the record of precipitation upstream of the orogen reduces commonly encountered complexities such as topographic threshold conditions to atmospheric circulation, variable moisture recharge to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration over the continents or the impact of hemispheric-scale atmospheric teleconnections; all of which may conspire in setting the isotopic composition of precipitation.\nHere, we highlight some of these challenges a) by using stable isotope paleoaltimetry data from the central Andes to show how differences in oxygen isotopes in precipitation between high and low elevation sites may enhance the robustness of Andean stable isotope paleoaltimetry, and b) by linking a large set of spatially distributed isotope and biological proxy data to evaluate the impact of Palaeogene surface uplift on mammalian evolution in western North America prior and during the Eocene-Oligocene transition.",

Tungsten deposits are typically magmatic-hydrothermal systems. Despite the economic significance of tungsten, there are no modern quantitative analytical studies of the fluids responsible for the formation of its highest-grade deposit type (tungsten vein deposits). Panasqueira (Portugal) is a tungsten vein deposit, one of the leading tungsten producers in Europe and one of the best geologically characterized tungsten vein deposits.\nIn this study, compositions of the mineralizing fluids at Panasqueira have been determined through combination of detailed petrography, microthermometric measurements and LA-ICPMS analyses, and geochemical modeling has been used to determine the processes that lead to tungsten mineralization. We characterized the fluids related to the various mineralizing stages in the system: the oxide stage (tin and tungsten mineralization), the sulfide stage (chalcopyrite and sphalerite mineralization) and the carbonate stage. Thus, our results provide information on the properties of fluids related with specific paragenetic stages. Furthermore we used those fluid compositions in combination with host rock mineralogy and chemistry to evaluate which are the controlling factors in the mineralizing process.\nThis study provides the first quantitative analytical data on fluid composition for tungsten vein deposits and evaluates the controlling mineralization processes helping to determine the mechanisms of formation of the Panasqueira tin-tungsten deposit and providing additional geochemical constraints on the local distribution of mineralization.",

            "abstract": "The 58-51 Ma interval was characterized by an increase of global temperatures (+4 to +6°C) up to the Early Eocene Climate Optimum (EECO, 52.9-50.7 Ma), the warmest interval of the Cenozoic. It was recently suggested that sustained high atmospheric pCO2, controlling warm early Cenozoic climate, may have been released during Neo-Tethys closure through the subduction of large amounts of pelagic carbonates and their recycling as CO2 at arc volcanoes. To analyze the impact of Neo-Tethys closure on early Cenozoic warming, we have modeled the volume of subducted sediments and the amount of CO2 emitted along the northern Tethys margin. The impact of calculated CO2 fluxes on early Cenozoic climate have then been tested using a climate carbon cycle model (GEOCLIM). We show that CO2 production may have reached up to 1.55x1018 mol/Ma specifically during the EECO, ~4 to 37% higher that the modern global volcanic CO2 output, owing to a dramatic India-Asia plate convergence increase. The subduction of thick Greater Indian continental margin carbonate sediments at ~55-50 Ma may also have led to additional CO2 production of 3.35x1018 mol/Ma during the EECO, making a total of 85% of the global volcanic CO2 outgassed. However, climate modelling demonstrates that timing of maximum CO2 release only partially fit with the EECO, and that corresponding maximum pCO2 values (750 ppm) and surface warming (+2°C) do not reach values inferred from geochemical proxies, a result consistent with conclusions arise from modelling based on other published CO2 fluxes. These results demonstrate that CO2 derived from decarbonation of Neo-Tethyan lithosphere may have possibly contributed to, but certainly cannot account alone for early Cenozoic warming, including the EECO. Other commonly cited sources of excess CO2 such as enhanced igneous province volcanism also appear to be up to one order of magnitude below fluxes required by the model to fit with proxy data of pCO2 and temperature at that time.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty in estimating the carbon loss from thawing ice-rich permafrost is attributed, in part, to the abrupt changes in ecosystem structure and function after thaw. In a thawing peat plateau in the discontinuous permafrost zone (Stordalen, Mire, Sweden; ST), we tested for the occurrence of abrupt changes in hydrology and the effects of these changes on the water table and vegetation feedback. Using a chronosequence approach along three transects that capture several transitional thaw stages, we found abrupt hydrological changes following thaw, wherein adjacent areas (1 m apart) had unrelated water table depth (WTD) fluctuations. Despite these abrupt changes, surprisingly, the same Gaussian model of plant abundance explained by WTD could be applied to data from both ST and an undisturbed ombrotrophic peatland (Mer Bleue Bog, Canada; MB). However, the Gaussian model fit was better at MB than at ST. Furthermore, explanatory power of the model at ST decreased with increasing permafrost thaw. While water table and vegetation feedback in a thawing landscape is similar to that of a peatland without transitional land cover types, the vegetation and carbon feedback is complicated by non-linear shifts in the partitioning of gaseous effluxes between CO2 and CH4. These results will be presented along with key implications for modeling carbon loss from thawing landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Unified real estate registration system shows the attention, determination and effort to of CPC Central Committee and State Council on real estate registration in China. However, under current situation, China's real estate registration work made less progress. One of the reasons is that it’s hard to express the property right of real estate on one map under the multi-sector management system. Under current multi-sector management system in China, different departments usually just survey and mapping the land type under its jurisdiction. For example, wetland investigation only mapping all kinds of wetland resources but not mapping other resource types. As a result, it cause he problem of coincidence or leak in integration of different results from different departments. As resources of the earth's surface, the total area of forest, grassland, wetland and so on should be equal to the total area of the earth's surface area. However, under the current system, the area of all kinds of resources is not equal to the sum of the earth's surface. Therefore, it is of great importance to express all the resources on one map. On one hand, this is conducive to find out the real area and distribution of resources and avoid the problem of coincidence or leak in integration; On the other hand, it is helpful to study the dynamic change of different resources. Therefore, we first proposed the \"integrated mapping\" as a solution, and take integrated land use with swamp mapping in Northeast China as an example to investigate the feasibility and difficulty. Study showed that: integrated land use with swamp mapping can be achieved through combining land use survey standards with swamps survey standards and \"second mapping\" program. Based on the experience of integrated land use with swamp mapping, we point out its reference function on integrated mapping and unified real estate registration system. We concluded that: (1) Comprehending and integrating different survey standard of different resources is the premise of \"integrated mapping\", (2) We put forward “multiple code” and “multiple interpretation” scheme in order to solve the problem of “attribute overlap”, (3) The area of “attribute overlap” can be segmented by a certain ratio to determine the property right in unified real estate registration.",

            "abstract": "Since 2001, the number of M>3 earthquakes increased significantly in Central and Eastern United States (CEUS), likely due to waste-water injection, also known as “induced earthquakes” [Ellsworth, 2013]. Because induced earthquakes are driven by short-term external forcing and hence may behave like earthquake swarms, which are not well characterized by branching point-process models, such as the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model [Ogata, 1988]. In this study we focus on the 02/15/2014 M4.1 South Carolina and the 06/16/2014 M4.3 Oklahoma earthquakes, which likely represent intraplate tectonic and induced events, respectively. For the South Carolina event, only one M3.0 aftershock is identified by the ANSS catalog, which may be caused by a lack of low-magnitude events in this catalog. We apply a recently developed matched filter technique to detect earthquakes from 02/08/2014 to 02/22/2014 around the epicentral region. 15 seismic stations (both permanent and temporary USArray networks) within 100 km of the mainshock are used for detection. The mainshock and aftershock are used as templates for the initial detection. Newly detected events are employed as new templates, and the same detection procedure repeats until no new event can be added. Overall we have identified more than 10 events, including one foreshock occurred ~11 min before the M4.1 mainshock. However, the numbers of aftershocks are still much less than predicted with the modified Bath’s law. For the Oklahoma event, we use 1270 events from the ANSS catalog and 182 events from a relocated catalog as templates to scan through continuous recordings 3 days before to 7 days after the mainshock. 12 seismic stations within the vicinity of the mainshock are included in the study. After obtaining more complete catalogs for both sequences, we plan to compare the statistical parameters (e.g., b, a, K, and p values) between the two sequences, as well as their spatial-temporal migration pattern, which may shed light on the underlying physics of tectonic and induced earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "It has been well documented that the diurnal maximum of convection and precipitation is observed during the morning hours (AM) over the ocean, whereas the maximum is during the afternoon hours (PM) over land. However, the difference between AM and PM precipitation in the coastal/adjacent seas over the Maritime Continent (MC) is 2-3 times larger than anywhere else in the tropics. Most large mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) during the local active phases of the MJO are over water of the MC. This makes the convective signals of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) much larger over the water than over the islands when the MJO moves through the MC. In this study, we examine the diurnal cycle of formation, propagation, and dissipation of MCSs by tracking cloud clusters in time and space using hourly satellite IR data and 3-hourly TRMM data. It is found that the large AM precipitation over the adjacent seas is a result of the propagating MCSs from the islands to the sea during the night, which are forced by the enhanced land breeze from the high mountains of the islands in the MC. MCSs can also initiate over the seas during the diurnal maximum of SST in the afternoon and continue to grow into the night and maximize during the early morning. The diurnal cycle of convection is modulated by the MJO. The two factors together may explain the large diurnal amplitude over the adjacent seas of the MC than that of the open ocean. The complex interactions of the convection, local and large-scale circulation, and the unique land-sea geography of the MC are further investigated using a high-resolution, coupled atmosphere-ocean model. The result indicates that the diurnal cycle of SST is affected by the tidal mixing in the ocean, which may be an important factor contributing to the air-sea interaction on the diurnal and MJO time scales.",

            "abstract": "A scientific drilling expedition was conducted at an active hydrothermal field on the Iheya-North Knoll by D/V Chikyu in 2014 (Expedition 907) as a part of “Next-generation Technology for Ocean Resources Survey” of the Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program. During the expedition logging while drilling (LWD) was deployed to constrain the area of the fluid reservoir beneath seafloor followed by three coring holes down to 150 meter below the seafloor (mbsf). The LWD system is composed of arcVISION for resistivity and natural gamma ray measurement and TeleScope for real-time transmission of drilling parameters and arcVISION data. Five sites (C9011-15) at the Iheya-North Original Site and one site (C9016) at Aki Site were drilled with LWD. At C9012 and C9016, the arcVISION detected temperature anomaly up to 84℃ at 234 mbsf and up to 39℃ at 80 mbsf, respectively. The temperature quickly increases at that depth and it would reflect the existence of high-temperature heat source along borehole. Due to the continuous fluid circulation during drilling, the measured temperature does not indicate in-situ temperature, but it reflects the heat disturbed by the cold circulated water instead. High quality resistivity and natural gamma ray data were acquired at six sites. The log curves at Site C9016 show characteristic response; the natural gamma ray log exhibits extremely high radiation (>500 gAPI) at 7-13 and 23-31 mbsf (Zone A). In the underlying interval of 31-40 mbsf, the resistivity log exhibits extremely low value (<0.2 ohm-m) (Zone B). Then the resistivity log exhibits higher value (~10 ohm-m) and the natural gamma ray log shows very low radiation (<50 gAPI) at the interval of 41-48 mbsf (Zone C). The log characteristics in Zone A, B, and C can be interpreted as a series of K-rich alteration zone, sulfide zone, and low-K hard (silicified) sediments, respectively. The LWD-based lithological interpretation was confirmed by the following core description. Zones A and B can be correlated to altered clay zone and sulfide zone including sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and pyrite. Our results show that LWD is a powerful tool for the identification and characterization of submarine hydrothermal deposits and LWD survey enhances the successful recovery of sulfide samples.",

            "abstract": "Approximately one third of Earth’s land surface is subjected to arid conditions, and aridland soils have the potential for significant feedbacks to global climate change drivers, such as anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. This study examined wetting-induced pulses of N2O and NOx along a nitrogen deposition gradient in the Colorado Desert of southern California. Measurements were made before and following water (to simulate a 2 cm rain event) and nitrogen plus water additions (30 kg NH4NO3 ha-1) at 15 minutes, 12 hours and 24 hours post-wetting. We found nitrogenous fluxes that were substantially higher than expected. N2O fluxes, in particular were remarkably high reaching up to 200 ng N2O-N m-2 s-1, similar to agriculture levels and in the range of peat bog emissions. There was a clear transition between N2O emissions, which peaked 15 minutes after wetting, and NOx emissions, which peaked at the 12 hour timepoint. NOx emissions were also considerable, reaching as high as 350 ng NOx-N m-2 s-1. Both N2O and NOx fluxes responded strongly to water additions, demonstrating a clear wetting-induced pulse response. While N2O was not affected by nitrogen additions, NOx fluxes demonstrated a significant increase with nitrogen plus water over water alone (p=0.016). These results suggest that gaseous nitrogen export, particularly N2O emissions, is a greater form of nitrogen loss in arid systems than is currently assumed. This potential for high nitrogen emissions and the capacity for anthropogenic nitrogen deposition to increase these emissions present serious implications for local air quality and significant soil feedbacks to climate change.",

            "abstract": "The formation of oceans at the Earth’s surface and hence the origin of life can be directly linked to the fate of water after planetary formation, but how much water is now confined in the upper mantle remains elusive. Current estimates of water in olivine from geochemistry are between 200 and 3600 H/106 Si. Here, we exploit the water-sensitive rheology of olivine to estimate the water content in the Wharton Basin asthenosphere in the Indian Ocean. We explore the role of water stratification in the upper mantle and the transient behavior of olivine flow in the context of postseismic deformation following the 2012 Mw 8.6 Wharton Basin earthquake using geodetic data from the Sumatra GPS network. We build a model that incorporates afterslip in the brittle upper mantle and viscous flow in the asthenosphere. We introduce a formulation of the transient rheology of olivine in the form of a flow law coupled to a state evolution that characterizes the internal stress of the mineral before steady-state. We find that the Wharton Basin asthenosphere contains about 1000 H/106 Si, representing 10% of water saturation of olivine at 100 km depth. If these results can be extrapolated to other depths, this indicates an equivalent of about 0.7 ocean mass is now present in the Earth’s upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "The elastic properties of ice are of interest in understanding (the\nevolution of) sea ice, glaciers and ice sheets, in general. Such data\nare crucial if we are to use elastic (ultrasonic to seismic) data to\nconstrain the internal structure and fabric of ice bodies and their\nenvironmental conditions. Fabric (crystallographic preferred\norientation) and temperature are two key factors that control the\nrheology of ice sheets. Fabric and temperature data at depth are\nlimited to the very small number of ice drill holes in Antarctica and\nGreenland, mostly at ice divides. Thus, there is a need to develop our\nunderstanding of elastic properties and wave propagation in ice to\nextract better ice information from seismic data sets.\nResonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) is used to measure the resonant\nmodes of samples, from which we can invert for the full elastic\ntensor, and estimate the attenuation quality factor. Compared to more\ntraditional time-of-flight ultrasound measurements, there a few\nobvious advantages. First, RUS is typically done at an order of\nmagnitude lower in frequency, which brings it closer to seismic\nfrequencies. This is important when attempting to map out the\ndispersive nature of these elastic properties. Second, it is often far\nfrom trivial to pick the shear wave arrivals in ultrasound in\nheterogeneous media. RUS does not rely on this distinction\nbetween primary and shear wave.\nAfter having developed and applied RUS successfully to rock\nsamples, an extension of RUS to ice cores in the Physical Acoustics\nLaboraty shows great promise. For example, we successfully inverted\nfor the isotropic parameters (bulk and shear modulus) of crystalline\nman-made ice, and estimated the attenuation quality factor Q. By\ncontrolling the freezer settings in the set-up, we were able to\nmonitor changes in these properties as a function of temperature. The\nresultant data are consistent with published results from other\napproaches in the laboratory and the field.\nRUS is sufficiently fast and portable that it could be applied in\nremote field sites (in Antarctica for example), negating the need to\nsend large sample volumes back to the laboratory. Application in the\nfield is particularly important for complex systems like sea ice,\nwhere the physical properties are likely to change as a function of\ntime and temperature.",

            "abstract": "Current climate models do not take into account the role of open water surfaces on the global water cycle. In spite of the small area coverage of rivers and floodplains, the impact of these water surfaces to various hydrologic processes should not be overlooked. Therefore, in this study, we focused on implementing river inundation processes from the state-of-the-art river model, CaMa-Flood, into the climate model, MIROC5. The two models were coupled using Multi-Program Multi-Data(MPMD), thereby enabling independent runs and reduced computational time. In the coupled model, the surface area of rivers and daily variation of floodplain areas were considered as a fraction of the land surface in each grid.\nThe implementation of these increased water surfaces resulted in large changes in variables such as latent heat flux, precipitation and temperature. Particularly, precipitation and latent heat flux tend to have a positive correlation with water surfaces, while surface air temperature had a negative correlation. The surface air temperature showed a decrease in high latitudinal areas during the summer months of June to August when floodplains increase, thereby weakening a common known bias of high temperature in atmospheric models. The results from this study suggest the necessity of appropriate consideration of open surface waters in a climate model and the need for a more detailed high-resolution analysis of the impacts mentioned above.",

However, EC measurement representing an integrated flux over its footprint area which is non-match with model grid or remote sensing pixel. Quantifying the uncertainties associated with gridded flux estimates by upscaling single EC tower NEP measurement to pixel scale is an important but not full investigated issue due to data availability. Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) Multi-Scale Observation Experiment on Evapotranspiration (MUSOEXE) built a flux observation matrix that include 17 EC towers within 5 km × 5 km area, provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate this uncertainty.\nThis study evaluated the spatial representativeness and uncertainty of EC measurement for upscaling to field scale combine footprint model, VPRM model and remote sensing data. Results shows that the large spatial variability of GPP, Re, and NEP is existing within test field (cropland landscape) during the growing season from 10 June to 14 September 2012. These variability increase with the increase of GPP and NEP. The systematic underestimations of single EC tower may exceed 100%, 40%, and 300% and the overestimations may exceed 35%, 30%, and 70% in extreme cases for GPP, Re, and NEP, respectively. This illustrate the risk of single tower EC measurement be used to validate remote sensing NEP product at global scale by direct comparison. This systematic bias is dominated by the different of vegetation structural component between two scales for NEP and lead to a systematic bias to estimate field mean NEP by impact the VPRM parameters. A simple linear model was proposed to reduce the representation error of single EC tower that combined the vegetation structure information. The corrected EC based NEP measurement then be used to constraint VPRM parameters to estimate the field mean NEP. The availability is validated by compare with reference value estimated using a linear unmixing model proposed in this study.",

Detailed study of the temperature profiles indicates that such an increase is closely related to the existence of Sq current focus, because it becomes more significant when the measurement is made near the center of Sq focus. In order to understand a general feature of this unusual phenomena occurring in the Sq current focus, the sounding rocket experiment was conducted in Uchinoura of Japan.\nIn this experiment, we launched “S-310-37” rocket equipped with a total of eight science instruments at 11:20 JST on January 16, 2007 after being convinced that the Sq current was approaching to the planned rocket trajectory. The geomagnetic activity had been successively quiet on that day so that we can estimate the position of Sq current focus.\nOur analysis of the obtained data indicates that the electron temperature was certainly increased by about 500-600 K at the altitude of 97-101 km with respect to the background. Strong electron density perturbation was also observed to exist above 97 km altitude, which corresponds to the lower boundary of the high electron temperatures. It is also noticeable that both the electric field and magnetic field data include unusual variation in the same altitude region as the temperature increase was observed, suggesting a possible connection between the thermal electron heating and variation of the electric and/or magnetic field.\nThus, the first experiment in 2007 revealed a general feature of such unusual phenomena in the Sq current focus, and thereby our interest to the generation mechanism for increasing the electron temperature was more and more increased. We will conduct the second rocket experiment to investigate such unusual phenomena in the Sq current focus in January 2016. In this experiment, we will try to measure plasma wave from 300 Hz to 22 MHz to discuss the existence of plasma instability. Accurate measurement of the electric and magnetic fields as well as electron temperature and density, energy distribution of thermal electrons will be also made. We try to elucidate causes and consequences of such mysterious phenomena existing in the Sq current focus.",

Temporal variation at each altitude exhibited increasing trend as observed globally (Figure). Seasonal variation at Yakutsk in East Siberia showed expected summer minimum, as seen at remote sites in northern mid to high latitudes, although no clear seasonality was observed at West Siberian sites (Surgut and Novosibirsk). Large CH4 emissions from West Siberian Lowlands (WSL) might compensate CH4 loss by reaction with OH radical during summer. The vertical gradient in CH4 concentration was larger in Surgut and Novosibirsk than in Yakutsk, which suggests a strong CH4 emission from WSL as well. However, the vertical gradient at Surgut was obviously decreasing; the annual mean difference between 5.5 km and 1.0 km decreased from 62-76 ppb during 1994-1996 to 33-49 ppb during 2012-2014. Chemical transport model reproduced this decrease tendency and suggested that global CH4 emissions have increased, but the contribution from WSL and Europe have decreased in this decade.\nFigure.

            "abstract": "At fast spreading mid-ocean ridges, the heat released by an axial magma chamber (AMC) is the main driver of hydrothermal circulation at the ridge axis. Seismic studies at the East Pacific Rise show that the AMC is continuous along-axis and has relatively small depth variations. In contrast, slow spreading ridges have short-lived, discontinuous melt lenses and a much sparser abundance of axial hydrothermal fields. These observations point at a strong link between the abundance of on-axis hydrothermal fields and the spatial and temporal variations of magmatic energy input.\nTo better understand the interplay of magmatic and hydrothermal processes we developed 2D and 3D numerical models that simultaneously solve for crustal accretion processes and hydrothermal convection. Our models cover the oceanic crust from depths below the AMC to the seafloor. The “magmatic\" model part simulates the processes within the AMC such as convection of the viscous melt, crystallization and the associated release of latent heat. The “hydrothermal\" model part is restricted to the permeable regions of the crust at temperatures below the brittle-ductile transition at ~700 ºC. Here we assume Darcy flow of a super-critical single-phase fluid and account for the thermodynamic properties of water. Boundary conditions allow for free venting of hydrothermal plumes at the top of the model domain. Magmatic and hydrothermal parts are coupled by the crustal temperature field, leading to two dynamic convective systems that are connected by a relatively thin, impermeable conductive boundary layer between ~700 ºC and 1000 ºC.\nFirst results indicate that the balance between the rate of energy input from magmatic processes and the rate of heat removal by hydrothermal flow controls the along-ridge depth of the AMC. Hydrothermal upflow and associated venting preferentially forms above “highs” of the AMC roof. Recharge flow surrounds these hot thermal plumes, because the thermodynamic properties of water (i.e. its fluxibility) make these warm regions more efficient for recharge flow than colder parts of the crust. Above local depressions of the AMC roof we observe less vigorous hydrothermal flow, so that along-ridge variations in AMC depth could be linked to locations of hydrothermal vent sites.",

            "abstract": "As a tsunami scientist, I’ve been frequently asked where the tsunami will/did come from? The conventional answer to this question is based on the understanding of trench and bathymetry distributions. Sometimes, for a precise answer, a series of scenario studies have to be performed in priori. Even hundreds of scenarios are created and studied, however, potential tsunami sources could be neglected unintentionally.. For this, I’ve created a new algorithm to efficiently locate the possible tsunami sources, which is called Impact Intensity Analysis (IIA). Briefly speaking, this algorithm scans the entire computational domain and find out the distribution of maximum wave height of each unit source. After that, the result presents a clear view of potential tsunami energy transport pattern. For example, the result of IIA shows that the southern east of Taiwan is under the threat of tsunamis sourcing from the northern segment of Yap Trench; and so is the northern segment of Manila Trench. A clear energy path can be seen, linking Taiwan and the Yap Trench. The result matches the scenario study of potential Yap tsunami very well (Figure 1). This indicates that once the tsunami source is located in the energy path, with a proper wave direction, the tsunami energy can be transported to the study site with relatively less energy loss. Therefore, this algorithm can help us analyze the potential tsunami source systematically; and more importantly, get rid of the impossible source candidates quickly.\nIn this paper, we present the detailed validation of this algorithm, including the directionality and the effect of on and off the energy path. At the end, we employ this algorithm to analyze the potential tsunami source of 1867 Keelung tsunami event. The result shows that this event was possibly caused by a submarine landslide generated tsunami and the landslide occurred in the north-east offshore Taiwan.\nFigure 1. The Impact Intensity Analysis (IIA) of the south-east Taiwan (left), and the distribution of the maximum wave height of the potential Yap tsunami (right). The result of IIA shows a clear energy path between Taiwan and Yap Trench, and the Yap tsunami projects the tsunami energy to Taiwan right in this path.",

            "abstract": "Water is essential to electricity generation. Power plant cooling water is responsible for 40-50% of total freshwater withdrawals in Europe (Rübbelke et al., 2011) and the United States (Kenny et al., 2009). In accordance with growing demands for electricity generation, water demands could be increased. There is concern that the water demands for electricity generation could compete with other major water users. Additionally, many countries are required reviewing energy policies to mitigate climate change. Thermal power replaced low carbon power like renewable energy, nuclear power, Carbon Capture and Storage as a mitigation technology. However, influences of such climate change mitigation technologies on water demands are still uncertain. In this study, we calculated freshwater demands for electricity generation by using the data set of future electricity generation in the twenty-first century which estimated by the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model, and assessed the overall effects of electricity generation on water demands under the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways and the Representative Concentration Pathways which were adopted by IPCC AR5. Water demands for electricity generation depends on cooling types, such as once-through cooling and recirculating cooling. We also took into account cooling system pathways. The result might be useful for deciding energy policies which aim for reduction of water demands, especially in regions experiencing water scarcity.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic eruptions produce many ecological disturbances that structure vegetation. While lichens are sensitive to disturbances, little is known about their responses to volcanic disturbances, except for colonization of lava. We examined lichen community responses through time to different disturbances produced by the May 1, 2008 eruption of Volcan Chaiten in south-central Chile. Pre-eruption vegetation near the volcano was old-growth Valdivian temperate rainforest dominated by closed-canopy Nothofagus sp... In 2012, we installed thirteen 1-acre plots across volcanic disturbance zones on which a time-constrained search was done for all macrolichen species, each of which was assigned an approximate log10 categorical abundance. We also installed a 0.2 m2 quadrat on two representative trees per plot for repeat photography of lichen cover. We remeasured at least one plot per disturbance zone in 2014 and re-photographed tree quadrats in 2013 and 2014. We then analyzed species composition and abundance differences among disturbance zones. In 2012, the blast (pyroclastic density flow), scorch (standing scorched forest at the edge of the blast) and deep tephra (>10 cm) zones had the lowest lichen species richness (5-13 species), followed by reference (unimpacted) and shallow (<10 cm) tephra (17-20 species). Gravel rain (preexisting rock ejected by eruption initiation), gravel rain + pumice and flooded forests (fluvially reworked volcanic material entrained by heavy rains) were species-rich (25-42 species). In 2014, the blast and deep tephra had regained 2-3 times the number of lichen species since 2012 while the light tephra and reference were essentially unchanged. Gravel rain, gravel rain + pumice and flooded forest plots all had about the same number of species in 2014 as 2012. Lichen colonization and growth in tree quadrats varied widely, from very little colonization in the blast to prolific colonization in the gravel rain + pumice zone. Lichen’s varied responses to different volcanic disturbances were attributable to varying degrees of mortality and subsequent availability of substrate, quantity of light and removal of competitors. While sensitive to disturbance, lichens are apparently resilient to and can quickly recolonize after a variety of large, violent volcanic disturbances.",

            "abstract": "In the mid-1990s the \"hotspotting\" technique was developed to assess the internal consistency of Pacific absolute plate motions (APM) models derived from hotspot trails, with the assumption that mantle plumes were fixed. Being a variant of the Hough transform, hotspotting maps a dated location (1-D geometry) on the seafloor to a flow line (2-D geometry). The accumulation of intersections of these flow lines reveals the optimal location of a fixed hotspot, assuming that the plate motion model is correct. It is the optimal exploratory technique for a planet with moving rigid plates over a set of fixed hotspots. However, it seems increasingly unlikely that we live on such a planet. Avoiding hotspots altogether we introduce \"ridge-spotting\", another promising technique for a planet with moving rigid plates and fixed ridges. Alas, we may not be living on that planet either. Yet, ridges are expected to undergo slow changes (ridge jumps notwithstanding), but that does not necessarily imply that an optimal APM model should minimize the ridge migration speed. In particular, ridges between stationary continental plates and fast-moving oceanic plates will move relatively fast, and an APM model should be expected to reflect this motion. In contrast, ridges that have been \"pinned\" by large mantle upwellings for considerable periods of time might be expected to favor APM models that minimize ridge migration. Given the long-lived super-plume mantle upwelling in the Equatorial Pacific it seems possible that the East-Pacific Rise may be a candidate for the second scenario, while the Pacific-Antarctic ridge, pushing the Pacific away from a near-stationary Antarctic continent, may be a candidate for the former. We present the ridge-spotting method and test published Pacific APM models using seafloor formed at the two ridges. Preliminary results indicate that ridge-spotting identifies problematic APM models because they imply unreasonable ridge migration. Fixed hotspot APM models, but also recently published moving hotspot models suffer from similar shortcomings by predicting unreasonable rotations for the Farallon-Pacific ridge during the Emperor stage. In contrast, a model based on predicting APM velocities from geodynamic modeling of ridge push and slab pull provides a much more reasonable ridge migration history.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic magnetizations of selected natural samples (sediments and volcanic rocks) were measured in time domain as well as in frequency domain. The time domain measurements were performed in pulse fields with variable lengths (10 μs to 10 ms) and amplitudes (0.5 mT to 0.7 T). To measure hysteresis parameters for small loops, one cycle of positive and negative pulses with different rate of field variation were generated. In the frequency domain, low-field magnetic susceptibility was measured over the frequency rage (1 kHz to 500 kHz) corresponding to the pulse lengths in the time domain measurements. Results in the time domain were characterized by the transient magnetization–field curves that were broadly comparable to the corresponding portions of the hysteresis loops measured by a quasi-static method using a VSM. The dynamic coercivity that is defined as the intersect with the abscissa in the negative regime increased as the pulse length reduced and the pulse peak increased. In strong pulse fields (> 0.5 T), irrespective of the kinds of samples, the magnetization remained at the end of a pulse and decayed exponentially within a few ms, suggesting rapid magnetic relaxations. In weak pulse fields, no such relaxation was observed except for the sediments rich in superparamagnetic (SP) particles. These field dependencies suggest that the relaxations in the strong fields could be due to the dynamics of the domain walls in the MD particles, while those of the sediments in weak fields may be ascribed to the relaxation of the SP particles. Results in the frequency domain were obtained in terms of the frequency spectrum of the real and imaginary components of complex susceptibility. Comparisons and interpretations of the data in these different domains were made in terms of the distribution of relaxation times. Discussions on the numerical conversion and transformation of these data as well as their rock magnetic applications will be provided.",

            "abstract": "From the 1940s through the early 1990s, liquid wastes from materials used and produced at the Hanford Site were disposed to the ground through cribs, ditches, ponds, and trenches. Primary groundwater and vadose zone contaminants include carbon tetrachloride, uranium, nitrate, chromium, 129I, 99Tc, and tritium.\nIodine-129 is of environmental concern due to its long half-life, mobility, and hazardous potential to humans through bioaccumulation, and is one of the primary risk drivers for the Hanford site. The 200 West area of the Hanford Site contains two separate plumes covering 1,500 acres where 129I concentrations are ~3.5 pCi/L in Hanford groundwater. Speciation analysis shows that iodate comprises 70.6% of the iodine present, and organo-iodide and iodide comprise 25.8% and 3.6% respectively. While hydraulic containment is the currently selected remedy for 129I in the groundwater, there is currently no remedy selected for controlling migration of 129I from the vadose zone to the groundwater. Research is currently underway to develop a site conceptual model for understanding the biogeochemical drivers for iodine speciation and determine the processes that drive the fate and transport of 129I through the vadose zone and into groundwater. These data will provide the information to decrease the uncertainty related to the inventory, distribution, and transport properties which will lead to appropriate treatment strategies for the 129I plume(s). \nUnderstanding the mechanisms and contributors to iodine speciation is important in order to develop bioremediation strategies for contaminated areas. The effect that microbial communities and humic acid have on iodine speciation and sorption was explored using Ringold sediment from the 200 West Area exposed to varying levels of 129I contamination in conjunction with varying growth media constituents. Several isolates obtained from these batch studies have been shown to reduce over 80% of iodate present in growth media when nitrate was present. No iodate reduction was observed in the absence of nitrate. Additionally, several isolates have been identified that can oxidize iodide. Currently, analytical techniques are underway to quantify the effect of microbial interaction on iodine speciation along with characterization of these diverse microbial isolates.",

            "abstract": "Climate change impact assessment studies associated with water resources and its management, presently, rely on a great extent on statistical downscaling techniques, to undertake fine resolution hydrologic modelling over a region. Though, recent literature is flooded with many new downscaling methodologies with varying complexities, the inefficiency of these downscaling techniques in accurately capturing the regional extremes, limits the employment of these downscaling techniques in any impact studies in water resources. It merely increases the monstrosity of uncertainty by adding one more factor: downscaling uncertainty. While chaotic nature of climate systems and existence of attractors are irrefutable, the knowledge on system dynamics is not incorporated in the statistical downscaling methodologies so far. A few questions rise from this context: (1) How possibly can we incorporate the information about system dynamics in statistical downscaling techniques? (2) Will it help in accurately simulating the characteristics of actual system, in statistical terms? (3) If so, will such as approach be able to capture the extremes better?. The present study attempts to address the above questions by adopting a phase space reconstruction approach, which reproduces the attractor of the system and inherent dynamics. The dominant variables to replicate the system dynamics are selected as surface air temperature, specific humidity, precipitable water, long wave radiation, and vertical velocity, in addition to rainfall, which is the variable to be downscaled. A multi-variate phase space reconstruction approach, taking into account the relevance and information contained in one variable, is adopted, to estimate the dimension of system and reconstruct the attractor. The downscaling of future rainfall is done by applying a local prediction approach, enforcing the known information of future dominant variables and employing classification and regression trees (CART). The present methodology is expected to simulate accurately the variations in downscaled rainfall.",

However, the question what physical process can impose such an electric field deep inside the strong magnetosphere still remains. The long-term monitoring of the Io plasma torus is a key observation to answer this question. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrometer EXCEED onboard the Hisaki satellite observed the Io plasma torus continuously during the two periods: from December 2013 to March 2014 and from November 2014 to May 2015. We found clear responses of the dawn-dusk asymmetry to rapid increases of the solar wind dynamic pressure. We statistically analyzed the relations between solar wind and IPT response. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of Io’s volcanic activity, detected by Hisaki in January 2015, on the solar wind response of Jovian inner magnetosphere.

This requires a standardized installation method able to provide good noise level performance at a reasonable cost, especially for the 60 percent of stations that we expect to be settled in open environments.\nDuring the last two years we tested various types of sensor’s hosting infrastructures with a strong focus on recently released posthole sensors that can be deployed at the bottom of shallow boreholes. Tests were performed at 3 different sites (two GEOSCOPE stations and a dedicated open-field prototype site) with geological conditions spanning from hard rocks to very soft soils. On each site, posthole sensors were deployed at different depths, from the surface to a maximum of 20m deep, and in different types of casing. Moreover, a reference sensor, either installed in a tunnel, a cellar or a seismic vault, has been operated continuously.\nWe present a comprehensive comparison of the seismic noise level measured in the different hosting infrastructures and for several frequency bands corresponding to various sources of noise. At high and low frequencies, seismic noise level in some boreholes equals or outperforms the one obtained for the reference sensors. Between 0.005 and 0.05Hz, we observe a strong decrease of seismic noise level on the horizontal components in the deepest boreholes compared to near surface installations. This improvement can reach up to 30dB and is mostly due to a reduction in tilt noise induced by wind or local pressure variations. However, the absolute noise level that can be achieved clearly depends on the local geology.\nAll these tests, together with estimated installation costs, point toward the deployment of sensors in shallow boreholes at the future French broadband stations located in open environments.",

            "abstract": "Marine mammals are common sentinel species for studying marine pollution, however their potential role as vectors of contaminants to local ecosystems has rarely been addressed. Organic methylmercury, or MeHg, is a potent neurotoxin that biomagnifies approximately one to ten million-fold in aquatic carnivores such as the Northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), whose excreta and molted pelage, in turn, constitute a source of environmental MeHg contamination at the base of marine food chains. This recycling of MeHg was evidenced by comparing total mercury (HgT) and MeHg concentrations in seawater at the Año Nuevo State Reserve pinniped rookery to those of neighboring coastal sites in Central California. The observed 17-fold enrichment of MeHg in seawater at Año Nuevo during the M. angustirostris molting season (0.28—9.5 pM) was remarkable, and exceeded the range of surface water MeHg concentrations observed in the highly urbanized San Francisco Bay estuary (<0.05—2.3 pM). The importance of MeHg inputs to Año Nuevo waters from Northern elephant seals was confirmed by the HgT concentrations in molted pelage samples (average = 3.6 µg g-1 dry wt.), which presumably contained >80% MeHg. This equates to an annual per-capita emission factor of 0.05 g MeHg per adult elephant seal. Based on this estimate, we calculate that approximately 0.2 kg of organic Hg entered the nearshore environment of Año Nuevo during that molting season. This elevated methylmercury (MeHg) in seawater adjacent to the rookery may become bioavailable to lower trophic levels, demonstrating that marine mammal colonization can substantially influence nearshore mercury cycling and potentially threaten ecosystem health.",

            "abstract": "Food security in Sahelian countries strongly relies on the ability of markets to transfer staples\nfrom surplus to deficit areas. Market failures, leading to the inefficient geographical allocation of food,\nare expected to emerge from high transportation costs and information asymmetries that are common\nin moderately developed countries. As a result, important price differentials are observed between\nproducing and consuming areas which damages both poor producers and food insecure consumers. It\nis then vital for policy makers to understand how the prices of agricultural commodities are formed by\naccounting for the existing market imperfections in addition to local demand and supply considerations.\nTo address this issue, we have gathered an unique and diversified set of data for Senegal and\nintegrated it in a spatially explicit model that simulates the functioning of agricultural markets, that is\nfully consistent with the economic theory. Our departure point is a local demand and supply model\naround each market having its catchment areas determined by the road network. We estimate the local\nsupply of agricultural commodities from satellite imagery while the demand is assumed to be a function\nof the population living in the area. From this point on, profitable transactions between areas with low\nprices to areas with high prices are simulated for different levels of per kilometer transportation cost\nand information flows (derived from call details records i.e. mobile phone data). The simulated prices are then compared\nwith the actual millet prices.\nDespite the parsimony of the model that estimates only two parameters, i.e. the per kilometer\ntransportation cost and the information asymmetry resulting from low levels of mobile phone activity\nbetween markets, it impressively explains more than 80% of the price differentials observed in the 40\nmarkets included in the analysis. In one hand these results can be used in the assessment of the social\nwelfare impacts of the further development of both road and mobile phone networks in the country. On\nthe other hand, the model could be further developed as a precious tool for the prediction of future\nstaple prices in the country.",

            "abstract": "The North Pacific climate has undergone interdecadal regime shifts during the twentieth century, such as in the mid-1920s, the mid-1970s, and the late-1990s. These climate shifts are closely related to phase changes in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. A strong linkage between changes in the tropical Pacific SST and the Aleutian low is evident in the 1970s and 1990s climate shifts but has remained unclear in the 1920s due to limited in situ observations in the tropical Pacific. We revisit the tropical influence on the North Pacific climate shift in the 1920s by utilizing an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) and a series of new historical climate data sets that incorporate the updated data source of in situ observations not available in the conventional climate data sets. New SST data sets such as COBE-SST2 improve data coverage in the tropical Pacific during the early twentieth century compared with their previous versions. These new SST data sets exhibit a pronounced equatorial Pacific warming in the mid-1920s, consistent with observed weakening of the equatorial trade winds and the zonal SLP gradient between the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean. This feature cannot be captured in conventional SST data sets such as HadISST1 and COBE-SST1. An AGCM forced by the new SST data sets successfully simulate not only the weakening of the Walker circulation but also a significant deepening of the Aleutian low observed in the mid-1920s. TOGA experiments suggest that the SST warming in the tropical Pacific is key to strengthen the Aleutian low as observed in the mid-1970s regime shift.",

Understanding these connections are relevant to determining how best to conserve landscape scale water quality and storage functions that these wetlands provide. Since groundwater provides a physical and geochemical link between the wetland and the surrounding landscape, a basic unanswered question is how wetlands interact with adjacent (ground) waters. By understanding this interaction, and enumerating the relative role of the various controlling factors, we seek to upscale findings from individual wetlands to better assess interactions within and between wetland complexes and drainage features at the catchment scale. Such a perspective is relevant for understanding cumulative effects on downstream waters. We used a large scale distributed hydrological model to quantify groundwater-wetland interactions. Model results are compared to observation data of solute concentrations from wetland systems in North America and Canada, testing hypotheses regarding hydrological connectivity and local to regional trends in wetland geochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Risks and damage, caused by deformation of building and constructions in cryolithozone, are growing for decades. Worsening of cryo-ecological situation and loss of engineering-geocryological safety are induced by both technogenic influences on frozen basement and climate change. In such towns on permafrost as Vorkuta, Dixon more than 60% of objects are deformed, in Yakutsk, Igarka- nearly 40%, in Norilsk, Talnakh, Mirnij 35%, in old indigenous villages - approximately 100%; more than 80% ground dams with frozen cores are in poor condition. This situation is accompanied by activation of dangerous cryogenic processes. For example in growing seasonally-thaw layer is strengthening frost heave of pipeline foundation: only on Yamburg gas condensate field (Taz Peninsula) are damaged by frost heave and cut or completely replaced 3000 – 5000 foundations of gas pipelines. Intensity of negative effects strongly depends on regional geocryology, technogenic loads and climatic trends, and in Arctic we see a temperature rise – warming, which cause permafrost temperature rise and thaw).\nIn built areas heat loads are more diverse: cold foundations (under the buildings with ventilated cellars or near termosyphons) are close to warm areas with technogenic beddings (mainly sandy), that accumulate heat, close to underground collectors for communications, growing thaw zones around, close to storages of snows, etc. Note that towns create specific microclimate with higher air temperature. So towns are powerful technogenic (basically, thermal) presses, placed on permafrost; in cooperation with climate changes (air temperature rise, increase of precipitation) they cause permafrost degradation.\nThe analysis of dozens of urban thermal fields, formed in variable cryological and soil conditions, showed, that nearly 70% have warming trend, 20% - cooling and in 10% of cases the situation after construction is stable. Triggered by warming of climate changes of vegetation, depth and temperature of seasonally thaw layer, summer precipitation regime and other natural parameters in combination with developing technogenesis require new strategy of the cryolithozone development.",

            "abstract": "Anisotropy of anhysteretic remanence (AARM) provides a unique tool to quantify geological fabrics. In contrast to anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), it extracts information from the remanence carrying particles and is not prone to inverse fabrics. Compared to other remanence-based methods (like IRM or TRM), it does not alter the sample and allows one to focus on sub-populations by using partial ARMs. Additionally AARM experiments can be done on 99 samples per run with our fully automated SushiBar. However, a remanence is imparted through a sequence of reference directions and subsequently measured with a separate device, giving rise to potential alignment differences that mostly affect the off-axis components. Using vectorial measurements as delivered by common rock magnetometers is favorable to get the best estimate of the anisotropy tensor, but makes the result highly dependent on the exact knowledge of the reference directions. This can be overcome by using the projection of the remanence vector on the reference direction instead of the full vector in the calculation of the best-fit anisotropy tensor. Since AARM experiments are much more time consuming than AMS experiments, it is troublesome to compensate the loss in information with additional measurements. Therefore we propose how a projection method can be used to obtain an initial estimate of the original reference directions, which can then can be used to exploit the full vectorial calculations. We will show examples from simulations and measurements on rock specimens to demonstrate the effect and the improvements due to our new method.",

They remain a ‘Pandora’s box of petrological confusion’ with a variety of exotic, and potentially diamondiferous, rocks such as lamprophyre, lamproite, orangeite and kimberlite being continuously reported from them for over one century or more. Intra-plate volcanism of this type discloses hidden information about the interior of the Earth. Samples from two dykes intruding Raniganj coalfield is studied here. The samples from Dyke1 are characterized by fine grained texture and phlogopite+apatite+K-feldspar+rutile+ankerite+dolomite+ chromite+chlorite+quartz assemblage while the samples from Dyke2 are characterized by coarse grained texture and phlogopite+ pseudomorphosed-olivine+apatite+ clinopyroxene +dolomite+ankerite+calcite+norsethite+talc+rutile+quartz+Ca-Mg-Fe-Zr silicate+K-feldspar+monazite+ perovskite assemblage. Based on the TiO2-Al2O3-FeO trends observed in phlogopites, the dykes seem to be a lamproite-orangeite transitional variety. The phlogopites observed in Dyke2 show two stages of crystallization defined by Ti-poor overgrowths on Ti-rich cores indicating that Dyke2 consolidated from a melt that fractionated from a magma which was initially emplaced at a different depth while the Dyke 1 phlogopites do not show any such sudden drop in Ti concentration in their rims indicating single stage crystallization. Ti-in-Quartz Thermometry yields temperatures between 769°C to 1115°C for Dyke1 and 779°C to 1019°C for Dyke2 which must corresponds to the emplacement and crystallization of these dykes. Trace element and isotopic ratios can be used to constrain particular mantle source characteristics of the dykes. Rb-Sr method can be used to determine the emplacement ages of these dykes.",

However, the subsequent oceanic redox responses in the Cryogenian are poorly constrained. Here, we conducted an integrated Fe-S-C-Mo biogeochemical study on black shales of the Cryogenian Datangpo Formation (~660Ma, Nanhua Basin, South China). Iron speciation data indicate that these black shales were deposited under euxinic water conditions. Co-variation between Mo and TOC suggests an increasing isolation of the basin from open ocean during the deposition of the black shales. Correspondingly, the Datangpo black shales show higher δ98Mo values (+0.97‰ to +1.12‰) for the lower part (0-10m) and lower δ98Mo values (+0.44‰ to +0.53‰) for the upper part (10-20m) consistent with a global scale seawater δ98Mo recorded in the lower part but only a basin scale seawater δ98Mo recorded in the upper part. Accordingly, we estimate the seawater Mo isotope closed to +1.1‰ at ~660 Ma, which suggests substantial oceanic anoxia compared to modern oceans (+2.3‰). The seawater δ98Mo reconstructed by the Datangpo black shales is exactly the same to previously reported seawater δ98Mo at ~750 Ma and ~640 Ma, indicating a continuous oceanic anoxia throughout the Cryogenian although widespread oceanic oxygenation was suggested for the subsequent Ediacaran by multiple geochemical records. Thus, in light of previous studies, our findings indicate a delayed oceanic oxygenation relative to the onset of NOE, which may help to explain the first presence of metazoa in Cryogenian but rapid diversification occurred in Ediacaran.",

In order to effectively implement control measures to reduce O3 levels, it is necessary to understand the chemical processes that in part govern O3 concentration, and to disaggregate local chemical O3 production from transport. To address this issue, a major field campaign was organised at the Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory (WAO), a coastal site in the UK that is regularly within the pollution outflow from London and Western Europe. As part of this campaign, a novel approach to directly measure in situ the rate of local O3 production was employed along with a range of instrumentation to measure concentrations of different radical species as well as with detailed VOC and NOx speciation. We will present preliminary findings from a major O3 pollution event (~120 ppb) that occurred during the campaign as a case study for investigating the contributing factors influencing O3 formation at a NOx limited site. Direct measurements of local chemical O3 production rates are compared with those inferred from a range of indirect approaches.",

            "abstract": "The number of high-quality paleoseismic records on major strike-slip faults of California has increased in recent years to the point that patterns in earthquake recurrence are emerging. The degree of predictability in time intervals between ground-rupturing earthquakes can be measured by the CoV (coefficient of variation). The CoV approximately normalizes for mean recurrence, and is thus useful to isolate the temporal variability of earthquake records. CoV estimates are themselves uncertain because input dates are actually probability distributions and because paleoseismic records are short and not necessarily representative samples from the underlying recurrence distribution. Radiocarbon dating uncertainty can be incorporated by sampling from event PDFs and compiling sample CoV estimates. Uncertainty due to the brevity of the site event record is larger, and neglect of it can lead to improbable estimates.\nLong records are now available on the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults in Southern California, and the San Andreas and Hayward faults in northern California. These faults accommodate most of the Pacific-North American relative plate motion in their respective regions. CoV estimates from sites with 8 or more events cluster around 0.63, but are as low as 0.4 for the southern Hayward fault. Sites with fewer events give similar estimates, though with lower resolution. The one prominent outlier, Burro Flats, with a CoV near 1.0, is in a region of severe fault complexity and rapid fault-normal compression.\nQuasi-periodic recurrence is emerging as a general property for these plate boundary faults. Some individual site records allow that, at low probabilities, recurrence could be random in time. When the ensemble is considered together, however, it is improbable that we would see the observed degree of agreement among boundary fault paleoseismic records; the more likely explanation is that quasi-periodic recurrence is a real property of the boundary fault system.",

The plane acted as conduit for hydrothermal fluids at some time in the past. The chemical influence of fluids on mineralogical alteration and geomechanical processes in fault core samples from SAFOD (San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth) is visible in pronounced dissolution-precipitation processes (stylolites, solution seams) as well as in the formation of new phases. Detrital quartz and feldspar grains are partially dissolved and replaced by authigenic illite-smectite (I-S) mixed–layer clay minerals. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging of these grains reveals that the alteration processes and healing were initiated within pores and small intra-grain fissures. Newly formed phyllosilicates growing into open pore spaces likely reduced the fluid permeability. The mechanical influence of fluids is indicated by TEM observations, which document open pores that formed in-situ in the gouge material during or after deformation. Pores were possibly filled with formation water and/or hydrothermal fluids suggesting elevated fluid pressure preventing pore collapse. Fluid-driven healing of fractures in samples from SAFOD and the DGLab Gulf of Corinth project is visible in cementation. Cathodoluminescence microscopy (CL) reveals different generations of calcite veins. Differences in CL-colors suggest repeated infiltration of fluids with different chemical composition from varying sources (formation and meteoric water).",

            "abstract": "Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is a key component of water resources management in irrigation of farmlands as it determines the crop water consumption. Numerous methods have been used to estimate ETc for scheduling irrigation and evaluating the soil water balance. However, there is a significant difference in ETc estimates from various models, which leads to a large uncertainty in the soil water balance, crop water consumption, and irrigation scheduling. In this study, several commonly-used ETc equations (Turc, Priestley-Taylor, Hargreaves-Samani, Penman-Monteith) are compared with the variational data assimilation approach (VDA) of Bateni et al. (2013). The ETc equations initially estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ETo), which is the evapotranspiration from a healthy and actively-transpiring grass field with ample water in the soil. Thereafter, ETc is calculated by multiplying ETo by the crop coefficient (Kc), which accounts for the crop type and soil water stress. To properly apply the Kc to non-standard conditions, a daily water balance estimation for the root zone is required, which is done by two soil water budget models (Cropwat, Hydrus-1D) that compute incoming and outgoing water flows in the soil profile. In contrast to these methods that estimate ETc in two steps, the VDA approach directly predicts ETc by assimilating sequences of land surface temperature into the heat diffusion equation and thus it is expected to provide more accurate ETc estimates.\nAll approaches are applied over three cropland sites namely, Bondville, Fermi, and Mead in the summer of 2006 and 2007. These sites are part of the AmeriFlux network and provide a wide variety of hydrological conditions. The results show that the variational data assimilation approach performs better compared to other equations.",

            "abstract": "Cassini has been orbiting Saturn for over eleven years now. During this epoch, the ring shadow has moved from covering much of the northern hemisphere (the solar inclination was 24 degrees) to covering a large swath south of the equator and it continues to move southward. At Saturn Orbit Insertion in 2004, the projection of the A-ring onto Saturn reached as far as 40N along the central meridian (52N at the terminator). At its maximum extent, the ring shadow can reach as far as 48N/S (58N/S at the terminator). The net effect is that the intensity of both ultraviolet and visible sunlight penetrating through the rings to any particular latitude will vary depending on both Saturn’s axis relative to the Sun and the optical thickness of each ring system. In essence, the rings act like semi-transparent venetian blinds.\nOur previous work examined the variation of the solar flux as a function of solar inclination, i.e. for each 7.25-year season at Saturn. Here, we report on the impact of the oscillating ring shadow on the photolysis and production rates of hydrocarbons (acetylene, ethane, propane, and benzene) and phosphine in Saturn’s stratosphere and upper troposphere. The impact of these production and loss rates on the abundance of long-lived photochemical products leading to haze formation are explored. Similarly, we assess their impact on phosphine abundance, a disequilibrium species whose presence in the upper troposphere can be used as a tracer of convective processes in the deeper atmosphere.\nWe will also present our ongoing analysis of Cassini’s CIRS, UVIS, and VIMS datasets that provide an estimate of the evolving haze content of the northern hemisphere and we will begin to assess the implications for dynamical mixing. In particular, we will examine how the now famous hexagonal jet stream acts like a barrier to transport, isolating Saturn’s north polar region from outside transport of photochemically-generated molecules and haze.\nThe research described in this paper was carried out in part at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

            "abstract": "Fractured porous media are notoriously challenging to model but of significant importance for many subsurface applications. In the common modelling approach A fractured geological formation is represented through distinct flow domains, the mobile fractures and the immobile matrix that provides additional storage for the fracture. The rate at which fluids exchange between the domains is represented by a transfer function. For imbibition during two-phase incompressible immiscible flow a simple first-order rate law can be formulated based on the saturation difference between the domains. While this is mathematically convenient it fails to capture the onset of imbibition at early times that is observed in simulations and experiments. Here we present an improved approach that captures the early time behaviour accurately by using semi-analytical self-similarity solutions for capillary driven flow. We also use this concept to predict the transitions from early to late-time-behaviour and construct a new hybrid transfer function. High resolution numerical simulations as well as experimental data are used to validate the results for different wetting and non-wetting phases viscosities and rock types that span a wide range of capillary diffusion coefficient for applications ranging from CO2 storage to oil recovery and beyond.",

            "abstract": "Of the 7200 km long very slow-spreading (14 mm/yr) Southwest Indian ridge (SWIR), which forms the plate boundary between Africa and the Antarctic, the easternmost portion represents an endmember of the global mid-ocean ridge system in terms of low melt supply. It is characterized by 30 to 70 km-wide corridors of nearly amagmatic spreading, separating domains of focused volcanic activity. Our study concerns one of these amagmatic corridors. Volcanic features that typically characterize other ridge systems are scarce and the seafloor is mostly made of exhumed mantle-derived sepentinized periodotites. Long-offset detachment faults are proposed to be responsible for exhumation, and provide the context for serpentinization. In this poster presentation, we use seismic constraints to discuss the kilometer-scale characteristics of the geophysical crust formed at the melt-poor divgergent plate boundaries. To supply these constraints, we use seismic data acquired during the recent Sismosmooth cruise (2014; E64o20' to E65o). We show seismic reflection results from three 2D coincident across-axis lines, and two 2D axis-parallel lines processed in a self-similar manner and merged to improve the information content. From these, we show evidence for the expression of the active detachment fault responsible for mantle exhumation. This fault can be followed to ~ 7.7 km at depth. To give an insight to the nature of the subsurface, we examine tomography results from wide-angle seismic refraction data, which suggests a thin geophysical crust. This is similar to models of geophysical crust proposed from gravity studies in the study area.",

            "abstract": "Barmer Basin of Rajasthan, Western India is a hydrocarbon rich sedimentary basin currently being explored by Cairn India Limited. The hydrocarbon bearing Fatehgarh Formation is being found at different depths in different oil fields (e.g. From south to north: Guda, Vijaya & Vandana, Air field High) of the basin. The net uplift and erosion in the Barmer Basin has been quantified using compaction methodology. The sonic log, which is strongly controlled by porosity, is an appropriate indicator of compaction, and hence used for quantification of net uplift and erosion from compaction. The compaction methodology has been applied to the shale rich Dharvi Dungar Formation of Barmer Basin of Late Paleocene age. The net uplift and erosion is also being checked with the help of AFTA-VR and seismic sections. The results show relatively no uplift in the southernmost part of the basin and a Guda field well is thus taken to be the reference well with respect to which the uplifts in different parts of the basin have been calculated. The northern part of the basin i.e. Air Field High wells experienced maximum uplift (~2150m). Interestingly, a few wells further south of the reference well show evidence for uplift. The study was able to point out errors in the report produced with the help of AFTA-VR which found out less uplift in Vijaya & Vandana oil fields as opposed to sonic log data. The process of finding out uplift using sonic log has a standard deviation of 200m as compared to about 500m error in AFTA-VR method. This study has major implications for hydrocarbon exploration. Maturation of source rock will be higher for any given geothermal history if net uplift and erosion is incorporated in maturation modeling. They can also be used for porosity predictions of reservoir units in undrilled targets.",

This is concerning, given that future sea level rise is strongly dependent on the GrIS’s response to Arctic change. The scientific community is currently torn between a model of a dynamic GrIS that becomes greatly reduced during interglacials and a model where the GrIS is relatively stable, even through interglacials that were warmer than today.\nWe review the paleo-stability of the GrIS and discuss the implications for GrIS predictions. Based on new cosmogenic data from the bedrock core drilled underneath the GISP2 ice core, we present the case that Greenland might have been free of ice at least once during the Pleistocene, highlighting its vulnerability. An immediate climate driver for the GrIS collapse is not evident from the existing paleo-climate database, motivating re-intensified research of physical mechanisms to melt the GrIS. We discuss a few preliminary climate scenarios that might have contributed to this dramatic ice-sheet collapse.\nOn the shorter time-scale, we present tentative strategies how to investigate the stability of the GrIS during the Holocene Climate Optimum, a period of arguable-warmer-than today temperatures. Finally, we summarize the value of the paleo-data for predictions of the GrIS stability.",

            "abstract": "A key step in studies of seismic anisotropy in the mantle is often the creation of models designed to explain its physical origin. We previously released MSAT (the Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolbox), which includes a range of functions that can be used together to build these models and provide geological or geophysical insight given measurements of, for example, shear-wave splitting. Here we describe some of the new features of MSAT that will be included in a new release timed to coincide with the 2015 Fall Meeting.\nA critical step in testing models of the origin of seismic anisotropy is the determination of the misfit between shear-wave splitting parameters predicted from a model and measured from seismic observations. Is a model that correctly reproduces the delay time \"better\" than a model that correctly reproduces the fast polarization? We have introduced several new methods that use both parameters to calculate the misfit in a meaningful way and these can be used as part of an inversion scheme in order to find a model that best matches measured shear wave splitting. Our preferred approach involves the creation, \"splitting\", and \"unsplitting\" of a test wavelet. A measure of the misfit is then provided by the normalized second eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of particle motion for the two wavelets in a way similar to that used to find splitting parameters from data. This can be used as part of an inverse scheme to find a model that can reproduce a set of shear-wave splitting observations.\nA second challenge is the interpolation of elastic constants between two known points. Naive element-by-element interpolation can result in anomalous seismic velocities from the interpolated tensor. We introduce an interpolation technique involving both the orientation (defined in terms of the eigenvectors of the dilatational or Voigt stiffness tensor) and magnitude of the two end-member elastic tensors. This permits changes in symmetry between the end-members and removes anomalous intermediate velocity distributions.",

            "abstract": "With the primary objective of investigating the upper mantle anisotropy beneath central Anatolia-Turkey, we have performed shear wave splitting analysis and calculated the fast polarization directions and time-delays benefiting from teleseismic earthquakes recorded by a dense temporary seismic network consisting of 65 broadband sensors that were deployed in early May 2013 and operated for two years as a part of CD-CAT project (Continental Dynamics Central Anatolian Tectonics, funded by NSF with instruments supplied by PASSCAL depository). To further enhance the station coverage in the region, we also included data from 45 permanent broadband stations of Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute (KOERI). During the analysis, we have used the SplitLab software to determine splitting parameters of the records from only SKS and SKKS phases. Our initial results were derived from teleseismic earthquakes (with magnitudes greater than 5.8) that occurred within the time period from May-2013 to 2014. The average fast polarization directions obtained from stations located in the vicinity of the East Anatolia Fault Zone are well aligned with the fault trend indicating NE-SW orientations. Furthermore, we did not observe significant variations in the polarization directions and the delay times along the fault zone. Stations deployed in the vicinity of Central Anatolian fault zone exhibit N-S fast directions in good agreement with the fault trend. The average delay time for the whole study area is slightly higher than 1 second. Rapid spatial variations in splitting parameters are observed only in Adana region and the surrounding area. This probably suggests that the contribution of crustal anisotropy to mantle anisotropy is quite high. This observation is also consistent with the known tectonic structure of this region, which is presumably related to fabrics within deep crustal rocks preserving a record of deformation. This point should also need to be supported with further anisotropy studies. Furthermore, the anisotropy models can be used to infer the depth distribution of the inferred mantle strain. These observations will help confirm whether there is a strong coupling between deformation in theasthenosphere and lithosphere and whether this is helping to aid in the extrusion of the Anatolian plate.",

Seismic activity is a complex problem and its study needs different types of observation methods.\nTwo main problems of seismic activity study are: reliable instrumental observations and earthquake short-term predictions. In case of seismic risks it is necessary to have reliable accelerometer data. One of the most promising field in earthquake short-term prediction is very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic wave propagation in ionosphere observation.\nTo study Seismic activity of Caucasus region, was created observation complex using Accelerometer, Velocimeter and VLF electromagnetic waves received from communication stations (located in different area of the world) reflected from low ionosphere.

            "abstract": "Conjugate, or bimodal, fault patterns dominate the geological literature on shear failure. Based on Anderson’s (1905) application of the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, these patterns have been interpreted from all tectonic regimes, including normal, strike-slip and thrust (reverse) faulting. However, a fundamental limitation of the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion – and others that assume faults form parallel to the intermediate principal stress – is that only plane strain can result from slip on the conjugate faults. However, deformation in the Earth is widely accepted as being three-dimensional, with truly triaxial stresses and strains. Polymodal faulting, with three or more sets of faults forming and slipping simultaneously, can generate three-dimensional strains from truly triaxial stresses. Laboratory experiments and outcrop studies have verified the occurrence of the polymodal fault patterns in nature.\nThe connectivity of polymodal fault networks differs significantly from conjugate fault networks, and this presents challenges to our understanding of faulting and an opportunity to improve our understanding of seismic hazards and fluid flow. Polymodal fault patterns will, in general, have more connected nodes in 2D (and more branch lines in 3D) than comparable conjugate (bimodal) patterns. The anisotropy of permeability is therefore expected to be very different in rocks with polymodal fault patterns in comparison to conjugate fault patterns, and this has implications for the development of hydrocarbon reservoirs, the genesis of ore deposits and the management of aquifers. In this contribution, I assess the published evidence and models for polymodal faulting before presenting a novel kinematic model for general triaxial strain in the brittle field.",

            "abstract": "The Cenozoic-to-recent volcanoes on the border of China and North Korea are recognized as continental intraplate volcanoes. Despite of much work, the origin and mechanism of the volcanoes remain as an issue of debate, due to their complex and long-lived volcanic activities and lack of detailed information for the crust and upper mantle structures. In this work, ambient noise analysis is performed to image lithospheric structures beneath the volcanoes and surrounding regions using continuous broadband recordings of two temporary networks (1998-1999 PASSCAL array and a part of the 2009-2011 NECASSArray). To better constrain the entire depths of lithosphere in the estimated 3-D velocity structure, we utilize the spectral auto-correlation (SPAC) method and a Bayesian inversion technique to measure phase velocity dispersion data and to obtain shear-wave velocity structures, respectively. We developed a novel grid-search technique for more stable SPAC measurements, and obtained phase velocity data are compared and combined with group and phase velocity data from the conventional frequency-time analysis. Hierarchical and trans-dimensional techniques are implemented in the Bayesian method to estimate more rigorous models and associated uncertainties. The estimated 3-D model shows slower velocity (~0.3 km/s) at the bottom of lithosphere (>60 km) and less modified thick-crust beneath the volcanoes compared to other regions in the model. This suggests our model favors the theory of magma underplating, crustal assimilation, and less volume of magma supply from upper mantle.",

In order to make effective policy for air quality attainment, it is contingent upon a thorough understanding of chemical production/loss mechanism of air pollutants and their precursors which drive air quality such as nitrogen oxides (NOX), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and oxidants (e.g. OH, HO2, RO, RO2, etc.). At present, policy development is constrained by a lack of data for broad suite of chemical species which significantly affect on air quality.\nDuring 4 weeks between May and June 2013, the pre-campaign for the Korea and U.S. Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) study took place in multiplatform including fifteen ground sites, one mobile laboratory, and one small air crafts. An integrated research activity covering field observations, chemical transport models, and remote sensing has been intensively conducted. This study was focused on studying photochemistry and nighttime chemistry in urban area and transboundary transport of air pollutants from upwind.

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing results when internal pore pressure is increased above a critical value. As the fracture extends, the fluid flows to the crack tip. The fracturing process depends strongly on the physical properties of both the porous solid and the fluid (e.g. porosity and elastic moduli for the solid, viscosity and compressibility for the fluid). It is also affected by the in-situ stress and pore pressure conditions. Here, we focus on the effect of fluid properties on hydraulic fracturing under conventional triaxial loading. Cylinders of Solnhofen limestone (a fine-grained, low permeability rock) were prepared with a central borehole through which different pressurized fluids such as oil, water or argon, were introduced. Preliminary experiments were performed using a confining pressure of 5 MPa and axial stress of 7 MPa. Our goal was to monitor fracture extension using strain gauges, acoustic emissions (AE) recording and ultrasonic velocity measurements. We also tried to compare the data with analytical models of fracture propagation. Initial tests showed that simple bi-wing fractures form when the fracturing fluid is relatively incompressible. With argon as pore fluid, a complex fracture network was formed. We also observed that the breakdown pressure was higher with argon than with less compressible fluids. After fracturing occurred, we cycled fluid pressure for several times. During the first cycles, re-opening of the fracture was associated with additional propagation. In general, it took 4 cycles to inhibit further propagation. Analytical models suggest that initial fractures occurring with compressible fluids tend to stabilize. Hence, formation and extension of additional fractures may occur, leading to a more complex morphology. Conversely, fractures formed by incompressible fluids remain critically stressed as they extend, thus producing a simple bi-wing fracture. Using compressible fracturing fluids could be a suitable candidate for an efficient network of fracture.",

            "abstract": "The reliability of flood loss models is a prerequisite for their practical usefulness. Oftentimes, traditional uni-variate damage models as for instance depth-damage curves fail to reproduce the variability of observed flood damage. Innovative multi-variate probabilistic modelling approaches are promising to capture and quantify the uncertainty involved and thus to improve the basis for decision making.\nIn this study we compare the predictive capability of two probabilistic modelling approaches, namely Bagging Decision Trees and Bayesian Networks and traditional stage damage functions which are cast in a probabilistic framework. For model evaluation we use empirical damage data which are available from computer aided telephone interviews that were respectively compiled after the floods in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2013 in the Elbe and Danube catchments in Germany. We carry out a split sample test by sub-setting the damage records. One sub-set is used to derive the models and the remaining records are used to evaluate the predictive performance of the model. Further we stratify the sample according to catchments which allows studying model performance in a spatial transfer context. Flood damage estimation is carried out on the scale of the individual buildings in terms of relative damage. The predictive performance of the models is assessed in terms of systematic deviations (mean bias), precision (mean absolute error) as well as in terms of reliability which is represented by the proportion of the number of observations that fall within the 95-quantile and 5-quantile predictive interval.\nThe reliability of the probabilistic predictions within validation runs decreases only slightly and achieves a very good coverage of observations within the predictive interval. Probabilistic models provide quantitative information about prediction uncertainty which is crucial to assess the reliability of model predictions and improves the usefulness of model results.",

            "abstract": "Rising atmospheric CO2 may enhance forest productivity via CO2 fertilisation and increased soil moisture associated with water savings.  Quantification of the response of forest productivity to rising CO2 concentrations is important, as increased forest productivity may contribute to the mitigation of anthropogenic climate change. Vegetation greenness indices derived from digital photographs have been correlated with a number of measures of ecosystem productivity including total biomass, leaf area index and gross primary productivity. Our study examines the effect of elevated CO2 on patterns in overstorey and understorey vegetation greenness at a Free Air CO2 Enrichment facility (EucFACE) situated within a temperate eucalypt forest in Sydney, Australia. EucFACE consists of six treatment areas, three subjected to ambient CO2 (‘ambient’) and three with ambient plus 150 ppm CO2 (‘elevated’). Each treatment area had one camera monitoring canopy greenness for a 12 month period and four cameras monitoring one understorey vegetation plot (2.25 m2) each for a 15 month period. Vegetation greenness was measured daily using the green chromatic coordinate (GCC).\nUnderstorey and overstorey GCC and rates of understorey greening and browning were not affected by elevated CO2. Periodic differences in canopy greening and browning between CO2 treatments were observed, though these probably reflect an insect defoliation event in one treatment area. Increases in canopy and understorey GCC were associated with a combination of extended periods of high soil volumetric water content (VWC) (>0.1) and high maximum temperatures (>25 °C). Browning appeared to be associated with a combination of periods of high maximum temperatures and low VWC or low minimum temperatures. Our short term findings suggest that eucalypt forest productivity will be sensitive to changes in climate, but may be relatively insensitive to changes in CO2 in the near future.",

As an important climatic indicator, sea ice has also undergone dramatic changes. Due to the limitations of poor geographical conditions and a lack of in-situ observations, knowledge about Arctic sea ice has not been explored well for a long time, furthermore it is especial difficult to get a high quality of Arctic Sea ice thickness information.\nEquipped with a Ku-band SIRAL, CryoSat-2 has been launched in 2010 as an important European Space Agency Earth Explorer Opportunity mission. CryoSat-2 has the advantage of measuring the thickness of polar sea ice and monitoring changes in the ice sheets that blanket Greenland and Antarctica with high precision.\nIn this paper, the CryoSat-2/SIRAL radar altimeter data were used to retrieve the sea ice thickness in the Greenland Sea, Arctic, validated with the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation (ICESat) laser altimeter measurements from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Beaufort Gyre Experiment Program (BGEP) Upward Looking Sonar (ULS) measurements. Results show that the sea ice freeboard in Greenland Sea has a remarkable seasonal variation and presents an evident regional characteristics. As it show below, during the frozen season in autumn and winter the sea ice freeboard concentrated in around 0.23m , the average freeboard in Greenland Sea in June decreased to around 0.18m, the minimum freeboard 0.12m appeared in September. In the Western Greenland Sea near the Greenland and the Fram Strait with higher-latitude where multi-year ice occupy most has a larger freeboard around 0.3m in winter. In the south-eastern Greenland Sea with lower-latitude and shallow sea water, the freeboard composed by first-year ice concentrated in around 0.1m in winter. At the same time, the sea ice area also had seasonal variations, its maximum was in January and March, and minimum was in September.",

USA\n3 Remote Sensing Division, National Institute for Space Research, São José dos Campos, Brazil, 12227-010, Brazil\nRecent Amazonian droughts have drawn attention to the vulnerability of tropical forests to climate perturbations. Ground and satellite observations of 2005 and 2010 mega-droughts have shown an increase in fire occurrence and tree mortality during the period of drought. Here, we use a combination of satellite observations over a period of about 15 years to examine the legacy of the droughts in terms of impacts on the ecological structure and function of the forests in years following the droughts and the subsequent carbon exchange. Using data from microwave satellite sensors of rainfall, canopy backscatter (2000-2014) and GRACE and GOSAT, we show that the 2005 drought has a legacy of 2-5 years in western Amazonia, by increasing the disturbance in canopy trees and impacting the gross primary production of the forest significantly. Amazonian forests, particularly in the southern region were again impacted by the 2010 mega-drought, causing a legacy of 2-4 years with potential decrease in GPP and productivity observed by GOSAT fluorescence. The persistent of low canopy water content observed by a joint QSCAT and OceanSAT observations were linked to a delay in recharging of the hydrological system observed by GRACE over a period of 2-5 years. The results suggest that Amazonian forests with distinct dry seasons in southern and western regions of the basin are potentially more vulnerable to droughts compared to regions with less seasonality. The long recovery time from the 2005 and 2010 droughts suggests that the occurence of droughts in Amazonia at 5-10 year frequency may lead to long-term alteration of the forest structure and function.\nKeywords: Amazonia, drought, carbon exchange, biomass loss, GPP",

            "abstract": "The coarse spatial resolution of global hydrological models (typically > 0.25o) limits their ability to resolve key water balance processes for many river basins, especially when compared to locally-tunes river models. A possible solution to the problem may be to drive the coarse resolution models with high-resolution meteorological data as well as to assimilate ground-based and remotely-sensed observations. In this study, we investigated the impact that assimilating streamflow and satellite soil moisture observations have on hydrological model estimation, for the Murrumbidgee River in Australia.\nThe PCR-GLOBWB global hydrological model is forced with downscaled global climatological data (from 0.5o downscaled to 0.1o resolution) obtained from the WATCH Forcing Data and local high resolution gauging station based gridded datasets (0.05o). Downscaled satellite derived soil moisture (0.1oresolution) from AMSR-E and 23 discharge stations are assimilated using an ensemble Kalman filter.\nResults show that the assimilation of soil moisture observations results in the largest improvement of the model estimates. The joint assimilation of both streamflow and downscaled soil moisture observations leads to further improvement in streamflow simulations (20% decrease in RMSE).\nResults also show that the added contribution of data assimilation, for both soil moisture and streamflow, is more pronounced when the global meteorological data are used to force the models. This is caused by the higher uncertainty and coarser resolution of the global forcing.\nWe show that it is possible to improve hydrological simulations forced by coarse resolution meteorological data with downscaled satellite soil moisture and streamflow observations and bring them closer to a local hydrological model forced with local climatological data. These findings are important in light of the efforts that are currently done to go to global hyper-resolution modelling and high resolution soil moisture mapping.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies revealed atmospheric bridges between the tropical Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean. In particular, several recent works indicate that the Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) may contribute to the climate variability over the equatorial Pacific. Inspired by these studies, our work aims at investigating the impact of the tropical Atlantic on the entire tropical climate system, and uncovering the physical dynamics under these tropical teleconnections.\nWe first performed a ‘pacemaker’ simulation by restoring the satellite era tropical Atlantic SST changes in a fully coupled model – the CESM1. Results reveal that the Atlantic warming heats the Indo-Western Pacific and cools the Eastern Pacific, enhances the Walker circulation and drives the subsurface Pacific to a La Niña mode, contributing to 60-70% of the above tropical changes in the past 30 years. The same pan-tropical teleconnections have been validated by the statistics of observations and 106 CMIP5 control simulations.\nWe then used a hierarchy of atmospheric and oceanic models with different complexities, to single out the roles of atmospheric dynamics, atmosphere-ocean fluxes, and oceanic dynamics in these teleconnections. With these simulations we established a two-step mechanism as shown in the schematic figure: 1) Atlantic warming generates an atmospheric deep convection and induces easterly wind anomalies over the Indo-Western Pacific in the form of Kelvin waves, and westerly wind anomalies over the eastern equatorial Pacific as Rossby waves, in line with Gill’s solution. This circulation changes warms the Indo-Western Pacific and cools the Eastern Pacific with the wind-evaporation-SST effect, forming a temperature gradient over the Indo-Pacific basins. 2) The temperature gradient further generates a secondary atmospheric deep convection, which reinforces the easterly wind anomalies over the equatorial Pacific and enhances the Walker circulation, triggering the Pacific to a La Niña mode with Bjerknes ocean dynamical feedback.\nThis mechanism contributes to the understanding of the global decadal climate variability and predictability.

            "abstract": "For a rational quantification of past, current and future water availability, the feedback mechanisms among atmosphere, land surface and subsurface play a crucial role. Investigations of these feedback mechanisms require coupled atmospheric-hydrological modeling systems. Investigations of climate and land use changes on the regional water balance require model systems, which describe the feedback mechanisms between groundwater-, soil moisture dynamics and precipitation and which allow long-term simulations for climate-relevant scales. We have developed such a fully-coupled, meso-scale modeling system extending the atmospheric model WRF-ARW with the hydrological model HMS, which includes lateral water fluxes at the land surface and subsurface. In addition, two-way interaction between the saturated and the unsaturated zone is implemented by replacing the free drainage bottom boundary of the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) with two approaches, a Fixed-head boundary condition assuming an equilibrium soil moisture distribution or a Darcy-flux at the boundary assuming a quasi-steady-state moisture profile below the LSM. The computational demand of this coupled model system allows long-term simulations.\nThe first application of the fully-coupled modeling system is for the Poyang Lake basin (160,000 km²) in South China for the years 1979-1986. The performance of fully-coupled simulations requires first rational setups of WRF and HMS. For WRF, a double-nesting approach is applied covering East Asia at 30 km resolution and the Poyang Lake basin at 10 km using ERA Interim data as global forcing. HMS simulations are performed on the 10 km grid. Simulation results are validated against CRU, GPCC, APHRODITE, CPC, GLEAM and streamflow observations. The performance of stand-alone WRF, HMS and the fully coupled simulations are shown. Furthermore, the impact of groundwater coupling on soil moisture, evapotranspiration, temperature and precipitation is investigated. The potential of the fully coupled model system, which closes the regional water balance, to investigate hydro-meteorological flux responses at basin scale is presented.",

These field-aligned currents are seen to move poleward through the radar field of view and to affect the observed ionosphere. The upward FAC is responsible, at least in part, for the heating of the ionospheric electrons. It is less clear whether the downward FAC cools the ionosphere. We use the TRANSCAR model of the ionosphere to quantify the thermoelectric effect that comes into play.

            "abstract": "In order to create a safe and comfortable environment for students to learn, a lot of electricity, which is generated from coal fired power plants, is used. Therefore, ISF Academy, a school in Hong Kong with approximately 1,500 students, will be installing a rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system with 302 solar panels. Not only will these panels be used to power a classroom, they will also serve as an educational opportunity for students to learn about the importance of renewable energy technology and its uses.\nThere were four different options for the installation of the solar panels, and the final choice was made based on the loading capacity of the roof, considering the fact that overstressing the roof could prove to be a safety hazard. Moreover, due to consideration of the risk of typhoons in Hong Kong, the solar panel PV system will include concrete plinths as counterweights – but not so much that the roof would be severely overstressed.\nDuring and after the installation of the PV system, students involved would be able to do multiple calculations, such as determining the reduction of the school’s carbon footprint. This can allow students to learn about the impact renewable energy can have on the environment. Another project students can participate in includes measuring the efficiency of the solar panels and how much power can be produced per year, which in turn can help with calculate the amount of money saved per year and when we will achieve economic parity. In short, the installation of the roof mounted PV system will not only be able to help save money for the school but also provide learning opportunities for students studying at the ISF Academy.",

            "abstract": "Fault slip rates inferred from GPS-calibrated kinematic models may be influenced by seismic-cycle and other transient effects, whereas models that minimize strain energy (“TSEM models”) represent average deformation rates over geological timescales. To explore differences in southern California fault slip rates inferred from these two approaches, I have developed kinematic, finite-element models incorporating the UCERF3 block model-bounding fault geometry and slip rates from the UCERF3 report (Field et al., 2014). A fault segment (the “Ventura-Oak Ridge segment”) was added to represent shortening accommodated collectively by the San Cayetano, Ventura, Oak Ridge, Red Mountain and other faults in the Transverse Ranges. Fault slip rates are randomly sampled from ranges given in the UCERF3 report, assuming a “boxcar” distribution, and models are scored by their misfit to GPS site velocities or to their total strain energy, for cases with locked and unlocked faults. Both Monte Carlo and Independence Sampler MCMC methods are used to identify the best models of each category.\nAll four suites of models prefer low slip rates (i.e. less than about 5 mm/yr) on the Ventura-Oak Ridge fault system. For TSEM models, low rates (< 12 mm/yr) are strongly preferred for the San Gorgonio segment of the SAF. The GPS-constrained, locked model prefers a high slip rate for the Imperial Fault (over 30 mm/yr), though the TSEM models prefer slip rates lower than 30 mm/yr. When slip rates for the Ventura-Oak Ridge fault system are restricted to less than 5 mm/yr, GPS-constrained models show a preference for high slip rates on the southern San Jacinto and Palos Verde Faults ( > 13 and > 3 mm/yr, respectively), and a somewhat low rate for the Mojave segment of the SAF (25-34 mm/yr).\nBecause blind thrust faults of the Los Angeles Basin are not represented in the model, the inferred Ventura-Oak Ridge slip rate should be high, but the opposite is observed. GPS-calibrated models decisively prefer a lower slip rate along the Mojave segment of the SAF than TSEM models, consistent with viscoelastic velocity perturbations late in the SSAF seismic cycle. The low San Gorgonio SAF slip rates inferred from TSEM models are consistent with strain transfer from the SAF Coachella segment to the ECSZ, bypassing the San Gorgonio SAF segment (e.g., Wallace, 1984).",

However, main features of the inhomogeneity in fault zones are not yet sufficiently understood. It is considered to be effective to compare geophysical data of geophysical survey and/or downhole logging with physical properties, microstructures and mineral compositions of fault rocks in the fault zone. In this presentation, results of the comparisons are introduced in the case of two fault zones; Hatagawa and Atotsugawa fault, in north-east and central Japan, respectively, and factors affecting the inhomogeneity of fault structure are suggested.\nAnisotropic resistivity measurements in laboratory were compared with microscopic observations of fault rocks recovered from outcrops of Hatagawa fault. In the case of Atotsugawa fault, the anisotropic resistivity profiles by physical survey across the fault zones were compared with microscopic observations and mineral composition analysis of fault rocks provided by drilling into the fault zone. As a result, the anisotropic resistivity profiles are strongly related to foliation structure of fault rocks. It is suggested that fault slip at the earthquake and shear deformation during the earthquake recurrence time develope foliation fabrics of fault rocks, and that the resistivity profile becomes anisotropic progressively in the fault zone.",

Otherwise, parameters can work against each other to curve-fit the peak or volume alone. Many rainfall-runoff models used in practice have a time of concentration as a parameter. The widely used Clark unit hydrograph is such a model. The time of concentration in that and other similar models can be determined from streamflow records. In order to check on the time of concentration, you should look at the streamflow recession when rainfall is no longer recorded. Thus, no runoff potential is present and only the time of concentration is effective. Analysis of the streamflow records can put strict bounds on the estimate of the time of concentration and precludes 'optimizing' to unrealistic values. An example from Coyote Creek in California is used to illustrate the principle.",

            "abstract": "Existence of a partially molten layer at the lunar core-mantle boundary has been proposed to explain the lack of observed far-side deep moonquakes, the observation of reflected seismic phases from deep moonquakes, and the dissipation of tidal energy within the lunar interior [1,2]. However, subsequent models explored the possibility that dissipation due to elevated temperatures alone can explain the observed dissipation factor (Q) and tidal love numbers [3]. Using thermo-chemical and dynamic modeling (including models of the early lunar mantle convection), we explore the hypothesis that an ilmenite-rich layer forms below crustal anorthosite during lunar magma ocean crystallization and may sink to the base of the mantle to create a partial melt layer at the lunar core-mantle boundary. Self-consistent physical parameters (including gravity, pressure, density, VP and Vs) are forward calculated for a well-mixed mantle with uniform bulk composition versus a mantle with preserved mineralogical stratigraphy from lunar magma ocean crystallization. These parameters are compared against observed mass, moment of inertia, real and imaginary parts of the Love numbers, and seismic travel times to further limit the acceptable models for the Moon. We have performed a multi-step grid search with over twenty thousand forward calculations varying thicknesses of chemically/mineralogically distinct layers within the Moon to evaluate if a partially molten layer at the base of the lunar mantle is well-constrained by the observed data. Furthermore, dynamic mantle modeling was employed on the best-fit model versions to determine the survivability of a partially molten layer at the core-mantle boundary.

Using an enough number of travel times of elastic wave paths in a sample, we can estimate internal structure of the sample. However, the number of the elastic wave transducers is limited, and only the travel times of the first arrival are available in most experiments. Employing broadband transducers (Yoshimitsu et al., 2014, GRL), later phases become available to be analyzed.\nIn the present study, we conduct a triaxial compressive test at room temperature under a dry condition and a confining pressure of 50 MPa, using a cylindrical Westerly granite sample of 100 mm long by 50 mm in diameter. Eight transducers are attached on the sample surface. One of the transducers is used as a wave source and voltage steps are repeatedly applied to it. The elastic waves passing through the sample are sensed by the other broadband transducers, and recorded at a sampling rate of 20 Msps.\nP-wave speed is estimated from the travel time of the direct P, and Vp/Vs value is assumed to be the √3 to give S-wave speed. We assume that all wave paths never bend except at the top and bottom surface of the sample. We calculate the travel times of later phases reflected at the top and/or bottom surfaces within 3 times.\nWe collate the calculated travel times with observed waveforms. We can identify the travel time of two phases: single reflection from both top and bottom of the sample. On the other hand, some other observed and calculated phase arrivals do not match with each other. Then, we try to identify some remarkable phases using the calculated travel times of PS and SP converted waves and interfacial waves, taking into consideration of wave speed anisotropy.",

The recent expansion of permanent seismic networks in the Australasian region provides great opportunity to study Earth structure and a great variety of physical mechanisms responsible for earthquakes.\nOn one hand, a better understanding of the Australasian lithosphere, which is now available through tomographic images from full waveform modelling (Fichtner et al. 2010), provides a powerful tool to scrutinize the determination of earthquake source parameters. Even at relatively long periods (40-200s), the 3D effects of regional structure were shown to significantly alter the global centroid moment tensor solutions (Hingee et al. 2012). Thus, we can now explore other types of uncertainties and test the accuracy of global centroid moment tensor (GCMT) solution for the earthquakes in the Australasian region while checking for the systematic inconsistencies in the solutions. This has a significant bearing on tectonic interpretations. For example, azimuth and plunge of fault planes can be investigated in search for systematic biases.\nOn the other hand, the time has come to take a full advantage of the 3D Earth structural model and embrace ongoing advances in computational power and storage. We develop a semi-automated procedure to calculate the Centroid Moment Tensors in a 3D heterogeneous Earth. We utilize the reciprocity theorem to create Green's functions for point sources covering seismogenic zones of Australasia. We focus on improving the capacity of the method to fully complement the existing monitoring tools at Geosciences Australia. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of detailed velocity structure on Centroid location and double-couple percentages.\nMoreover Azimuth and Plunge of focal mechanisms in GCMT (Global CMT), were investigated in search for any systematic bias.\n",

            "abstract": "Historically, insufficient quantitative value has been derived from state groundwater monitoring networks. Water level data are occasionally used for calibrating local scale groundwater models and for graphical analysis, but very rarely are they used to identify regional groundwater processes and quantify changes in groundwater dynamics over time. Potentiometric maps have occasionally been derived to assist understanding of regional processes but generally they are derived for one point in time, often simply using an average water level over a year or season. Consequently, dynamics of regional groundwater over time has been compromised. Kriging with external drift (KED) has been a widely adopted approach for regional scale potentiometric mapping in recent years. However, it has a number of unacknowledged fundamental weaknesses - specifically, excessive noise in the head, sensitivity to observation errors and questionable estimation in upland regions and in coastal regions dominated by radial flow. These weaknesses are illustrated and then a multivariate localised colocated cokriging approach is proposed that locally reduces the excessive noise from KED and incorporates the coast line and streams into the estimation. Combined with the temporal interpolation of groundwater head (\nPeterson & Western, 2014)\n, the approach allows regional scale mapping for a single point in time. To illustrate the approach, the monthly water table level was mapped across Victoria, Australia, from 1985 to 2014. Using the maps, the location and the nature/magnitude of major changes in groundwater dynamics were identified and the surface-groundwater connectivity of major rivers was estimated over time. While geological knowledge can be incorporated, this approach allows data-driven insights to be derived from groundwater monitoring networks without the usual assumptions required for numerical groundwater modeling.\nPeterson, T.

            "abstract": "Global temperature is expected to increase further during the 21st century. Thus, it is great of importance to understand how future climate would be changed in a warmer climate. In this study, we examine the relationship between changes in tropical Pacific precipitation and extratropical Northern Hemisphere climate in response to greenhouse warming. By analyzing the CMIP5 climate models, it is found that the change in latitudinal position of Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is closely related to the strength of the Northern Hemisphere surface warming in a warmer climate. That is, the global warming due to the increase of greenhouse concentration causes the change in the ITCZ, in turn, the meridional shift of ITCZ can contribute to accelerate or attenuate the surface warming further by changing large-scale atmospheric circulation over the Northern Hemisphere. Specifically, the extratropical Northern Hemisphere surface warming tends to be stronger (weaker) in the models where the ITCZ shifts relatively more northward (southward).",

We present continent-wide features using Transportable Array data receiver function analysis, followed by regional comparisons to tie to ground truth from xenolith studies and structural mapping. We stress that the Transportable Array, at ~75 km station spacing, only offers a collection of point measurements of the crust due to the lack of crossing raypaths.\n7.x layers (lower crust with high seismic velocities) can be created during crustal growth processes such as magmatic or mechanical underplating and during crustal modification such as large-scale melting. We present receiver function results and a compilation of previous regional studies using refraction data or receiver functions from regional dense networks. 7.x layers appear predominantly in parts of the northern U.S. Cordillera and across the southeastern U.S. We compare the seismic results with a xenolith study in Montana that details incremental growth of the 7.x layer from the Archean on. Hydration of a granulitic lower crust can destroy the 7.x layer and has the potential to cause epirogenic uplift. We interpret the pattern seen across the Transportable Array in the light of this hypothesis.\nDuctile deformation of the deep crust generates shear fabrics that can be detected seismically. Receiver functions detect shear zones via contrasts in foliation to the surrounding material. We map foliation strikes and depths in the crust across the Transportable Array using azimuthal analysis of receiver functions. Strikes from receiver functions typically align with surface fault traces in tectonically active regions, with depths of the converters exceeding the brittle zone. We discuss continent-wide strikes mapped with receiver functions. Contrasting orientations of Proterozoic shear zones and pervasive surrounding foliations in basement exposures in Colorado are reflected in seismic results from the Transportable Array and CREST experiment.",

            "abstract": "An extraordinary precipitation over 100 mmhr-1in Hiroshima on August 19, 2014, caused a flash flood which resulted in 74 fatalities and collapse of 330 houses. In order to examine the meteorological background of this flooding event, we carried out a detailed analysis utilizing rain gauge data, satellite precipitation dataset, and a meso scale and a global scale objective analyses provided from the Japan Meteorological Agency. Then, we performed numerical experiments using a nonhydrostatic compressible equation model called the Cloud-Resolving Storm Simulator (CReSS). As a result, a combined effect of an atmospheric river (AR) and a cut-off low (COL) in this flooding event was elucidated. \nDuring the event, a filamentary transport of moisture extending from the Indochina Peninsula to the Japanese Islands was observed along the southern side of the subtropical jet, forming an AR. This AR had a deep structure with an amount of free tropospheric moisture comparable to that of the boundary layer. Concurrently, there was a COL, detached from the Mid-Pacific Trough, moving northwestward toward the Japanese Archipelago. With various sensitivity experiments, we concluded that a mid-tropospheric instability associated with the cold core of the COL and a dynamical ascent induced in its foreside, collaboratively worked with the anomalous moisture in the free troposphere associated with the AR, to extraordinarily enhance the precipitation over Hiroshima region. An orographic effect to concentrate the precipitation in this region was also confirmed. An implication on a difference in effects of AR in this event with a climatologically moist boundary layer, from those in the US west coast with a very dry environment, was also obtained. \nAcknowledgment: This study is supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-1503) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan, and by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

            "abstract": "Modeling underground gas storage requires simulations on a large domain over the whole time of plant operation and beyond, including local features such as fault zones and a representation of the transient saline front. The boundary conditions and resulting pressure reversal are affected by external fluctuations in energy demand and supply (e.g. power to gas) over a wide range of time scales. In addition, often a large number of simulation runs need to be conducted to quantify parameter uncertainty (e.g. Monte Carlo simulation). Within acceptable computational time this cannot be achieved by full three-dimensional multiphase multicomponent models due to limited computational resources. In contrast to that, less computational resources are required by numerous simplified mathematical models. One class of these models is based on the assumption of vertical equilibrium. However, this assumption may be invalid in the area around the well during injection and extraction of gas and at the tip of the plume and in general only holds after a certain timescale in the rest of the domain. In addition, simplified models do not provide the accuracy desired for some parts of interest in the domain, like fault zones, the displacement front or geological heterogeneity especially around the injection zone. The individual benefits of simplified models such as a vertically integrated model and more complex and thus more accurate models such as a full-dimensional multiphase model are combined by coupling both model types in one domain. The boundary between the models is adapted during the simulation to capture transient processes. Stability, applicability and efficiency of the coupled model for different injection scenarios and domain features will be analyzed and discussed. Physically/mathematically motivated coupling criteria to govern the movement of the boundaries between the models will be presented and compared. It will be shown how the coupled model maintains a high degree of accuracy where necessary while being at the same time efficient to be applied for real case scenarios of underground gas storage.",

            "abstract": "In the past few decades, regional increase in air temperature has accelerated the ice melting in polar, sub-polar, and major land glacial areas. The glaciers in Tibetan Plateau, the largest glaciers outside Polar Regions and the sources of several trans-boundary major rivers, are now showing aggravated terminus retreat and thinning. The variation of freshwater availability is crucial for the economic development in Mainland Southeast Asia, especially in hydroelectric generation and agriculture irrigation. These rives, including the Mekong River, is also subject to upstream-downstream conflict and transboundary issues. In this study, we propose to estimate the remaining glacier water storage in Mekong River basin, and further analyze the impact of glacier retreat on these dams/reservoirs for the next decade. By calculating the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the water surface area (WSA) can thus be extracted from optical satellite images. On the other hand, the ice surface area (ISA) can be derived from the Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (POLSAR) images. With different polarization states of electromagnetic wave reflected by earth surface, POLSAR image can effectively identify glacier/ice from snow. Combined WSA and ISA information with digital elevation model (DEM), the change of freshwater storage in glaciers can be estimated. In the end, the influence on dams/reservoirs in the Mekong River caused by glacier retreat can be forecasted. The result can also be applied to hydrology, water allocation, and economy/agriculture policy determination.",

            "abstract": "It is now generally accepted that about 25% of the seafloor formed at slow spreading mid-ocean ridges (MOR), and along a good proportion of the ocean-continent transition zones, comprises mantle-derived ultramafic rocks and gabbros that are emplaced in the footwall of large offset normal faults (also called detachments). These detachment faults are therefore a fundamental component of plate tectonics. Based on proxies such as axial depth, axial valley relief, and gravity anomalies, our study area qualifies as a worldwide MOR end-member in terms of low melt supply. It is also an end-member in terms of the abundance of mantle-derived rocks exposed at the seafloor. Our study focuses on a corridor of nearly-amagmatic spreading that extend along-axis for up to 70 km, and across-axis on both diverging plates over distances that correspond to 10 myrs-worth of accretion. Asymmetric detachment faults in this corridor accommodate almost 100% of plate divergence, yet the overal pattern of magnetic anomalies is symmetrical, suggesting that detachments have repeatedly flipped polarity.\nIn this presentation, we use geological observations, geophysical data and plate reconstructions in this magmatically-poor ultraslow (14 mm/yr) MOR end-member region to address key questions about the time and space evolution of mid-ocean ridge detachments. We analyze the lifetime and polarity of successive detachments, we examine their lateral (along-axis) evolution as the nearly amagmatic corridor transitions into adjacent, more magmatic ridge domains. We also use seafloor reflectivity and dredging to test possible links between sparse volcanic events in the nearly amagmatic corridor and the initiation of new detachments. Detachment surfaces exposed in the older parts of our study area (> 6 myrs) are commonly corrugated, yielding significantly more gabbroic samples, mixed with ultramafics in dredge hauls, than younger non-corrugated, smooth detachment surfaces. We analyze the transition between these two types of exposed fault surfaces and outline a conceptual model that could be tested and generalized to more magmatically active slow and ultraslow ridges.",

Within this collection, we have identified in more than a thousand records an energy packet that arrives 5-20 seconds after the PKPbc (or PKPbc-diff) and represents a coda that is not predicted by 1D reference seismic models. The origin of this scattered energy is unclear and may provide valuable information about structure in the core. We use array analysis techniques to enhance the signal of theses scatterers and try and locate them.\nOur results show that the scattered energy originates along the great-circle path in a consistent range of arrival times and narrow range of ray parameter. There are no obvious variations with source or station location, in particular the depth of the source. After exploration of possible location for these scatterers, we show that their origin is most likely in the vicinity of the inner-core boundary. We refer to this scattered energy the \"M\" phase.\nTo assess our interpretation, we model synthetic seismograms and explore models of structures at the base of the outer-core and search for models that predict the relative travel times and amplitudes of the M to PKPdf without destroying the fit to PKPbc. We show that a ~300km thick layer with a larger gradient than in AK135 over a ~50km lower velocity layer above the ICB provides a good fit to the differential travel times. We also consider the possibility that lateral variations in the thickness or velocity of this layer and ICB topography could produce a M phase.",

The 7-year weekly records of the carbonate chemistry condition in the Chuuk lagoon, located in the coral-rich western Pacific Ocean, show that under the condition of weak intrusion of ambient seawater from the surrounding open ocean, two internal biological processes (calcification and respiration) were reinforced each other and collectively lowered the acidity of the reef water for extended periods, ranging from a few months to several months. Our study indicates that the acidification of reef water can be intensified by the enhancement of respiration under the weak intrusion of ambient water due to low winds (i.e. the longer residence time of reef water). Our finding is not an isolated phenomenon but may be widespread in the coral-rich western Pacific Ocean (the habitat of 50% of the global coral reefs), where the degree of ambient water intrusion was revealed to be closely associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation-induced wind speed change.",

            "abstract": "As a new approach to forest inventory utilizing, LiDAR remote sensing has become an important research issue in the past. Lidar researches initially concentrate on the investigation for mapping forests at the tree level and identifying important structural parameters, such as tree height, crown size, crown base height, individual tree species, and stem volume etc. But for the virtual city visualization and mapping, the traditional methods of tree classification can't satisfy the more complex conditions. Recently, the advanced LiDAR technology has generated new full waveform scanners that provide a higher point density and additional information about the reflecting characteristics of trees. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that it is feasible to detect individual overstorey trees in forests and classify species. But the important issues like the calibration and the decomposition of full waveform data with a series of Gaussian functions usually take a lot of works. What’s more, the detection and classification of vegetation results relay much on the prior outcomes.\nFrom all above, the section-based method for tree species classification using small footprint and high sampling density lidar data is proposed in this paper, which can overcome the tree species classification issues in urban areas. More specific objectives are to: (1)use local maximum height decision and four direction sections certification methods to get the precise locations of the trees;(2) develop new lidar-derived features processing techniques for characterizing the section structure of individual tree crowns;(3) investigate several techniques for filtering and analyzing vertical profiles of individual trees to classify the trees, and using the expert decision skills based on percentile analysis;(4) assess the accuracy of estimating tree species for each tree, and (5) investigate which type of lidar data, point frequency or intensity, provides the most accurate estimate of tree species’ classification.

In order to further constrain GIA models and improve our current knowledge of GIA, more observations (e.g. relative sea-levels (RSL), GPS, gravity measurements, tide-gauges) are desirable to resolve the following parameters of GIA:\n1.Ice thickness,\n2.Lithospheric thickness,\n3.Radial viscosity profile (background viscosity profile for modeling),\n4.Lateral viscosity changes in view of thermal versus chemical origin of the 3D structures in the mantle.\nWe discuss global sensitivities of RSL data of the last 18,000 years. This also includes indicative RSL-like data (e.g., lake levels) on the continents far off the coasts. We present detailed sensitivity maps for the four parameters above for up to nine dedicated times. Assuming an observational accuracy of 2 m of RSL data of all ages (based on analysis of currently available data), we highlight areas (or optimal locations) around the world where, if the environmental conditions allowed its deposition and survival until today, RSL data of at least this accuracy may help to quantify the GIA modeling parameters above.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between surface melting and ice motion will affect how the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) responds to climate and the structure of the subglacial drainage system may be crucial in controlling how changing melt-rates impact ice motion. Ice sheet motion varies over seasonal time-scales in response to varying surface meltwater inputs to the ice-sheet bed which lubricate the ice-bed interface, resulting in periods of faster ice motion. However, the impact of hydro-dynamic coupling on ice motion over decadal timescales remains poorly constrained. Here we utilise remotely-sensed optical Landsat imagery to generate a record of annual motion spanning three decades extending back to 1985. Our observations cover an ∼8000 km2 area along ∼170 km of predominantly land-terminating margin of the west GrIS, and extend ∼50 km inland to 1100 m asl. We find that that annual ice motion was 12% slower in 2007–2014 compared to 1985–1994, despite a corresponding 50% increase in surface meltwater production. Less than 1/3 of the observed slowdown can be explained by a reduction in internal deformation caused by marginal ice sheet thinning, and we therefore hypothesise that increases in subglacial drainage efficiency, associated with sustained larger melt volumes, have reduced basal lubrication resulting in slower ice flow. Our findings suggest that hydro-dynamic coupling in this section of the ablation zone resulted in net ice motion slowdown over decadal timescales — not speedup as previously postulated. Increases in meltwater production from projected climate warming may therefore further reduce the motion of land-terminating margins of the ice-sheet indicating such margins are more resilient to the dynamic impacts of enhanced meltwater production than previously thought. The implications of these observations for wider ice sheet hydrology-dynamics coupling are considered.",

The GEF-metric that indicates the strength of column-integrated longwave radiative heating due to cloud-radiation interaction is relatively well correlated with MJO amplitude and eastward propagation of precipitation signal.

            "abstract": "The lowermost portion of large eruption columns is the momentum-driven, fluid flow portion known as a volcanic jet. The perturbation of the atmosphere from this region produces a sound known as jetting or jet noise. Recent work has shown that this volcanic jet noise produced by a volcano has similar characteristics as the sound from jet and rocket engines. The study of volcanic jet noise has gained much from laboratory jet engine studies; however, jet engines have been engineered to reduce noise thereby limiting their use as a comparison tool to the complex, ever-changing volcanic jet. Previous studies have noted that fumaroles produce jet noise without further detailed investigation. The goal of this work is to enhance our understanding of large-scale volcanic jets by studying an accessible, less hazardous fumarolic jet. We aim to characterize the acoustic signature of fumaroles and evaluate if fumarolic jets scale to that of large volcanic jets. To investigate this, we deployed a 6-element acoustic array at two different locations along the edge of the crater wall at Aso Volcano, Japan from early July through mid-August 2015. Approximately two months before this deployment, the pyroclastic cone within Aso’s crater partially collapsed into the vent. The cone was constructed during both ash venting and strombolian-style explosive activity in the last year. After the deployment, on July 13 a new small vent opened on the southwest flank of the pyroclastic cone. The vent is several meters in diameter and has consistent gas jetting which produces audible jet noise. To better capture the acoustic signature of the gas jetting we moved the array to the southwestern edge of the crater. The array is 230 meters from the vent and is positioned 54 degrees from the vertical jet axis, a recording angle usually not feasible in volcanic environments. Preliminary investigations suggest directionality at the source and the influence of topography along the propagation path as evidenced by a reduction in power and decrease in correlation between certain array elements.",

            "abstract": "The role of the land surface on dust variability over West Africa is still debated. Early studies have identified a correlation between dust optical depth over the Atlantic and previous year Sahelian precipitation and NDVI. Recent studies, however, point to a modest role of vegetation on dust emission variability, either with model attribution studies or analyses of SYNOP data. Part of the debate comes from the fact that 'previous year precipitation or NDVI' is only a vague cause of reduced dust emission during the dry season. It is implicitly assumed that wet or vegetated soils persist during the dry season, without any solid evidence.\nHere we present a method to derive dry-season vegetation in the Sahel, applied to the aqua-MODIS data (2002-2015). The ratio of the SWIR bands at 1.6 and 2.1 microm, referred to as STI, is shown to depend on dry vegetation cover.\nWe show that the anomalies of vegetation, emerging in the rain season, persist throughout the dry season in the Sahel. Monthly STI anomalies for each month from October to June are strongly correlated to the July-September NDVI anomaly for every pixel in the Sahel.\nThen we correlate dry-season averaged STI and Dust Uplift Potential (DUP from ERA-Interim) to MODIS DeepBlue AOD and to AOD from Aeronet stations in the Sahel. STI and DUP explain 40% to 50% of the variance of dust AOD. Areas where STI is best correlated with AOD variability are mostly found in Niger but extend from Chad to Mauritania, whereas DUP shows the strongest correlations near Bodele and similar places in Niger. The role of STI is best seen when averaging over a few months whereas DUP operates also a shorter time-scales.\nWe conclude that the dry-season vegetation plays a role in controlling dust AOD over the Sahel, in addition to wind.\nSTI estimated from Landsat data for the large drought of 1984 was much smaller than during 2002-2015, which suggests that vegetation was also an important cause of the high dust AOD of the 80s.",

            "abstract": "The Recife Metropolitan Region (PE, Brazil) is a typical \"hot spot\" illustrating the problems of southern countries on water issues inducing high pressures on water resources both on quantity and quality in the context of global social and environmental changes. By focusing on the groundwater geochemistry in a costal multilayer aquifer, this work aims at investigating the sources and processes of salinization. Two different Precambrian blocks separated by a large lineament area constitute the site basement. The sedimentary fillings of the two basins present different origins that were distinguished by the Sr isotope composition. The northern deep Beberibe aquifer displays very high 87Sr/86Sr with a large range of values (0.7102-0.7233) illustrating the main continental origin of sediments whereas the southern deep Cabo aquifer showed lower values (0.7097-0.7141) indicating the contribution of the marine sedimentation. Although sulfate isotopes, Electrical Conductivity and Cl contents indicate a mixing with seawater for some samples of the deep Cabo and Beberibe aquifers, all 87Sr/86Sr values are above the present-day seawater composition. This can be related to the complex local history of transgression/regression phases that induced alternatively salinisation and freshening with gains and losses of cations and Sr, together with water-rock interactions. δ18O-δ2H clearly evidence the local present day recharge in the surficial aquifer, some samples being affected by in situ evaporation processes and/or recharge with evaporated water from dams used for water supply. The deep aquifers display a high range of B (20-600µg/L) and δ11B (6.7-68.5‰) with some of the highest values known to date. Multiple sources and processes affect the B behavior, among which mixing with saline water, B sorption on clays/organic matter and mixing with wastewater. The surficial aquifers are locally salinized possibly due to present seawater intrusion, and highly contaminated with wastewater.",

            "abstract": "For a reliable calibration of a relative paleointensity stack, we proposed a new method for direct comparison of absolute paleointensities (APIs) with relative paleointensities (RPIs) (Mochizuki et al., under review). In the analysis, APIs are directly compared with the RPIs of a RPI stack at six stratigraphic levels: three levels are based on tephrostratigraphic correlations between welded tuffs and corresponding tephra layers in the oxygen isotope stratigraphy, and the other three levels are based on paleomagnetic correlations between RPI minima and transitional geomagnetic fields. In the present study, to increase API data with tephrostratigraphic correlation, we applied the LTD-DHT Shaw paleointensity method (Tsunakawa-Shaw method) to 21 welded tuffs in Japan extruded with widespread tephra layers. We obtained mean paleointensities for 16 of the 21 welded tuffs. Since nine of the 16 welded tuffs were correlated with the tephras recognized in the oxygen isotope stratigraphy, they can be added to the API data used in the direct comparison method. Combining these API data with the reported data, we compared API data with RPIs from the PISO-1500 stack and SINT-800 stack at the 14 stratigraphic levels: eleven levels are based on tephrostratigraphic correlation and the other three levels are based on paleomagnetic correlation. RPIs of the PISO-1500 stack showed a linear relationship with the virtual axial dipole moments (VADMs) calculated from the APIs, indicating that the PISO-1500 stack has a linear relation to the axial dipole moment. PRIs from the SINT-800 stack also have a linear-like trend with the VADMs. This direct comparison method can clarify the relationship between APIs and RPIs of a RPI stack, and thus provide a reliable calibration of the RPI stack to absolute values.",

The wave field consists of a wide range of wave components propagating in different directions with different speeds for different wavelengths. The long waves directly distort the wind field, while the short waves contribute significantly to the surface drag as surface roughness. In our study, we developed a two-way coupling numerical scheme for the simulation of wind and wave interaction. The turbulent wind field is computed using LES on wave-surface-fitted computational grid, and the wave field is computed with phase-resolved nonlinear wave simulation. At each time step, the wave simulation provides sea surface geometry and velocity as bottom boundary conditions to the wind simulation, while the latter provides wind forcing for the wave evolution. Our simulations with different wave scenarios, including a variety of windseas at different development stages, swells, and shoaling over bathymetry variations, show significant effects of waves on the wind field. Based on the simulation data, the momentum flux and turbulence transport processes in the lower marine atmospheric boundary layer are analyzed in detail with a focus on wave effects.",

Clogging processes can alter this heterogeneity as function of time and thus can modify transport. To understand transport under clogging conditions and to unravel the potential of multiple tracer tests to characterize such transport process we perform column and sandbox experiments.\nOur recently developed column and sandbox experiments are used to perform multiple tracer tests during clogging. In a first set of experiments, a cubic cell of 0.1 m x 0.1 m x 0.1 m is used to experimentally estimate flow and transport characteristics of an unconsolidated sediment through Darcy and tracer experiments. The water streaming through the experiment is amended with ammonium sulfate permanently. Salt tracers are added to the streaming water repeatedly, to be detected at micro electrodes at the inflow and the outflow of the cubic cell. Through repeated syringe injections of a barium chloride solution into the center of the cubic cell clogging processes are forced to occur around the mixing zone of the injected and streaming water by precipitation of barium sulfate. In a second set of experiments, a sandbox model including a sediment body of 0.3 m x 0.3 m x 0.1 m is used. Tracer, streaming, and injection water chemistry is kept similar to the cubic cell experiments. However, tracer breakthrough is now detected at nine positions within the experiment and at the inflow and the outflow of the sandbox model. Injection of barium chloride solution is now at two locations around the center of the sandbox model. Flow and transport characteristics of the sediment body are estimated based on Darcy and tracer experiments, which are performed repeatedly. Combined analysis of local and ensemble breakthrough curves and integrated numerical modeling will be used to understand effective and local flow and transport in a in a porous medium during clogging.",

            "abstract": "Lake Montcortès is a karstic lake located in Catalonian Pyrenees (Spain). Its sediments consist of biogenic varves composed of a couplet of calcite and organic matter layers and occasional detrital layer. Previous studies of the lake’s sediments spanning the last 1500 years proposed that the lake was meromictic and that calcite layers formed due to endogenic precipitation in the epilimnion during spring/summer, driven by diatom blooms. These processes would have been influenced by variations in calcium saturation, trophic state and water temperature of the lake. The presence of phosphorous and biological differences between planktonic diatoms Cyclotella comta and C.cyclopuncta, would have produced additional differences in calcite sublayering.\nIn order to improve comprehension of limnological variables that influence varve formation processes, monthly field campaigns including sediment traps deployment have been carried out during two concurrent years (2013-2015).\nThe lake mixed once during winter. Endogenic calcite precipitation related with high primary production and calcium saturation in metalimnetic water was confirmed. Trapped material composition revealed low but constant calcite precipitation through the year with higher intensities during summer and autumn, coinciding with high relative abundances of C. cyclopuncta and C.ocellata. Nutrient content was very low throughout both years, particularly phosphorous. It seems to be removed by coprecipitation of calcium phosphate with calcite during summer, probably inhibiting part of calcite precipitation reaction. In contrast to previous hypotheses, currently calcite precipitation occurs through the whole year, mainly during summer and autumn months, and may be triggered by nucleation with picoplankton. Our study shows that processes leading to varve formation are highly complex and that any extrapolation to different regions or time periods should be handled with caution",

Despite the fact that this theory has shaped modern geosciences it has some limitations, and among them the impossibility to evaluate the forces at the origin of the surface displacements and deformations. Hence important questions remain difficult to solve like the origin of the sizes of plates, forces driving mountain building or supercontinent dispersal...\nTremendous progresses have been made in the past 15 years in mantle convection modelling. Especially, modern convection codes can solve for motion equations with complex material properties. Since the early 2000’s, the development of pseudo-plastic rheologies contributed to produce convection models with plate-like behaviour: plates naturally emerge and interact with the flow in a self-organized manner.\nUsing such models in 3D spherical geometry (computed with StagYY - Tackley, 2008), I will show that important questions on the global tectonics of the planet can be addressed now: the distribution of seafloor ages, the distribution of plate area, the lifetime of small and large plates or modes of plate reorganizations.\nTackley, P.J., Modellng compressible mantle convection with large viscosity contrasts in a three-dimensional spherical shell using the yin-yang grid, Phys.

            "abstract": "It has been common to perform comparisons between palaeoclimate model simulations with palaeoclimate reconstructions to better understand the mechanisms of climate change, and the accuracy of data reconstructions. However, it is surprisingly rare that palaeoclimate data has actually resulted in a change of the models. This is particularly true for the state-of-the-art GCMs. The talk will focus on two examples of using model parameter perturbation methodogies to effectivily tune the model to palaeoclimate data. The main example will use the Last Glacial Maximum and focus on the stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. We will also discuss older time periods such as the earlly Eocene. In both cases we will use versions of the Hadley Centre climate model. It will be shown that the model initially appears to be too stable to forcings, particularly input of fresh water. By tuning the model, we can get enhanced sensitivity of the model. The results show that this can give significant differences in the response of the model at regional scale, although the overall climate sensitivity of the model to future clinate change is relatively unaltered.",

            "abstract": "The alpine wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau have been subject to rapid climate changes and intensifying human activities, resulting in a lower water table. The changes may affect CH4 emissions by influencing biological processes of production or consumption. However, the magnitude, pattern of CH4 emissions on annual timescale and their responses to water table lowering in alpine wetlands remain poorly understood, because of technical limitations and the harsh environments. We conducted the first in situ year-round observation using Eddy Covariance method and a mesocosm experiment simulating changes in water table depth (+3 and -20 cm soil depth relative to the surface) using Manual Static Chamber method to measure the CH4 fluxes in an alpine wetland. We found that the annual CH4 emissions were 26.4 and 33.8 g CH4 m-2 in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and the non-growing season CH4 emissions accounted for 43.2-46.1% of the annual emissions from in situ observation, highlighting an indispensable contribution that was often overlooked by previous studies. Meantime, a two-peak seasonal variation in CH4 fluxes was observed, with a small peak in the spring thawing period and a large one in the peak growing season. Mesocosm experiment showed that water table lowering largely reduced CH4 emissions by 52.7-64.9%, but did not affect seasonal dynamics in the growing seasons from 2011 to 2013. Our findings suggested that the CH4 emissions from the alpine wetlands on the Tibetan plateau cannot be ignored during non-growing season, and the wetlands may be a weaker CH4 source in the growing season considering water table lowering associated with artificial drainage and climate warming in this region.",

            "abstract": "Deforestation impacts climate in two major ways: affecting the atmospheric CO2 concentration and modulating the land-atmosphere fluxes of energy and water vapor. Given the important role of forests in the global carbon cycle, climate treaties account for land-based mitigation options like afforestation, reforestation and avoided deforestation or forest degradation. On the contrary, predicted climate impacts of biophysical processes, such as the exchange of energy and water vapor, are still uncertain in sign and magnitude, and therefore have not been considered in climate negotiations to date. Direct observations of the biophysical climate effects of forest losses and gains are therefore required to constrain model predictions, reduce the uncertainty of model ensembles, and provide robust recommendations to climate policy.\nIn this work we report an observation-driven global analysis of the biophysical impacts of forest losses and gains on the local climate, based on a combination of Earth observations of recent changes in forest cover, surface radiometric temperatures and in-situ air temperatures. Our study documents that deforestation causes local changes in skin and air temperature that varies in sign and magnitude according to the climate zone. Results show that forest losses amplify the diurnal temperature variation and increase the mean and maximum air temperature, with the largest signal in arid zones, followed by temperate, tropical and boreal zones. In the decade 2003-2012, variations of forest cover generated a global biophysical warming corresponding to 31% of the biogeochemical signal due to CO2 emission from land use change. These experimental evidences provide a global and robust quantification of the local climate sensitivities to deforestation and a novel assessment of the mitigation potentials of forests on mean/maximum air temperatures and on the diurnal temperature variations. Overall, the observation-driven, global quantification of the biophysical signal of deforestation provided in this study may support the inclusion of land biophysics in climate negotiations and the definition of novel protocols for the measurement, reporting, and verification of these relevant effects.",

An updated version of the CHAOS time-dependent geomagnetic field model will be presented, with a focus on details of the selection and incorporation of Swarm data including field gradient estimates.

            "abstract": "Climate records from lacustrine systems have been established in the last years to improve our understanding of the regional and temporal expression of climate change on the continents, and how it influenced the human evolution. Lake Petén Itzá, located in the center of the climatically sensitive Peninsula Yucatán, is a surficial closed-basin lake located in the lowlands of northern Guatemala drilled by ICDP. The region itself exhibits characteristic climate conditions, making it an ideal region for paleoclimatological and paleoecological studies. A key problem in obtaining a long-lasting climate record is to establish robust chronologies beyond 40 ka since they exceed the range of 14C dating, but tephra layers within these sediments may provide good age-constraints >40 ka. We here use large-magnitude, widespread, Pleistocene to Holocene silicic eruptions from caldera volcanoes in the Central American volcanic arc (CAVA), contributing to the drilled Petén Itzá lake sediments in the form of numerous lacustrine tephras providing time markers to develop a new, extended age model. We established robust and well-constrained correlations between the tephras in Lake Petén Itzá and the deposits at the CAVA source as well as their marine equivalents in the sediments of the Pacific Ocean based on major and trace element glass compositions. We document here 8 well-constraint time markers for the Petén Itza age models, which so far were only based on younger 14C dates and some preliminary, only major-element based, tephra correlations. Additionally ongoing Ar/Ar age dating of the Los Chocoyos eruption will provide a new pinning point froma an important regional marker horizon. In summary we have been able to modify the current age models, extend the paleoclimate and paleoecological record in this neotropical region to ~300 ka, and contribute greatly to the determination of the magnitude (eruptive volumes) and more precise eruption dates of CAVA eruptions.",

The most significant megathrust events in this region are the 1944 Tonankai (Mw 8.1), the 1946 Nankai (Mw 8.3) and the 1968 Hyuganada (Mw 7.5) earthquakes. The landward down-dip limit of the Nankai megathrust seismogenic zone is located at a depth of ~30-40 km, marked by the occurrence of episodic tremors and slips. The seaward up-dip limit is not very distinct, being generally at a depth of ~10 km and correlated with a suite of diagenetic to low-grade metamorphic processes. To clarify the causal mechanism of the megathrust earthquakes, we studied the detailed three-dimensional P and S wave velocity (Vp and Vs), attenuation (Qp and Qs), and Poisson’s ratio (σ) structures of the SW Japan forearc, using a large number of high-quality arrival time and t* data measured precisely from seismograms of local earthquakes. The suboceanic earthquakes used are relocated precisely using sP depth phase and ocean bottom seismometer data. Our results show the existence of two prominent high-V, high-Q, and low-σ patches separated by low-V, low-Q, and high-σ anomalies in the Nankai megathrust zone. Megathrust earthquakes during 1900 to 2013 nucleated in or around the high-V, high-Q, and low-σ patches, which may represent strongly coupled areas (i.e., asperities) in the megathrust zone. This feature is very similar to that of the NE Japan megathrust zone where the great Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw 9.0) occurred on 11 March 2011 (e.g., Zhao, 2015). These results indicate that structural heterogeneities in the megathrust zone, such as the subducting seafloor topography and compositional variations, control the nucleation of megathrust earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "In many regions, atmospheric conditions change frequently with shifts of wind direction, extending maritime influences far inland or continental influences to coastal ecosystems. Climate models predict changes in both wind direction and velocity; these changes could potentially impact ecosystems mass and energy exchanges with the atmosphere. Using climate and ecosystem-scale eddy-covariance data from Sardinia, we evaluated whether the frequency of certain wind characteristics, potentially improving ecosystem CO2 uptake, have changed over five decades, and whether these characteristics are indeed linked to ecosystem gas-exchange responses of the studied ecosystem. The analyses shows that days dominated by summer Mistral winds decreased on average 3% per decade, and that wind direction affects biosphere-atmosphere exchange of carbon but not water. High velocity cool Mistral winds from continental Europe treble vapor pressure deficit (D) as they cross the island. In contrast, arriving with a similar D, lower velocity, warmer Saharan Sirocco winds heat up, thus increasing D five-fold only 50 km inland. Over a mixed ecosystem (grass-wild olive), while soil moisture was low and constant, daytime net carbon exchange (NEE) averaged 2.3-fold higher in Mistral than Sirocco days, largely reflecting the theoretically expected response of canopy conductance (gc) to variation of D. Because the product of gc and D encodes the key ecosystem compensatory mechanism, the reciprocal gc-D response maintained similar ecosystem evapotranspiration (E). Thus, summertime ecosystem water-use efficiency (W=NEE/E), was ~66% higher during Mistral than other days. The historical decrease of Mistral frequency reduced the estimated summertime NEE >30 %. The analyses demonstrate that alteration of dominance of air masses predicted with future climate will amplify or negate the positive effect of increased atmospheric [CO2] on W, and should be considered when assessing climate change impact on NEE.",

A novel aspect of the method is that plasma mass can be distributed arbitrarily between fluid and particles, thereby allowing kinetic effects to be included only in regions and times of interest. This allows a tradeoff to be made between computational cost of a model and accuracy of the physical description of plasma in different parts of the modeled system. It is also possible to have a smooth transition between fluid and kinetic physics in contrast to existing computational models in which a discontinuity in physics exists when transitioning between regions of different physical descriptions of plasma. By varying the fraction of plasma mass represented by particles it is also possible to gain insight into the physical effects required for and produced by various phenomena such as magnetic reconnection.",

            "abstract": "The synoptic nature of satellite remote sensing makes this technique a key tool to contribute to estimating the amount of Carbon fixed by vegetation at global scale. From the various types of information that can be derived from space, the recent capacity to create global datasets of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) may prove to be a game-changer. SIF is a signal emitted by the photosynthetic machinery itself that, under the illumination conditions in which it can be estimated by satellite, has been shown to be proportional to gross primary productivity (GPP). However, this relationship is dependent on vegetation types that are typically spatially mixed at the coarse spatial resolution of SIF datasets (at best 0.5°), which in turn is a consequence of the complexity of the SIF retrieval itself. This study demonstrates how 0.5° SIF derived from GOME-2 data can be downscaled to a more adequate spatial resolution of 0.05° by combining 3 explanatory biophysical variables derived from the MODIS sensor (NDVI, land surface temperature and evapotranspiration) under a semi-empirical light-use efficiency framework. The finer spatial resolution results in a cleaner signal when aggregating it per land cover type. The signal is also better correlated in time with GPP estimated from flux towers, reaching the same level of performance than global GPP products calibrated on such flux towers and driven by meteorological and remote sensing variables (other than SIF). Establishing linear relationships between SIF and flux-tower GPP at vegetation type level allows to estimate values of global terrestrial vegetation gross productivity that have different magnitude but similar temporal patterns as other GPP products. Based on downscaled SIF, the mean global GPP values over the period 2007 to 2013 are (for deciduous broadleaf and mixed forests) 13.7, (for evergreen needleleaf forests) 2.5, (for grasslands) 12.5 and (savannahs and woody savannas) 36.8 Pg of Carbon per year.",

To install and operate solar power generation systems not only the intensity of solar irradiance at ground but also variation in sola irradiance has to be considered. Ground-based observation of solar irradiance can provide information about the variation on shorter temporal scale. In this study variation within a day is investigated. Solar irradiance data with 1minute interval is used. To evaluate the variation in solar irradiance we use three variables: mean, standard deviation and sample entropy. These variables represent availability of solar irradiance at the surface, strength of variation, and manner of fluctuation respectively. The characteristics of variation in surface solar irradiance is investigated using three variables. The cluster analysis is performed to divide 47 observation stations in Japan into groups with similar variation features. We found that 3, 6, and 9 clusters are suitable for classifying the 47 sites. The results of cluster analysis clarified characteristics of monthly mean values for three variables of variation in solar irradiance.",

Groundwater levels variations in preassembled wells and changes in electronic conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, water temperature and pH in the hyporheic zone were examined as environmental performance indicators for the water quality. Groundwater tables in wells were highly related to the river water levels that showed a hysteresis pattern, and the lag time is associated with the distances from wells to the river bank. The distribution of DO and EC were strongly related to the water temperature, indicating that the cold water released from up-reservoir could determine the biochemistry process in the hyporheic zone. Results also showed that the hyporheic water was weakly alkaline in the study area but had a more or less uniform spatial distribution. Dam release-storage cycles were the dominant factor in changing lateral hyporheic flow and water quality.",

            "abstract": "The response of the solid Earth to the melting of ice sheets, or Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), is controlled by thickness of the lithosphere and the viscosity of the mantle, and as such it is also sensitive to lateral changes in these parameters. However it has proved difficult to uniquely constrain lateral changes in Earth parameters using observations of GIA. Here we investigate whether horizontal velocities in Antarctica can constrain a viscosity contrast beneath the Transantarctic mountains.\nA large ice sheet that existed in the Ross sea at the last glacial maximum has since melted. In GIA models in which viscosity only varies with depth, the removal of an ice sheet leads to horizontal motion that is directed away from the former ice sheet (outward). Seismic imaging indicates thicker crust and colder mantle beneath East Antarctica which translates to a viscosity contrast at depth. Simulations with a simple, axisymmetric model show that horizontal velocities are reversed (inward motion) following ice sheet removal, if there is a viscosity contrast of at least 3 orders of magnitude with the stiffer mantle a viscosity of at least 1022 Pa s. Simulations with a 3D finite element model and viscosity maps based on seismic models show a more complicated velocity pattern with mostly inward motion directly outside the area of largest ice melt. The 3D models provide a better fit to GPS derived horizontal velocities in the north-western shore of the Ross Sea. There, the direction of horizontal motion can only be reproduced if the model includes a lateral viscosity contrast.",

Special data sets to model the non-tidal loading deformations are available at the Global Geophysical Fluids Centre (GGFC) of the IERS. Different groups are generating loading models, thus, a comparison is needed in order to assess the difference between the models and set these differences in relation to the size of the loading deformation itself.\nWhen analyzing space-geodetic data, the loading deformation has a direct impact on the station positions estimated as they cause non-linear station variations. Additionally, there is an indirect impact on other parameters of global space-geodetic solutions, e.g., Earth orientation parameters, geocenter coordinates, satellite orbits or troposphere parameters.\nWe show that the loading deformation as well as the differences between the models depend on the region. As a consequence, the impact on the space-geodetic solutions heavily depends on the network chosen for the analysis. This makes it special for the VLBI and SLR analysis as their networks are not as dense as the GNSS network used for global analysis.\nWe show the impact of atmospheric, oceanic and hydrological loading on the parameters of space-geodetic solutions when correcting for the global geophysical fluid models at the observation level.

Using the 3S (RS, GIS, GPS) technologies, quantitative analysis method of landscape patterns and ecological simulation, this study examines the spatiotemporal characteristics of land use/ land cover and ecosystem functions change in the grassland restoration areas in China from 2000 to 2010. We apply two parameters land use transfer matrix and land use dynamic degree to explore the speed and regional differentiation of land use change. We propose vegetation coverage, net primary production (NPP), soil and water conservation capacity to assess the ecosystem functions. This study analyzes the characteristics of landscape patterns at the class and landscape levels and explores the ecological effect of land use pattern and regional ecological processes. The results show that: (1) Grassland and others were the main landscape types in the study area in the past decade. The ecosystem structure was stable. About 0.37% of the total grassland area in 2000 experienced change in land use / land cover types. The area of woodlands, wetlands, farmlands, and built-up areas expanded. The area of others has declined. (2) The dynamic degree of regional land use was less than one percent in the recent ten years. The speed of land use and land cover change was low, and regional differentiation of change between the provinces was small. (3) The matrix of the landscape did not change in the study area. Landscape fragmentation index values decreased progressively; landscape diversity rose continuously; landscape aggregation and continuity decreased slightly; the landscape maintained relative integrity. (4) Ecosystem functions has increased as a whole. The vegetation coverages with significant increase (with a 1.99% yr-1 slope of regression) in the total study area; NPP has a fluctuating and increasing tendency, ranging from 218.23 gC·m-2yr-1 in 2000, to 226.30 gC·m-2yr-1 in 2010, with a 3.70% increase; Soil and water conservation capacity has showed an obvious increment. (5) The grassland restoration program implementation evidently improved the structure and stability of the land use/ land cover.

            "abstract": "Sediment material of a river bed is an important factor for river morphodynamics. Typically, alluvial rivers construct their own geometries based on the sediment size and its distribution that affect the sediment transport capacity in river channel networks, involving the issues of watershed sediment yield, flood controls and the evolution of flood plain, habitats, deltas and adjacent coastline. Hence, investigating grain size and size distribution of sediment materials on riverbeds is important for practical river management and assessment of landscape evolution. In this study, we collected total 43 sediment samplings along the Koaping River in southern Taiwan to analyze the grain size and its distribution along the river. Spatial distributions of different representative grain sizes, such as D50 and D90, and the size corresponding Manning's n values are analyzed and discussed in this paper. An exponential grain size distribution (GSD) formula is used to explore the relation between the frequency and size of riverbed sediment. Results show that the grain size has a wide range distribution in the river upstream but displays a narrow-range variation in the river downstream. For example, the sediment medium size D50 ranges from 1.25 mm to 391.27 mm with an average of 49.36 mm in the upstream while it ranges from 0.135 mm to 0.625 mm with an average of 0.338 mm in the downstream. The best fitting curves of GSD with exponential scaling are analyzed with an empirical parameter Dc that is used to normalize the sediment grain size. This study finds that the empirical parameter Dc could be replaced by the sediment resentative size D65 (65% of sediment smaller than it). The results obtained herein could be useful not only in analyzing sediment transport of a river but also in river management.",

            "abstract": "Time-lapse seismic signatures can be used to quantify fluid saturation and pressure changes in a reservoir undergoing CO2 sequestration. However, the injection of CO2 acidifies the water, which may dissolve and/or precipitate minerals. Understanding the impact on the rock frame from field seismic time-lapse changes remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we study the effects of carbonate-CO2-water reactions on the physical and elastic properties of rock samples with variable volumes of carbonate cementation. The effects of fluid substitution alone (brine to CO2) and those due to the combination of fluid substitution and mineral dissolution on time-lapse seismic signatures are studied by combining laboratory data, geophysical well-log data and 1-D seismic modeling.\nNine rocks from Pohokura Field (New Zealand) are reacted with carbonic acid. The elastic properties are measured using a high-density laser-ultrasonic setup. We observe that P-wave velocity changes up to -19% and correlate with sandstone grain size. Coarse-grained sandstones show greater changes in elastic wave velocities due to dissolution than fine-grained sandstones. To put this in perspective, this velocity change is comparable to the effect of fluid substitution from brine to CO2. This can potentially create an ambiguity in the interpretation of the physical processes responsible for time-lapse signatures in a CO2injection scenario.\nThe laboratory information is applied onto well-log data to model changes in elastic properties of sandstones at the well-log scale. Well-logs and core petrographic analyses are used to find an elastic model that best describes the observed elastic waves velocities in the cemented reservoir sandstones. The Constant-cement rock physics model is found to predict the elastic behaviour of the cemented sandstones. A possible late-time sequestration scenario is that both mineral dissolution and fluid substitution occur in the reservoir. 1-D synthetic seismograms show that seismic amplitudes can change up to 126% in such a scenario. Our work shows that it is important to consider that time-lapse seismic signatures in carbonate-cemented reservoirs can result not only from fluid and pressure changes but also potentially from chemical reaction between CO2-water mixtures and carbonate cemented sandstones.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater is a crucial water resource that sustains river ecosystems and provides public water supply. Furthermore, during periods of prolonged high rainfall, groundwater-dominated catchments can be subject to protracted flooding. Climate change and associated projected increases in the frequency and intensity of hydrological extremes have implications for groundwater levels. This study builds on previous research undertaken on a Chalk catchment by investigating groundwater variability in a UK sandstone catchment: the Tern in Shropshire. In contrast to the Chalk, sandstone is characterised by a more lagged response to precipitation inputs; and, as such, it is important to determine the groundwater behaviour and its links with the large-scale climatic circulation to improve process understanding of recharge, groundwater level and river flow responses to hydroclimatological drivers.\nPrecipitation, river discharge and groundwater levels for borehole sites in the Tern basin over 1974–2010 are analysed as the target variables; and we use monthly gridded reanalysis data from the Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project (20CR). First, groundwater variability is evaluated and associations with precipitation / discharge are explored using monthly concurrent and lagged correlation analyses. Second, gridded 20CR reanalysis data are used in composite and correlation analyses to identify the regions of strongest climate-groundwater association.\nResults show that reasonably strong climate-groundwater connections exist in the Tern basin, with a several months lag. These lags are associated primarily with the time taken for recharge waters to percolate through to the groundwater table. The uncovered patterns improve knowledge of large-scale climate forcing of groundwater variability and may provide a basis to inform seasonal prediction of groundwater levels, which would be useful for strategic water resource planning.",

In the recipe, the source rupture is represented by the characterized source model (Irikura and Miyake, 2011). The broadband ground motion time histories are computed by a hybrid approach: the 3-D finite-difference method (Aoi et al. 2004) and the stochastic Green’s function method (Dan and Sato, 1998; Dan et al. 2000) for the long- (> 1　s) and short-period (< 1 s) components, respectively, using the 3-D velocity structure model.\nAs the engineering significance of scenario earthquake ground motion prediction is increasing, thorough verification and validation are required for the simulation methods. This study presents the self-validation of the recipe for two MW6.6 crustal events in Japan, the 2000 Tottori and 2004 Chuetsu (Niigata) earthquakes. We first compare the simulated velocity time series with the observation. Main features of the velocity waveforms, such as the near-fault pulses and the large later phases on deep sediment sites are well reproduced by the simulations. Then we evaluate 5% damped pseudo acceleration spectra (PSA) in the framework of the SCEC Broadband Platform (BBP) validation (Dreger et al. 2015). The validation results are generally acceptable in the period range 0.1 – 10 s, whereas those in the shortest period range (0.01-0.1 s) are less satisfactory. We also evaluate the simulations with the 1-D velocity structure models used in the SCEC BBP validation exercise. Although the goodness-of-fit parameters for PSA do not significantly differ from those for the 3-D velocity structure model, noticeable differences in velocity waveforms are observed. Our results suggest the importance of 1) well-constrained 3-D velocity structure model for broadband ground motion simulations and 2) evaluation of time series of ground motion as well as response spectra.",

We perform a systematic detection of volcano-tectonic earthquakes beneath TVG using three dense, small-aperture seismic arrays, which were deployed for six months in 2012. We use broadband frequency-wavenumber beam forming and moving-window grid-search methods to compute array parameters for all nearly continuous data and identify volcano-tectonic earthquakes. We detect much more events than that listed in the TVG volcano-tectonic earthquake catalog, about 50 events per month.

            "abstract": "Iron oxides can bind particularly large amounts of organic matter (OM) and seem to be an important control on OM storage in many soils. To better understand the interactions between Fe oxides and OM, we produced ferrihydrite-OM associations by adsorption and coprecipitation in laboratory experiments. Because ferrihydrites are often formed in OM-rich solutions, we assume that coprecipitation is a common process in nature. In contrast to adsorption on pre-existing ferrihydrite surfaces, coprecipitation involves adsorption, occlusion (physical entrapment of OM), formation of Fe-OM complexes, and poisoning of ferrihydrite growth. The reactivity of coprecipitates may therefore differ from ferriydrites with adsorbed OM.\nIncubation experiments with an inoculum extracted from a Podzol forest-floor were carried out to quantify the mineralization of the adsorbed and coprecipitated organic matter. These experiments showed that the association with ferrihydrite stabilized the associated organic matter, but that differences in the degradability of adsorbed and coprecipitated organic matter were small. We therefore conclude that coprecipitation does not lead to a significant formation of microbial inaccessible organic matter domains.\nMicrobial reduction experiments were performed using Geobacter bremensis. We observed that increasing amounts of associated OM led to decreasing initial reaction rates and a decreasing degree of dissolution. Reduction of coprecipitated ferrihydrites was faster than reduction of ferrihydrites with adsorbed OM.\nOur data demonstrate that the association with ferrihydrite can effectively stabilize labile polysaccharides. Vice versa, these polysaccharides may protect ferrihydrite from reduction by Geobacter-like bacteria. However, a challenge for future studies will be to link formation and degradation of mineral-organic associations to natural porous systems, that is, to the complex interplay of mass transport and microbial distribution in the undisturbed soil.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical observations in Northeast Japan indicate its complex mantle wedge dynamics: in particular, 1) narrow low-seismic-velocity regions extending from the back-arc into the sub-arc mantle, so called “hot fingers” [Tamura et al., 2002], and 2) abrupt rotation of the seismically fast polarization direction from trench-normal to trench-parallel beneath the arc [Nakajima and Hasegawa, 2004]. Although the origin of hot fingers is not well understood, its strong spatial correlation with volcanic clustering at surface indicates that they play an important role in controlling arc volcanism. The cause of trench-parallel fast direction in the fore-arc mantle is also unclear; it has been attributed to a range of mechanisms, such as trench-normal mantle wedge flow, the presence of B-type olivine and trench-parallel alignment of melt pockets in the mantle wedge, and hydration along trench-parallel deep-cutting faults in the subducting slab. In this study, we examine the effects of hot fingers on the mantle wedge flow pattern and thermal structure beneath the arc and forearc through three-dimensional numerical experiments and investigate its implications for volcanic spacing and seismic anisotropy in Northeast Japan. In the model, the effects of hot fingers are implemented by imposing thermal anomalies on the back-arc-side vertical boundary. We found that the presence of hot fingers results in 3-D dynamic pressure gradients, which induce local along-arc mantle flow between hot fingers beneath the fore-arc, consistent with the observed pattern of seismic anisotropy in the mantle wedge. Between hot fingers, the along-arc mantle flow in the fore-arc suppresses corner flow, causing lower temperatures in the mantle wedge and in the upper portion of the subducting slab. The cooler condition is likely to hinder the dehydration of the subducting slab and flux melting in the mantle wedge, and this can explain the paucity of Quaternary arc volcanism between hot fingers in Northeast Japan.

            "abstract": "Based on SAFIR3000 Lightning Location Network and radar information, 89 linear mesoscale convective systems occurred in Beijing area are analyzed from the year of 2007 to 2011. All the linear convective systems are classified to six categories by radar morphologies, including leading convective lines with trailing stratiform region (TS), leading stratiform region trailing convective region (LS), leading convective lines with no stratiform region (NS), bow echo of leading line (BE), leading convective lines with parallel stratiform region (PS). The results show that linear convective systems occurred frequently in summer time over Beijing area, particularly the TS and LS mode, accounted for 61% of the linear MCSs. According to synoptic chart, the 89 linear convective systems are mainly influenced by cold vortex, wind shear, moving trough and western Pacific subtropical high. The lightning activities of linear MCSs including TS MCSs, LS MCSs and PS MCSs which are most frequent of three categories are discussed. On average, lightning mainly located in the linear convective region, and less or no lightning located in the trailing stratiform region. The lightning are mainly located in the strong radar echo of TS, LS and PS mode in the mature stage, but lightning activities present apparent different in the dissipating stage. At the dissipating stage, the lightning occurred gradually increased in the stratiform region of TS mode, whereas there is no lightning occurred in the stratiform region of LS mode, and +CG lightning take account for large percentage in PS MCSs.",

According to the study of Zeller and Dreschoff (1990), the radioactivity values of Lichen hills and Frontier Mt. area in the Victoria Land were very high. To identify the geochemical characteristics of granitic rocks in these areas, 13 samples of Lichen Hills rocks and 4 samples of Outback Nunatak rocks are analyzed. For mineralogical study, samples were observed in macroscale as well as microscale including microscope electron probe analysis. Rock samples of Lichen Hills, Outback Nunatak are mainly leucogranite and granitic pegmatite. These rock samples are composed of quartz, k-feldspar, plagioclase, muscovite, garnet, tourmaline like granite. In SEM-EDS analysis, the observed light colored minerals show relatively high Th, U, Dy, Ce, Nb concentration. This suggests that rock samples may contain minerals such as fergusonite, monazite, thorite, allanite, karnasurtite which are considered to be REE-bearing minerals. Samples of related rocks have been analyzed in terms of major, trace and rare earth element (REE) concentrations using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). As concentration of SiO2 increase, Al2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3, MgO, P2O5 concentration decrease and Na2O, K2O, MnO concentration increase. Analyzed trace elements and REE are normalized using CI Chondrite, Primitive mantle. The normalized data show that LREE are enriched compared to HREE. The distinct negative anomalies of Eu, Sr are observed, indicating that rock-forming melts are fairly processed state of fractional crystallization. It means that Th, U, Nb, Ta are much enriched in the melts.",

            "abstract": "Asteroids are constantly bombarded by much smaller meteoroids at extremely high speeds, which results in erosion of the material on the asteroid surface. Some of this material is vaporized and ionized, forming a plasma that is ejected into the environment around the asteroid where it can be detected by a constellation of closely orbiting nanosatellites.\nWe present a concept to leverage this natural phenomenon and to analyze this excavated material using low-power plasma sensors on nanosatellites in order to determine the composition of the asteroid surface. This concept would enable a constellation of nanosatellites to provide useful data complementing existing techniques such as spectroscopy, which require larger and more power-hungry sensors. Possible mission architectures include precursor exploratory missions using nanosatellites to survey and identify asteroid candidates worthy of further study by a large spacecraft, or simultaneous exploration by a nanosatellite constellation with a larger parent spacecraft to decrease the time required to cover the entire asteroid surface.\nThe use of meteoroid impact plasma to analyze the surface composition of asteroids will not only produce measurements that have not been previously obtained, including the molecular composition of the surface, but will also yield a better measurement of the meteoroid flux in the vicinity of the asteroid. Current meteoroid models are poorly constrained beyond the orbit of Mars, due to scarcity of data. If this technology is used to survey asteroids in the main belt, it will offer a dramatic increase in the availability of meteoroid flux measurements in deep space, identifying previously unknown meteoroid streams and providing additional data to support models of solar system dust dynamics.",

To address this, we present initial steps toward the development of a novel hydrologic model for supraglacial streamflow on the GrIS. Ice ablation and surface meteorology were measured during a 6-day field campaign in a 112 km2 ablation zone of southwest Greenland. We modeled ablation using SnowModel, an energy balance snow- and ice-ablation model. The required model inputs included standard surface meteorology and a digital elevation model (DEM), and the model outputs include all components of the energy balance and surface meltwater production for each grid cell in the ice-sheet watershed. Our next steps toward developing a complete hydrologic model for supraglacial streamflow in the ablation zone of the GrIS include the application of the meltwater-routing model HydroFlow to compare with in-situ measurements of supraglacial river discharge.",

            "abstract": "The Northern Tanzania Divergence (NTD), the youngest part of the East African Rift System, presents the opportunity to obtain insights about the birth and early stages of rifting before it progresses to mature rifting and seafloor spreading. This region is particularly interesting because the Eastern rift splits into three arms in this area and develops in a region of thick and cold lithosphere, amid the Archaean Tanzanian craton and the Proterozoic orogenic belt (the Masai block). We analyzed about two thousand seismic events recorded by the 39 broadband stations of the CRAFTI network during its two-year deployment in the NTD area in 2013 to 2014. We present the results of surface wave tomographic inversion obtained from fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves for short periods (between 4 to 14 seconds). Group velocity dispersion curves obtained via multiple filter analysis are path-averaged and inverted to produce 0.1º x 0.1º nodal grid tomographic maps for discrete periods using a 2D generalization of the Backus and Gilbert method. To quantify our results in terms of S-wave velocity structure the average group velocity dispersion curves are then inverted, using a linearized least-squares inversion scheme, in order to obtain the shear wave velocity structure for the upper 20 km of the crust. Low velocity anomalies are observed in the region 50 km south of Lake Natron, as well as in the area of the Ngorongoro crater. The implications of our results for the local tectonics and the development of the rifting system will be discussed in light of the growing geophysical database from this region.",

Size of the entrained eclogite, which controls the reaction rates with ambient peridotite, however, is very difficult to constrain using geophysical observation.\nAmong Hawaiian shield volcanoes, Koolau is the most enriched end-member in eclogite component (Frey et al, 1994). Reconstruction of Koolau volcano based on submarine study on Nuuanu landslide (AGU Monograph vol.128, 2002, Takahashi Garcia Lipman eds.) revealed that silica-rich tholeiite appeared only at the last stage (Makapuu stage) of Koolau volcano. Chemical compositions of lavas as well as isotopes change abruptly and coherently across a horizon (Shinozaki et al. and Tanaka et al. ibid.). Based on these observation, Takahashi & Nakajima (2002 ibid) proposed that the Makapuu stage lava in Koolau volcano was supplied from a single large eclogite block.\nIn order to study melting process in Hawaiian plume, high-pressure melting experiments were carried out under dry and hydrous conditions with layered eclogite/peridotite starting materials. Detail of our experiments will be given by Gao et al (2015 AGU). Combined previous field observation with new set of experiments, we propose that variation in SiO2 among Hawaiian tholeiites represent varying degree of wall-rock interaction between eclogite and ambient peridotite. Makapuu stage lavas in Koolau volcano represents eclogite partial melts formed at ~3 GPa with various amount of xenocrystic olivines derived from Pacific plate. In other words, we propose that “primary magma” in the melting column of Hawaiian plume ranges from basaltic andesite to ferro-picrite depending on the lithology of the source. Solidus of peridotite lowers significantly due to FeO, TiO2, K2O from eclogites thus PMT of Hawaiian plume may be ~1450C which is siginificantly lower than current estimates (e.g., Herzberg, 2006).",

            "abstract": "SST-forced tropical-channel simulations are used to quantify the control of shortwave (SW) parameterization on the mean tropical climate compared to other major model settings (convection, boundary layer turbulence, vertical and horizontal resolutions). The physical mechanisms whereby this control manifests are explored by the means of a large set of simulations with two widely used SW schemes. Analyses focus on the spatial distribution and magnitude of the net SW radiation budget at the surface (SWnet_SFC), latent heat fluxes, and rainfall at the annual timescale. The model skill and sensitivity to the settings tested are quantified relative to observations and reanalyses and using an ensemble approach.\nModel skill is mainly controlled by SW parameterization, especially the magnitude of SWnet_SFC and rainfall and both the spatial distribution and magnitude of latent heat fluxes over ocean. On the other hand, the spatial distribution of continental rainfall (SWnet_SFC) is mainly influenced by convection parameterization and horizontal resolution (boundary layer parameterization and orography).\nPhysical understanding of both the control of SW parameterization and sensitivity to SW schemes is addressed by analyzing the thermal structure of the atmosphere and conducting sensitivity experiments to O3 absorption and SW scattering coefficient. SW parameterization shapes the stability of the atmosphere in two different ways according to whether surface is coupled to atmosphere or not, while O3 absorption has minor effects in our simulations. Over SST-prescribed regions, increasing the amount of SW absorption warms the atmosphere only because surface temperatures are fixed, resulting in increased atmospheric stability. Over surface–atmosphere coupled regions (i.e., land points in our simulations), increasing SW absorption warms both atmospheric and surface temperatures, leading to a shift towards a warmer state and a more intense hydrological cycle. This turns in reversal model behavior between land and sea points, with the SW scheme that simulates greatest SW absorption producing the most (less) intense hydrological cycle over land (sea) points. This demonstrates strong limitations for simulating land/sea contrasts in SST-forced simulations.",

In order to consider the application of the developed technique, two dimensional SIP was tested in the area of hydro-thermal mineral deposit, Haenam in South Korea. We also acquired time-domain IP data for the same profile in order to verify the accuracy of SIP data, and compared both data after data processing and analysis completed. Separation of transmitter and receiver line was used to get more accurate data, and porous pot electrode was also used to remove the polarization effect of receiver electrodes. As results of both survey methods, we knew that resistivity images were nearly same but the chargeability and phase images were slight different. From the previous experience of SIP survey on the close test, phase anomaly was closely related and expected to the mineralized zone also in this survey. The site where the test survey was conducted was a small hills, and on the top of hill silicified alteration zone was identified which were shown as a high-resistivity anomaly on the resistivity mage. Below this high-resistivity anomaly, we identified phase anomaly that showed a consistent trend originated from the deep anomaly directly under the mountain, and it continued from south to north, and deep to shallow. This trend of phase anomaly was not clearly identified on the inverted chargeability images for the averaged chargeability of time-domain IP data. But when we use new inversion algorithm which use all the chargeability data of 20 time windows simultaneously, we got similar inverted results for the middle-time IP data. Through the test survey of SIP and IP, we know that S/N ration of SIP measurements was superior to those of IP measurement because SIP measurement was made during the transmitter on but IP measurement did not. And if we use the newly developed IP inversion algorithm, we could get more reliable inversion result for the time-domain IP data. Therefore, it is expected the SIP method should be more popular if the developed 2D SIP processing software is widely used.",

The smaller distances among the spacecraft of the recently launched Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission and the unprecedented time resolution of the plasma and field measurements of the instruments onboard MMS allow us to study the current sheet with greater details. For this analysis, we use plasma density measurements obtained both from the plasma detector as well as from plasma density estimates observed from spacecraft potential variations also derived when the spacecraft potential is under active control, i.e. the ASPOC instruments are emitting ion beams. These plasma parameters deduced from the different level of ASPOC currents are used to characterize the current sheet structures obtained from the magnetic field measurements. We focus on case studies and compare our results with previous findings from the Cluster mission. The results of this study could be a useful input for current sheet models and simulations.",

One new striking feature is the evidence of an Alfven transition layer (ATL) almost adjacent to the upper edge of the stagnant exterior cusp (SEC), through which the plasma flow transits from super (from magnetosheath) to sub-(to SEC) Alfvenic regime in a good agreement with experimental data statistics performed by Lavraud and al. (2005) but not mentioned in MHD results. Simulation results show that the ATL expands towards areas even far from the cusp region. The 3D features of this ATL are extensively analyzed in details (i) for Northward IMF, and (ii) as the IMF is rotating from Northward to Southward.",

Mineralization of the veins and crosscutting relationships gives constraints for the different generation of veins. Calcium carbonate, commonly aragonite in the upper part and calcite in the lower part of the igneous basement, is usually present in veins as a late phase following the quartz precipitation and the clay minerals formation. The sequence of vein generations in the lithified sediments close to the contact within the CCR basalt is characterized by smaller veins filled by quartz, followed by massive intersecting calcite veins. A high fluid pressure can be concluded, due to wall rock fragments embedded within the filling and fractured mineral grains in the ground mass, which are close to the veins. This requires that the magmatic basement and the lithified sediments were covered by sequences of low permeability sediments forming a barrier that enabled build up elevated fluid pressure. The investigation of fluid inclusions in the lowest units of borehole 344-U1414, give clues about the source of the fluids and about the vein evolution within the incoming Cocos Plate close to Middle American Trench. The microthermometric analyses of the primary, almost aqueous, inclusions indicate a temperature range during entrapment between 200 and 420°C. The data indicate that seawater within the Cocos Ridge aquifer communicated with high-temperature fluids and/or were modified by heat advection. We consider the Galapagos hotspot and/ or the Cocos-Nazca spreading center as heat source. Fluids originated from mobilized sediment pore water and invaded seawater. Isotope and heat flow data indicate a deep fluid source within the Cocos Plate oceanic crust too.",

With the help of satellite image data, it becomes feasible to retrieve the TLGS in a spatially continuous manner, which also accommodates local variation of TGSs. In this article, the TGSs of paddy rice in Hunan Province, China since 1995 was retrieved using times-series curves of MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). The change in TLGS and its connection to regional climate change was discussed. The results showed the advance of TGSs of double-season paddy rice and the reduction of GSL in the past 20 years, which is believed to be linked to the rise in the temperature and precipitation in the growth periods. Understanding the local variation and trend of TLGS influenced by climate change is essential for making agricultural adaptive policies to reduce the risk of crop damaged, also can provide key information for studying how multi-hazards affect crop exposure.",

            "abstract": "In continental rift zones, tectonic extension generates deep topographic depressions, typically graben or half-graben structures, confined by large border faults. Volcanism may be distributed within, at the border and outside of the depressions, and the mechanisms controlling this distribution are debated. Recently, Maccaferri et al. (2014) proposed that the reorientation of the principal stresses linked to crustal thinning and overall crustal mass redistribution in rift zones modifies the expected trajectory of ascending magma pockets and plays a fundamental role in the distribution of volcanism at the surface. However, the model does not explain why volcanism is asymmetric in most continental rift zones. The goal of this study is to investigate the relation between the characteristic distribution of volcanism at the surface, the distribution and geometry of magma storage at depth, and the observed geometric asymmetry of the grabens at most rift zones. By using a boundary element model for dike propagation and analogue laboratory experiments we evaluate the ascent path of magmatic dikes in asymmetric continental rifts.\nWe find that the position of the magma source along the cross section of the rift and its spatial extent and the asymmetry of the graben cross section are the most important factors controlling one-sided volcanic activity at surface. For dikes starting beneath the rift's center, the more asymmetric the rift structure the more likely is asymmetric volcanic activity. Dikes are deflected to the shallow rift side and no volcanism develops on the deep side or only focused in one spot. However, if the position of the magma ponding region is offset towards the deep side of the graben, the dikes tend to emerge on the rift shoulder adjacent to such deep side. To a minor extent, also the starting depth of the dikes, any topographic loading on the graben flanks due to flank uplift and the background tectonic stress impact the surface distribution of volcanism. Mostly, all the latter mechanisms influence the distance between the graben's edge and dike arrival at surface. Our analogue experiments show similar results supporting that the graben geometry and the location where the dikes nucleate are major controls on the surface distribution of the magmatism in rifts.",

The extent, long-distance effects and potential long-term changes of these two atmospheric circulations are not yet fully understood. Here, we analyse modern airborne pollen in a transition zone of seasonally alternating dominance of the Westerlies and the ISM to develop a pollen discrimination index (PDI) that allows us to distinguish between the intensities of the two circulation systems. This index is applied to interpret a continuous lacustrine sedimentary record from Lake Nam Co covering the past 24 cal kyr BP to investigate long-term variations in the atmospheric circulation systems. Climatic variations on the central TP widely correspond to those of the North Atlantic (NA) realm, but are controlled through different mechanisms resulting from the changing climatic conditions since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). During the LGM, until 16.5 cal kyr BP, the TP was dominated by the Westerlies. After 16.5 cal kyr BP, the climatic conditions were mainly controlled by the ISM. From 11.6 to 9 cal kyr BP, the TP was exposed to enhanced solar radiation at the low latitudes, resulting in greater water availability.",

            "abstract": "Proterozoic cratonic margins are structurally and magmatically complex areas of the Earth’s crust, having undergone one or more orogenic cycles. Syn- to late-orogenic plutonic suites have a profound effect on the stabilization of cratonic margins by enabling the development of a refractory and buoyant subcontinental mantle and/or lower crust from which they were derived. In addition, these intrusive bodies act as isotopic tracers to the underlying lithospheric keel and its intricate and often obscured architecture.\nIn situ multiple sulfur isotope systematics are a robust and powerful tool for fingerprinting spatially and temporally anomalous signatures found in the crust. When combined, δ34S and Δ33S have the potential to link source environment and age of a sulfur-bearing mineral. Here, we investigate the multiple sulfur isotopic signatures of two syn- to late-orogenic supersuites that form a large component of the Paleoproterozoic Capricorn Orogen of Western Australia: the ca. 1820–1775 Ma Moorarie Supersuite and the ca. 1680–1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite.\nResults from secondary ion mass spectrometry demonstrate that the magmatic pyrite from the Moorarie Supersuite yields two differing signatures with δ34S and Δ33S equal to: 1) 3.1–4.8; ~0.00, and 2) 5.1–8.4; 0.1–0.24. This dichotomy is spatially associated with unexposed seismic blocks defined by Johnson et al., (2013).\nMultiple sulfur isotope systematics also lend insight into the poorly understood formation mechanisms and sources of syn- to late-orogenic plutonic suites. The Durlacher Supersuite does not preserve sample-to-sample variation (δ34S=5.0–8.3; Δ33S=0.0), indicating that it crystallized from a widespread and homogeneous source. This is in direct contrast to the systematic δ34S and Δ33S variation preserved in the Moorarie Supersuite, a feature that we attribute to smaller batch melting of localized and isotopically separate blocks. Lastly, the Durlacher Supersuite contains anomalous within-sample +Δ33S that we interpret to reflect the entrainment of surrounding Archean crust during diapiric ascent and emplacement. This study is part of a greater effort to investigate how anomalous sulfur isotopic signatures can be transported from metallowell-endowed Archean cratons and fractionated into younger orogenic belts.",

            "abstract": "River morphology evolves in response to trade-offs among a series of environmental forcing factors, and this evolution will be disturbed if such environmental factors change. One example of response to chronic disturbance is the intensive river evolution after earthquakes in southwest China’s mountain areas. When simulating river morphological response to environmental disturbance, an exponential rate law with a specified characteristic response time is often regarded as a practical tool for quantification. As conceptual models, empirical rate law formulations can be used to describe broad brush morphological response, but their physically basis is not solid in that they do not consider the details of morphodynamic processes. Meanwhile, river evolution can also be simulated with physically-based morphodynamic models which conserve sediment via the Exner equation. Here we study the links between the rate law formalism and the Exner equation through solving the Exner equation mathematically and numerically. The results show that, when implementing a very simplified form of a relation for bedload transport, the Exner equation can be reduced to the diffusion equation, the solution of which is a Gaussian function. This solution coincides with the solution associated with rate laws, thus providing a physical basis for such formulations. However, when the complexities of a natural river are considered, the solution of the Exner equation will no longer be a simple Gaussian function. Under such circumstances, the rate law becomes invalid, and a full understanding of the response of rivers to earthquakes requires a complete morphodynamic model.",

            "abstract": "Land surface models incorporate a large number of processes, described by physical and empirical equations. The agility\nof the models to react to different meteorological conditions is artificially constrained by having hard-coded\nparameters in their equations.\nThe land surface model Noah with multiple process options (Noah-MP) is one of the standard land surface schemes in WRF\nand gives the flexibility to experiment with several model parameterizations of biophysical and hydrological\nprocesses. The model has around 80 parameters per plant functional type or soil class, which are given in tabulated\nform and which can be adjusted. Here we looked into the model code in considerable detail and found another 140\nhard-coded values in all parameterizations, called hidden parameters here, of which around 50-60 are active in\nspecific combinations of the process options.\nWe quantify global parametric sensitivities (SI) for the traditional and the hidden parameters for five model outputs\nin 12 MOPEX catchments of very different local hydro-meteorologies. Outputs are photosynthesis, transpiration,\nlatent heat, surface and underground runoff.\nPhotosynthesis is mostly sensitive to parameters describing plant physiology. Its second largest SI is for a hidden\nparameter that partitions incoming into direct and diffuse radiation. Transpiration shows very similar SI as\nphotosynthesis. The SI of latent heat are, however, very different to transpiration. Its largest SI is observed for a\nhidden parameter in the formulation of soil surface resistance, due to low transpiration in Noah-MP. Surface runoff is\nmostly sensitive to soil and infiltration parameters. But it is also sensitive to almost all hidden snow parameters,\nwhich are about 40% of all hidden parameters. The largest SI of surface runoff is to the albedo of fresh snow and the\nsecond largest to the thermal conductivity of snow. Sensitive parameters for underground runoff, finally, are a mixture\nof those of latent heat and surface runoff.\nIn summary, five of the six largest sensitivities in Noah-MP belong to hidden parameters. All other hidden parameters\nhave little effect on output variability. There are about 40 sensitive, traditional parameters in comparison. We\ntherefore recommend to include these five hidden parameters in any model assessment or calibration study.",

            "abstract": "Clouds play an important role in the Earth’s energy budget and therefore constitute a crucial element of climate change prediction. Thus, the demand for understanding the properties of clouds more accurately has been increasing and satellites have become a dominant tool for cloud observation because of their continual global coverage capability. NASA launched Aqua Earth-observing satellite on May 4, 2002. Aqua has five operating instruments (AIRS, AMSU, CERES, MODIS, and AMSR-E), which have different wavelength coverages and thus different retrieval algorithms. Among them, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) retrieve cloud liquid water path (LWP), a highly important cloud property that characterizes clouds, with different retrieval algorithms because MODIS uses VIS/NIR channels while AMSR-E uses microwave channels. In this study, the LWP data retrieved from MODIS and AMSR-E over the East Asia region will be analyzed and compared. The retrieval period is four full years (2007-2010) so that annual averages and seasonal differences can be revealed. Although a comparison of global LWP data from MOIDS and AMSR-E has been done in a previous study, the general global distributions were shown. Here, we focus on the East Asia region where seasonal LWP differences are large due to monsoon circulation and typhoons in summer months. More details will be discussed at the conference.",

            "abstract": "The McKittrick oil field is located near the western edge of the San Joaquin Basin, California. The oil field is currently in production with 480 wells producing from the Tulare, San Joaquin, Reef Ridge, Monterey, Temblor, Tumey, and Kreyenhagen formations. Within the Temblor Formation production is mainly from the Miocene Carneros and the Phacoides sandstones. Eighty-two samples from the Phacoides sandstone (2403 – 3045 m below surface) were obtained from the California Well Sample Repository to characterize and understand the diagenetic history and its influence on its reservoir properties. Petrographic thin sections were analyzed by quantitative optical petrography, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and imaging with back-scatter electron and cathodoluminescence. The Phacoides sandstone consists of fine to very coarse, poorly to well-sorted, arkosic arenites, and wackes with detrital framework grains including sub-angular quartz, K-feldspar (microcline and orthoclase), plagioclase, and lithic fragments. Ba-free, Ba-rich, and perthitic K-feldspars are present. Accessory minerals include glauconite, biotite, muscovite, magnetite, titanomagnetite, sphene, zircon, apatite, corundum, and rutile. Diagenetic alteration includes: (1) compaction, (2) mineral dissolution, (3) albitization of feldspars, alteration of biotite to pyrite and chlorite, replacement of framework grains by calcite, (4) alteration of volcanic rock fragments, (5) cementation by kaolinite, calcite and dolomite, and (6) precipitation of K-feldspar and quartz overgrowths. Early-formed fractures were healed by authigenic quartz, albite, and K-feldspars. Precipitation of carbonates and clays, rearranging of broken grains, and formation of pseudomatrix reduced primary porosity. Secondary porosity is common and formed initially by the dissolution of plagioclase (excluding albite) and volcanic fragments, and later by dissolution of calcite, dolomite, and detrital K-feldspars. Hydrocarbon emplacement was followed by precipitation of late pyrite framboids in pores containing both oil and clays; suggesting that maturation of hydrocarbons supplied S that reacted with ferrous ions in pore fluids trapped within clays.",

            "abstract": "The partitioning of W between silicate and metallic melts has important implications for the core formation. W is siderophile, but an increase affinity for silicate melts is recorded at low degrees of polymerization. We observe the same trend in our multi-anvil experiments. This phenomena has been explained intuitively based on its atomic charge and size (Siebert et al. 2011). The influence of NBO/T on the partitioning of elements has been extensively discussed in literature (Palme et al. 2011; Righter 2011a; Righter 2011b) but it does not address the problem in its entirety since structural changes imposed by compression to high pressure are not included in the NBO/T parameter.\nIn our experimental data we looked at the partitioning of W as a function of NBO/T, at 8GPa and 2000oC, and we observe a correlation with the amount of Ca present in the melt. This observation lead to the idea that the atomic volume of W and the available space in the silicate melts is responsible for the partitioning variation with NBO/T. We decided to test this hypothesis by using first principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations to look at the structural changes in the silicate melts as a function of Si/O ratio and the behaviour of W in such different environments.\nHere we present new data regarding the coordination and charge of W in different types of silicate melts and we offer a structural interpretation for the partitioning behaviour of W as a function of the degree of polymerization of silicate melts.\n",

            "abstract": "We present here two data set composed of about 20 multichannel seismic data profiles, for a total of 1102 km of data acquired in the Sicilia Channel in Italy and Marmara Sea in Turkey. The data set of Multichannel seismic reflection profiles and well information acquired for commercial purpose by oil companies in the 1970’s and 1980’s. All profiles in Sicilia Channel, which are available on .pdf files were downloaded from VIDEPI website. Other profiles in Marmara Sea were taken from Turkish Petroleum Corporation. The first step was to convert the graphic files SEG-Y format files, using SeisTrans® software. Due to the great inhomogeneity of the various seismic lines, which have been recorded from different companies with different acquisition parameters, it has been necessary a great job of homogenization and noise reduction through the use of adequate band-pass filters. Then, for each reconstructed seismic line, SEG-Y header editing was necessary in order to assign the CDP (common-depth-points) and the SP (shot points) to the corresponding geographic coordinates. The SEG-Y files so created were uploaded and archived into a project using the Kingdom Suite® seismic package. To perform the calibration of seismic data with the stratigraphic wells, the classic problem is to identify on seismic profiles the reflections corresponding to the lithological variations identified in the wells. This is because the vertical scale of the seismic data is expressed in time, while that of the wells is expressed in meters. The main unknown is then the sound velocity within the different lithologies. In order to better correlate real data reflections with the corresponding stratigraphic discontinuities, synthetic seismogram have been created from the reflectivity series obtained through acoustic impedance calculations. They represent an example of forward modeling to match as closely as possible the real seismic data.",

            "abstract": "Cloud microphysical relationships are determined by various processes that occur in clouds. The simplest and the most important process that occurs during cloud development would be the adiabatic condensational growth of cloud droplets. However, what have been observed in real clouds are often different from the cloud microphysical relationships predicted based on adiabatic condensational growth. There could be various reasons why the measured relationships deviated from adiabatic prediction but turbulent entrainment and mixing of the air above cloud top is considered to be the most important process that modulates cloud microphysical relationships especially in stratocumulus clouds. There were many studies on this issue for marine stratocumulus clouds but studies on continental stratocumulus clouds are rare. Compared to maritime stratocumulus clouds, continental stratocumulus clouds usually have very different thermodynamic and aerosol conditions. So in this study we examined microphysical relationships in continental stratocumulus clouds measured during the Routine AAF CLOUD Optical Radiative Observations (RACORO) campaign as an attempt to reveal the most dominant entrainment-mixing mechanism in these clouds. We used so called the mixing diagram and found that most cases suggested homogeneous mixing of entrained air. We also estimated the scale parameters (i.e., transition length and scale number) because they are indicative of whether entrainment-mixing mechanism is homogeneous or inhomogeneous. The estimated values were found to be critically dependent on turbulent dissipation rate and were suggestive of homogeneous mixing, compared to those estimated for marine stratocumulus clouds in our recent study. We will try to explain why such is the case for continental stratocumulus clouds.",

Spatial relationships between surface sedimentary facies distribution and benthic environments were estimated for the open-type Ganghwa tidal flat and semi closed-type Hwangdo tidal flat, Korea. In this study, we standardized the surface sedimentary facies and tidal channel index of the channel density, distance, thickness and order. To extract tidal channel information, we used remotely sensed data, such as those from the Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT)-2, KOMPSAT-3, and aerial photographs. Surface sedimentary facies maps were generated based on field data using an interpolation method.The tidal channels in each sediment facies had relatively constant meandering patterns, but the density and complexity were distinguishable. The second fractal dimension was 1.7-1.8 in the mud flat, about 1.4 in the mixed flat, and about 1.3 in the sand flat. The channel density was 0.03-0.06 m/m2 in the mud flat and less than 0.02 m/m2 in the mixed and sand flat areas of the two test areas. Low values of the tidal channel index, which indicated a simple pattern of tidal channel distribution, were identified at areas having low elevation and coarse-grained sediments. By contrast, high values of the tidal channel index, which indicated a dendritic pattern of tidal channel distribution, were identified at areas having high elevation and fine-grained sediments. Surface sediment classification based on remotely sensed data must circumspectly consider an effective critical grain size, water content, local topography, and intertidal structures.",

            "abstract": "Polar Mesospheric Summer Echoes (PMSE) have been observed for the first time by a tri-static radar system comprising the EISCAT VHF (224 MHz, 0.67 m Bragg wavelength) active radar in Tromso (Norway) and passive receiving stations in Kiruna, (Sweden) and Sodankyla (Finland). The antennas at the receiving stations, originally part of the EISCAT tri-static UHF radar system at 930 MHz, have been refitted with new feeder systems at the VHF frequency of the transmitter in Tromso. The refitted radar system opens new opportunities to study PMSE for its own sake and as a tracer of the dynamics of the polar mesosphere, a region that is difficult to investigate by other means. The measurements show that very frequently both remote receiving antennas detect coherent signals that are much greater than the regular incoherent scattering due to thermal electrons and coinciding in time and space with PMSE measured by the transmitter station in Tromso. This represents further evidence that PMSE is not aspect sensitive, as was already indicated by a less sensitive radar system in a bi-static configuration, and implying that the underlying atmospheric turbulence, at least at sub-meter scales, is isotropic in agreement with Kolmogorov’s hypothesis. Measurements also show that the vertical rate of fall of persistent features of PMSE is the same as the vertical line of sight velocity inferred from the doppler shift of the PMSE signals. This equivalence forms the basis for using PMSE as a tracer of the dynamics of the background mesosphere. Thus, it is possible to measure the 3-dimensional velocity field in the PMSE layer over the intersection volume of the three antennas. Since the signals have large signal-to-noise ratios (up to 30 dB), the inferred velocities have high accuracies and good time resolutions. This affords the possibility to make estimates of momentum flux in the mesosphere deposited by overturning gravity waves. Gravity wave momentum flux is believed to be the engine of a gigantic refrigerator that cools the polar mesospheres in summer. Momentum flux investigations will be the subject of a separate report.",

Its rupture process is well imaged by the teleseismic MUSIC back-projections (BP). Here, we perform independent back-projections of high-frequency recordings (0.5-2 Hz) from the Australian seismic network (AU), the North America network (NA) and the European seismic network (EU), located in complementary orientations. Our results of all three arrays show unilateral linear rupture path to the east of the hypocenter. But the propagating directions and the inferred rupture speeds differ significantly among different arrays. To understand the spatial uncertainties of the BP analysis, we image four moderate-size (M5~6) aftershocks based on the timing correction derived from the alignment of the initial P-wave of the mainshock. We find that the apparent source locations inferred from BP are systematically biased along the source-array orientation, which can be explained by the uncertainty of the 3D velocity structure deviated from the 1D reference model (e.g. IASP91). We introduced a slowness error term in travel time as a first-order calibration that successfully mitigates the source location discrepancies of different arrays. The calibrated BP results of three arrays are mutually consistent and reveal a unilateral rupture propagating eastward at a speed of 2.7 km/s along the down-dip edge of the locked Himalaya thrust zone over ~ 150 km, in agreement with a narrow slip distribution inferred from finite source inversions.",

            "abstract": " The fundamental challenge in understanding the origin and evolution of the continental crust is to recognize how primary mantle source, and oceanic crust, which are essentially mafic to ultramafic in composition, could differentiate into a more or less felsic compositions. It is possible to understand growth and differentiation of the continental crust by constraining the interplay of magmatism, deformation, and high-grade metamorphism in the lower crust. Here, we apply this knowledge on the lower crustal granitoids of southern India and speculate on the variations in geochemistry as a consequence of differentiation and secular evolution of the continental crust.\nThe major groups of granitoids of southern India are classified as metatonalites, comparable to typical Archaean TTGs with pronounced calc-alkaline affinity, and metagranites which are magmatic fractionation produced by reworking of early crust. Metatonalites are sodic-trondhjemites with slightly magnesian, moderate LREE (average LaN = 103) and low HREE (average YbN = 2) characerestics, where as metagranites are calc-alkaline ferroan types with enriched LREE (average LaN = 427) and HREE (average YbN = 23). Petrogenetic characteristics of granitoids illustrate continuous evolution of a primary crust into diverse magmatic units by multiple stages of intracrustal differentiation processes attributed to following tectonic scenarios: (1) formation of tonalitic magma by low- to moderate-degree partial melting of hydrated basaltic crust at pressures high enough to stabilize garnet-amphibole residue and (2) genesis of granite in a continental arc-accretion setting by an episode of crustal remelting of the tonalitic crust, within plagioclase stability field. The first-stage formed in a flat-subduction setting of an volcanic-arc, leading to the formation of tonalites. The heat budget required is ascribed to the upwelling of the mantle and/or basaltic underplating. Progressive decline in mantle potential temperature over geological time triggered the second-stage by flat-to-steep transition in subduction style. Granite so formed with its comparatively low-density induced rheological perturbations in the lower continental crust, thereby initiating foundering of the residual materials and effective differentiation of the lower crust.",

The aim of this study was to explore the likely changes of precipitation extreme changes due to future climate change. The study specifically focuses to understand the future climate change impact on variability of rainfall intensity-duration-frequency in Upper Blue Nile basin. Precipitations data from two Global Climate Models (GCMs) have been used in the study are HadCM3 and CGCM3. Rainfall frequency analysis was carried out to estimate quantile with different return periods. Probability Weighted Method (PWM) selected estimation of parameter distribution and L-Moment Ratio Diagrams (LMRDs) used to find the best parent distribution for each station. Therefore, parent distributions for derived from frequency analysis are Generalized Logistic (GLOG), Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), and Gamma & Pearson III (P3) parent distribution. After analyzing estimated quantile simple disaggregation model was applied in order to find sub daily rainfall data. Finally the disaggregated rainfall is fitted to find IDF curve and the result shows in most parts of the basin rainfall intensity expected to increase in the future. As a result of the two GCM outputs, the study indicates there will be likely increase of precipitation extremes over the Blue Nile basin due to the changing climate. This study should be interpreted with caution as the GCM model outputs in this part of the world have huge uncertainty.",

In those old rocks, large Δ33S anomalies and the variations are reported: before 2.45 Ga, the variations of values are greater than ±1‰; between 2.45 Ga and 2.0 Ga, the variations have a range from -0.1 to 0.5‰; after 2.0 Ga the variations have more smaller range from -0.1 to 0.2‰. Sulfur isotope values from the rocks before 2.0 Ga may show anomalous Δ33S values from the ancient sulfur reservoir.\nIn South Korea, the oldest rocks (ca. 2.5 Ga) are found in Daeijak Island. Major lithology of island consists of gabbroic amphibolite, tonalitic and granodioritic gneiss, and leucocratic granite, which belongs to the Gyeonggi massif. The oldest age was measured in the core of the zircon from the tonalitic protolith. Some sulfide minerals are found in amphibolite and small amount of sulfur is also included in other rocks.\nAs a preliminary study of Δ33S analysis in sulfides from the oldest rock in Korea, analysis of samples from Daeijak Island was conducted. The samples used for the analysis were amphibolite, gneiss, and leucocratic granite. Sulfur components were extracted from the each whole rock samples using CRS and thode solution. Then it was converted to SF6 to measure sulfur isotope ratios at the mass spectrometer. Δ33S values of samples are measured to give the range from -0.009 to 0.014‰. Multiple sulfur isotopes were examined for the tracers of sulfur source and sulfur cycles in ancient times.",

            "abstract": "Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a key term in the carbon cycle science. Being difficult or even impossible, at the ecosystem scale to directly quantify, various methods are used to estimate GPP, such as: eddy covariance CO2 flux partitioning, carbonyl sulfide exchange, sun-induced fluorescence, isotopes of CO2, and the photochemical reflectance index. The primary source of global GPP estimates is the FLUXNET project within which GPP is estimated in a consistent fashion through eddy covariance flux partitioning at more than 700 sites globally. Since the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) reflects net uptake during daytime, when photosynthesis exceeds respiration, and net emission during nighttime due to ecosystem respiration (RECO), the eddy covariance flux partitioning is based on the idea that daytime RECO may be inferred from nighttime NEE direct measurements, and consequently GPP can be obtained by subtracting RECO from NEE. However, the main assumption underlying this approach, which is that a temperature-dependent model of RECO parametrised based on nighttime temperatures may be extrapolated to daytime temperatures, has not been conclusively tested.\nThis study investigates whether nighttime measurements of RECO provide unbiased estimates of daytime RECO. To this end we used ecosystem respiration chambers in a mountain grassland which, by keeping the vegetation in the dark during the measurement, allowed us to directly quantify RECO during both day and night. These data, pooled by day, night or day and night, were then used to parametrise temperature dependent models of RECO. Results show that day and night RECO do not follow the same relationship with temperature and that RECO inferred by using the nighttime parametrisation overestimates the true respiration. Potential reasons of this observed bias, like the overestimation of daytime mitochondrial respiration and implications for the quantification of GPP are discussed.",

            "abstract": "U­–Pb dating of rutile is an ideal tool for exploring the cooling and exhumation history of the lower crust, given its moderate closure temperature and the occurrence of rutile in relevant lithologies. We present an example from the Ivrea–Verbano Zone (IVZ, Italy), a classic section through the Permian lower crust that records high-temperature metamorphism followed by extension and exhumation associated partly with the Jurassic opening of the Alpine Tethys ocean. Granulite facies metapelites collected across ~35 km have Zr-in-rutile temperatures that record crystallisation during Permian metamorphism and anatexis, but SHRIMP U–Pb dating of rutile records cooling through 650–550 °C in the Jurassic. Rutile age distributions are dominated by a peak at ~160 Ma, with a subordinate peak at ~175 Ma. Both age populations show excellent agreement between samples, indicating that the two distinctive cooling stages they record were synchronous on a regional scale. The ~175 Ma population is interpreted to record cooling in the footwall of rift-related faults and shear zones, for which widespread activity in the Lower Jurassic has been documented along the western margin of the Adriatic plate. The ~160 Ma age population postdates the activity of all known rift-related structures within the Adriatic margin, but coincides with extensive gabbroic magmatism and exhumation of sub-continental mantle to the floor of the Alpine Tethys, west of the IVZ. We propose that this ~160 Ma early post-rift age population records regional cooling following episodic heating of the distal Adriatic margin. The partial preservation of the ~175 Ma age cluster suggests that the post-rift (~160 Ma) heating pulse was of short duration. The regional consistency of the rutile U–Pb data is in contrast to many other thermochronometers in the IVZ, demonstrating the value of this technique for probing the thermal evolution of high-grade metamorphic terranes. The decoupling between Zr-in-rutile temperatures and rutile U–Pb ages under lower crustal conditions is exploited to constrain two different parts of the T–t evolution of this section with a single mineral.",

            "abstract": "The rupture process of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake exhibits depth-dependent variations in the frequency content of seismic radiation from the plate interface. This depth-varying rupture property has also been observed in other subduction zones (Lay et al, 2012). During the Tohoku earthquake, the shallow region radiated coherent low frequency seismic waves whereas the deeper region radiated high frequency waves. Several kinematic inversions (Suzuki et al, 2011; Lee et al, 2011; Bletery et al, 2014; Minson et al, 2014) detected seismic waves below 0.1 Hz coming from the shallow depths that produced slip larger than 40-50 meters close to the trench. Using empirical green functions, Asano & Iwata (2012), Kurahashi and Irikura (2011) and others detected regions of strong ground motion radiation at frequencies up to 10Hz located mainly at the bottom of the plate interface. A recent dynamic model that embodies this depth-dependent radiation using physical models has been developed by Galvez et al (2014, 2015). In this model the rupture process is modeled using a linear weakening friction law with slip reactivation on the shallow region of the plate interface (Galvez et al, 2015). This model reproduces the multiple seismic wave fronts recorded on the Kik-net seismic network along the Japanese coast up to 0.1 Hz as well as the GPS displacements. In the deep region, the rupture sequence is consistent with the sequence of the strong ground motion generation areas (SMGAs) that radiate high frequency ground motion at the bottom of the plate interface (Kurahashi and Irikura, 2013).\nIt remains challenging to perform ground motions fully coupled with a dynamic rupture up to 10 Hz for a megathrust event. Therefore, to generate high frequency ground motions, we make use of the stochastic approach of Graves and Pitarka (2010) but add to the source spectrum the slip rate function of the dynamic model. In this hybrid-dynamic approach, the slip rate function is windowed with Gaussian noise where the duration of the time window and the starting rupture is determined by the slip rate function at each point in the fault (Dalguer et al, 2002). Finally, to validate this method we compare the synthetic seismograms with the recorded ground motion for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake up to 10 Hz.",

These structures may be subject to an ion-kinetic tearing instability, and hence generate magnetic islands and hot populations of ions associated with magnetic reconnection. It has been suggested that reconnection processes in this environment have important implications for local particle transport, influencing the porosity of the sectored heliosheath, and for the generation of anomalous cosmic rays via acceleration at reconnection sites. We study this complex environment by means of three-dimensional hybrid simulations over long time scales, in order to capture the evolution of the system from linear growth of the tearing instability at early times, to a fully developed turbulent cascade at late times. Simulations are conducted using both force-free and Harris current sheet equilibria, with varying plasma beta and guide field angle. We discuss the evolution of the magnetic topology, and how changes in the initial conditions affect reconnection rates, particle acceleration, cross-boundary transport and magnetic spectra. We also examine the effect of including an energetic population of interstellar H+ pick-up ions. Finally, given the turbulent end state in the simulations, we also investigate the multiple current sheet system as a general scenario for driving turbulence, and as an alternative to the common methods for simulating decaying turbulence.",

These magnetic fluctuations in low and middle latitudes generated by small-scale field aligned currents (FACs), and have about 10-30 seconds period along the satellites' orbit [Nakanishi et al., 2014] and about 200 (340) seconds temporal scale for meridional (longitudinal) magnetic components [Iyemori et al., 2015]. We also observed ionospheric disturbances and ground geomagnetic fluctuations just after the eruption. The 4-min period oscillations of total electron content (TEC) were observed by GPS receivers near the volcano. The 260 and 215 seconds spectral peaks in D component of ground based geomagnetic observation were found. Such oscillations and spectral peaks didn't exist before the eruption. All of these observations may have the same origin, i.e., vertical acoustic resonance between the ionosphere and the ground. In this presentation, we estimate the propagation velocity of the TEC oscillations and the spatial scale of the disturbance region in the E-layer where the FACs are generated by the ionospheric dynamo.",

            "abstract": "Shear wave splitting (SWS) inversion presents a method whereby the upper crust can be interrogated for fracture density. It is caused when a shear wave traverses an area of anisotropy, splits in two, with each wave experiencing a different velocity resulting in an observable separation in arrival times. A SWS observation consists of the first arrival polarization direction and the time delay. Given the large amount of data common in SWS studies, manual inspection for polarization and time delay is considered prohibitively time intensive. All automated techniques used can produce high amounts of observations falsely interpreted as SWS. Thus introducing error into the interpretation. The technique often used for removing these false observations is to manually inspect all SWS observations defined as high quality by the automated routine, and remove false identifications. We investigate the nature of events falsely identified compared to those correctly identified. Once this identification is complete we conduct a inversion for crack density from SWS time delay. The current body of work on linear SWS inversion utilizes an equation that defines the time delay between arriving shear waves with respect to fracture density. This equation makes the assumption that no fluid flow occurs as a result of the passing shear wave, a situation called squirt flow. We show that the assumption is not applicable in all geological situations. When it is not true, its use in an inversion produces a result which is negatively affected by the assumptions. This is shown to be the case at the test case of 6894 SWS observations gathered in a small area at Puna geothermal field, Hawaii. To rectify this situation, a series of new time delay formulae, applicable to linear inversion, are derived from velocity equations presented in literature. The new formula use a ‘fluid influence parameter’ which indicates the degree to which squirt flow is influencing the SWS. It is found that accounting for squirt flow better fits the data and is more applicable. The fluid influence factor that best describes the data can be identified prior to solving the inversion. Implementing this formula in a linear inversion has a significantly improved fit to the time delay observations than that of the current methods.",

LTR events in this study are defined by three criteria: 1) hourly rainfall exceeding 30 mm h-1 recorded at any of the automated synoptic observing system (ASOS) around Osan(Middle West) or Gwangju(South West), 2) an area of rainfall at > 1 mm h-1 (as estimated from radar reflectivity) of less than 20,000 km2, and 3) clearly defined stages of genesis and dissipation in a group of rain cells (>10 mm h-1) and these duration is shorter than 24 hours. As a result, 15 cases were selected from the summer season (June-August) over the last decade (2004-2013). It is found that all cases occurred inland during the afternoon hours and that the duration and maximum rain area of convective cells (>30 mm h-1) was less than 9 hours and smaller than 2,000 km2, respectively. The majority of cases showed the following thermodynamic characteristics: 1) strong convective available potential energy (CAPE > 1,000 J kg-1 related to surface heating, 2) weak or no convective inhibition (CIN < 50 J kg-1), 3) adequate moisture and total precipitable water (TPW ~ 55 mm), and 4) values of storm relative helicity (SRH) of less than 120 m2 s-2. These thermodynamic conditions indicated that these cases were caused by strong atmospheric instability, lifting to overcome CIN, and sufficient moisture. Our conclusion is that LTR events in the Korean peninsula occurred by deep moisture convective system. Furthermore, those systems vary according to region such as convective band(Middle west) or scattered small cells(South West).",

Both in the vertical and in the horizontal planes, wind-wave induced erosion is one of the chief processes controlling the morphodynamic evolution of shallow tidal basins. Wind-wave induced bottom shear stresses can promote the disruption of the polymeric microphytobenthic biofilm and lead to the erosion of tidal-flat surfaces and to the increase in suspended sediment concentration which in turn affects the stability of intertidal ecosystems. As an example, the Venice Lagoon has experienced strong erosion processes in the last two centuries, which progressively deepened the lagoonal bottoms, promoted the loss of fine cohesive sediments through the inlets after storms, and lead to the loss of extensive salt-marsh areas. Towards the goal of developing a synthetic theoretical framework to represent wind wave-induced resuspension events and account for their erosional effects on the long-term biomorphodynamic evolution of tidal systems, we employed a full-fledged finite element model accounting for the role of wind waves and tidal currents on the hydrodynamic circulation in shallow basins. Our analyses of the spatial and temporal characteristics of wind-induced erosion events for the actual configuration of the Venice Lagoon and for a few configurations of the last two centuries, allow us to reconstruct erosive trends typical of past Venice Lagoon configurations and to provide predictions on future scenarios for the Venice Lagoon.",

The OBS array used in this study include six stations installed in the Huatung Basin, operating during September 2012- June 2013. Three of the stations were located at ~1500 km depth and the other three were at ~4500 km depth. First, we analyze its noise correlation function (NCF) and obtain the coherency between stations in time domain. Second, we stack the cross-correlation pairs for all period for about 290 days to enhance the signal coherency. Third, we obtain the phase velocity of the surface waves, which presents ~0.5-1.5km/s in the Huatung Basin. Finally, we separate data pairs every 20 days and stack them to obtain their spectrograms, in order to inspect the seasonal changes of ambient noise. Our results show that the ambient noise is strongest in December and January. Further, we analyze the spectrum of every single station. The dominant energy peak is at 4-5sec, which is generated by second long ocean waves called short period secondary microseism (SPSM). [Chen et al., 2011]",

            "abstract": "Large-displacement plate boundary scale faults such as the Alpine Fault develop an internal architecture distinct from that of the host rock due to the effects of accumulated mechanical damage, mineralogical alteration, and potentially contrasting internal stress and pore fluid pressure regimes. The seismic velocity, density, electrical resistivity, and other properties of the faults therefore provide proxy information on parameters relvant to fault strength, locking, and slip. At in situ seismic imaging frequencies (~1 to >100 Hz), fault-hosted low velocity zones (LVZ) are observed in many faults including the San Andreas and Alpine Faults, as well as a number of subduction interface faults, but these signals lack the resolution to resolve the trade-off between length scale and magnitude of velocity anomalies in detail. They also cannot be used to detect the effects of velocity anisotropy in many cases. Borehole and sample-based measurements shed light on the fine-scale architecture of faults, which can in turn delimit permissible interpretations of seismic data. Detailed work on outcrop-derived Alpine Fault samples, DFDP-1 logs and cores, SAFOD, NanTroSEIZE, and JFAST project logs and cores, and other field and borehole examples collectively suggest: (a) brittle fault zones differ greatly in the degree to which their intrinsic elastic properties contrast with those of the wall rock depending on protolith composition, and this strongly affects the degree to which stress or fluid pressure anomalies can be detectable via seismic reflection, refraction, or tomography; (b) fault damage and core (gouge) zones are in some cases distinct from each other in Vp and Vs but not in others; and (c) seismic velocity anisotropy occurs on several nested length scales and is typically weaker in the fault core than in the surrounding damage zone or protolith.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale gravitational flank collapses of steep volcanic islands are hypothetically capable of triggering megatsunamis with highly catastrophic effects. Yet evidence for the existence and impact of collapsed-triggered megatsunamis and their run-up heights remains scarce and/or is highly contentious. Therefore a considerable debate still exists over the potential magnitude of collapse-triggered tsunamis and their inherent hazard. In particular, doubts still remain whether or not large-scale flank failures typically generate enough volume flux to result in megatsunamis, or alternatively operate by slow-moving or multiple smaller episodic failures with much lower tsunamigenic potential. Here we show that one of the tallest and most active oceanic volcanoes on Earth – Fogo, in the Cape Verde Islands – collapsed catastrophically and triggered a megatsunami with devastating near-field effects ~73,000 years ago. Our deductions are based on the recent discovery and cosmogenic 3He dating of tsunamigenic deposits - comprising fields of stranded megaclasts, chaotic conglomerates, and sand sheets – found on the adjacent Santiago Island, which attest to the impact of this megatsunami and document wave run-up heights exceeding 270 m. The evidence reported here implies that Fogo’s flank failure involved at least one sudden and voluminous event that resulted in a megatsunami, in contrast to what has been suggested before. Our work thus provides another line of evidence that large-scale flank failures at steep volcanic islands may indeed happen catastrophically and are capable of triggering tsunamis of enormous height and energy. This new line of evidence therefore reinforces the hazard potential of volcanic island collapses and stands as a warning that such hazard should not be underestimated, particularly in areas where volcanic island edifices are close to other islands or to highly populated continental margins.",

We combine zircon U-Th dating and trace element chemistry, with zircon-hosted melt inclusion compositions and volatile abundances to investigate the magmatic evolution preceding the 74 ka Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT) eruption.\nZircon have U-Th crystallization ages spanning from eruption age to > 375 ka, reinforcing earlier findings that the YTT system was long-lived. A progressive increase of U in zircon (from < 500 to ~1500 ppm) indicates that the YTT system, or a portion of it, became highly fractionated between 130-200 ka. A possible lull in zircon crystallization is contemporaneous with a previously recognized increase in chemical diversity of allanite ~110-130 ka, suggesting a period of enhanced thermal input into the system.\nWe identify two main populations of zircon-hosted melt inclusions. A low-MgO type is more evolved (> 280 ppm Rb, ~125 ppm Ba, 25-30 ppm Sr, < 0.03 wt% MgO) and has high water contents (3.8-5.7 wt% H2O), consistent with formation and storage in a highly fractionated crystal mush ~ 4-9 km deep. A high-MgO type (250-260 ppm Rb, 160-450 ppm Ba, 35-55 ppm Sr, 0.04-0.07 wt% MgO) has compositions similar to matrix glasses, and is typically less hydrous (0.5-3.5 wt% H2O), suggesting storage and degassing in a somewhat more primitive melt < 3 km deep. Melt inclusions dated via U-Th measurements of surrounding zircon zones, show no clear temporal differences between the two MgO populations. Rather, melt inclusions entrapped throughout the entire YTT history have relatively invariant major element chemistries, and have no temporal trends in volatile abundances.\nZircon-hosted melt inclusions (particularly the low-MgO type) of many ages occur within sealed reentrant melt-channels. A number of zircon grains have actively open melt channels rimmed with 1-3 μm of low-U zircon growth. These dissolution/regrowth features are texturally similar to dissolution zones with high-T overgrowths described previously in YTT quartz; collectively, these textures provide evidence of a major thermal perturbation(s) 10’s-100’s of years before the YTT eruption. We conclude that high-T recharge events occurred throughout the pre-eruptive YTT evolution, and suggest that a large recharge event triggered the cataclysmic YTT eruption.",

This volcanic island is far from the plate boundaries and the fundamental cause of the volcanic activity in this region is not understood well. To understand the origin of the island, resolving the detailed seismic velocity structures is crucial. Therefore, we applied ambient noise tomography to study the velocity structures of the island. Continuous waveform data recorded at 20 temporary and 3 permanent broad-band seismic stations are used. The group and phase velocity dispersion curves of the fundamental mode Rayleigh waves are extracted from cross-correlograms for 253 station pairs by adopting multiple filter technique. The fast marching method and the subspace method are jointly applied to construct 2-D group and phase velocity maps for periods ranging between 1 and 15 s. 1-D shear wave velocity models and their uncertainties are estimated by the Bayesian technique. The optimal number of the layers are determined at the end of the burn-in period based on the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). Final 3-D velocity model of the island is constructed by compiling 1-D models. In our 3-D model, a distinct low velocity anomaly appears beneath Mt. Halla from surface to about 6 km depth. The surficial extent of the anomaly is more or less consistent with the surface geologic feature of the third-stage basaltic eruption reported by previous studies but the vertical extension of the anomaly is not well constrained. To improve the velocity model, especially enhance the vertical resolution of the anomaly, we will apply joint analysis of the surface wave dispersions and teleseismic receiver functions. The improved model will provide more information to infer the tectonic or volcanic implications of the anomaly and unravel the origin of the strange volcanic island in South Korea.",

            "abstract": "Rolf et al. (EPSL, 2012) and Coltice et al. (Science, 2012) have previously shown that continents exert a first order influence on Earth’s mantle flow by affecting convective wavelength and surface heat flow. With stationary continents, Heron and Lowman (JGR, 2014) highlighted the decreasing role of continental insulation on subcontinental temperatures with higher Rayleigh number (Ra). However, the question whether there exists a correlation between mobile continents and elevated temperatures in the subcontinental mantle or not remains to be answered.\nContinental motion is attributed to the viscous stresses imparted by the convecting mantle and the extent of this motion depends on the heat budget of the mantle. Core-mantle boundary (CMB) heat flux, internal heating from decay of radioactive elements, and mantle cooling contribute to this heat budget. Out of these sources, CMB heat flux is not well defined. However, the recent determination of core’s high thermal conductivity requires a CMB heat flow of at least 12 TW (de Koker et al., PNAS 2012; Pozzo et al., Nature 2012; Gomi et al., PEPI 2013). Thus it is necessary to characterize the impact of basal heating on mantle dynamics with mobile continents and self-consistent plate tectonics.\nBy systematically varying parameters such as CMB temperature, continental size, mantle heating modes, and Rayleigh number; we model Boussinesq, incompressible, thermo-chemical mantle convection with 2D spherical annulus geometry using StagYY (Tackley, PEPI 2008). We observe the aforementioned correlation irrespective of the variations in basal heating and continental size (except for very small continents). Moreover, we see episodicity between correlation-anticorrelation with increasing convective vigour. Furthermore, the effect of radioactivity in the continental crust on this correlation is investigated. At present, mobile continents in StagYY are simplified into a compositionally distinct field drifting at the top of the mantle; thereby lacking the complexities of real Earth. We aim to further develop the code to allow for realistic continental growth and destruction.",

            "abstract": "We develop a technique to invert ambient noise correlations for the space-, time- and frequency-dependent distribution of noise sources, accounting for the 3D heterogeneous structure of the Earth. Noise source inversion mainly serves two purposes: First, it allows us to construct more accurate forward models for cross-correlation waveforms used in ambient noise tomography, and second, it provides new insights for better understanding source mechanisms.\nPrevious results based on a global dataset of correlations in the hum period band confirm that correlations can be used to map the seasonality of hum excitation. We obtained these results using a simple 1-D model of wave propagation with constant parameters. We now extend this mapping to a first inversion step.\nThe procedure of the inversion is the following. Starting from a homogeneous source distribution, we evaluate the asymmetry in signal energy between causal and acausal branches. This results in a first set of noise source images. We then construct forward models of correlations with a spectral element wave propagation code. Our approach to construct these models efficiently is to use source-receiver reciprocity and to assume spatial uncorrelation of noise sources. In such a setting, correlations can be calculated from a pre-computed set of Green’s functions between the seismic receivers and sources located at the Earth’s surface.\nBesides the resulting hum source model itself, key questions are how the chosen modeling approach compares to previously published approaches and in what way the 3-D structure, compared to a 1-D Earth, influences the resulting correlation waveforms.",

Mineral-contaminant relationships (i.e. adsorption, ion-exchange, desorption) are rarely pure abiotic processes. Microbes, mainly bacteria and microfungi, can catalyze several reactions modifying the element speciation, as well as the bioavailability of inorganic pollutants. Soil, sediments, and waters heavily polluted with PTEs through AMD processes are a potential reservoir of extremophile bacteria and fungi exploitable for biotechnological purposes. Two different AMD related colloids, an ochraceous precipitate (deposited in weakly acidic conditions, composed by nanocrystalline goethite) and a greenish-blue precipitate (deposited at near-neutral pH, composed by allophane + woodwardite) were sampled. The aims of this work were to a) characterize the mycobiota present in these colloidal minerals by evaluating the presence of alive fungal propagules and extracting bacteria DNA; b) verify the fungal strains tolerance, and bioaccumulation capability on greenish-blue and ZnSO4 enriched media; c) evaluate potential impact of bacteria in the system geochemistry.\nThe preliminary results show an interesting and selected mycobiota able to survive under unfavourable environmental conditions. A significant number of fungal strains were isolated in pure culture. Among them, species belonging to Penicillium and Trichoderma genera were tested on both greenish-blue and ZnSO4 enriched media. The results show a significant tolerance and bioaccumulation capability to some PTEs. The same colloidal precipitates were processed to extract bacteria DNA by using a specific procedure developed for sediments. The results give a good yield of nucleic acids and a positive PCR amplification of 16S rDNA accomplished the first step for future metagenomic analyses.",

The new realization, the ICRF-3, is being prepared not only with more observations but also with addressing two completely new features. The first one is an extension of the observing frequency range, the second one is an attempt to rigorously combine individual VLBI solutions. In a further step, the combined VLBI data set may be rigorously linked to the other space-geodetic techniques, GNSS, SLR, and DORIS. With this multi-step combination, a consistent realization of TRF, EOP, and CRF will be possible.\nThe combinations are carried out primarily on the basis of datum-free normal equation systems (NEQ). The first step is an accumulation of all solutions for IVS and VLBA Calibrator Survey observations at X/S band. For the second combination step, a special Ka/X band solution with fully populated covariance matrix has to be converted to an NEQ, and the third step is the combination of the final VLBI solution with that of the other space-geodetic techniques.

We use this framework for understanding how data can communicate across contexts to answer the question: Can coupling climate-related indicators with data provenance support scientific innovation and science translation? To address this question we conducted a study to understand the features and capabilities necessary for indicators and data provenance for scientific uses, using the recently online-released U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) Indicators and Global Change Information System (GCIS) as linked boundary objects. We conducted semi-structured interviews with professional researchers in which we asked the researchers to explore and describe what they observed that was useful or frustrating for a subset of the USGCRP Indicators, related GCIS content, and other similar indicator and metadata websites. Participants found these sites' navigation and the labeling and description of their assets frustrating and confusing, but were able to clearly articulate the metadata and provenance information they needed to both understand and trust the indicators. In addition to identifying desired features that are likely to be specific to this audience (e.g., references or citations for indicators), scientists wanted clear, easier-to-access provenance information of the type usually recommended for documenting research data. Notably, they felt the information would be best presented in a fashion accessible to a broader audience, as those with more technical expertise should be able to infer additional contextual details given the provenance information that they had identified as key. Such results are useful for the improvement of indicator systems, such as the prototype released by USGCRP. We note in particular that the consistency of responses across the multi-disciplinary sample, which included scholars in astrophysics, geography, marine biology, and conservation ecology, suggests that data and indicators have strong potential to serve as boundary objects to bridge diverse spaces, and may provide a useful point of reference for establishing interdisciplinary collaboration.",

            "abstract": "Robust knowledge about processes involved in glacial melt-water drainage is crucial for a complete understanding of ice sheets. Investigating sediments and geomorphology of drainage systems below ice sheets is complicated; however, formerly glaciated regions are easily accessible. On the South Swedish Uplands, in the area covered by Fennoscandian ice sheets (FIS) during the late Quaternary, there is a diversity of hummocky tracts. For over a century, the hummocky characteristics of this region have been recognized, and several explanations have been proposed since. Most of these studies describe hummocks shown to be products of stagnant ice. The advent of LiDAR has revealed details of the landscape never before seen. We have mapped and analyzed glacial landforms on detailed DEMs from the region, and can present a more diverse view of the hummocky tracts. The four most striking features apart from the diversity are the spatial distribution and morphology. First, there are distinct elongate zones of hummocks with a radial pattern. Second, the hummocky zones in some places show an anastamosing and in other place a dendritic pattern. Third, in analyzing these elongate zones, it is clear that they do not follow regional lows but instead runs over highlands. Fourth, in these zones there are localities with eskers superposed on hummocks. These observations let us propose that stagnant ice cannot be the only process responsible for the hummocky tracts of SSU. In the field we have investigated the stratigraphy in sections. Preliminary results show that the stratigraphy cannot be readily interpreted as till from stagnant ice. Taken together, these observations can possibly explain the elongate hummocky zones invoking processes of subglacial meltwater eroding hummocks in the bottom of tunnel valleys. If these distinct elongate hummocky zones are not stagnant ice features but produced by subglacial meltwater they would alter the view of the FIS deglaciation significantly.",

            "abstract": "The Tjörnes Fracture Zone (TFZ) connects the Northern Volcanic Zone to the Mid-Atlantic ridge north of Iceland. It primarily consists of two transform structures, the Húsavík-Flatey Fault (HFF) and the Grímsey Oblique Rift (GOR), which together have experienced about ten M>6 earthquakes since 1750. There is growing concern that a large earthquake may be due in the TFZ. The GOR and the northwestern part of the HFF have been seismically very active during the past two decades, often in the form of seismic swarms of various intensity and duration. The most energetic swarms during this period took place in October 2012 and March 2013, with several M>5 earthquakes. These and previous swarms occurred offshore and are poorly understood, in particular regarding the physical mechanism behind their generation and to what extent the swarm-like activity might temporally or permanently modify the hazard in the entire TFZ.\nHere we study the spatio-temporal pattern of earthquake swarms occurring in the TFZ since 1996. We find that the swarms show spatial complementarity, i.e., in general they do not overlap spatially with earlier swarms. Moreover, together they have progressively filled up the entire GOR and the western half of the HFF. Each swarm shows a clear migration of hypocenters on their respective fault planes. This is particularly visible in the September-October 2012 and March 2013 sequences, where the earthquakes expanded concentrically from a central, focused patch on the fault to the entire fault area excited by seismicity. The swarms typically start as very localized microseismicity, lasting for a few hours to a few days. Then, the hypocenter area starts to expand, with earthquakes migrating at velocities ranging from 1 km/day up to 1 km/h. The migration sometimes accelerates or decelerates, depending on the case, and then comes to a sudden stop, with microseismicity continuing on the fault plane for a few days or weeks. The estimated rupture duration and rupture velocity scale with the estimated seismic moment as previously identified slow slip events in subduction zones or on transform faults. The properties of the swarms in the TFZ therefore point to an interesting sequence of nucleation, propagation and arrest of transient slip in a fault zone with a complex rheology and to an interesting form of strain release and seismic cycle.",

            "abstract": "Understanding fjord circulation in Greenland’s outlet glacial fjords is crucial to explaining recent temporal and spatial variability in glacier dynamics, as well as freshwater transport on the continental shelf. The fjords are commonly assumed to exhibit a plume driven circulation that draws in warmer and saltier Atlantic-origin water toward the glacier at depth. Freshwater input at glacier termini directly drives this circulation and significantly influences water column stratification, which indirectly feeds back on the plume driven circulation. Previous work has focused on freshwater inputs from surface runoff and submarine melting, but the contribution from iceberg melt, a potentially important freshwater source, has not been quantified. Here, we develop a new technique combining in situ observations of movement from iceberg-mounted GPS units with multispectral satellite imagery from Landsat 8. The combination of datasets allows us to examine the details of iceberg movement and quantify mean residence times in a given fjord. We then use common melt rate parameterizations to estimate freshwater input for a given iceberg, utilizing novel satellite-derived iceberg distributions to scale up to a fjord-wide freshwater contribution. We apply this technique to Rink Isbræ and Kangerlussuup Sermia in west Greenland, and Helheim Glacier in southeast Greenland. The analysis can be rapidly expanded to look at other systems as well as seasonal and interannual changes in how icebergs affect the circulation and stratification of Greenland’s outlet glacial fjords. Ultimately, this work will lead to a more complete understanding of the wide range of factors that control the observed regional variability in Greenland’s glaciers.",

The rupture affected the crustal Beichuan fault, with both thrusting and dextral slide slip components. This fault is responsible for the exhumation of the basement over Triassic sediments. Several paleoseismological studies have well constrained the Quaternary activity of this fault, and thermochronological data show a rapid exhumation starting from Oligocene. The total offset of the Beichuan fault remains unknown.\nSamples collected in the hanging wall of the Beichuan fault, yield stable white mica, chlorite, epidote and quartz. Chemical and thermobarometric analyses of metamorphic minerals yield metamorphic peak conditions at 300±50°C and 7-8 kbar. Such P,T conditions suggest burial to 18-20 km depth, and represent the maximum vertical offset of the Beichuan fault. Comparison of results from distant sampled sites along the Beichuan fault reveals the spatial continuity of this offset along the Beichuan fault.\nThe attainment of peak pressure conditions will be dated using in-situ laser ablation 40Ar/39Ar dating of the metamorphic micas. This will help constrain the onset of Beichuan fault activation, which corresponds to the onset of thick skin deformation in the Longmen Shan.\n [CW1]I deleted all this stuff below because I thought it was too much information for a conference abstract – but you do have space to put it back.",

            "abstract": "Electroseismic methods which are the opposite of seismo-electric methods have only been little investigated up to now especially in the near surface scale. These methods can generate the solid-fluid relative movement induced by the electric potential in fluid-filled porous media. These methods are the response of electro-osmosis due to the presence of the electrical double layer. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations of electroseismic studies have been performed. Electroseismic measurements conducted in micro glass beads saturated with demineralized water. Pair of 37 x 37 mm square aluminium grids with 2 mm of aperture and 4 mm of spacing is used as the electric dipole that connected to the electric power source with the voltage output 150 V. A laser doppler vibrometer is the system used to measure velocity of vibrating objects during measurements by placing a line of reflective paper on the surface of media that scattered back a helium-neon laser. The results in homogeneous media shows that the compressional waves induced by an electric signal. We confirm that the results are not the effects of thermal expansion. We also noticed that there are two kinds of the compressional waves are recorded: fast and slow P-waves. The latter, Biot slow waves, indicate the dominant amplitude. Moreover, we found that the transition frequency (ωc) of Biot slow waves depends on mechanical parameters such as porosity and permeability. The ωc is not affected when varying conductivity of the fluid from 25 - 320 μS/cm, although the amplitude slightly changed. For the results in two layer media by placing a sandstone as a top layer shows that a large amount of transmission seismic waves (apparently as Biot slow waves) rather than converted electromagnetic-to-seismic waves. These properties have also been simulated with full waveform numerical simulations relying on Pride’s (1994) using our computer code (Garambois & Dietrich, 2002). If it is true that the electric source in the safe voltage range generates seismic waves dominantly, it may be a reason of electro-osmosis dewatering technique to transport liquids. And this source may be used an alternative as a seismic source in geophysical exploration.",

We present rock magnetic data of the upper 160 mcd (<900 ka) from hole 1063D that show magnetic properties vary in concert with glacial cycles. Magnetite appears to be the main magnetic carrier in the carbonate-dominated interglacial horizons, yet exhibits contrasting grain size distributions depending on the redox state of the horizons. Higher contributions of single domain magnetite exist above the present day sulfate reduction zone (ca. 44 mcd) with relatively higher multidomain magnetite components below that likely arise from the partial dissolution of SD magnetite in the deeper, anoxic horizons. Glacial horizons on the other hand, characterized by enhanced terrigenous deposition, show no evidence for diagenetic dissolution but do indicate the presence of authigenic greigite close to glacial maxima (acquisition of gyro-remanence, strong magnetostatic interactions and SD properties). Glacial horizons contain hematite (maxima in HIRM and S-Ratio consistent with a reddish hue) and exhibit higher ARM anisotropy and pronounced sedimentary fabrics. We infer that post depositional processes affected the magnetic grain size and mineralogy of Bermuda rise sediments deposited during the late Pleistocene. Hematite concentration is interpreted to reflect primary terrigenous input that is likely derived from the Canadian Maritime Provinces. A close correlation between HIRM and magnetic foliation suggests that changes in sediment composition (terrigenous vs. marine biogenic) were accompanied by changes in the depositional processes at the site.",

We investigated both the loads and ages of carbon exported by the five largest rivers in South Korea using seasonal sampling and dual carbon isotope analysis for 2012 – 2013. Annually a total of 581 Gg of carbon (DIC, DOC, and POC combined) was transported to the ocean through the five rivers, releasing 7.6, 1.7, and 0.8 g-C m-2 yr-1 of DIC, DOC, and POC, respectively, which accounted for 80%, 14%, and 6% of the annual loads of riverine carbon, respectively. About 37-45% of annual riverine DIC loads, 37-51% of DOC loads, and 33-47% of POC loads were released from the basins during the summer monsoon (June – August) indicating strong effects of precipitation in the riverine carbon export. Modern to ~1,020 years old carbon was released from the five river basins. The δDI13C and ΔDI14C showed a negative correlation in each river whereas no consistent correlation was observed between δDO13C and ΔDO14C, suggesting a large variation in DOC sources. Riverine POC load increased sharply after a typhoon and ΔPO14C was higher in summer than winter in the five rivers. The results suggested that both quantity and quality of riverine carbon released from the five largest basins could be strongly influenced by the Asian monsoon climates and that relatively young dissolved carbon could be predominantly released as the intensity and frequency of storms increase.",

            "abstract": "Submarine canyons act as major conduits of sediment from shallow- to deep-sea regions, yet the sedimentary processes operating within them are poorly understood. This stems from the relative inaccessibility of such complex environments and therefore the difficulty of making direct observations. As a result, much of our understanding of the dynamics of sediment-laden flows in submarine canyons results from making inferences from the deposits that they leave behind in the geological record. This study tests how well geological deposits in the canyon can be used to reconstruct the flows that created them by comparing the sedimentary record on the floor, benches and walls of Monterey canyon, offshore California, with the sediments collected in sediment traps during flow events. The project makes use of systematic transects of precisely located push cores and vibracores that were collected using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The cores were collected by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) at approximately 300 m, 500 m, 800 m, 1000 m, 1200, and 1500 m water depth, with three of these in the vicinity of sediment traps deployed in 2002 by the US Geological Survey. Laser particle-size analysis of the grain sizes present in the push cores was directly compared to the grain size of deposits from the sediment traps, previously analysed using the same technique. A key result suggests that using deposits to reconstruct flows may not be as straightforward as previous studies have assumed. For example the size of sediment found draping the canyon walls can be very different from that collected in sediment traps at the same heights and locations. Two hypotheses are outlined to explain reasons for this unexpected sediment distribution: (1) The vertical sediment distribution is not uniform along the canyon transect, corresponding to differences in turbulence intensity as a result of variations in flow depth and distance from the canyon wall, and (2) flows or not erosive or depositional and therefore bypass sand down-system.",

            "abstract": "The underground Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) at Äspö, Sweden, is located in granitic rock and dedicated to investigations concerning deep geological disposal of radioactive waste. Several in-situ experiments have been performed in the HRL, among them the recent Buffer-Rock Interaction Experiment (BRIE) and, on a much larger scale, the long-term Prototype Repository (PR) experiment.\nInterpretation of such experiments requires a profound understanding of the groundwater flow system. Often assumed is a conceptual model where the so-called “intact rock” is interspersed with stochastically distributed fractures. It is also a common assumption, though, that fractures in granite exist on all length-scales implying that the hydraulically relevant rock porosity is basically made up of micro fractures.\nThe conceptual approach of GRS’ groundwater flow code d3f thus appeared to be fitting where large fractures are represented discretely by lower-dimensional features while the remaining set of smaller fractures – also called “background fractures” – is assumed to act like an additional homogeneous continuum besides what is believed to be the undisturbed matrix. This approach was applied to a hydraulic model of the BRIE in a cube-like domain of 40 m side length including drifts, boreholes and three intersecting large fractures. According to observations at the underground rock laboratories Stripa and the HRL a narrow zone of reduced permeability – called “skin” – was additionally arranged around all geotechnical openings. Calibration of the model resulted in a considerable increase of matrix permeability due to adding the effect of the background fractures.\nTo check the validity of this approach the calibrated data for the BRIE were applied to a model for the PR which is also located in the HRL but at quite some distance. The related brick-shaped model domain has a size of 200 m x 150 m x 50 m. Fitting the calculated outflow from the rock to the measured outflow distribution along the PR-tunnel and the outflow into the six “deposition boreholes” nevertheless required only a moderate modification of the initially used permeabilities. By and large the chosen approach for the BRIE can thus be considered to have been successfully transferred to the PR.",

            "abstract": "The Barents Sea shelf was subjected to both tectonic- and glacially-driven erosion during the Cenozoic. It is however unclear which of the erosion mechanisms had the most important role in generating net erosion that indicates a total effect of all erosion events. The literature estimates of glacial to tectonic erosion ratio vary significantly and often do not account for regional variations. The tectonic erosion is often attributed to plate reorganization in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea during the Cenozoic. The literature shows wide diversity of opinions regarding timing and thickness of the tectonic erosion. In contrast, glacial erosion thickness estimates are well constrained and show lower discrepancy in results. The glacial erosion thickness estimates are therefore key information that can be used for constraining the ratio between tectonic and glacial erosion. The glacial contribution to the net erosion is however also controlled by on-shelf deposition that counteracts the process of glacial erosion. However the on-shelf deposition rates have never been calculated. In result, the Pleistocene sediment budget and glacial contribution to the net erosion has never been assessed yet.\nThe Pleistocene contribution to the net erosion was approached by a new Monte-Carlo-type method where the Pleistocene-Holocene sediment budget is calculated and the net erosion thickness is determined as a balance between total deposition and erosion thicknesses. The proposed method requires definite ages of glacial and interglacial periods what is not available in the literature. The timeframe was established by using a new approach based on the regional ice-sheet volume curve. Also, the new glacial/interglacial timeframe enables calculating the erosion rates for glacial duration (103 – 104 yr) timescale what have not been performed before.\nThe results show that the western Barents Sea was glaciated during 4 marine isotope stages for a total duration of 29 kyr. The glacial erosion rates range between 25 and 40 mm/yr. On-shelf deposition rates vary from 0 to 35 mm/yr. In the western Barents Sea the net erosion was found to be mainly the effect of tectonic uplift and subsequent erosion prior to the glacial ages. The results show that the Pleistocene glaciations did not or slightly contributed to development of the net erosion.",

The TDS instrument can provide burst mode electric fields data with as long as 16384 sample points at 250 kHz sampling rate. In all 1120 suspected reconnection events, it is found that the most commonly occurred waves are neither ion acoustic waves, electrostatic solitary waves, nor Langmuir/upper hybrid waves, but Bernstein-like waves with harmonics of the electron cyclotron frequency. In addition, to each type of waves, Langmuir/upper hybrid waves reveal the largest occurrence rate in the reconnection region than in the ambient solar wind. These results indicate that Bernstein-like waves and Langmuir/upper hybrid waves might play important roles in the reconnection associated particle heating processes and they might also influence the dissipation of magnetic reconnection.",

First, near-seafloor magnetic anomalies display characteristic sequences of magnetic intensity variations that we confidently identified by comparison with published paleointensity curves for the Brunhes period and used as a dating tool. This approach is further confirmed by the linear trend relating the NRM (Natural Remanent Magnetization) and paleointensity measured on rock samples along the same section. Second, valid K-Ar and Ar-Ar ages are determined on enriched basalt samples collected by deep-sea submersible. They show an excellent coincidence with the magnetic ages and support the use of high-resolution, near-seafloor marine magnetic anomalies as an efficient tool to date the young magmatic oceanic crust, where radiometric methods are generally unpractical, with unprecedented resolution. The ages obtained on the CIR reveal a 150-200 kyr cyclicity in the magmatic and tectonic processes of seafloor formation, two ridge jumps of 2.5 km and 1.2 km, respectively, and a systematic spreading asymmetry in favor to the Indian flank which may result from the interaction of the CIR with the Reunion hotspot.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological and bio-geochemical processes in catchments are largely determined by the flow pathways of water through the subsurface. While the properties of the input (precipitation) and the output (streamflow) can be monitored with relatively low expenditure, subsurface flow processes and travel times remain difficult to quantify. A comprehensive understanding of these physical mechanisms is, however, crucial for a sustainable management of water resources.\nNatural tracers, such as stable isotopes of water (18O and 2H), in combination with other water quality parameters allows for studying various hydrological and associated processes in great detail. To follow the dynamics in rapidly changing hydrologic systems, high temporal resolution measurements of water isotopes and other constituents is required.\nHere, we present first results from an extensive field experiment in Switzerland where rain- and river water samples are sampled and analyzed directly in the field every 30 minutes. With this, sample degradation during storage and transportation can be minimized. At the same time, errors due to the collection and handling of numerous water samples are avoided.\nThe fully automated monitoring system is comprised of the newly developed Continuous Water Sampler Module (CoWS), which was coupled to a Picarro L2130-i Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer (Picarro Inc., USA), to continuously measure 18O and 2H. Optical and electrochemical sensors together with a spectrometer probe monitor NO3-, DOC and physico-chemical parameters, such as oxygen content, pH, electrical conductivity (s::can Messtechnik GmbH, Vienna). An ion chromatograph (Metrohm, Switzerland) allows for precise measurements of the major anions and cations. For quality control, additional water samples are taken automatically at the same frequency and analyzed in the laboratory.",

We integrated information on hydraulic state variables measured during transport, optimal parameters obtained from a numerical solution of a convection dispersion reaction model, structure of the flow field derived from morphological analysis and a classical DLVO model extended for hydrophobic interaction to understand the governing transport dynamics. The citrate-coated Ag NP were relatively more mobile compared to the “soil-aged” Ag nanoparticles explained by the differences in solution chemistry. Two processes are peculiar to both citrate-coated and “soil-aged” Ag nanoparticles: retardation and irreversible straining attributed to the air-water and solid-water interfaces respectively. However, the retardation seems to be less pronounced for the “soil-aged” Ag nanoparicles which could be explained by the differences in nanoparticle properties. As an additional phenomenon, cation brigding complexation is suggested for the “soil-aged” Ag nanoparticles due to the presence of multivalent cations. We suggest coupled physical and chemical processes during transport which could be fairly well described by the proposed convection-dispersion-reaction model.",

            "abstract": "Large negative trends of atmospheric CO concentrations in the recent decade are observed by both surface measurements and satellite retrievals over many regions globally. However, this decrease in CO concentration cannot be fully explained by current emission inventories. Here, we aim at attributing the observed CO concentration decline using an atmospheric inversion that simultaneously optimizes CO sources (from surface emissions and atmospheric oxidations of hydrocarbons) and CO sinks (through reaction with oxidant hydroxyl radical OH in the atmosphere) with observational constraints of CO and other chemically related trace gases. Satellite retrievals of CO total column from the latest product v6 of MOPITT sensor together with surface in-situ measurements of methane and methyl chloroform are assimilated for the period from 2002 to 2011. The optimized concentrations are evaluated with independent observations. Sensitivity tests of ACTM latitudinal/vertical resolution, prior OH fields, and additional observational constraints are discussed. The optimized CO budgets indicate that the CO concentration decline is primarily caused by a decrease in the CO emissions by 3% yr-1, whereas no significant trends are found at the global scale for the chemical CO sources and for the OH concentrations that regulate CO sinks. We highlighted some regional inconsistencies between bottom-up and top-down results. In contrast to bottom-up inventories, the inversion finds negative trends over China and positive trends over Africa.",

            "abstract": "Previously we have shown how principles based on productivity maximization (e.g. maximization of net primary production, net growth maximization, or functional balance) can explain allocation responses to resources, such as nutrients and light (\nFranklin et al., 2012\n). However, the success of these approaches depend on how well they align with the ultimate driver of plant behavior, fitness, or life time reproductive success. Consequently, they may not fully explain how allocation changes during the life cycle of trees where not only growth but also survival and reproduction are important. In addition, maximizing instantaneous productivity does not account for path dependence of tree growth. For example, maximizing productivity during early growth in shade may delay emergence in the forest canopy and reduce lifetime fitness compared to a more height oriented strategy. Here we present an approach to model how growth of stem diameter and leaf area in relation to stem height dynamically responds to light conditions in a way that maximizes life-time fitness (rather than instantaneous growth). The model is able to predict growth of trees growing in different types of forests, including trees emerging under a closed canopy and seedlings planted in a clear-cut area. It can also predict the response to sudden changes in the light environment, due to disturbances or harvesting. We envisage two main applications of the model, (i) Modeling effects of forest management, including thinning and planting (ii) Elucidating height growth strategies in trees and how they can be represented in vegetation models.\n ",

            "abstract": "Bayesian solutions to inverse problems in near-surface geophysics and hydrology have gained increasing popularity as a means of estimating not only subsurface model parameters, but also their corresponding uncertainties that can be used in probabilistic forecasting and risk analysis. In particular, Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods have attracted much recent attention as a means of statistically sampling from the Bayesian posterior distribution. In this regard, two approaches are commonly used to improve the computational tractability of the Bayesian-MCMC approach: (i) Forward models involving a simplification of the underlying physics are employed, which offer a significant reduction in the time required to calculate data, but generally at the expense of model accuracy, and (ii) the model parameter space is represented using a limited set of spatially correlated basis functions as opposed to a more intuitive high-dimensional pixel-based parameterization. It has become well understood that model inaccuracies resulting from (i) can lead to posterior parameter distributions that are highly biased and overly confident. Further, when performing model reduction as described in (ii), it is not clear how the prior distribution for the basis weights should be defined because simple (e.g., Gaussian or uniform) priors that may be suitable for a pixel-based parameterization may result in a strong prior bias when used for the weights. To address the issue of model error resulting from known forward model approximations, we generate a set of error training realizations and analyze them with principal component analysis (PCA) in order to generate a sparse basis. The latter is used in the MCMC inversion to remove the main model-error component from the residuals. To improve issues related to prior bias when performing model reduction, we also use a training realization approach, but this time models are simulated from the prior distribution and analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) to build a basis. Application of this approach is demonstrated on a simple geophysical inverse problem involving crosshole georadar tomography, whereby the eikonal equation represents a more appropriate version of the underlying physics and straight rays are assumed as a faster forward model.",

            "abstract": "Scour zones in the World’s largest rivers, or so-called “megascours”, are extensive and dynamic features that are currently poorly understood in terms of their morphology and kinematics. Such scours can erode c. 50-60 metres below the water surface, extend laterally for 100s metres to kilometres, and may migrate kilometres in a single year. Understanding the evolution of such scour zones has important implications for improved flood and bank erosion prediction, better infrastructure planning (e.g. bridges, embankments), and differentiating between autocyclic and allocyclic erosion in the geological record (e.g. sequence stratigraphic applications). Here, we present results from two field seasons using geophysical techniques (high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and seismic reflection data using Chirp and Boomer sources) to study six scour zones in the Ganges-Jamuna-Padma-Meghna river system of Bangladesh. These scours include some of the World’s largest confluences, as well as smaller distributaries, and those with varying levels of tidal influence. Seismic data from repeat surveys permit an accurate characterization of short-term scour evolution and associated deposits across two monsoonal flood peaks. Meanwhile, the bathymetric data reveals widespread deep scours (30-40 m) even in small, downstream distributary tidal channels, illustrating that megascours are present all the way to the subaerial delta fringe. Bathymetric analysis also shows a complex relationship between these scours and bedform distribution and orientation. This suggests the need for a new scaling for sand dune dimensions at such sites, and the need for substantial revisions to current ideas on the use of dune-scale cross-stratification to infer palaeoflow depths in the ancient sedimentary record.",

In that compilation and later studies, there are no data from the early part of the deglaciation at intermediate depths (~1300-2300m). The reasons for that include downslope sediment transport during the LGM for some regions and no deep-sea coral appearance before the late Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1). For the compiled intermediate-depth data from the rest of the deglaciation, they are from different places, and therefore the spatial variability is mixed with the temporal variability. In this study, we will present a time series of ventilation age using a gravity core-long piston core pair from the New England Slope, based on which we can have a better idea of the temporal evolution of the ventilation strength. Our core is located in the middle of the intermediate depths (1820m) and has high sedimentation rates throughout the deglaciation. Usually apparent ventilation age (benthic 14C age minus planktic 14C age) is presented for foraminifera-based ventilation reconstructions. However, there can be a large error for that when the surface reservoir age in the water formation region is much larger than at the core location (e.g., during the early HS1 and the Younger Dryas) because in that case the water left the production region with an old initial age. In this study, we will present adjusted ventilation ages after considering the surface reservoir age history in the subpolar North Atlantic.\n1. L. F. Robinson, J. F. Adkins, L. D.

            "abstract": "The full resolution of shallow-water equations for modeling flash floods may have a high computational cost, so that majority of flood simulation softwares used for flood forecasting uses a simplification of this model : 1D approximations, diffusive or kinematic wave approximations or exotic models using non-physical free parameters. These kind of approximations permit to save a lot of computational time by sacrificing in an unquantified way the precision of simulations. To reduce drastically the cost of such 2D simulations by quantifying the lost of precision, we propose a 2D shallow-water flow solver built with the open source code Basilisk1, which is using adaptive refinement on a quadtree grid. This solver uses a well-balanced central-upwind scheme, which is at second order in time and space, and treats the friction and rain terms implicitly in finite volume approach. We demonstrate the validity of our simulation on the case of the flood of Tewkesbury (UK) occurred in July 2007, as shown on Fig. 1. On this case, a systematic study of the impact of the chosen criterium for adaptive refinement is performed. The criterium which has the best computational time / precision ratio is proposed. Finally, we present the power law giving the computational time in respect to the maximum resolution and we show that this law for our 2D simulation is close to the one of 1D simulation, thanks to the fractal dimension of the topography.\n[1] http://basilisk.fr/",

The ITRS realization is based on the combination of the observation data of the four geodetic space techniques VLBI, SLR, GNSS and DORIS, which include all observations from the individual beginning of the techniques until end of 2014. The final solution is planned to be finished in October 2015. As the previous solution, ITRF2008, the new realization ITRF2014 will contain station positions and velocities as well as consistently estimated Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP). Additionally, for the first time sine-cosine fits of the station positions annual signals will be provided. The ITRF2014 will be more accurate and stable than ITRF2008 as six more years of observation data of the four space geodetic techniques, new observing stations and improved models are available and in ITRF2014 for the first time non-linear station motions will be considered.\nThree ITRS Combination Centres of the IERS (DGFI, IGN and JPL) are each in charge with the computation of this new realization. While the combination strategies of IGN and JPL are based on the combination of parameters, DGFI’s strategy uses the combination of normal equation systems. A further difference between the ITRS realization strategies is that DGFI considers non-linear station motions by applying non-tidal loading signals of atmosphere, hydrology and ocean, while the other CC set up sine-cosine functions to do this. This paper presents the DGFI realization DTRF2014. It demonstrates shortly the combination strategy and its characteristics. It discusses the results of the analysis of the datum parameters, station coordinates and EOP. Finally, it presents the DTRF2014 solution as well as the validation results.",

            "abstract": "Tropical species may be highly sensitive to temperature increases associated with climate change because of their narrow thermal tolerances. Recent work has highlighted the importance of temperature in tropical forest function, however most studies use air temperature measurements from sparse meteorological stations even though surface temperatures are known to deviate from air temperatures. Tropical organisms exist in microclimates that are highly variable in space and time and not easily measured in natural environments. This is in part because of the complex structure of tropical forests and the potential for organisms themselves to modify their own environment. In the case of plants, leaf temperature is linked to the water and surface energy balance of their microenvironment. Here we present results from near-continuous thermal camera monitoring of the forest canopy in Barro Colorado Island, Panama (5-minute intervals for approximately 9 months). We compare daytime (maximum) vs. nighttime (minimum) differences between canopy temperature and air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and precipitation. On average, canopy temperatures are consistently ~2 degrees Celsius higher than air temperatures. These data can paired with flux tower data on-site and used to advance understanding of temperature controls on the structure and function of tropical forests, such as carbon assimilation, phenology, and habitat monitoring, and can be integrated into models to improve predictions of tropical forest response to future climate change.",

            "abstract": "Natural and restored peatlands are often a strong source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). CH4 fluxes vary greatly between different peatland ecosystems, depending on temperature, water level and vegetation. In addition, peatlands often show high small-scale spatial heterogeneity that strongly influences the magnitude of CH4 production. This heterogeneity potentially induce a sensor location bias and leads to additional uncertainties due to the flux footprint variability over heterogeneous terrain. To account for such uncertainty, we installed two eddy covariance towers 26 m apart (height: 6 m) to measure the CH4 flux, together with latent heat and CO2 fluxes at the bog ecosystem “Schechenfilz” in southern Germany. The study site is a large near-natural bog (111 ha) with heterogeneity that is characterized by patches of bog-pine forest, sedge meadows, peat mosses and open water areas. Ongoing CH4 measurements on one of the towers began in July 2012, and both towers were operated with a LI-7700 to measure the CH4 flux simultaneously from autumn 2014 to early spring 2015. In a second campaign, from mid-October to mid-November 2014, both instruments were operated at the same tower for comparison. Throughout the investigation, 17 water level gauges were used to measure the temporal variability of the water level in the mean footprint area. The water level was interpolated based on a high-resolution digital terrain model, which also allows us to account for the impact of the spatial variability of the water table. A vegetation map focused on the distribution of plants with aerenchymous tissues was used to determine the influence of the vegetation composition on the CH4 exchange. In this study, we estimated the uncertainty of CH4 fluxes induced by the instrument system and the flux footprint variability. The footprint analyses together with the water table measurements and vegetation map were also used to analyze the impact of small-scale spatial heterogeneity on the CH4 flux magnitude.",

While in this contribution we focus on translationally invariant equilibria, the method can also be extended to rotationally invariant systems. The current formalism defines the shear field component in terms of the magnetic field strength which leads to a Grad-Shafranov equation that is implicitly coupled to a secondary constraint equation. The new formalism bypasses this problem by considering the shear field component as a function of the poloidal magnetic field strength. One can then show that the problem is reduced to an equivalent problem without a shear field through the use of an effective parallel pressure, which makes it much easier to use the new method for modelling purposes.",

We deployed an array of 41 broadband and short-period seismometers and 14 strong motion sensors across eastern and central Nepal. The ~100x200 km-sized array spans the primary aftershock region and covers the rupture area. Sites include twenty-five broadband, six medium-band, ten co-located short-period and strong motion, and four strong-motion only installations. The array will remain in place for 6-12 months. We will present initial results from the first few months of the deployment.\nThe April 25 earthquake and the May 12, 2015 M7.3 aftershock are examples of seismic activity resulting from the ongoing collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates. The two tectonic plates converge at ~4 cm per year, deforming the Earth’s crust and uplifting the Himalayan Mountains. Historically, aftershocks of large Himalayan earthquakes occur on the principal subduction-zone thrust (the Main Himalayan Thrust), and also on splay thrust faults such as the Main Central Thrust, Main Boundary Thrust, and Main Frontal Thrust as well as along faults within the overriding plate. Detailed location of aftershocks will provide unprecedented sub-surface resolution of the geometry of these faults that at present are known mainly from surface mapping. Structures down-dip and along-strike of the main thrust that may limit the extent of rupture, or control the nucleation pattern of future earthquakes, require high-resolution studies that cannot be conducted with teleseismic recordings of the main shock and its aftershocks. Detailed aftershock imaging or controlled-source profiling is required to solve this problem.",

            "abstract": "European peatlands have been extensively managed over past centuries. Typical management activities consisted of drainage and afforestation, which lead to considerable damage to the peat and potentially significant carbon loss. Recent efforts to restore previously managed peatlands have been carried out throughout Europe. These restoration efforts have direct implications for water table depth and greenhouse gas emissions, thus impacting on the ecosystem services provided by peatland areas. In order to quantify the impact of peatland restoration on water table depth and greenhouse gas budget, We coupled the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to a process-based model for methane emissions (Walter and Heimann, 2000). The new model (EPIC-M) can potentially be applied at the European and even at the global scale, but it is yet to be tested and evaluated. We present results of this new tool from different peatlands in the Flow Country, Scotland. Large parts of the peatlands of the region have been drained and afforested during the 1980s, but since the late 1990s, programs to restore peatlands in the Flow Country have been enforced. This region offers therefore a range of peatlands, from near pristine, to afforested and drained, with different resoration ages in between, where we can apply the EPIC-M model and validate it against experimental data from all land stages of restoration.\nGoals of this study are to evaluate the EPIC-M model and its performances against in situ measurements of methane emissions and water table changes in drained peatlands and in restored ones. Secondly, our purpose is to study the environmental impact of peatland restoration, including methane emissions, due to the rewetting of drained surfaces. To do so, we forced the EPIC-M model with local meteorological and soil data, and simulated soil temperatures, water table dynamics, and greenhouse gas emissions. This is the first step towards a European-wide application of the EPIC-M model for the assessment of the environmental impact of peatland restoration.",

            "abstract": "Conceptual rainfall-runoff models use spatially averaged rainfall fields as input. However, these are typically associated with significant errors, e.g. due to poor representativity of the gauge network, that affect the model outcome. In this study it is hypothesised that a simple spatially and temporally averaged event-dependent rainfall multiplier can account for errors in the rainfall input and this is tested by evaluating the effects of multipliers on the accuracy and precision of the predictive distributions.\nParameter sets found to be behavioural across a range of different flood events were assumed to be a good representation of the catchment dynamics. Each parameter set was subsequently used to identify rainfall multipliers for each of the individual events from a range of multipliers estimated from rainfall gauge data. An effect of the parameter sets on identified multipliers was found, however it was small compared to the effect due to the event rainfall input. The distributions of the identified multipliers were shown to be event-dependant by statistical testing.\nAccounting for input rainfall errors by using event-dependent multipliers improved the reliability of the predictions, and only at the cost of a small decrease in precision. Hence, the distribution of identified multipliers for past events can be used to account for possible rainfall errors when predicting future events and be updated as new data becomes available. The method offers a simple and computationally cheap way to address rainfall errors in hydrological modelling.",

However, the abundance and provenance of DBC in the ocean are not well understood. Here, DBC in the South China Sea (SCS) was determined at molecular level using the benzenepolycarboxylic acids (BPCAs) method. DBC showed high concentrations in the upper 100 m seawater with the average of 1.13 μmol l-1 (n=55). In the intermediate seawater (200-1500 m), DBC ranged from 0.67 to 0.89 μmol l-1 with the average of 0.78 μmol l-1 (n=9), exhibiting nearly homogeneous distributions. The vertical distribution pattern indicated that DBC significantly degraded in the photic zone, corresponding to an attenuate constant of 12.5±4.9 km-1. The ratios of B6CA/B3CAs increased downward, implying that aromatic condensation degree of DBC increase during transport from surface to deep water. Using the standing crops of DBC in the upper 200 m and the residence time of seawater, atmospheric deposition of DBC was estimated to be 1.94 TgC yr-1, accounting for around 16% of the global BC deposition. Our study highlights that DBC could be an important component of ocean carbon cycling in Pacific Asia Marginal Seas.",

            "abstract": "A new cost-effective implementation of online nesting is developed to improve the computational performance, which is important as well as physical performance in a numerical weather prediction and regional climate experiment. For a down-scaling experiment, a nesting system is indispensable component. Online nesting has merits against offline nesting in updating interval of boundary data and un-necessity of intermediate files. However, the computational efficiency of online nesting has not been much evaluated. In the conventional implementation (CVI) of online nesting, the MPI processes are arranged as a single group, and the group manages all of the nested-domains. In the new implementation (NWI), the MPI processes are divided into several groups, and each process group is assigned to each domain. Therefore, there can be almost no idling processes ideally. In addition, the outer domain calculation can be overlapped behind the inner domain calculation. Elapsed time of data transfer from the outer domain to the inner domain also can be hidden behind the inner domain calculation by appropriate assignment of the processes.\nWe applied the NWI to the SCALE model (Nishizawa et al. 2015), which is a regional weather prediction model developed by RIKEN AICS. We evaluated the computational performance of the NWI in the double-nested experiment by using the K computer. The grid numbers (x,y,z) were set as (120, 108, 40) for the outer domain with 7.5 km horizontal grid space, and (180, 162, 60) for the inner domain with 2.5 km horizontal grid space. For the calculation, 90 processes were used in both the CVI and the NWI. In the NWI, the MPI processes were divided into two groups, and assigned to the outer and the inner domains; 9 and 81 processes for the outer and inner domains, respectively. The computational performance was improved 1.2 times in the NWI compared to the CVI. The benefit of the NWI could become larger when domains are multiple nested.",

            "abstract": "Larvae of intertidal species grow offshore, and migrate back to the shore when they are ready to settle on their adult substrates. In order to reach the habitat, they must cross the surf zone, which is characterized as a semi-permeable barrier. This is accomplished through physical forcing (i.e., waves and current) as well as their own behavior. Two possible scenarios of onshore larval transport are proposed: Negatively buoyant larvae stay in the bottom boundary layer because of turbulence-dependent sinking behavior, and are carried toward the shore by streaming of the bottom boundary layer; positively buoyant larvae move to the shore during onshore wind events, and sink to the bottom once they encounter high turbulence (i.e., surf zone edge), where they are carried by the bottom current toward the shore (Fujimura et al. 2014). Our biophysical Lagrangian particle tracking model helps to explain how beach morphology and wave conditions affect larval distribution patterns and abundance. Model results and field observations show that larval abundance in the surf zone is higher at mildly sloped, rip-channeled beaches than at steep pocket beaches. Beach attributes are broken up to examine which and how beach configuration factors affect larval abundance. Modeling with alongshore uniform beaches with variable slopes reveal that larval populations in the surf zone are negatively correlated with beach steepness. Alongshore variability enhances onshore larval transport because of increased cross-shore water exchange by rip currents. Wave groups produce transient rip currents and enhance cross-shore exchange. Effects of other wave components, such as wave height and breaking wave rollers are also considered.",

            "abstract": "High relative humidity (HRH) is defined as a relative humidity of at least 80%, which is often associated with the occurrence of cloud layers. Thus, the frequency of HRH and its changes in the troposphere may be related to the occurrence frequency of cloud layers and their changes. In this study, trends in the frequency of HRH (defined as days with relative humidity ≥80%) over China from the surface to the mid-troposphere (≥400 hPa) from 1979 to 2012 were analyzed using a homogenized humidity dataset for spring (March－May), summer (June－August), autumn (September－November), and winter (December－February). The results for the ground level indicate decreasing trends at most stations in southeastern China in spring and in northern China in summer. In the lower troposphere (850 hPa and 700 hPa), most stations over China exhibited positive trends in summer, autumn, and winter. For the mid-troposphere (500 hPa to 400 hPa), increasing trends dominated over China in spring, summer, and autumn. Finally, six reanalysis datasets, including the NCEP/NCAR I, NCEP/DOE II, CFSR, ERA-Interim, MERRA, and JRA-55 datasets, were compared with the observed increasing trends in HRH frequency in the low-mid troposphere. Similar vertical profiles of HRH trends in the reanalysis datasets and the homogenized humidity dataset were observed in certain seasons and for certain regions, with positive or small negative trends at high levels and large negative trends at 850 hPa, respectively. These results are consistent with the increasing low-mid cloud amounts in recent decades.",

            "abstract": "The seismic energy radiated by active volcanism is one common measurement of eruption size. For example, the magnitudes of individual earthquakes in volcano-tectonic (VT) swarms can be summed and expressed in terms of cumulative magnitude, energy, or moment release. However, discrepancies exist in current practice when treating the radiated energy of volcano seismicity dominated by surface waves. This has implications for volcanic tremor, since eruption tremor typically originates at shallow depth and is made up of surface waves. In the absence of a method to compute surface wave energy, estimates of eruption energy partitioning between acoustic and seismic waves typically assume seismic energy is composed of body waves. Furthermore, without the proper treatment of surface wave energy, it is unclear how much volcanic tremor contributes to the overall seismic energy budget during volcanic unrest.\nTo address this issue, we derive, from first principles, the expression of surface wave radiated energy. In contrast with body waves, the surface wave energy equation is naturally expressed in the frequency domain instead of the time domain. We validate our result by reproducing an analytical solution for the radiated power of a vertical force source acting on a free surface. We further show that the surface wave energy equation leads to an explicit relationship between energy and the imaginary part of the surface wave Green’s tensor at the source location, a fundamental property recognized within the field of seismic interferometry.\nWith the new surface wave energy equation, we make clear connections to reduced displacement and propose an improved formula for the calculation of surface wave reduced displacement involving integration over the frequency band of tremor. As an alternative to reduced displacement, we show that reduced particle velocity squared is also a valid physical measure of tremor size, one based on seismic energy rate instead of seismic moment rate. These concepts are illustrated with data examples from recent eruptions of Pavlof and Okmok volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc.",

Here we present high-resolution 2-D coupled tectonic-surface processes modeling of extensional basin formation. The main aim is to find out how erosion and deposition affect the deformation in extensional systems. We test sensitivity of the rift mode to the combined effects of crustal rheology and varying surface process efficiency (erodibility, sea level). The results show that both erosion of rift flank areas and basin deposition enhance localization of crustal deformation. Frictional-plastic extensional shear zones accumulate more deformation during a longer period of time, and time of lithospheric rupture is delayed when fluvial erosion, transport and deposition are efficient. We show that removal of mass from rift flanks and sedimentary loading in the basin area are the main cause of the feedbacks providing a first order control on the style of extensional basin formation. Variation of strain localization in natural rift systems correlates with the observed behavior and suggests similar feedbacks as demonstrated by the forward numerical models.",

            "abstract": "Although three-dimensional (3-D) electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey has become a popular practice in the site characterization and process monitoring, the two-dimensional (2-D) ERT survey is still often used in the field. This is because that the 2-D ERT survey is relatively easy to do and the focus of site characterization is on the information of 2-D cross section, not necessarily of the 3-D subsurface structure. Examples of such practice include tunnel line and crossing fault survey. In these cases, depending on the property of surface soil to be surveyed, the 2-D ERT survey with pole-pole array may occasionally make us obtain quality good data, however it often gives us a suit of data set both with real and erroneous ones that incorporated the effects of electrode contact and not far enough far electrodes. Without preprocessing, the apparent resistivity pseudo-section constructed from this kind of data set may quite deviate from the real one and the information obtained from it may be misleading and even completely incorrect. In this study, we developed a method of far electrode dynamic correction that is appropriate for raw data preprocessing from 2-D pole-pole array ERT survey. Based on this method, we not only can find and delete the abnormal data points easily, but also can position the coordinates of far electrodes actually working in the field, thus delete the far electrode effects and make best use of the looked strange data points. The method also makes us to be able to judge the effects of electrode contact and avoid using such data points in the following apparent resistivity pseudo-section construction. With this preprocessing to the data set, the constructed apparent resistivity pseudo-section is demonstrated to be more approximate to the real one. This makes the following reversion calculation more robust. We'll introduce this far electrode dynamic correction method and show application examples in the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Soil microorganisms play key roles in nutrient cycling, and are distributed throughout the soil profile. Currently, there is little information about the characteristics of the microbial communities along the soil depth because most studies focus on microorganisms inhabiting the soil surface. To better understand the functions and composition of microbial communities and the biogeochemical factors that shape them at different soil depth, we analyzed soil microbial activities and bacterial and fungal community composition in a soil profile of a fallow field located in central Korea. Soil samples were taken using 120-cm soil cores. To analyze the composition of bacterial and fungal communities, barcoded pyrosequnecing analysis of 16S rRNA genes (bacteria) and ITS region (fungi) was conducted. Among the bacterial groups, the abundance of Proteobacteria (38.5, 23.2, 23.3, 26.1 and 17.5%, at 15-, 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-cm depth, respectively) and Firmicutes (12.8, 11.3, 8.6, 4.3 and 0.4%, at 15-, 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-cm depth, respectively) decreased with soil depth. On the other hand, the abundance of Ascomycota (51.2, 48.6, 65.7, 46.1, and 45.7%, at 15-, 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-cm depth, respectively), a dominant fungal group at this site, showed no significant difference along the soil profile. To examine the vertical difference of microbial activities, activity of five extracellular enzymes that take part in cycling of C, N, and P in soil ecosystems, beta-1,4-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, beta-1,4-xylosidase, beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and acid phosphatase were analyzed. The soil enzyme activity declined with soil depth. For example, acid phosphatase activity was 88.5 (± 14.6 (± 1 SE)), 30.0 (± 5.9), 18.0 (± 3.5), 14.1 (± 3.7), and 10.7 (± 3.8) nmol g-1 hr-1, at 15-, 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-cm depth, respectively. These metagenomics studies, along with other studies on microbial functions, are expected to enhance our understanding on the complexity of soil microbial communities and their relationship with biogeochemical factors.",

            "abstract": "Fault zone materials have been suggested to be heterogeneous, such as along-strike variations of low velocity zone and stress conditions. How these fault heterogeneities affect earthquake rupture propagation is important to advance our understanding of earthquake physics, and yet remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the effects of along-strike fault heterogeneity on rupture propagation through numerical modeling on a strike-slip planar fault governed by a linear slip-weakening friction law. We first implement along-strike variations of fault zone materials based on field observations, which have shown the velocities of P and S waves of the low velocity zones can be reduced up to 50% compared to intact rocks. The rupture speed is decreased if the rupture propagates into materials with lower shear modulus and keeps at a stable speed quickly. In contrast, the rupture speed is increased if the rupture propagates into materials with higher shear modulus and accelerates into a steady speed more slowly. If this material boundary is very close to the nucleation zone, it may inhibit the nucleation process. In addition, there is always a perturbation on the rupture speed near the boundary due to the reflected energy. We then investigate the effects of a patch with elevated effective normal stress (barrier) on rupture propagation. Except for the distance d between the barrier and the nucleation zone, its width w, and the additional effective normal stress Δσn, all other parameters are kept constant for all the simulated models. Our results confirm that the barrier may slow down or stop coseismic ruptures, but may also induce supershear ruptures. Moreover, there is a sharp boundary between stopping the rupture and making very strong supershear ruptures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the supershear rupture may emerge in a region that is delineated by two approximate linear boundaries for parameters d and w. The duration of supershear ruptures increases as the barrier sizes grow from the lower to the upper boundary, which are proportional to the reduction in rupture speeds caused by the barrier. Because supershear ruptures may produce more destructive near-field ground shaking, our findings have important implications for earthquake hazard preparation.",

A key control on arsenic mobilization in aquifers in these areas has been controversially identified as the interaction of ‘labile’ organic matter contained in surface waters with groundwaters and sediments at depth [2-4], which may trigger the release of arsenic from the solid- to aqueous-phase via reductive dissolution of iron-(hyr)oxide minerals [5].\nIn a field site in Kandal Province, Cambodia, which is an arsenic-affected area typical to others in the region, there are strong seasonal patterns in groundwater flow direction, which are closely related to monsoonal rains [6] and may contribute to arsenic release in this aquifer. The aim of this study is to explore the implications of the high susceptibility of this aquifer system to seasonal changes on potential ground-surface water interactions. The main objectives are to (i) identify key zones where there are likely ground-surface water interactions, (ii) assess the seasonal impact of such interactions and (iii) quantify the influence of interactions using geochemical parameters (such as As, Fe, NO3, NH4, 14C, 3T/3He, δ18O, δ2H). Identifying the zones, magnitude and seasonal influence of ground-surface water interactions elucidates new information regarding potential locations/pathways of arsenic mobilization and/or transport in affected aquifers and may be important for water management strategies in affected areas.\nThis research is supported by NERC (NE/J023833/1) to DP, BvD and CJB and a NERC PhD studentship (NE/L501591/1) to DM.\n",

Two injection wells, Prati-9 and Prati-29, located in the northwestern part of the field and their associated seismicity composed of 1,776 events recorded throughout a seven-year period were analyzed. The seismicity catalog was relocated and the source characteristics including focal mechanisms and static source parameters were refined using first-motion polarity, spectral fitting and mesh spectral ratio techniques. The source characteristics together with statistical parameters (b-value) and cluster dynamics were used to investigate and understand the details of fluid migration scheme in the vicinity of injection wells. The observed temporal, spatial and source characteristics were clearly attributed to fluid injection and fluid migration towards greater depths, involving increasing pore pressure in the reservoir. Increasing poroelastic stresses at greater depths affect the kinematic properties of the seismicity in that at reservoir depths normal faulting mechanism events dominate, whereas at larger depths the contribution of strike-slip events are is significantly increasing. The seasonal changes of injection rates were found to directly impact the shape and spatial extent of the seismic cloud. A tendency of larger seismic events to occur closer to injection wells and a correlation between the spatial extent of the seismic cloud and source sizes of the largest events was observed suggesting geometrical constraints on the maximum likely magnitude. The observed maximum magnitude was found to be clearly correlated to the dimensions of seismic cloud which is related to the volume of formation weakened by fluid injection and injection rate, and the average pore pressure change in the reservoir.",

            "abstract": "Common or basic susceptibility may exist in a region. This common feature has been tested to be true in several drainage basins in Taiwan in recent years. A multi-temporal landslide inventory was commonly used in building a landslide susceptibility model for a region. An event landslide inventory and triggering factors were also used to build an event landslide susceptibility model in recent years. An event-based landslide susceptibility model is dependent on that event, and different event models exhibit different susceptibility pattern. However, if we extract the triggering factors from the event model, then the model would be event-independent and can represent the basic susceptibility of the region. We found that different event-independent susceptibility model for the same region are similar in pattern, and is similar also to a susceptibility model built by a multi-temporal landslide inventory at that region. On this basis, we can use an event-independent susceptibility model to represent the basic susceptibility of the region with confidence. We tested the relationship between probability of failure and rainfall intensity, as well as total rainfall at each basic susceptibility bin. It was found that the relation is good; the probability of failure increases with an increase in the rainfalls and also an increase in the susceptibility. A fitting surface of probability of landslide failure using a rainfall parameter and the basic susceptibility as two independent variables was done and the example will be presented.",

            "abstract": "During the middle Miocene, voluminous tholeiitic flood basalts erupted in eastern Oregon, followed closely by widespread eruptions of rhyolitic tuffs and lavas. While numerous causes have been proposed, many researchers are currently in agreement that the initiation of a mantle plume associated with the Yellowstone hotspot track is ultimately responsible for this magmatic activity. The mafic component of this magmatic activity has received considerable attention, contrary to the corresponding silicic volcanism.\nThe widespread Littlefield Rhyolite consists of rhyolitic lava flows that erupted in eastern Oregon contemporaneous to upper Grande Ronde Basalt lavas. The estimated total volume of erupted rhyolites is ~100 km3 covering ~850 km2. While the areal extent and distribution of the Littlefield Rhyolite has been sufficiently delineated by geological mapping in the past, little is known about the internal stratigraphy and emplacement of this extensive rhyolitic unit. The focus of this study has been to investigate the stratigraphy and petrology of the Littlefield Rhyolite and whether field and geochemical relationships exist to help constrain the timing and storage sites of Grande Ronde Basalt magmas. Although indistinguishable in the field, our data reveal that the Littlefield Rhyolite consists of two geochemically distinct rhyolite flow packages that are designated here as lower and upper Littlefield Rhyolite according to stratigraphic relationships in Malheur River Gorge. There, several other units are sandwiched between the lower and upper rhyolites, including several lava flows and a one-meter thick agglutinated spatter deposit of local Grande Ronde Basalt units. The spatter deposit thickens to 10s of meters over a distance of 800 m where the deposit is strongly welded. We now recognize this as a venting site of local Grande Ronde Basalt. One of the local variants of upper Grande Ronde Basalt is icelanditic (~61 wt. % SiO2) in composition and is found at a number of places including a location near the southern extent of the Littlefield Rhyolite. Geochemical modeling strongly suggests that icelandite lavas from Alder Creek resulted from mixing of Grande Ronde and Littlefield Rhyolite magmas, thereby tying a Grande Ronde magma storage site to within the greater Malheur River Gorge area.",

Within this framework, specific tools were tailor-made to better extract the magnetic signal emanating from Earth’s the lithospheric. These tools rely on the scalar gradient measured by the lower pair of Swarm satellites and rely on a regional modeling scheme that is more sensitive to small spatial scales and weak signals than the standard spherical harmonic modeling.

We assess the efficiency of this dedicated chain for modeling the lithospheric magnetic field using more than one year of measurements, and finally discuss refinements that are continuously implemented in order to further improve the robustness and the spatial resolution of the lithospheric field model.",

            "abstract": "GIFT workshops are a two-and-a-half-day teacher enhancement workshops organized by the EGU Committee on Education and held in conjunction with the EGU annual General Assembly. The program of each workshop focuses on a different general theme each year. Past themes have included, for example, \"Mineral Resources\", \"Our Changing Planet\", “Natural Hazards”, \"Water\" and “Biodiversity and Evolution”. These workshops combine scientific presentations on current research in Earth and Space Sciences, given by prominent scientists attending EGU General Assemblies, with hands-on, inquiry-based activities that can be used by the teachers in their classrooms to explain related scientific principles or topics. Teachers are also invited to present their own classroom activities to their colleagues, regardless of the scientific topic. The main objective of these workshops is to communicate first-hand scientific information to teachers in primary and secondary schools, significantly shortening the time between discovery and textbook. The GIFT workshop provides the teachers with materials that can be directly incorporated into their classroom, as well as those of their colleagues at home institutions. In addition, the full immersion of science teachers in a truly scientific context (EGU General Assemblies) and the direct contact with leading geoscientists stimulates curiosity towards research that the teachers can transmit to their pupils. In addition to their scientific content, the GIFT workshops are of high societal value. The value of bringing teachers from many nations together includes the potential for networking and collaborations, the sharing of experiences and an awareness of science education as it is presented in other countries. Since 2003, the EGU GIFT workshops have brought together more than 700 teachers from more than 25 nations. At all previous EGU GIFT workshops teachers mingled with others from outside their own country and informally interacted with the scientists, providing a venue for rich dialogue for all participants. The dialogues often included ideas about learning, presentation of science content and curriculum. Programs, presentations and Web streaming of past GIFT workshops are available at: http://www.egu.eu/education/gift/workshops/",

            "abstract": "A critical missing link in existing landscape evolution models is a dynamic soil evolution models where soils co-evolve with the landform. Work by the authors over the last decade has demonstrated a computationally manageable model for soil profile evolution (soilscape evolution) based on physical weathering. For chemical weathering it is clear that full geochemistry models such as CrunchFlow and PHREEQC are too computationally intensive to be couplable to existing soilscape and landscape evolution models. This paper presents a simplification of CrunchFlow chemistry and physics that makes the task feasible, and generalises it for hillslope geomorphology applications. Results from this simplified model will be compared with field data for soil pedogenesis. Other researchers have previously proposed a number of very simple weathering functions (e.g. exponential, humped, reverse exponential) as conceptual models of the in-profile weathering process. The paper will show that all of these functions are possible for specific combinations of in-soil environmental, geochemical and geologic conditions, and the presentation will outline the key variables controlling which of these conceptual models can be realistic models of in-profile processes and under what conditions. The presentation will finish by discussing the coupling of this model with a physical weathering model, and will show sample results from our SSSPAM soilscape evolution model to illustrate the implications of including chemical weathering in the soilscape evolution model.",

            "abstract": "Arctic permafrost-associated wetlands and thawing permafrost emit the greenhouse gas methane (CH4), either as a product of recent microbial activity in the active layer or taliks, or from deeper geogenic sources where pathways through the permafrost exist. Current emission estimates vary strongly between different models and there is still disagreement between bottom-up estimates from local field studies and top-down estimates from atmospheric measurements. We use airborne flux data from two campaigns in the Mackenzie River Delta, Canada, in July 2012 and 2013 to directly quantify permafrost CH4 emissions on the regional scale, to analyse the regional pattern of CH4 fluxes and to estimate the contribution of geogenic emissions to the overall CH4 budget of the delta. CH4 fluxes were calculated with a time-frequency resolved version of the eddy covariance technique, resulting in a gridded 100 m x 100 m resolution flux map within the footprints of the flight tracks. We distinguish geogenic gas seeps from biogenic sources by their strength and show that they contribute strongly to the annual CH4 budget of the delta. Our study provides the first estimate of annual CH4 release from the Mackenzie River Delta and the adjacent coastal plain. We show that one percent of the covered area contains the strongest geogenic seeps which contribute disproportionately to the annual emission estimate. Our results show that geogenic CH4 emissions might need more attention, especially in areas where permafrost is vulnerable to thawing sufficiently to create pathways for geogenic gas migration. The presented map can be used as a baseline for future CH4 flux studies in the Mackenzie River Delta.",

The total volume of the seismic waveform data collected from all these observation station is about 1MByte for 1 second (about 8 to 10Mbps) by using the WIN system(Urabe 1991).\nJDXnet is the Japan Data eXchange network for earthquake observation data. JDXnet was started from 2007 by cooperation of the researchers of each organization. All the seismic waveform data are available at the all organizations in real-time. The core of JDXnet is the broadcast type real-time data exchange by using the nationwide L2-VPN service offered in JGN-X of NICT and SINET4 of NII.\nBefore the Tohoku earthquake, the nine national universities had collected seismic data to each data center and then exchanged with other universities and institutions by JDXnet. However, in this case, if the center of the university was stopped, all data of the university could not use even though there are some alive observation stations.\nBecause of this problem, we have prepared the data relay server in the data center of SINET4 ie the cloud center. This data relay server collects data directly from the observation stations of the universities and delivers data to all universities and institutions by JDXnet.\nBy using the relay server on cloud center, even if some universities are affected by a large disaster, it is eliminated that the data of the living station is lost. If the researchers set up seismometers and send data to the relay server, then data are available to all researchers. This mechanism promotes the joint use of the seismometers and joint research activities in nationwide researchers.",

            "abstract": "In situ measurements of hydrogeologic properties within fault zones are few, in part because of the challenges of measuring the scale-dependent quantities in fractured rock reservoirs. This work aims to fill the gap by utilizing a combination of tidal, barometric and seismic response analyses on pressure head time-series from the Santa Susana Field Laboratory in Southern California. The techniques sample different effective volumes and so allow us to investigate the scale-dependent structure near fault zones. Permeability and specific storage were inverted from tidal response at 14 locations, and specific storage was also computed from barometric efficiencies at 10 locations. In addition, we computed hydro-seismic transfer functions after nine local earthquakes and teleseismic events. We found that permeability computed from tidal response are quite homogeneous within about one and a half orders of magnitude over the site regardless of the presence of moderate to large faults. This result is consistent with the earlier aquifer tests using standard methods. The tidal responses also showed higher variability of specific storage inside the fault zones suggesting that fault damage zone generates a storage architecture. The storage from the tidal responses can be consistently interpreted for the tidal, barometric and seismic responses. However, the observations require that the permeability inside the fault zones at the spatial scale of the seismic response (~meters) is much lower than at the spatial scale of the tidal response (~10's of meters). The result suggests possible sensitivity to the low permeability fault core, which has been historically difficult to measure at the field scale.",

            "abstract": "The mass balance and long-term stability of the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica depend heavily on the dynamics of their ice-ocean margins. Iceberg calving accounts for the majority of the net annual loss of ice in Antarctica and around half of that from Greenland. Furthermore, climate driven changes to dynamics at these calving margins can be transmitted far inland. Thus, predicting future sea level contribution from the cryosphere requires an improved understanding of calving, and the processes which link it to climate and ice-sheet flow.\nWe present results from a new 3D calving model coupled to a full-Stokes, time evolving glacier dynamic model, implemented for Store Glacier, a 5-km-wide calving glacier in the Uummannaq region of West Greenland, which flows at a rate of 20 m/day at its terminus. The model is developed using the open source finite element package Elmer/Ice, with the criterion that calving occurs when surface and basal crevasses meet. Crevasses open in response to tensile stresses near the terminus and water pressure at the bed.\nWhen the model was applied in 2D for the central flowline of Store Glacier, we found that basal topography exerts overarching control on the long term position of the calving front, while ice mélange buttressing allows the seasonal extension of a floating tongue, which collapses in early summer. New results emerging from implementation of calving in a 3D model indicate significant spatial heterogeneity in calving dynamics because the northern half of the terminus is grounded whereas the southern half is floating. This contrasting setting affects calving dynamics, further underlining the importance of geometry and basal topography, and suggesting that lower dimensional calving models may miss important aspects of calving dynamics. Our results also suggest that implementing grounding line dynamics is important for modelling calving, even for glaciers which are, for the most part, firmly grounded.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake swarms, fluid migration and gas springs are indications of the ongoing geodynamic processes within the West Bohemia seismic zone located at the Czech-German border. The possible relationship between the fluids, gas and seismicity is of particular interest and has motivated numerous past, ongoing and future studies, including a multidisciplinary monitoring proposal through the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). The most seismically active area within the West Bohemia seismic zone is located at the Czech town Nový Kostel. The Nový Kostel zone experiences frequent swarms of several hundreds to thousands of earthquakes over a period of weeks to several months. The seismicity is always located in the same area and depth range (~5-15 km), however the activated fault segments and planes differ. For example, the 2008 swarm activated faults along the southern end of the seismic zone, the 2011 swarm activated the northern segment, and the recent 2014 swarm activated the middle of the seismic zone. This indicates changes to the local stress field, and may relate to fluid migration and/or the complicated tectonic situation. The West Bohemia Seismic Network (WEBNET) is ideally located for studying the Nový Kostel swarm area and provides good azimuthal coverage. Here, we use the high quality P- and S-wave arrival picks recorded by WEBNET to calculate swarm-dependent velocity models for the 2008 and 2011 swarms, and an averaged (swarm independent) model using earthquakes recorded between 1991 and 2011. To this end, we use double-difference tomography to calculate P- and S-wave velocity models. The models are compared and examined in terms of swarm-dependent velocities and structures. Since the P-to-S velocity ratio is particularly sensitive to the presence of pore fluids, we derive ratio models directly from the inverted P- and S-wave models in order to investigate the potential influence of fluids on the seismicity. Finally, clustering and rupture patterns within the earthquake swarm sequences are analyzed and interpreted in relation to the velocity models in order to identify possible triggering mechanisms for the periodic seismic energy release.",

            "abstract": "It is known that tsunamis are rather rare events, especially when compared to earthquakes, and the Italian coasts are no exception. Nonetheless, a striking evidence is that 6 out of 10 earthquakes occurred in the last thousand years in Italy, and having equivalent moment magnitude equal or larger than 7 where accompanied by destructive or heavily damaging tsunamis. If we extend the lower limit of the equivalent moment magnitude down to 6.5 the percentage decreases (around 40%), but is still significant. Famous events like those occurred on 30 July 1627 in Gargano, on 11 January 1693 in eastern Sicily, and on 28 December 1908 in the Messina Straits are part of this list: they were all characterized by maximum run-ups of several meters (13 m for the 1908 tsunami), significant maximum inundation distances, and large (although not precisely quantifiable) numbers of victims. Further evidences provided in the last decade by paleo-tsunami deposit analyses help to better characterize the tsunami impact and confirm that none of the cited events can be reduced to local or secondary effects. Proper analysis and simulation of available tsunami data would then appear as an obvious part of the correct definition of the sources responsible for the largest Italian tsunamigenic earthquakes, in a process in which different datasets analyzed by different disciplines must be reconciled rather than put into contrast with each other. Unfortunately, macroseismic, seismic and geological/geomorphological observations and data typically are assigned much heavier weights, and in-land faults are often assigned larger credit than the offshore ones, even when evidence is provided by tsunami simulations that they are not at all capable of justifying the observed tsunami effects. Tsunami generation is imputed a-priori to only supposed, and sometimes even non-existing, submarine landslides. We try to summarize the tsunami research point of view on the largest Italian historical tsunamigenic earthquakes; we highlight the open problems, and suggest that tsunami observations and simulations can contribute towards their solution.

            "abstract": "The concept of a magma ocean existing while a rocky planet accretes is useful for modeling its geochemical evolution, and is particularly successful in explaining moderately siderophile element concentrations relative to chondrites in the Earth's mantle. Here we examine the physical consequences of the existence of a magma ocean covering an Earth-like planet during accretion using continuous and stochastic accretion scenarios from N-body Grand Tack-style simulations. We find that release of gravitational potential energy is the dominant control on the temperature of the growing core inside the planet and leads to thermal stratification of the core, resistant to convection. Temperatures at the center of the accreting planet are low enough that the increasing silicate overburden pressure leads to freezing. An inner core develops early in all of the Earth accretion histories explored so far and persists beyond the end of accretion, controlled by the heating time the whole core which can be lengthy. Thus recent seismic studies supporting the existence of an innermost inner core may be observing a relic from the very earliest stage of Earth's accretion history. The composition of this part of the core may reflect the composition of the core at its earliest accretion stage rather than of the present core, yielding a different form and intensity of anisotropy.",

            "abstract": "The forested peatlands of the Earth’s tropical belt represent a major terrestrial carbon pool that may contain over 90 petagram C. However, the mechanisms that led to the build-up of this significant pool of carbon are poorly understood. Moreover, the rates of carbon uptake by peat accumulation in these tropical settings have rarely been quantified and natural variations in uptake on decadal to millennial scales are not well constrained. We studied carbon accumulation dynamics on these timescales of a peat swamp forest dominated by the dipterocarp Shorea albida – a unique forest type that, until recently, widely covered the lowlands of northwest Borneo. The impressive Shorea albida trees may reach heights of 70 m and are therefore strongly susceptible to windthrow and lightning. Such natural disturbances cause these trees to fall and uproot – excavating over 1 m deep holes into the peat that fill with water to become tip-up pools. The analysis of high-resolution aerial photographs and radiocarbon dated peat cores from our field site in Brunei together with the construction of a simulation model of peat accumulation allowed us to determine the role of tree-fall and tip-up pools in carbon storage. In a hectare of Shorea albida forest four tip-up pools form per decade. A pool completely fills with organic matter within 200 years according to our pollen record and a dated pool deposit stored 40 kg C m-2 of the total 110 kg C m-2 large local peat carbon pool. The carbon accumulation rates in these pools reach over 800 g C m-2 yr-1 - within the range of annual litterfall in dipterocarp forests. The simulation model indicates that up to 60% of the peat deposits under Shorea albida forests could be derived from infilled pools. Tip-up pools are therefore local hotspots for carbon storage in tropical forested peatlands.",

            "abstract": "Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is one of the major sinks of bio-available nitrogen from the marine system. Anammox is estimated be responsible for ca. 30% of dinitrogen gas produced in modern open oceans [1]. Tracing the anammox process in the past has been temporally-limited by the lability of the lipid biomarkers synthesised by anammox bacteria. These ladderane lipids are highly susceptible to degradation [2,3], and are not well preserved in the sedimentary record [4]. Recently, however, bacteriohopanetetrol stereoisomer (BHT isomer) was identified as a more recalcitrant biomarker for pelagic anammox, expanding the potential to study past anammox activity [5].\nHere, we investigate BHT isomer concentration (Fig. 1a) and BHT isomer ratio (Fig. 1b) in sediments from the last ~60 ka in the Gulf of Alaska (IODP Expedition 341, Site U1419) [6]. Our data show increased deposition of pelagic anammox bacteria, paralleled by inorganic proxy records for oxygen-depleted bottom water conditions (total sulfur and pyrite-bound iron to highly reactive iron ratio; Fig. 1, c,d). This indicates that the oxygen minimum zone in the Gulf of Alaska likely fluctuated following past climate changes.\n[1] Ward, B.B. 2013. Science 341, 352-353.\n[2] Sinninghe Damsté, et al. 2002.

            "abstract": "Rifted Basins often develop in internal zones of orogenic belts, although the latter may not be easy to unravel. We chose the example of the super-stretched Andaman sea region affected by several stages of rifting in the internal zone of a composite collage of allochthonous terranes. We made use of a set of geophysical, geochronological and structural data to analyze the rifting evolution and reconstruct the previous compressional structures.\n- Starting in the late Oligocene the East Andaman Basin opened as a back arc in a right-lateral pull- apart. The rifting propagated Westward to the central Andaman basin in the Middle Miocene, and to the oceanic spreading stage in the Pliocene.\n- An early extension occurred in the Paleogene, marked by widespread opening of isolated continental basins onshore Malay Peninsula and offshore Andaman Shelf and Malacca Straits. The rifting was accommodated by LANF’s along preexisting weakness zones such as hinges of folds and granitic batholiths. Continuous extension connected the isolated basins offshore, whereas onshore, the grabens remained confined. There, AFT data show an uplift phase around 30Ma.\nIn the Late Cretaceous, a major deformation occurred oblique to the pre-existing Indosinian basement fabrics. The convergence was partitioned into thrusting and uplift of the Cretaceous volcanic arc in Thailand and Myanmar, inversion of Mesozoic basins, and coeval wrenching responsible for large phacoid-shaped crustal slivers bounded by wide strike slip fault zones. The slivers share similar characteristics: a thick continental core of lower Paleozoic sedimentary basins units surrounded by Late Cretaceous granitoids. Radiometric data and fission tracks indicate a widespread thermal anomaly in all West Sunda Plate synchronous to a strong uplift.\nIn the Latest Mesozoic, the Western Margin of Sunda plate was subjected to a major E-W compression, accommodated by oblique conjugate strike slip faults, leading to the formation of a large orogenic belt which is nowadays difficult to observe due to a poly-phase rifting that took place in the internal zone of this previously formed belt. The obliquity of this deformation illustrates the importance of inherited Paleozoic Gondwanian basement discontinuities on the subsequent rifting patterns.",

            "abstract": "We perform kinetic linear theory instability analysis in a non-drifting anisotropic electron-proton plasma to study the effects of proton temperature anisotropies on the electron firehose instability in the collisionless solar wind. We solve the Vlasov linear theory dispersion relation for hot highly anisotropic electron-proton plasma in high-beta regime to study the behavior of the solar wind plasma close to the instability thresholds as observed by different spacecraft at 1 AU. We consider temperature and anisotropy regimes for which the electrons and the protons can interact via the excited electromagnetic fluctuations. For the selected parameters simultaneous electron and proton firehose instabilities can be observed with the growth rate of the electron firehose instability extending towards the proton scales. The co-existance of the proton and the electron firehose and the mixing of scales for the electromagnetic fluctuations excited by the two instabilities depends on the initial temperatures, anisotropies and angle of propagation. In the case of parallel wave propagation both left and right-hand polarized waves are simultaneously excited. As we increase the angle of propagation the electron firehose starts to dominate with excitation of large-amplitude aperiodic fluctuations over a large range of wave-numbers, starting at the protons scales and extending up to the smaller electron scales. We calculate the maximum growth rate of the oblique electron firehose as a function of the proton temperature anisotropy and discuss the implications of the electron-proton scale mixing for the observed plasma properties and instability thresholds in the undisturbed solar wind.",

Therefore, LAI is a crucial input variable in many large scale land surface schemes. Nonlinear dependencies of processes upon LAI require to account for its spatial heterogeneity.\nLAI data derived from remote sensing (RapidEye, resolution 5 m) and simulated with the ecohydrological simulation system DANUBIA (resolution 150 m) were analyzed for the fertile loess plain (1100 km2) of the Rur catchment in Germany for the year 2011. Spatial heterogeneity is described by relative frequency distributions (spatial variability) and ranges of semivariograms (spatial structure).\nDespite the different resolutions, model results of LAI are generally very similar to remote sensing data. Relative frequency distributions (RFD) of LAI can be explained by the superimposition of RFDs of the main crops’ LAI. While upscaling (by averaging) does not change the spatial mean LAI, it reduces the standard deviation. At spatial resolutions less than 300 m, the RFDs of LAI change from asymmetric multi-peak to symmetric single-peak shapes.\nSpatial structure in terms of theoretical semivariogram ranges shows two characteristic lengths of 100 to 300 m and 2 to 20 km corresponding to the dimensions of agricultural fields and soil properties. Information on the shorter lengths is conserved during upscaling down to resolutions of about 500 m.\nResults show that for the test area, information required to comprehensively describe spatial heterogeneity (spatial variability and structure) of LAI is not conserved at spatial resolutions less than 300 m.",

We installed seven piezometers (IYHW1 to 7) in the streambed that across stream in every 10 m and in depth of 0.85 to 1.54 m, a device that measure stage level nearby IYHW1, and devices that measure soil temperature in every 10 cm down to 50 cm nearby each piezometer was installed. We monitored water level and water temperature every hour from automatic transducers at the piezometers and the stage level, and soil temperatures were monitored every two hours. We took samples from the hyporheic water, stream water, and nearby groundwater to analysis chemical and isotopic compositions. The water level difference between stream water and hyporheic waters indicated that groundwater was downwelling in wet season and upwelling in dry season. The groundwater temperature remained steady in different seasons, but the stream water represented a frequent fluctuation with large amplitude. The hyporheic waters and soil temperature represented intermediate variation characteristics. The chemical compositions were not able to indicate in interaction of groundwater and stream water because no distinctive difference in seasonal variation in waters. The quantity of isotopic compositions of oxygen and hydrogen determined from using mixing ratio indicated that downwelling in wet season and upwelling in dry season.

            "abstract": "About 57% of the Earth’s surface is covered by oceanic crust and new ocean floor is continuously created along the ~60.000 km long mid-ocean ridge (MOR) system. About 25% of the MOR spread at an ultra-slow spreading rate of <20 mm/yr. At ultra-slow spreading rates the melt supply to the ridge is thought to dramatically decrease and crustal thickness decreases to a thickness of <6 km. However, we know little about the processes shaping crust at reduced spreading rates. A formation of crust from a magma chamber would suggest the creation of a well stratified crust, with an extrusive upper crust (layer 2) and a lower gabbroic crust (lower 3) and a well-defined crust-mantle boundary and hence a seismic Moho. In contrast, decompressional melting without formation of a magma chamber would support a crustal structure where seismic velocities change gradually from values typical of crustal rocks to mantle rocks. Here, we report initial results from a survey from the ultra-slow spreading Cayman Spreading Centre in the Caribbean Sea, sampling mature crust along a flowline from both conjugated ridge flanks. The seismic refraction and wide-angle survey was conducted using ocean-bottom-seismometers from Germany, the UK, and Texas and a 5500 cubic-inch airgun-array source towed by the German research vessel METEOR in April 2015. Typical crustal velocities support a thin crust of 3 to 5 km thickness. However, a well-defined Moho boundary was not observed. Thus, velocities change gradually from crustal-type velocities (<7.2 km/s) to values of 7.6-7.8 km/s, supporting mantle rocks. We suggest that reduced mantle velocities indicate gabbroic intrusions within the mantle rather than indicating serpentinization.",

            "abstract": "The tectonic configuration of the Banda region in southeast Asia captures the spatial transition from subduction of Indian Ocean lithosphere to subduction and collision of the Australian continental lithosphere beneath the Timor Sea, which can be considered as the temporal transition of the initiation of continental collision. An ongoing broadband seismic deployment funded by NSF is aimed at better understanding the mantle and lithospheric structure in the region and the relationship of the arc-continent collision to orogenesis. Here, we present results from ambient noise tomography in the region utilizing this temporary deployment of 30 broadband instruments and 38 permanent stations in Indonesia and Australia. Despite having only a year of data from the new experiment and about 2.5 years of data in total, we are already able to measure stable dispersion curves for several paths resulting in good recovery for the Savu Sea, Timor Leste, and the Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) region of Indonesia. The resulting initial three dimensional shear velocity model indicates significant lateral heterogeneity along the plate boundary. The model contains clear anomalies associated with the subducting oceanic lithosphere, subducted Australian continental lithosphere, and perhaps delaminated oceanic sediments forming the core of the island of Timor. In this initial 3D model, the subducted lithosphere appears to shallow under the islands of Timor and Sumba relative its position beneath to the Savu Sea where oceanic or transitional lithosphere is being subducted. Additionally, a low velocity anomaly associated with the island of Timor from near the surface to ~8 km depth is observed. Under the island of Sumba, a high velocity anomaly is observed between 10 and 20 km depths. These differences may reflect variation in the stage of subduction along strike, compositional variations, or the influences of subducting seamounts such as the Scott Plateau. Finally, we observe localized low velocity mid-crustal anomalies along the active arc to the north of Timor and Sumba associated with volcanic centers. This suggests these volcanoes may be sampling a common mid crustal magma chamber.",

            "abstract": "Observations of weak short-period teleseismic body waves help to resolve lowermost mantle structure at short wavelengths, which is essential for understanding mantle dynamics and the interactions between the mantle and core. Their limited amount and uneven distribution are however major obstacles to solve for volumetric structure of the D” region, topography of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and D” discontinuity, and the trade-offs among them. While PcP-P differential travel times provide important information, there are trade-offs between velocity structure and core-mantle boundary topography, which PcP/P amplitude ratios can help resolve, as long as lateral variations in attenuation and biases due to focusing are small or can be corrected for.\nDense broadband seismic networks help to improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the target phases and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of other mantle phases when the slowness difference is large enough. To improve SIR and SNR of teleseismic PcP data, we have introduced the slant-stacklet transform to define coherent-guided filters able to separate and enhance signals according to their slowness, time of arrival and frequency content. We thus obtain optimal PcP/P amplitude ratios in the least-square sense using two short sliding windows to match the P signal with a candidate PcP signal. This method allows us to dramatically increase the amount of high-quality observations of short-period PcP/P amplitude ratios by allowing for smaller events and wider epicentral distance and depth ranges.\nWe present the results of measurement of PcP/P amplitude ratios, sampling regions around the Pacific using dense arrays in North America and Japan. We observe that short-period P waves traveling through slabs are strongly affected by focusing, in agreement with the bias we have observed and corrected for due to mantle heterogeneities on PcP-P travel time differences. In Central America, this bias is by far the stronger anomaly we observe after correcting for geometrical spreading, radiation pattern of the source, reflection and transmission coefficients at interfaces and intrinsic attenuation using the AK135 and QL6 1-D models. In areas not influenced by slabs, we generally see lower amplitude ratios than predicted.",

            "abstract": "South China Sea (SCS) is the largest marginal sea of the western north Pacific. Due to the interaction between the abrupt topography at the Luzon Strait (LS) and the barotropical tides, internal tides (ITs) are active in the northern SCS. Therefore, to clarify the temporal variations and spatial distributions of the internal tides in the northern SCS, and to investigate the propagation and evolution of internal tides and its contributions to the deep ocean mixing, a mooring array with up to 11 moorings has been built in the northern SCS since 2010. Based on continuous observations for 5 years, a series of studies are conducted here, to analyze the temporal variability and spatial structure of the internal tides in the SCS, to describe the propagation paths of the internal tides in the SCS, to explore the influence of barotropical tides at LS to the internal tides in the northern SCS, and to quantify the contributions of the internal tides to deep ocean mixing in the northern SCS. A series of research results are as follows:\nIn the northern SCS, the diurnal tide kinetic energy is found to exhibit apparent seasonal variability—strongest in summer and weakest in autumn and spring. However, the variability of semidiurnal tide is just opposite, but with smaller amplitude. It is further found that the barotropical tide and the diurnal internal tide observed at the generation site also display a similar seasonal variation with diurnal internal tides in northeast SCS, which indicates that the barotropical tidal current at the source region has the potential to account for the seasonal variability of the diurnal tide on the continental slope of the northern SCS. During the westward propagation from LS to the continental slope and shelf in the SCS, the energy proportion of higher mode internal waves are increasing for diurnal tide, but decreasing gradually for semidiurnal tide. The internal tides are propagating away from the Luzon Strait, with the diurnal internal tides mainly propagating toward the southwest, and the semidiurnal internal tides toward the northwest. Vertical energy flux of semidiurnal internal tides is stronger than that of diurnal tides, both being stronger in winter, especially in December.",

            "abstract": "Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is often used to measure the H2O and CO2 contents of volcanic glasses. A key advantage of FTIR over other analytical techniques is that it can reveal not only total H2O concentration but also H2O speciation, i.e. how much H2O is present as molecular H2O (H2Om) and how much as hydroxyl groups (OH) bound to the silicate network. This H2O speciation data can be used to investigate cooling rate and glass transition temperature of volcanic glasses, and to interpret H2O contents of pyroclasts affected by partial bubble resorption during cooling or secondary hydration after deposition. FTIR in transmitted light requires sample wafers polished on both sides of known thickness. Thickness is commonly measured using a micrometer but this may damage fragile samples and in samples with non-uniform thickness, e.g. vesicular samples, it is difficult to position at the exact location of FTIR analysis. Furthermore, in FTIR images or maps of such samples it is impractical to determine the thickness across the whole of the analysed area, resulting either in only a selection of the collected data being processed quantitatively and the rest being unused, or results being presented in terms of absorbance, which does not account for variations in thickness.\nIt is known that FTIR spectra contain absorption peaks related to the glass aluminosilicate network at wavenumbers of ~2000, ~1830 and ~1600 cm-1 [1]. These have been shown to be proportional to sample thickness at the analysis location for one obsidian composition with up to 0.66 wt% H2O [2]. We test whether this calibration can be applied more widely by analysing a range of synthetic and natural glasses (andesitic to rhyolitic) to examine how the position and relative intensities of the different silicate absorption peaks vary with composition and H2O content. Our data show that even minor differences in composition necessitate a unique calibration. Furthermore, importantly we show how interference between the ~1600 cm-1 silicate peak and ~1630 cm-1 H2Om peak can result in significant overestimation of H2Om, and demonstrate how the relationship between silicate peak intensities and sample thickness can be used to assess and correct for this interference.\n[1] Newman et al (1986) Am Min 71, 1527-41\n[2] Miwa & Toramaru (2013) Bull Volc 75, 685-97",

            "abstract": "In 2011, a 13-m high Chijiawan Dam on Chijiawan Creek was removed due to the safety concern due to aging structure and scoured dam foundation as well as habitat restoration of the endangered Formosan landlocked salmon. Similar to Chijiawan Dam, many dams in Taiwan are located in steep mountainous area with coarser sediment and high sediment yield, and may be removed in the near future. Since the capability of current sediment transport model is insufficient, a systematic planning of field survey and monitoring work can effectively help to decrease data uncertainty in simulation. In this study, we aimed to understand the minimum requirements of data for numerical model to predict channel responses after dam removal, according to the data of pre-project and long term post-project monitoring works from removal of Chijiawan dam.\nWe collected the hourly discharge data of Taipower gaging station located 6.8 km from the dam from 2010 to 2012 and conducted surveys of grain size distributions, cross-sectional and longitudinal profiles. We applied Sedimentation and River Hydraulics (SRH) one-dimensional model to simulate bed elevation changes by different setting of data input, including bed sediment, roughness coefficient, cross-section spacing, and flow discharge. Then, we performed a sensitivity analysis by using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate the minimum requirements of data for predicting to dam removal. The RMSE variability of varied setting of bed sediment, roughness coefficient, cross-section spacing, and flow discharge ranged from 0.02 m, 0.17 m, 0.14 m and 0.09 m, respectively. The results highlight that the simulation is sensitive to roughness coefficient, cross-section spacing, and flow discharge, and less sensitive to bed sediment. We anticipate the results will help decision maker to understand the importance of field data in future removals.",

            "abstract": "Located in the Marmara Sea, the Istanbul-Silivri segment of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) is known to be a seismic gap since 1766, although, in the last century, the NAF has caused major devastating earthquakes over most of its extent. This fault segment, void of seismicity, may be either creeping aseismically or blocked and accumulating enough strain to produce an earthquake of magnitude 7 or greater. This section of the NAF may thus represent a major seismic and tsunamigenic hazard for the Istanbul megalopolis, located only 40 km away.\nThe objective of the MARSITE project, funded by the European Union and coordinated by the Observatory of the University of Kandilli (KOERI), is to determine the blocking state of the Istanbul-Silivri fault segment. In this context, an array of 10 acoustic transponders has been deployed on either sides of the fault, in the eastern part of the Kumburgaz Basin, to measure the displacements of the fault over a period of 3 to 5 years. The telemetric beacons (4 from the University of Brest and 6 from the GEOMAR Institute in Kiel) form two arrays fitted in one another.\nThe principle of the experiment is to repeatedly measure the distance (ie two-way-travel time of acoustic pings) between pairs of beacons and thus to monitor the deformation of an array of 9 baselines, 500m to 3000m long, of which 5 cross obliquely the assumed fault trace. The French and German arrays are independent but ensure a redundancy of rangings along common baselines. Each acoustic transponder also monitors the temperature, pressure, sound-velocity and attitude (tiltmeters), every one or two hours. Data are stored in each beacon and can be downloaded from the surface using an acoustic modem. We present here the first 6 months of recording by the French array, from November 1st, 2014 to April 25, 2015.\nAll acoustic transponders worked nominally for 6 months and appear to have remained stable on the seafloor. Recorded sea-bottom temperatures provide evidence for transient changes likely due to episodic flows of deep colder water across the Kumburgaz Basin. Pressure records display diurnal variations related to the tides. Both parameters affect the sound-velocity and thus the acoustic ranges, and are used to correct the baselines.",

While short period geophone is only mass in a coil the broadband sensor is sophisticated combination of feedback circuits. Experience shows that broadband sensors are very sensitive to ground motion and its orientation, especially tilt. On March 17, 2015 an amazing, strong event was simultaneously recorded by all stations at Z component, with very long period - not typical for seismic events. Records at the same time suggested geomagnetic storm. In this study broadband seismometer response to electromagnetic wave caused by geomagnetic storms is shown and analyzed. Main observation was done using network of 13 broadband stations in northern Poland. Same signal was recorded on all stations on area of 120 km in diameter. Time and shape of recording was exactly the same as recording of magnetic anomaly in permanent magnetic station HEL located about 50 km from the nearest seismic station. The first small event was recorded at about 5 am, and following it strong event started at about 4 pm UTC. An increase of signal amplitude is observed with geomagnetic latitude in the range 52.26 - 53.27o (corresponding geographic 53.69 - 54.54oN). Seismic and magnetic records are compared for other permanent stations in the area, as well as for other recent storms. In this study circumstances needed for recording magnetic anomalies with seismic stations are discussed based on years of seismic recording by Polish permanent stations and temporary passive experiments “13BB star” and PASSEQ.

            "abstract": "The snow and ice on the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) experienced the extreme surface melt around 12 July, 2012. In order to understand the snow-atmosphere interaction during the period, we applied a physical snowpack model SMAP to the GrIS snowpack. In the SMAP model, the snow albedo is calculated by the PBSAM component explicitly considering effects of snow grain size and light-absorbing snow impurities such as black carbon and dust. Temporal evolution of snow grain size is calculated internally in the SMAP model, whereas mass concentrations of snow impurities are externally given from observations. In the PBSAM, the (shortwave) snow albedo is calculated from a weighted summation of visible albedo (primarily affected by snow impurities) and near-infrared albedo (mainly controlled by snow grain size). The weights for these albedos are the visible and near-infrared fractions of the downward shortwave radiant flux. The SMAP model forced by meteorological data obtained from an automated weather station at SIGMA-A site, northwest GrIS during 30 June to 14 July, 2012　(IOP) was evaluated in terms of surface (optically equivalent) snow grain size and snow albedo. Snow grain size simulated by the model was compared against that retrieved from in-situ spectral albedo measurements. Although the RMSE and ME were reasonable (0.21 mm and 0.17 mm, respectively), the small snow grain size associated with the surface hoar could not be simulated by the SMAP model. As for snow albedo, simulation results agreed well with observations throughout the IOP (RMSE was 0.022 and ME was 0.008). Under cloudy-sky conditions, the SMAP model reproduced observed rapid increase in the snow albedo. When cloud cover is present the near-infrared fraction of the downward shortwave radiant flux is decreased, while it is increased under clear-sky conditions. Therefore, the above mentioned performance of the SMAP model can be attributed to the PBSAM component driven by the observed near-infrared and visible fractions of the downward shortwave radiant flux. This result suggests that it is necessary for snowpack models to consider changes in the visible and near-infrared fractions of the downward shortwave radiant flux caused by the presence of cloud cover to reproduce realistic temporal changes in the snow albedo and consequently the surface energy balance.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor of older ages shows a constancy of heat flow, and bathymetry that is different from what is expected for a half-space cooling model. These observations led to consideration of the existence of small-scale convection below the lithosphere (Parsons and McKenzie, 1978). Previous studies have characterized the detailed physics of such processes (Davaille and Jaupart, 1994; Choblet and Sotin, 2000; Solomatov and Moresi, 2000; Korenaga and Jordan, 2003 among others). However, questions remain for applications to the Earth: what is the shape of developed small-scale convection, what length-scales are involved, how does associated small-scale convection depend on the plate layout and its time-dependence.\nUsing 3D spherical models of mantle convection with plate-like behaviour (Tackley, 2008), we will present a study of developed small-scale convection in a context of self-organization of plates and mantle flow. Small-scale convection depends on the resistance of the lithosphere, and its development beneath large plates produce network shapes with specific length-scales and orientations (see figure). We will show the impact of the size of plates and the evolution of subduction on the small-scale convection, and characterize how the age-heat flow relationship can change with time. The potential for seismic detection of the spatiotemporal patterns of temperature heterogeneity will also be discussed.\n",

            "abstract": "Farmers in Africa are highly vulnerable to variability in the weather – especially to drought. Robust and timely information on drought risk can enable farmers to take action to increase yields. Such information also forms the basis of financial instruments, such as weather index insurance. Monitoring weather conditions is, however, difficult in Africa because of the heteorogeneity of the climate, and the sparcity of the ground-observing network. Remotely sensed data (for example satellite-based rainfall estimates) are an alternative to ground observations – but only if the algorithms have skill and the data are presented in a useful form. A more fundamental issue is that the condition of the land surface is affected by factors other than rainfall. The evolving risk of agricultural drought is thus determined by the properties of the land surface, the contemporaneous soil moisture and the risk of rainfall deficits.\nWe present a prototype agricultural decision support tool, based on the JULES land-surface model, driven with ensembles of meteorological driving data, which encompass the uncertainty in rainfall. We discuss the application of the tool for designing and implementing drought insurance in Ghana and Zambia – illustrated with real examples of weather index insurance schemes that are already active.",

            "abstract": "The Wairakei geothermal field is located in the south-western end of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), a NNE-trending rifting arc, New Zealand. Commercial geothermal power generation commenced at the Wairakei filed in 1958, with large scale infield reinjection started in eastern Wairakei (Oputu) in 1998 and expanded to southern Wairakei (Karapiti) in 2011.\nSince 2009, Contact Energy Ltd. has operated 13 borehole seismometers installed in the Wairakei area and observed micro-earthquakes, generally magnitude < 2. Seismic activity in the Karapiti reinjection field has noticeably increased after the start of reinjection in 2011. The hypocenter locations are mainly in the range of between 500m and 1,500m depth coinciding with the permeable Wairakei ignimbrite geological unit.\nIn this study, we investigate hydraulic parameters of the geothermal reservoir and faults from micro-seismicity occurred in the Karapiti area between August 2011 and July 2014 using the r-t plot proposed by Shapiro (2002) and Shapiro and Dinske (2009). To estimate hydraulic diffusivity of the reservoir, the Karapiti area was divided into 3 geological layers (Waiora formation, Wairakei ignimbrite, and Tahorakuri formation). A total of six fault structures showing pore pressure propagation patterns were identified from an event cluster analysis using CURATE. In Karapiti area, seven injectors have been operated with three different reinjection time stages. To consider this situation, we made r-t composite plots for the hydraulic diffusivities of the reservoir and faults.\nThe estimated hydraulic diffusivities of the three geological layers show a narrow range of 0.02 and 0.08 m2/s. The calculated hydraulic diffusivities of the faults range between 0.8 and 4.5 m2/s which show higher values than those for the reservoir. A noticeable figure is that the faults embedded in the Wairakei ignimbrite have higher value than others. We were not able to find any remarkable relationship between fault direction and hydraulic diffusivity.\nIn order to estimate hydraulic diffusivity more accurately, we are re-calculating the hypocenter locations of Karapiti events using the non-linear location program, NonLinLoc (Lomax et al. 2000). In addition, through measured or estimated rock and fluid properties, we will convert hydraulic diffusivity to permeability.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning, vehicular and industrials emissions of atmospheric fine-particulate matter over south and south-east Asia have led to degradation of regional air-quality, poor visibility and possible impact on regional climate change. In addition to airborne particles of primary origin, secondary aerosol formation has been recognized as a dominant process contributing to air pollution and visibility impairment over urban areas. The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) is one of the densely populated regions in northern India where PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) throughout the year. Aerosol chemical composition analysis suggests that carbonaceous (EC, OC) and water-soluble inorganic species (WSIS) contribute ~30-35% and ~15-20% of PM10 mass, respectively during wintertime. The formation of fog and haze, a common phenomenon observed during wintertime in the IGP, is associated with high aerosol loading from anthropogenic emission sources as well as formation of secondary aerosols via gas to particle conversion under favorable meteorological conditions. Our studies indicate that mass concentrations of EC, OC and WSOC show nearly 30% increase during fog and haze events; whereas inorganic constituents (NH4+, NO3 - and SO4 2-) are 2-3 times higher than those during clear days. The sulphur and nitrogen oxidation ratios (SOR and NOR) also exhibit significant increase suggesting possible enhancement of secondary formation of SO42- and NO3- during fog and haze events. The average WSOC/OC ratio is relatively high in the day-time samples (0.66 ± 0.11) compared to that in the night-time (0.47 ± 0.07); suggesting an increased contribution of secondary organic aerosols. This talk will discuss our understanding of optical, microphysical, CCN and cloud activation processes over northern India.",

            "abstract": "Peninsular shield of India is composed of several Archaean cratons bordered by Proterozoic mobile belts which amalgamated the Archaean cratons and helped in the growth of the Indian subcontinent. The ENE-WSW trending Central Indian Tectonic Zone (CITZ) is one such important mobile belt which sutures the Bundelkhand and the Aravalli craton in the north and Bastar, Singhbhum and Dharwar cratons in the south.\nThe CITZ is a collection of lithotectonic terranes ranging in age from Archaean to recent and comprises supracrustal belts, granulite belts, shear zones and felsic-mafic magmatic rocks. The Betul belt is characterized by a litho-package of plutonic magmatic rocks, volcano-sedimentary rocks, bimodal volcanics and associated base metal sulphide mineralization. The petrological, geochemical and geochronological evolution of the mafic magmatic rocks has significance in our understanding of Proterozoic crustal evolution in central India.\nHere we report major and trace element concentrations of 14 mafic samples (basaslts, gabbors, pyroxenites and dolerites) in an attempt to classify, characterise and suggest a spatial and temporal evolution of the mafic magmatic rocks of the Betul mobile belt vis-à-vis CITZ. Traditionally these rocks have been classified as being calc-alkaline rocks, related to arc volcanism and rift tectonics.\nWe have divided these rocks into those have a positive Europium anomaly and those having a negative Europium anomaly to better understand the source and the contaminant for these rocks. We find characterisitic difference specifically in the trace element ratios and concentrations of the rocks with +Eu anomaly [La=10.69ppm; LaN/YbN=3.65] and those with –Eu anomaly [La=27.59; LaN/YbN=8.86]. Based on these data we propose that the Betul mafic rocks may have been derived from an enriched mantle source that experienced contamination from the lower continental crust or sub-continental lithosphere prior to eruption.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s bow shock shows different characteristics according to the plasma beta of upstream solar wind. In this study we investigated kinetic properties of ions at a low beta shock using measurements from the Cluster spacecraft. On 27 January 2001 Cluster observed gradual transition of the bow shock from high beta to low beta. For the high-beta shock the temperature of ions increased largely across the shock. However, the velocity space distributions in the downstream region show that the ions consist of two different components. One of them is the solar wind ion beam transmitted into the downstream region across the shock, which is a little bit thermalized from the upstream solar wind. The other is hotter component with bi-Maxwellian distribution. This observation implies that the solar wind ion beam does not instantly thermalize at the shock boundary into the hot ions in the magnetosheath. As the beta of the upstream solar wind becomes lower, the hotter component is substantially reduced and the solar wind ion beam maintains its shape in the velocity space while being slightly thermalized. Moreover, the velocity space distribution of the hotter component becomes more kappa-like, especially along the velocity parallel to the magnetic field. We will compare the level of thermalization of the high-beta and low-beta shocks, which will provide better insight about the thermalization process at collisionless shocks.",

            "abstract": "GHOST is a novel, compact shortwave infrared spectrometer, designed for remote sensing of tropospheric columns of greenhouse gases (GHGs) over the ocean from an unmanned aircraft. This is achieved by observing solar radiation at high spectral resolution which has been directly reflected by the ocean surface. The GHOST system has been specifically designed and built to address the following science objectives: 1) testing of atmospheric transport models; 2) validation of GHG column observations over oceans obtained using polar orbiting satellites; and 3) complement in-situ tropopause transition layer observations from other instruments.\nDuring January and February 2015 GHOST successfully underwent rigorous environmental testing and was installed on board the Northrop Grumman Global Hawk N872NA, an unmanned aircraft operated by NASA from the Armstrong Flight Research Centre at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Here, we present first results from two Global Hawk flights which took place in March 2015 as part of the CAST-ATTREX campaign. The science flights comprised long, approximately north-south transects over the eastern Pacific Ocean, providing an opportunity to observe spatial trends in GHG column concentrations on regional scale. The second science flight on 10th March 2015 coincided with overpasses from both the NASA OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory) and the JAXA GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite) satellites, enabling inter-comparison of the GHOST results with total column observations from both satellites. A TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network) station was also operational at Edwards during the two flights, allowing the GHOST observations to be validated against ground based total column measurements of GHGs.",

            "abstract": "Technological innovations used for sustainable urban development, green roofs offer a range of benefits, including reduced heat island effect, rooftop runoff, roof surface temperatures, energy consumption, and noise levels inside buildings, as well as increased urban biodiversity. Green roofs feature layered construction, with the most important layers being the vegetation and the substrate layers located above the traditional roof. These layers provide both insulation and warm season cooling by latent heat flux, reducing the thermal load to the building. To understand and improve the processes driving this thermal energy reduction, it is important to observe the thermal dynamics of a green roof at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales.\nTraditionally, to observe the thermal behavior of green roofs, a series of thermocouples have been installed at discrete depths within the layers of the roof. Here, we present a vertical high-resolution distributed-temperature-sensing (DTS) system installed in different green roof modules of the Laboratory of Vegetated Infrastructure for Buildings (LIVE –its acronym in Spanish) of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. This DTS system allows near-continuous measurement of the thermal profile at spatial and temporal resolutions of approximately 1 cm and 30 s, respectively. In this investigation, the temperature observations from the DTS system are compared with the measurements of a series of thermocouples installed in the green roofs. This comparison makes it possible to assess the value of thermal observations at better spatial and temporal resolutions. We show that the errors associated with lower resolution observations (i.e., from the thermocouples) are propagated in the calculations of the heat fluxes through the different layers of the green roof. Our results highlight the value of having a vertical high-resolution DTS system to observe the thermal dynamics in green roofs.",

Such a minimum appears simultaneously[7] with the initiation of Seismic Electric Signals activity[8] being the first time in which two geophysical observables of different nature exhibit simultaneous anomalous behavior before major EQs.

            "abstract": "The oblique arc-continental collision coupled with high tectonic deformation rates and sub-tropical climate have made Taiwan an ideal area for studies of the interactions among tectonic, climate and surface processes. Numerous efforts have been made to derive the uplift pattern at different time scales; however, there is still a data gap at the millennial timescale. In-situ, cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in quartz from modern river sands address this timescale and can provide basin-wide erosion rates. We present here a study of the southern Central Range, combining a cosmogenic nuclide study with analysis of the main topographic characteristics. In this region, the mechanism of mountain building changes from accretionary wedge deformation to arc-continental collision with transient landscapes and complex uplift patterns.\nTo characterize the uplift pattern in the southern Central Range, we apply χ analysis to infer average channel steepness of each drainage basin, for comparison to the in-situ 10Be concentrations in modern river sands. The spatial pattern of average channel steepness correlates with the basin-wide erosion rate, both showing a gradual increase to the north. The correlation confirms that 10Be concentrations reflect erosion rates over the timescale of landscape evolution. We also identify several transient features from χ analysis, indicating drainage basin reorganization. These drainage area rearrangements are also reflected in the basin-wide erosion rates, which confirms transience in the landscape including the channel network geometry. We also tested the impact of an extreme event, typhoon Morakot, which impacted the study area in 2009 with heavy rainfall and several thousand landslides. We obtained sand samples from before and after the typhoon. We find that post-typhoon samples yield higher inferred erosion rates, suggesting dilution of the sediment by quartz with low concentrations of 10Be.",

            "abstract": "The Salton Trough in southern California is a tectonically active pull-apart basin that was formed by migrating step-overs between strike-slip faults, of which the San Andreas Fault (SAF) and the Imperial Fault are the current, northernmost examples. The Salton Seismic Imaging Project (SSIP) was undertaken to improve our knowledge of fault geometry and seismic velocities within the sedimentary basins and underlying crystalline crust around the SAF. Such data are useful as input for modeling scenarios of strong ground shaking in the surrounding high-population areas. We used pre-stack depth migration of line segments from shot gathers in several seismic profiles that were acquired in the northern part of the SSIP study area (Lines 4 - 7). Our migration approach can be considered as an infinite-frequency approximation of the Fresnel volume pre-stack depth migration method. We use line segments instead of the original waveform data. We demonstrate the method using synthetic data and analyze real data from Lines 4 - 7 to illustrate the relationship between distinct phases in the time domain and their resulting image at depth. We show both normal-moveout reflections from sub-horizontal interfaces and reverse-moveout reflections from steep interfaces, such as faults. Migrated images of dipping faults, such as the SAF and the Pinto Mountain Fault, are presented in this way. The SAF is imaged along Line 4, through the Mecca Hills, as a number of steeply dipping fault segments that collectively form a flower structure, above 5 km depth, that sole into a moderately NE-dipping fault below that depth. The individual migrated reflection packages correlate with mapped surface fault traces in the Mecca Hills. A similar geometry is seen on Line 6, from Palm Springs through Yucca Valley, where fault splays sole or project into a moderately dipping SAF below 10-km depth. We also show and discuss the reflectivity pattern of the middle and lower crust for Lines 4 - 7.",

This paper aims to provide a general overview of changes on future runoffs and water levels in the Qu River Basin, upper reaches of Qiantang River, East China by combining future climate scenarios, hydrological model and 1D hydraulic model. The outputs of four GCMs BCC, BNU, CanESM and CSIRO under two scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for 2021-2050 are chosen to represent future climate change projections. The LARS-WG statistical downscaling method is used to downscale the coarse GCM outputs and generate 50 years of synthetic precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures to drive the GR4J hydrological model and the 1D hydraulic model for the baseline period 1971-2000 and the future period 2021-2050. Finally the POT (Peaks Over Threshold) method is applied to analyze the change of extreme events in the study area. The results show that design runoffs and water levels all indicate an increasing trend in the future period for Changshangang River, Jiangshangang River and Qu River at most cases, especially for small return periods(≤20), and for Qu River the increase becomes larger, which suggests that the risk of flooding will probably become greater and appropriate adaptation measures need to be taken.",

            "abstract": "When managed effectively and sustainably crop yield in irrigated agriculture can be up to three times than in rainfed agriculture. Unsurprisingly, irrigation agriculture is globally gaining in importance. This is especially true in Africa where the share of irrigated to rainfed agriculture in terms of area cultivated is below global averages.\nA large-scale expansion of irrigation, nonetheless has the potential to alter the natural hydrological cycle at local up to basin scales. In all cases, a good understanding of the water balance is needed. However, and especially in the developing context, data are scarce and knowledge about the available resources is most often not present. Some of the key reasons are: a) traditional monitoring approaches do not scale in terms of costs, b) repair is difficult and c) vandalism. There is a clear need of cheaper and easy-to-use methods for gathering information on water use and water availability.\nWe have developed a mobile device application for measuring discharge in rivers and irrigation furrows. The discharge is computed by analysing a few seconds of a movie recorded using the built-in camera. The great advantage is that the only requirement is that the field of view contains two reference markers with known scale and with known position relative to the channel geometry, a priori knowledge on the channel geometry and its roughness. The other great advantage is that the data collected (water level, surface velocity and discharge) can be sent via SMS or web-service to a central database.\nThe app is being currently used in a formerly ungauged catchment, the Themi River, which is part of the Pangani Basin in Tanzania. Furrow leaders and community members measure furrow discharges on-farm and monitor water levels in rivers off-farm. These community members were given a smartphone and received thorough training. Additionally, off-grid members have received a mobile recharging solution. Operational Expenses of the community members who are performing crowd-sensing are fully compensated via a clear contractual relationship with a Service Center. Since the beginning of 2015, data are collected at 11 river sites and 23 furrow intakes on a daily basis. Average instrumentation costs per river/furrow site are in the order of USD 200.-. Average monthly operational costs are USD 15.- per site.",

            "abstract": "Thermokarst, a process that characterizes landforms caused by thawing of ice-rich permafrost, is a key indicator of permafrost degradation. Surface dynamics of thermokarst processes on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) of China, is still poorly quantified or understood. It is also challenging to detect and measure surface subsidence due to loss of subsurface ice over a large area.\nIn this study, the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) technique is used to retrieve surface subsidence located at Eboling Mountain, near the northern edge of the QTP. Persistent Scatterer (PS) refers to stable natural or man-made object with good coherence in temporal domain. Based on the assumption that the residual phase of nearby PS is smaller than , we can retrieve the unwrapped phase associated with the sparsely irregular data. Using 17 L-band ALOS-1 PALSAR images taken from 2006 to 2011, we find linear deformation trends of up to 50 millimeters per year and seasonal subsidence of up to 80 millimeters over the area where thermokarst gullies are present (location: 38.01° N ,100.90° E , Figure 1), associated with thermokarst development and seasonal thawing of active layer, respectively. Furthermore, to the northwest and northeast of the Eboling thermokarst area, there are several small areas with large subsidence trends, which may also be related to thermokarst processes.\nThis study demonstrates that the PSInSAR technique has the ability to map and quantify thermokarst-induced subsidence spanning multiple years using ALOS-1 PALSAR images. Yet as the thermokarst processes are much more complex in nature than a simple subsidence trend, more efforts are required (1) to validate the PSInSAR results with in situ measurements, (2) to better separate thermokarst-induced subsidence from seasonal ground elevation changes by including winter PSInSAR data and accounting for frost heave processes, and (3) to quantify potential aliasing problem due to the sparse temporal sampling rate of the PSInSAR data. This study promises a potential of using PSInSAR to identify thermokarst landforms, map and quantify surface subsidence due to permafrost degradation, and assess its impacts over large areas on the QTP.",

            "abstract": "The hydrogen isotope composition (δD) of leaf wax n-alkanes in sedimentary archives is commonly used as a qualitative paleohydrology proxy due to its relationship to δD values of water taken up by plants. In addition to source water δD values the climatic and plant physiologically-dependent leaf water D-enrichment is a key process controlling the leaf wax isotopic composition. As leaf water δD values are strongly variable on diurnal to seasonal timescales, it is not possible to capture the full temporal and spatial leaf water variability in the Himalaya by sampling. Modeled δD values in turn can be used to understand the temporal and spatial distribution of leaf water isotopes and enable us to better understand the influence of seasonal variation in source water δD and D/H fractionation processes on the plant leaf water. Moreover seasonally resolved modeled leaf water δD values can be used to understand the seasonal origin of leaf wax n-alkane δD values.\nThe Himalaya provides an excellent natural laboratory to study spatial and temporal leaf water isotope patterns, because it is characterized by large gradients in altitude, precipitation, vegetation type, and temperature. The Indian Summer Monsoon transports moisture from the Bay of Bengal along the Southern Himalayan Front causing strong orographic rainfall with additional winter precipitation derived through the Westerlies.\nTo capture the effect of this spatially and temporally varying hydrology along and across the Himalayan orogeny on leaf water isotope enrichment, we utilized calibrated satellite data (TRMM, MODIS) to drive a steady-state two-pool Craig-Gordon leaf water model (spatial resolution: 5x5 km2 and 8-day temporal resolution). Our model yields more D-depleted leaf water throughout the year towards the Tibetan Plateau reflecting the orographic effect. Compared to the wet summer season winter leaf waters are generally more D-enriched with a less pronounced isotopic lapse rate across the Himalayan range. These different seasonal responses stress the importance of understanding the seasonal origin of the leaf wax δD signal for paleoclimatic studies as well as paleoalitimetry.",

Limitations to the use of EMI for estimating any of these properties exist, due to the ambiguous relationship between the measured apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and the soil properties of interest. To further investigate the potential of EMI for field-scale mapping of θ, we conducted repeated EMI surveys during different hydrological states on a hillslope site where soil properties and θ dynamics were known in detail from a wireless soil moisture monitoring network. Repeated EMI measurements offered the potential to reveal the limits of applicability of the method. For the investigated site we found that i) ECa showed small temporal variations, whereas the range of soil moisture was very large; ii) temporal changes in spatial patterns of ECa differed from temporal changes in spatial patterns of soil moisture; and iii) the ECa-θ relationship varied with time, independent of both the moisture state (dry, intermediate or wet) and the hydrological regime (drying, stable or wetting). This suggests that, at the investigated site, θ has little influence on ECa. Because ECa and θ are predominantly controlled by the same factors and their relative importance changes over time, the ambiguous ECa-θ relationship changes over time, limiting the use of EMI for estimating θ.",

Pressure changes inside the formation cause effective and total stress changes inside and outside of those formations. These changes can bring the reservoir or its surroundings to failure conditions. The existence of faults and weak zones increases the likelihood of failure in rock masses depending on the amount of the injection-induced changes and the formation properties.\nThis paper discusses the stress changes in different reservoir and injection conditions. Numerical analysis indicates that the pressure buildup can significantly change the total and effective stress and these changes are more severe when faults are present in the formation. Also, the reservoir and caprock experience a greater decrease in the mean effective stress and increase in the deviatoric stress in the footwall and hanging wall of a fault in reverse and normal faulting stress regimes, respectively. The stress path depends on the size of the CO2 plume, the pressure distribution inside the reservoir, and fault and reservoir properties.",

            "abstract": "Olivine composition and zoning patterns are widely used to reconstruct the evolution of mafic magmas from source to surface and to extract timescales of magmatic processes. Deciphering the olivine zoning code is challenging because the contributions of growth and diffusion may overlap. A detailed multi-element (Fe, Mg, P, Al, Ni) examination of zoning in an exceptional olivine with skeletal morphology allows unequivocal discrimination between these two processes using simple but powerful geometrical arguments. Olivine crystals initially grow diagonally from corner locations, whereas diffusion follows mutually-perpendicular crystal lattice orientations. Generating the zoning patterns for our case-study olivine required at least 4-5 months of diffusive re-equilibration of Fe-Mg, further demonstrating that crystal morphologies produced by rapid growth can survive at magmatic temperatures for extended periods. No significant major element zoning is preserved after rapid growth, lending further credibility to timescales retrieved via diffusion modeling. Extending multi-element approaches to decoding olivine zoning patterns can help determine whether the kinetic relationship between growth- and diffusion-induced zoning recognized herein is widely applicable. Such studies will improve our understanding of timescales of magma storage, solidification, mixing and/or transit towards the surface.",

The models presented satisfy the observed total mass of each planet and the radius at the observed 1-bar pressure level. We assume the existence of three regions at different depths: an outer adiabatic envelope composed predominately of H2 and He, with a helium mass fraction 0.26, a water-rich layer including varied amounts of rock and hydrogen, and a chemically homogeneous rock core. Using measured rotation rates of Uranus and Neptune, and a density profile obtained for each model using constituent equations of state and the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, we calculate the gravitational harmonics J2 and J4 for comparison with observed values as an additional constraint.\nThe H2-H2O critical curve provides information about the nature of the boundary between the outer, hydrogen-rich envelope and underlying water-rich layer. The extrapolated critical curve for hydrogen-water mixtures crosses the adiabat of the outer atmospheric shell in these models at two depths, implying a shallow outer region of limited miscibility, an intermediate region between ~90 and 98 percent of the total planet radius within which hydrogen and water can mix in all proportions, and another, deeper region of limited miscibility at less than ~90 percent of the total planet radius. The pressure and temperature of the gaseous adiabatic shell at the depth of the shallowest extent of the water-rich layer determines whether a gradual compositional transition or an ocean surface boundary may exist at depth in these planets. To satisfy the observed J2, the outer extent of the water-rich layer in these models must be located between approximately 80 and 85 percent of the total planet radius, within the deep region of limited H2-H2O miscibility, implying an ocean surface is possible within the interior.",

            "abstract": "In this work we assess the main advantages of complementing the standard magnetotelluric (MT) impedance tensor (Z) response with inter-station horizontal magnetic tensor (HMT) and geomagnetic transfer function (GTF) responses. Results were obtained from constraining the subsurface beneath a MT profile in a 3-D environment using distorted synthetic responses and real data.\nFrom the synthetic case study four main improvements were observed when performing joint inversion of Z, HMT and GTF data simultaneously, instead of only inverting the commonly used Zdata: (1) superior precision in the characterization of the electrical resistivity values of the anomalies below and outside the profile; (2) the potential to recover high electrical resistivity anomalies that are poorly recovered by using MT responses alone; (3) improvement in the characterization of the bottom and lateral boundaries of the anomalies with low electrical resistivity; and (4) superior imaging of the continuity of structures with low electrical resistivity.\nA corresponding inversion comparison was performed using real responses from Clare Basin (Co. Clare, Ireland) acquired during summer of 2014 within the IRECCSEM project (www.ireccsem.ie). A total of 140 sites were acquired, including audiomagnetotellurics (AMT) and broadband magnetotelluric (BBMT) time series data. The results obtained undertaking a joint inversion of Z, GTF and HMT data corroborate the results observed in the synthetic study. In addition, when confronted the results of the Clare Basin area with independent geological and geophysical data, the geoelectrical models show higher resolution when HMT and GTF data are included in the inversion process.\nThe observed advantages offer new opportunities for the MT method by making the results from a MT profile in a 3-D environment more believable, supporting the possibility of high-resolution studies without necessarily expending a large amount of economical and computational resources.",

            "abstract": "In the Earth's crust and mantle there are plenty quite sharp discontinuities in material properties. These material contrasts lead to reflections of seismic waves. Detailed images of the contrasts could be made by applying reflection imaging. Thus far, however, reflection imaging of the deep Earth has been restricted to isolated depth ranges, for which sufficient source-receiver reflection paths could be found. Rarely there is a dense sampling of both sources and receivers in the same region, which allows consistent illumination of reflectors over a large depth range. We do create such dataset by applying seismic interferometry to ScS reverberations measured over Japan. The earthquake responses are detected with the Hi-net high-sensitivity accelerometers (tiltmeters) network operated by the NIED. Large-magnitude earthquakes nearby Japan generate a clear ScS phase that is observed over the entire island arc. For deep earthquakes, additionally ScS reverberations can be observed from interfaces ranging from the lithosphere to the mantle transition zone, and all the way to the D'' region. We apply seismic interferometry to a multitude of these ScS arrivals and reverberations. Doing so, the responses are retrieved as if there were shear-wave sources at all Hi-net stations and the resulting reflections were measured at the same stations. We migrate the zero-offset (co-located source and receiver) reflection responses to a reflectivity image. The main features on this image are the Moho, the topography of the 410 and 660 discontinuities and the reflectors delineating low- and high-velocity zones above the core-mantle boundary.",

            "abstract": "Clearing and burning of tropical savanna leads to globally significant emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), although there is large uncertainty relating to the magnitude of this flux. Australia’s tropical savannas are 12% of global savanna extent and are largely intact; however there is currently a focus on agricultural expansion across northern Australia involving clearing for primary production. Eddy covariance and soil chamber methods were used over almost 2 years to quantify CO2 and non-CO2 fluxes from savanna that was cleared and prepared for agriculture (CS). Fluxes from an uncleared site (UC) were also monitored. Carbon fluxes from both sites were similar (NEE -0.23 Mg C ha-1 month-1) for the 5.4 months prior to clearing, a period spanning the late dry to mid-wet season. Fluxes were monitored for a further 17 months through a dry-wet-dry climate cycle and phased land use change which included clearing and a debris curing phase, followed by burning and soil preparation for cropping. Over this period (excluding the managed fire), the CS site was a source of +0.43 Mg C ha-1 month-1 compared to a net sink at the UC site of -0.05 Mg C ha-1 month-1. Woody debris from clearing (30.9 Mg C ha-1) was removed from the site via burning in the late dry season and emission factors were used to calculate emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O which totalled 138.0 Mg CO2-e ha-1. Over the 17 months of monitoring this land transformation, emissions were +9.7 Mg CO2-e ha-1 month-1 compared to a sink of -0.17 Mg CO2-e from the UC site. Using these emissions and LUC scenarios at catchment to regional scales suggest proposed clearing for agriculture could significantly increase the region’s fire-dominated GHG emissions. These data are essential for both land-atmosphere models as well as decision support tools that inform trade-offs between greenhouse gas accounting, conservation and development goals.",

            "abstract": "Astronomical calibration of the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) for the Eocene (34-56 Ma) has advanced tremendously in recent years. Combining a cyclostratigraphic approach based on the recognition of the stable 405-kyr eccentricity cycle of Earth's orbit with high-resolution bio- and magnetostratigraphy from deep-sea sedimentary records (ODP Legs 171B, 189 and 207; IODP Exp. 320/321) resulted in a new calibration of the middle-to-late Eocene GPTS spanning Chrons C12r to C19n (30.9-41.3 Ma). A fully astronomically calibrated GPTS for the Eocene was established recently by integrating cyclo-bio-magnetostratigraphy from ODP Sites 702 and 1263 records spanning the middle Eocene with Site 1258 records covering the early Eocene. Comparison of this deep sea-derived GPTS with GTS2012 and GPTS calibration points from terrestrial successions show overall consistent results, but there are still major offsets for the duration of Chrons C20r, C22r and C23n.2n. Because of the relatively large uncertainty of the calibration point, a radioisotopic dated ash layer in DSDP 516F, at C21n.75 (46.24±0.5 Ma) the duration of C20r in GPTS2012 (2.292 myr) is uncertain. Offsets in durations of C22r and C23n.2n between GPTS2012 and the new astronomical GPTS (~400-kyr longer C22r; ~400-kyr shorter C23n.2n) could be due to uncertainties in the interpretation of Site 1258 magnetostratigraphic data. Here we present new results toward establishing a more accurate and complete bio-, magneto- and chemostratigraphy for South Atlantic Leg 208 sites encompassing magnetochrons C13 to C24 (33 to 56 Ma). Our study aims to integrate paleomagnetic records from multiple drilled sites with physical property data, stable isotope data and XRF core scanning data to construct an astronomically calibrated framework for refining GPTS age estimates. This effort will complete the Early-to-Middle Eocene GPTS and allow evaluation of the relative position of calcareous nannofossil events to magnetostratigraphy.",

For this purpose, we collected the groundwater radionuclides data of 2000-2011 from National Institute of Environmental Research and available literatures. The sample data were classified into five groups according to the rock types and radionuclide levels were used to construct detailed concentration maps. Radon, uranium, gross-α and radium concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 64,688 pCi/L (mean: 4,907 pCi/L), 0 to 2,297 µg/L (mean: 27.5 µg/L), 0 to 312.0 (mean: 3.9 pCi/L) and 0 to 17.4 pCi/L (mean: 0.2 pCi/L), respectively. Radon concentrations in 562 (53.5%) of 1,501 wells exceeded 4,000 pCi/L, which is the maximum contaminant level by the US environmental protection agency. Uranium, gross-α, and radium concentrations in 121 (11.9%) of 1,031 wells, 34 (3.5%) of 978 wells and 4 (4.5%) of 89 wells exceeded 30 µg/L, 15 pCi/L and 5 pCi/L, respectively. Radionuclide mean concentration in igneous and metamorphic rocks showed higher levels than those of other rocks such as volcanic, carbonate and sedimentary rocks. However, we found that correlations among radionuclides were weak or not significant. This subject is supported by Korea Ministry of Environment as “the GAIA project”.",

            "abstract": "Pumped Storage Hydroelectricity (PSH) is a good alternative to increase the efficiency of power plants, which cannot regulate the amount of electricity generated according to the demand (wind, solar or even nuclear power plants). PSH plants, which consist in two reservoirs located at different heights (upper and lower), can store energy during low demand periods (pumping water from the lower to the upper reservoir) and generate electricity during the high demand peaks (falling water from the upper to the lower reservoir). Given that the two reservoirs must be located at different heights, PSH plants cannot be constructed in flat regions. Nevertheless, in these regions, an alternative could be to use abandoned underground works (open pits or deep mines) as lower reservoirs to construct Underground Pumped Storage Hydroelectricity (UPSH) plants. To select the best place to construct a plant, two considerations must be taken into account regarding the interaction between UPSH plants and groundwater: 1) the alteration of the natural conditions of aquifers and 2), the efficiency of the plant since the electricity generated depends on the hydraulic head inside the underground reservoir. Obviously, a detailed numerical model must be necessary before to select a location. However, a screening methodology to reject the most disadvantageous sites in a short period of time would be useful.\nGroundwater flow impacts caused by UPSH plants are analyzed numerically and the main variables involved in the groundwater evolution are identified. The most noticeable effect consists in an oscillation of the groundwater. The hydraulic head around which groundwater oscillates, the magnitude of the oscillations and the time to achieve a “dynamic steady state” depend on the boundaries, the parameters of the aquifer and the characteristics of the underground reservoir. A screening methodology is proposed to assess the main impacts caused in aquifers by UPSH plants. Finally, the efficiency regarding the groundwater evolution inside the reservoir is determined.",

            "abstract": "Microbial S isotope fractionations close to the thermodynamic fractionation between sulfate and sulfide (~70‰) are encountered only at the slowest rates of sulfate reduction in laboratory cultures. In turn, the slowest laboratory reduction rates overlap with only the highest values of cell-specific sulfate reduction rates measured in marine sediments. This chain-of-logic implies that sulfate-reducing microbes in the marine sedimentary biosphere fractionate S isotopes at magnitudes close to the thermodynamic limit. Recent observations from sulfate-poor environments indicate that fractionations are large even at micromolar sulfate concentrations, in agreement with model predictions of near-thermodynamic S isotope fractionation at these sulfate concentrations as long as cell-specific sulfate reduction rates are low. Despite the expectation of large microbial fractionations, pyrite in both modern marine sediments and Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks records apparent fractionations ranging from 0 to more than 70‰.\nWe suggest that the observed range of modern marine and geologic apparent fractionations recorded in pyrite does not reflect variability in intrinsic microbial behavior, but an early diagenetic modulation of large microbial fractionations, which are pinned to the thermodynamic limit by the low natural rates of sulfate reduction. With a diagenetic model developed in this study, we show that the entire range of apparent fractionations is possible with microbial fractionations at the thermodynamic limit. Apparent fractionations depend on a variety of physical parameters of the sedimentary environment like sedimentation rate, porosity, and organic matter content, most of which correlate with water depth. These findings, in combination with knowledge about the preservation potential of sediments deposited at different depths, make predictions for the observed geologic range of apparent fractionations, and ways in which it differs from the range in modern marine sediments.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations indicate that the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) releases methane, which stems from shallow hydrate seabed reservoirs. The total amount of carbon within the ESAS is so large that release of only a small fraction, for example via taliks, which are columns of unfrozen sediment within the permafrost, could impact distinctly the global climate. Therefore it is crucial to simulate the future fate of ESAS’ subsea permafrost with regard to changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions. However only very few attempts to address the vulnerability of subsea permafrost have been made, instead most studies have focused on the evolution of permafrost since the Late Pleistocene ocean transgression, approximately 14000 years ago.\nIn contrast to land permafrost modeling, any attempt to model the future fate of subsea permafrost needs to consider several additional factors, in particular the dependence of freezing temperature on water depth and salt content and the differences in ground heat flux depending on the seabed properties. Also the amount of unfrozen water in the sediment needs to be taken into account. Using a system of coupled ocean, atmosphere and permafrost models will allow us to capture the complexity of the different parts of the system and evaluate the relative importance of different processes.\nHere we present the first results of a novel approach by means of dedicated permafrost model simulations. These have been driven by conditions of the Laptev Sea region in East Siberia. By exploiting the ensemble approach, we will show how uncertainties in boundary conditions and applied forcing scenarios control the future fate of the sub sea permafrost.",

            "abstract": "We introduce a new scheme for the reliable 3D inversion of marine controlled-source electromagnetic (EM) data. Our code, named Modeling with Adaptively Refined Elements for 3D EM (MARE3DEM), uses a new variant of the Occam method for the inversion framework. A parallel goal-oriented adaptive finite element method serves as the backbone for the forward operator.\nBoth the forward and inverse model domains are simulated using unstructured tetrahedral meshes, which readily accommodate arbitrarily complex 3D conductivity variations. The unstructured inverse mesh efficiently handles multiple scale structures and allows for fine-scale model parameters within the region of interest while parameters can be made coarser in the outer domain. The inverse and forward domains are decoupled with the initial forward mesh nested in the inverse mesh. This initial mesh is iteratively refined using a goal-oriented adaptive scheme until the forward solution’s accuracy converges to the desired tolerance. As the key interface between the forward and inverse operator, the sensitivity kernels that establish a linear relationship between changes in the conductivity model and changes in the modeled responses are computed using the adjoint-reciprocity method with the optimal mesh.\nParallel computation of the forward responses and sensitivity kernels follows a data decomposition scheme where independent modeling tasks containing different frequencies and subsets of the transmitters and receivers are simulated in parallel on a high performance computing cluster. Further computational efficiency and scalability is obtained in the regularized Gauss-Newton portion of the inversion using parallel dense matrix-matrix multiplication and matrix factorization routines implemented with the ScaLAPACK library.\nA synthetic isotropic inversion parameters with significant seafloor bathymetry variation and a heterogeneous subsurface shows the reliability of the algorithm and its potential to deal with complex geological scenarios.",

The lack of such sustained observations was identified in the Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS) Cryosphere Theme Report as a major shortcoming. Conventional altimetry measurements over GISMs exist, but coverage has been sparse and characterized by coarse ground resolution. Additionally, and more importantly, they proved ineffective in the presence of steep slopes, a typical feature of GISM areas. Since the majority of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet mass loss is estimated to lie within 100 km from the coast, but only about 10% is surveyed, there is the need for more robust and dense observations of GISMs, in both time and space.\nThe ESA Altimetry mission CryoSat aims at gaining better insight into the evolution of the Cryosphere. CryoSat’s revolutionary design features a Synthetic Interferometric Radar Altimeter (SIRAL), with two antennas for interferometry. The corresponding SAR Interferometer (SARIn) mode of operation increases spatial resolution while resolving the angular origin of off-nadir echoes occurring over sloping terrain. The SARIn mode is activated over GISMs and the elevation for the Point Of Closest Approach (POCA) is a standard product of the CryoSat mission.\nHere we present, through a wide range of examples in Polar settings, a new approach for more comprehensively exploiting the SARIn mode of CryoSat and produce ice elevation and elevation change with enhanced spatial resolution compared to standard CryoSat elevation products. In this so-called CryoSat Swath SARIn (CSSARIn) approach, the signal beyond the POCA is analysed, leading to between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude more elevation measurements than conventional approaches, and providing elevation where conventional POCA fails. We will present the rationale, validation and results of the approach for retrieving elevation, elevation change and volume change over various environments in the Arctic and Antarctic regions e.g. ice sheet margins, ice caps, ice streams, sub-glacial lakes.",

            "abstract": "The Middle America Trench (MAT) extends from the Riviera Fracture Zone offshore Mexico down to the Panama Fracture Zone. Along the MAT, the oceanic Cocos plate changes in character from the older, deeper and relatively smooth plate offshore Guatemala-Nicaragua to the ~20 km thick crust of Cocos Ridge off Costa Rica. These changes occur because the northern part of the the Cocos plate has been formed at the East Pacific Rise, while the southern part is formed at the Cocos-Nazca spreading center, which is in turn influenced by the Galapagos Hotspot, originating prominent submarine structures such as the Cocos Ridge. In contrast, the terrane forming the overriding plate in the Pacific convergent margin, which is mainly made by the Caribbean Igneous Province rocks, is relatively homogeneous. Thus, this region is an excellent natural example to study the effect of changes in the incoming plate on the tectonics and deformation of the overriding plate. The Nicaragua lake in the north is a result of upper plate extension related to rollback of the subducting slab, whereas in the south, the Talamanca Cordillera indicates compression of the Caribbean crust probably related with the subduction of the Cocos Ridge.\nWe present numerical models that help to understand the long-term effects of variable subducting oceanic crust age and thickness on upper plate deformation and magmatism. Furthermore, we investigate the seismic behavior of these different convergent systems. The applied numerical model consists of a 2D seismo-thermo-mechanical finite difference scheme with visco-elasto-plastic rheology and a stick-slip frictional formulation to simulate spontaneous nucleation, propagation and arrest of earthquake-like ruptures on physically consistent faults.",

            "abstract": "Accurate and reliable streamflow prediction is essential to mitigate social and economic damage coming from water-related disasters such as flood and drought. Sequential data assimilation (DA) may facilitate improved streamflow prediction using real-time observations to correct internal model states. In conventional DA methods such as state updating, parametric uncertainty is often ignored mainly due to practical limitations of methodology to specify modeling uncertainty with limited ensemble members. However, if parametric uncertainty related with routing and runoff components is not incorporated properly, predictive uncertainty by model ensemble may be insufficient to capture dynamics of observations, which may deteriorate predictability. Recently, a multi-scale parameter regionalization (MPR) method was proposed to make hydrologic predictions at different scales using a same set of model parameters without losing much of the model performance. The MPR method incorporated within the mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM,\nhttp://www.ufz.de/mhm\n) could effectively represent and control uncertainty of high-dimensional parameters in a distributed model using global parameters. In this study, we evaluate impacts of streamflow data assimilation over European river basins. Especially, a multi-parametric ensemble approach is tested to consider the effects of parametric uncertainty in DA. Because augmentation of parameters is not required within an assimilation window, the approach could be more stable with limited ensemble members and have potential for operational uses. To consider the response times and non-Gaussian characteristics of internal hydrologic processes, lagged particle filtering is utilized. The presentation will be focused on gains and limitations of streamflow data assimilation and multi-parametric ensemble method over large-scale basins.",

            "abstract": "The NASA mission GRAIL inherits its concept from the GRACE mission to determine the gravity field of the Moon. The use of inter-satellite Ka-band range-rate (KBRR) observations enables data acquisition even when the spacecraft are not tracked from the Earth. The data allows for a highly accurate estimation of the lunar gravity field on both sides of the Moon, which is leading to huge improvements in our understanding of its internal structure and thermal evolution. In this presentation we discuss the latest GRAIL-based lunar gravity fields generated with the Celestial Mechanics Approach using the Bernese GNSS Software.\nWe present our recent solutions up to d/o 200, where KBRR observations and position data (GNI1B products) were used to solve for the lunar gravity field parameters in a generalized orbit determination problem. We detail our parametrization in terms of pseudo-stochastic pulses and empirical accelerations, which allows for high quality results even while using a simple model of non-gravitational forces and pre-GRAIL a priori fields. Moreover, we present our latest advances towards the computation of a lunar gravity field with improved spatial resolution.\nAs a further extension of our processing, the GNI1B positions are replaced by the original Doppler observations of the Deep Space Network (DSN) to allow for a completely independent determination of the lunar gravity field. Based on Doppler data, we perform orbit determination by solving six initial orbital elements, dynamical parameters, and stochastic parameters in daily arcs using least squares-adjustment. The pseudo-stochastic parameters are estimated to absorb deficiencies in our dynamical modeling (e.g. due to non-gravitational forces). DSN Doppler and KBRR data are then used together with an appropriate weighting for a combined orbit determination process. We present our latest results in the orbit determination of GRAIL over the primary mission phase (PM, March-May 2012) and eventually present our first lunar gravity fields based on Doppler and KBRR observations.\nWe compare all of our results from the PM with the most recent lunar gravity field models released by other groups, as well as their consistency with topography induced gravity.",

            "abstract": "Thin cirrus clouds at high latitudes are often composed of small ice particles not larger than 100 µm. Cirrus clouds reflect incoming solar radiation, creating a cooling effect. At the same time these clouds absorb the infrared radiation from Earth, creating a greenhouse effect. The net effect, crucial for radiative transfer, depends on the cirrus microphysical properties, such as particle size distributions (PSD) and particle shapes. Knowledge of these cloud properties is also needed for calibrating/validating passive and active remote sensors.\nWe report on a series of balloon-borne in-situ measurements that is carried out at a high-latitude location, Kiruna in northern Sweden (68N 21E). The measurements target upper tropospheric, cold cirrus clouds. The measurements are ongoing, and the method and first results are presented here. Ice particles in these clouds are predominantly very small, with a median size of measured particles of around 50 µm. Ice particles at these sizes are inherently difficult to measure with aircraft-mounted probes due to issues with resolution, sizing, and size-dependent sampling volume. These probes also suffer from problems with shattering of larger ice particles at the typically high aircraft speeds. The method used here avoids these issues. Furthermore, with a balloon-borne instrument data are collected as vertical profiles, more useful for calibrating or evaluating remote sensing measurements than data collected along horizontal traverses. Particles are collected on an oil-coated film at a sampling speed given directly by the ascending rate of the balloon, 4 m s-1. The collecting film is advanced uniformly inside the instrument so that an always un-used section of the film is exposed to ice particles, which are measured by imaging shortly after sampling. The high optical resolution of about 4 µm together with a pixel resolution of 1.65 µm allows particle detection at sizes of 10 µm and larger. For particles that are 20 µm (12 pixel) in size or larger the shape can be recognised. The sampling volume is well defined independent of particle size.\nPreliminary results of this balloon campaign are presented here. PSDs are studied, as well as particle areas, extinction coefficients, and area ratios. Mass, ice water content, and effective diameters determined from the data are also presented.",

Analysis of the changes in pan evaporation helps to understand the variation of vapor in the hydrological cycle and the impact of climate change. This study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal trends in pan evaporation and analyze the causes of its variation in Qiantang River Basin, East China. A self-organizing map neural network is first applied to classify the 40 hydrological stations. Based on the clustering results, a trend-free pre-whitening Mann-Kendall test is used to investigate the historical trends based on more than 50 years of observations. Finally, global sensitivity analysis is conducted for evaluating the relationship between evaporation and five climate variables and for investigating the causes of changes. It is found that the hydrological stations can be classified into six sub-areas and the evaporation trends vary substantially at different sub-areas. Generally, there is a decreasing trend in a majority of months and the most significant decreases occur in summer. The results of sensitivity analysis reveal that pan evaporation is more sensitive to solar radiation, followed by minimum air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and maximum air temperature. The contribution of interaction effects between different climate variables to the variation of pan evaporation cannot be ignored in some specific stations. Overall, the change is mainly due to the decrease of solar radiation. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the causes of pan evaporation variation and valuable information for sustainable water and crop management in this region.",

This system utilises the capabilities of contemporary inertial micro-sensors (strap-down accelerometers and gyroscopes) to record fluvial transport from the moving body-frame of artificial pebbles modelled precisely to represent the motion of real, coarse sediment grains (D90=100 mm class). This type of measurements can be useful in the context of sediment transport only if the existing mathematical understanding of the process is updated. We test a new mathematical model which defines specifically how the data recorded in the body frame of the sensor (Lagrangian frame of reference) can be generalised to the reference frame of the flow (channel, Eulerian frame of reference). Given the association of the two most widely used models for sediment transport with those frames of reference (Shields’ to Eulerian frame and HA. Einstein’s to Lagrangian frame), this description builds the basis for the definition of explicit incipient motion criteria (Maniatis et al. 2015) and for the upscaling from point-grain scale measurements to averaged, cross-sectional, stream related metrics. Flume experiments where conducted in the Hydraulics laboratory of the University of Glasgow where a spherical sensor of 800 mm diameter and capable of recoding inertial dynamics at 80Hz frequency was tested under fluvial transport conditions. We managed to measure the dynamical response of the unit during pre-entrainment/entrainment transitions, on scaled and non-scaled to the sensor’s diameter bed and for a range of hydrodynamic conditions (slope up to 0.02 and flow increase rate up to 0.05m3.s-1.

            "abstract": "An intense swarm of seismicity on 16 August 2014 marked the intrusion of a large dike from the subglacial Bárðarbunga volcano, central Iceland. Melt propagated laterally from the central volcano at the brittle-ductile boundary at ~6 km b.s.l. and created over 30,000 earthquakes along a 46 km path heading NE from Bárðarbunga. On 31 August a fissure eruption began at Holuhraun and the seismicity rate within the dike dropped instantaneously to a much lower level suggesting that once a pathway to the surface had formed, magma was able to flow freely and largely aseismically. Melt was fed from the subsiding Bárðarbunga volcano to Holuhraun for 6 months, until the eruption ceased on 27 February 2015. We discuss the relationship between bursts of seismicity in the feeder volcano and periods of rapid dike propagation.\nWe use a dense seismic network and relative earthquake relocations to map in detail the segmentation of the dike on all scales. New dike segments were initiated with a rapid advance of the dike tip at typically 1 km/h, separated by pauses of up to 78 h. During the stalled periods the magma pressure built until it was sufficient to fracture a new segment, which then propagated rapidly forward. Large segments became seismically quiet once a new segment had intruded beyond it as extensional stresses had been relieved and melt was able to flow freely. Each rapid propagation phase was accompanied by a drop in the seismicity rate directly behind the dike tip, most likely due to a stress shadow being formed behind the dike tip. Moment tensor solutions show that the dominant failure mechanism is left-lateral strike slip faulting at the leading edge, orientated parallel to the dike, with a combination of right-lateral, left-lateral and normal faulting behind the dike tip, contradicting many widely used models. Much of the seismicity behind the tip may represent fracture of frozen melt as the dike inflated and propagated forward",

These methods exploit recent developments in high-performance computing and suitable numerical methods for seismic wave propagation, while operating efficiently across the vast observable frequency spectrum of global waves in sparse yet realistic structures. AxiSEM (www.axisem.info and geodynamics.org) relies upon axisymmetric (including spherically symmetric) models, thereby satisfying a large fraction of observable data. The benefit of this method lies in the resultant dimensional collapse to two numerical dimensions, whereby the third azimuthal dimension is tackled analytically. For high-frequency wave propagation, this leads to 3-4 orders of magnitude speedup in computational cost compared to 3D domain discretizations. AxiSEM is highly scalable and accommodates efficient implementations of viscoelasticity and anisotropy. We will present benchmarks, data comparisons, a diverse range of applications from inner-core anisotropy to noise modeling and lowermost mantle structures, and wavefields for sensitivity kernels. We also touch upon ongoing efforts for linking computational cost to structural complexity in the vein of Occam's razor, eventually allowing for an adaptive rendition of 1D, 2D and 3D structures at optimally low computational cost, as well as 1D/3D hybrid approaches.\nInstaseis (www.instaseis.net) is a methodology to extract full, broadband and accurate waveforms instantaneously from wavefield databases computed with AxiSEM. This \"once-and-for-all solution\" relies on reciprocity and requires only two AxiSEM simulations to construct the databases, while allowing for arbitrary parameter changes (e.g. source, processing, structure) instantaneously with modest computational cost and storage requirements. The instaseis python package is integrated with ObsPy, contains a graphical user interface, and can be used for source inversion, noise simulations, finite-fault modeling, waveform tomography, uncertainty estimations, as well as teaching.\nBoth methods are published open-access and freely available via the above website links.",

The launch of additional instruments, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in the past 15 years greatly improves the detail and resolution of remotely sensed data available to observe vegetation and physical climate. Using a monte carlo technique we map outlier years across the globe and find the areas of greatest change in the statistical relationship across the Midwest, Europe, central South America and the Sahel.\nWith 30 years of research quality data on the surface greenness we show that the regressions over the last 15 years between NDVI and temperature are significantly different than the 30-year regression. By looking at the statistical relationships between the biosphere and longer-term temperature measurements we can better understand how representative shorter datasets will be of long-term processes and how much the coupling in the combined climate-biosphere system is changing.",

            "abstract": "A good assessment of pulses of microbial nitrogen (N) supply is of paramount importance in helping understand the soil N cycle and catchment N exports in Mediterranean regions. Yet, the real contribution of N mineralization and nitrification pulses to soil N availability and catchment N exports remains unclear because most of the experiments have been performed on single forest ecosystem, while focusing on just few rainfall events. Over a year, we performed biweekly soil incubations to investigate patterns and controls of pulses of net N mineralization (NNM) and nitrification (NN) in three forests (riparian, evergreen oak and beech) coexisting within a Mediterranean headwater catchment. Further, we examined the influence of these pulses on soil N budgets and stream N loads. Within the catchment, riparian soils were hotspots of NNM and NN as they accounted for 30% of measured soil N supply, with median rates being multiple-fold higher than at the oak and beech forests. Pulses of NNM and NN generally occurred in spring immediately after large rainfall events (>20 mm). Moreover, high summer soil temperatures (>16ºC) promoted pulses of microbial activity at the riparian site. Although microbial pulses were restricted in time at all sites, they could contribute between 26-42% of the annual rates of NNM and NN. However, only NN pulses in the riparian site lead to disproportional increases in soil N availability and stream N loads, suggesting that these Mediterranean riparian soils could be a critical source of nitrate to the stream. Our study stresses that intensive monitoring is essential to capture hot moments of soil N processes, and thus to understand the relevance of microbial pulses on soil N biogeochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Built upon generalized reflection/transmission coefficients, a family of secular functions constructed based on the continuity conditions across various interfaces, have been proposed in our previous study to give a thorough search of normal modes for stratified layered model. For the ocean-Earth model, i.e., one with a stack of surficical fluid layers, we find that the secular function constructed according to the continuity condition across the fluid/solid interface, which is devised specially for finding Stoneley modes especially at high frequencies, should be employed as well to find a few “stubborn” modes that may otherwise probably be lost with the searching step fixed. It turns out that these “stubborn\" modes belong to the so-called trapped modes whose energy are mainly focused in the layers other than in the low-velocity layers. Were our searching scheme not employed, the searching step would become much finer and it would thus cost more time, and no loss of these “stubborn” modes would not even be guaranteed, if the traction-free condition alone was used to find the physically existent modes at given frequency. This demonstrates again the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed mode-searching approach when the model contains low-velocity layers or fluid layers.",

This new scheme solves the elastodynamic equations in the \"quasi-Cartesian\" coordinate system similar to a local Cartesian one, instead of the spherical coordinate system, with a staggered-grid finite-difference method in time domain (FDTD) which is one of the most popular numerical methods in seismic motion simulations for local to regional scale models. The proposed scheme may be useful for modeling seismic wave propagation in a very large region of sub-global scale beyond regional and less than global ones, where the effects of roundness of earth cannot be ignored.\nIn \"quasi-Cartesian\" coordinates, x, y, and z are set to be locally in directions of latitude, longitude and depth, respectively. The stencil for each of the x-derivatives then depends on the depth coordinate at the evaluation point, while the stencil for each of the y-derivatives varies with both coordinates of the depth and latitude. In order to reduce lateral variations of the horizontal finite-difference stencils over the computational domain, we move the target area to a location around the equator of the computational spherical coordinate system using a way similar to the conversion from equatorial coordinates to ecliptic coordinates. The developed scheme can be easily implemented in 3-D Cartesian FDTD codes for local to regional scale modeling by changing a very small part of the codes. Our scheme may be able to open a window for multi-scale modeling of seismic wave propagation in scales from sub-global to local one.",

            "abstract": "The Central East African Rift (CEAR) bifurcates in two branches (eastern, magma-rich and western, magma-poor) surrounding strong Tanzanian craton. Intensive magmatism and continental flood basalts are largely present in many of the eastern rift segments, but other segments, first of all the western branch, exhibit very small volcanic activity. The Eastern rift is characterized by southward progression of the onset of volcanism, the extensional features and topographic expression of the rift vary significantly north-southward: in northern Kenya the deformation is very wide (some 150-250 km in E-W direction), to the south the rift narrows to 60-70 km, yet further to the south the deformation widens again in the so-called Tanzania divergence zone. Widening of the Eastern branch within its southern part is associated with the impingement of the southward-propagating rift on the strong Masai block situated to east of the Tanzanian craton.\nTo understand the mechanisms behind this complex deformation distribution, we implemented a 3Dl ultra-high resolution visco-plastic thermo-mechanical numerical model accounting for thermo-rheological structure of the lithosphere and hence captures essential features of the CEAR.\nThe preferred model has a plume seeded slightly to the northeast of the craton center, consistent with seismic tomography, and produces surface strain distribution that is in good agreement with observed variation of deformation zone width along eastern side of Tanzanian craton: localized above bulk of mantle material deflected by cratonic keel narrow high strain zone (Kenia Rift) is replaced by wide distributed deformations within areas situated to north (northern Kenya, Turkana Rift) and to south (Tanzania divergence, Masai block) of it.\nThese results demonstrate significant differences in the impact of the rheological profile on rifting style in case of dominant active rifting compared to dominant passive rifting. Narrow rifting, conventionally attributed to cold strong lithosphere in passive rifting mode, may develop in weak hot ultra-stretched lithosphere during active rifting, after plume impingement on a tectonically pre-stressed lithosphere. In that case, initially ultra-wide small-amplitude rift patterns focus, in few Myr, into large-scale faults that form a narrow rift.",

            "abstract": "Stemflow (SF) is recognized as an important process delivering water, solute, and particulate fluxes to spatially localized areas of the forest floor. Using both long-term SF data from nine even-aged deciduous teak trees grown in the same plantation and meteorological data from a nearby tower, this study seeks to better understand how: (1) specific biotic and abiotic factors control stand-scale SF production of teak; and (2) various biotic and abiotic factors affect tree-to-tree variations in teak SF production. A conventional regression analysis of SF volume against rainfall indicates that, for five individuals among the nine, SF was more efficiently produced in the leafless than in the leafed. However, for the other individuals, there was no such a relation, suggesting tree-to-tree variation in the response of SF to canopy status. A boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis setting daily basis SF funneling ratios (SFF) of the nine trees as dependent variables, indicates that SFF was intricately controlled by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors. The top six influential factors were, in descending order, rainfall duration, tree height, rainfall intensity, air temperature, wind speed, and antecedent dry period length having positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, and negative influence on SFF, respectively. Although teak exhibits drastic intra-annual changes in leaf phenology, leaf area index (LAI) had an unexpectedly small influence on SFF on a stand scale. Additional BRT analyses focusing on individuals with the maximum and the minimum SFF values (among the nine individuals) showed that there was considerable tree-to-tree variation in an array of the influential variables for SFF, even though they were planted in the same year and grown in the same plot. In addition to this difference, the BRT analyses also showed that response of SFF to LAI differs between the two individuals. The differentiating responses to LAI depending on individuals may be the reason for the apparent small influence of LAI on stand-scale SFF. This research clarifies some of the factors that control SF production for valuable teak trees at both individual tree and stand scales.",

            "abstract": "Alpine regions are likely to be areas at risk regarding to landslide-induced tsunamis, because of the proximity between lakes and potential instabilities and due to the concentration of the population in valleys and on the lakes shores. In particular, dam lakes are often surrounded by steep slopes and frequently affect the stability of the banks. In order to assess comprehensively this phenomenon together with the induced risks, we have developed a 2.5D numerical model which aims to simulate the propagation of the landslide, the generation and the propagation of the wave and eventually the spread on the shores or the associated downstream flow.\nTo perform this task, the process is done in three steps. Firstly, the geometry of the sliding mass is constructed using the Sloping Local Base Level (SLBL) concept. Secondly, the propagation of this volume is performed using a model based on viscous flow equations. Finally, the wave generation and its propagation are simulated using the shallow water equations stabilized by the Lax-Friedrichs scheme. The transition between wet and dry bed is performed by the combination of the two latter sets of equations.\nThe proper behavior of our model is demonstrated by; (1) numerical tests from Toro (2001), and (2) by comparison with a real event where the horizontal run-up distance is known (Nicolet landslide, Quebec, Canada). The model is of particular interest due to its ability to perform quickly the 2.5D geometric model of the landslide, the tsunami simulation and, consequently, the hazard assessment.",

In this paper, we introduce and outline a new constructional concept for an ocean bottom pressure meter that aims for unequivocal detection and monitoring of long-term trends. The concept is based on a differential pressure sensor that measures the pressure difference between the environment and a reference pressure within a sealed volume. This sealed volume conserves the instantaneous pressure at the moment of its closure at the monitoring location in a temperature-compensated manner. Furthermore, the approach enables easy in situ calibration of the differential pressure gauge by simply opening the reference pressure chamber to the environment and checking the zero point offset.",

Multi-nose structures have been observed if 2 or more noses appear at the same time (Vallat et al., 2007). Gaps between \"noses\" (or \"bands\") have been explained in terms of the competing corotation, convection and magnetic gradient drifts. Charge exchange losses in slow drift paths for steady state scenarios and the role of substorm injections have also been considered (Li et al., 2000; Ebihara et al., 2004).

Off-fault displacement should be evaluated in important facilities, such as Nuclear Installations. Probabilistic Fault Displacement Hazard Analysis (PFDHA) is developing on the basis of PSHA. PFDHA estimates on-fault and off-fault displacement. For estimation, PFDHA uses distance-displacement functions, which are constructed from field measurement data. However, observed displacement data are still sparse, especially off-fault displacement. In Nuclear Installations, estimation of off-fault displacement is more important than that of on-fault.\nWe carried out numerical fault displacement simulations to assist in understanding distance-displacement relations of on-fault and off-fault according to fault types, normal, reverse and strike fault. We used Okada's dislocation method. The displacements were calculated based on the single fault model with several rakes of slip. On-fault displacements (along the fault profile) of each fault types show a similar trend. Off-fault displacements (cross profile to the fault) of vertical (reverse and normal) fault types show the rapid decreasing displacement on the foot wall side. In the presentation, we will show the displacement profile and also stress, strain and so on.\nThe dislocation model can not express discontinuous displacements. In the future, we will apply various numerical simulations (Finite Element Method, Distinct Element Method) in order to evaluate off-fault displacements. We will also compare numerical simulation results with observed data.",

            "abstract": "Since the Pliocene, global climate history is distinguished by the transition into a colder world, dominated by the onset and intensification of major Northern Hemisphere glaciations which have changed in their duration and intensity. It has been argued that cooling in the surface ocean has been driven by or been conducive to continental ice-sheet growth or influenced by progressive sub-glacial erosion and feedbacks to explain changing ice-sheet extent and dynamics, which may occur independently of climate change and/or the potential regional climate impacts of tectonic uplift. At present, isolating climate as the driver of evolving continental ice volume since the Pliocene is hindered by the limited long term data sets which directly link climate changes to evidence for ice-sheet advance/retreat, erosion, and tectonic evolution over million year timescales.\nIODP Expedition 341 (May-July 2013) drilled a cross-margin transect from ice-proximal sites on the continental shelf to distal sites in the deep Pacific. This study focuses on the most distal drilled site, (Site U1417, c. 4190 m water depth) which extends through the Pleistocene, Pliocene and Miocene and was targeted due to its rich recorded history of climate change, glaciation and tectonics and which will allow for a more detailed understanding of the interaction between north-east Pacific paleoceanography and the history of the north-west Cordilleran ice sheet, neither of which are fully understood given limited data which pre-dates the Last Glacial Maximum. The focus of this research is to target the evidence for past climate change as recorded in evidence for evolving sea surface conditions including sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and ice rafted debris (IRD) through the Pliocene and Pleistocene.\nWe have reconstructed SSTs during the mid-Pliocene and Plio-Pleistocene Transition (PPT) using the alkenone biomarker proxy, the UK37’ index, the relative abundance of C37:4 alkenone and IRD counts and compare our results with evidence for evolving ice-sheet history as determined through the shipboard-generated lithostratigraphy. We consider the interaction between SSTs and IRD proxies and evaluate the influence of climate versus tectonic forcing: Is there a Pliocene-Pleistocene cooling? What is the SST variability? What is the SST-IRD relationship?",

The result shows that the LPS was formed in the southwest of Qinghai Province in April. It moved southwest to Xizang Autonomous Region in May and then shifted to westward. After reached to most west point, the LPS turned back with attenuation and dissipated in October. The intensity of LPS was stronger in high PMI year than that in weak PMI year. The track of LPS located farther north and present less zonal fluctuation in high PMI year. The B-H was well correlated with PMI especially in dry seasons. And there is a time lag of 2 to 3 months. It means that the Plateau summer monsoon onset early and with high intensity at the beginning of the onset period when the thermal effects were strong in February.",

Whittaker classified biome types mainly as a function of Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) and Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP), resulting in the well-known Whittaker plot1. This relationship is still being used to map biomes globally2. The same inputs (MAT and MAP), augmented with a radiation proxy, are used in the resource-balance perspective for modeling large-scale vegetation productivity as a function of abiotic factors3. These two approaches, used in a temporally dynamic manner, provided us indicators of shifts in growth-limiting factors4 and associated environmental ranges of vegetation, which, in turn, are key indicators for the study of global change and biodiversity5.\nWe present a study in which we used the Whittaker relationship and CRU TS 3.22 climatic data to map regions that showed variable biome potential. These regions are likely to indicate ecotones – i.e. interactions zones between biomes – that have been subject to abiotic change and where a change in the vegetation system can be anticipated. At the same time, we used remotely sensed data (GIMMS v3g 1982-2012) to study gradients in vegetation dynamics in these zones. Preliminary results show strongest environmental shifts in northern ecotones, e.g. on the tundra – boreal boundary, and associated changes in climatic growth-limiting factors4.\n[1] Whittaker RH (1975) Communities and Ecosystems, Macmillan, 385p.\n[2] Ricklefs RE (2008) The Economy of Nature, W.

            "abstract": "Orogenic areas are subject to uplift and horizontal deformation as observed by present-day global positioning system and repeated leveling measurements. Crustal mass is conservative and less dense than the mantle, thus the horizontal shortening must be accompanied by crustal thickening and horizontal extrusion. According to the level of isostatic compensation, the thickening is partitioned into topographic uplift and Moho deepening. We investigate the mass change induced gravity signal and discuss whether this signal could be detected using terrestrial or satellite gravity observations. An example is the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, for which we model crustal thickening and calculate the expected gravity signal. The predictions are compared with present-day gravity changes observed by GRACE and with published in situ absolute gravity rates. It is found that the crustal thickening signal cannot be neglected and that it contributes significantly to the observed signal. Those studies with focus on the glacier and hydrologic mass fluxes should be aware that, if neglected, the crustal signal could introduce a significant bias. The GRACE observations give a positive gravity rate over central Tibetan Plateau, unexplained by the hydrologic or cryospheric signals, and a negative rate over the Himalayas and at its foothill, which is attributable to a prolonged hydrologic drought and/or depletion of groundwater. Our model shows that the positive gravity rate could be explained by elevation uplift, and a stable or upwelling Moho. The negative gravity change signal is due primarily to the strong elevation-gradient at the foothill of the Himalayas, and to an uplift accompanied by crustal thickening and Moho lowering. Finally, we place constraints and requirements on future gravity missions, for the feasibility to more accurately observe this signal, and to separate it from the background hydrologic and cryospheric processes.",

            "abstract": "Depth of event is an important criterion of seismic event screening at the International Data Center, CTBTO. However, a thorough determination of the event depth can be conducted mostly through special analysis because the IDC’s Event Definition Criteria is based, in particular, on depth estimation uncertainties. This causes a large number of events in the Reviewed Event Bulletin to have depth constrained to the surface. When the true origin depth is greater than that reasonable for a nuclear test (3 km based on existing observations), this may result in a heavier workload to manually distinguish between shallow and deep events. Also, IDC depth criterion is not applicable to the events with the small t(pP–P) travel time difference, which is the case of the nuclear test. Since the shape of the first few seconds of signal of very shallow events is very sensitive to the presence of the depth phase, cross correlation between observed and theoretic seismogram can provide an estimate for the depth of the event, and so provide an expansion to the screening process. We exercised this approach mostly with events at teleseismic and partially regional distances. We found that such approach can be very efficient for the seismic event screening process, with certain caveats related mostly to the poorly defined crustal models at source and receiver which can shift the depth estimate. We used adjustable t* teleseismic attenuation model for synthetics since this characteristic is not determined for most of the rays we studied. We studied a wide set of historical records of nuclear explosions, including so called Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNE) with presumably known depths, and recent DPRK nuclear tests. The teleseismic synthetic approach is based on the stationary phase approximation with Robert Herrmann’s hudson96 program, and the regional modelling was done with the generalized ray technique by Vlastislav Cerveny modified to the complex source topography.",

The cusp is a funnel-shaped region where shocked solar wind plasma is able to enter the magnetosphere via the process of magnetic reconnection. The analysis is presented in three sections:\nFirstly, a high-latitude spacecraft trajectory is shown to cross the northern cusp where magnetosheath plasma is observed in-situ. The ion observations are shown to be a result of `bursty' reconnection occurring at the dayside magnetopause. A different interval is also presented where the southern cusp is observed to oscillate with a period the same as Saturn’s rotational period.\nSecondly, the locations of all the cusp crossings are shown. The field-aligned distances (calculated from observed ion energy-pitch angle dispersions) from the reconnection site are presented. The cusp events are also compared to solar wind propagation models to investigate any correlations.\nFinally, the magnetic field observations of the cusps are analysed focusing on the diamagnetic depressions. The data are subtracted from a magnetic field model, and the calculated magnetic pressure deficits are compared to the particle pressures. A high plasma pressure layer in the magnetosphere adjacent to the cusp is discovered to also depress the magnetic field.",

            "abstract": "Each summer, vast quantities of surface-derived ice sheet meltwater runs off from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Much of this runoff is injected into glaciated fjords at depth beneath marine-terminating glaciers. Due to its low relative density, the runoff rises as a buoyant plume up the glaciers’ calving fronts, entraining deep fjord water as it does so. This deep, ambient water tends to be relatively rich in nutrients and so the runoff plumes act to fertilise the surface layers of the fjord, leading to an observed late season spike in biological productivity in the fjord’s surface layers. Although surface melting and runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet are predicted to increase significantly in the coming years and decades, the potential effect of this on fjord and coastal biological productivity is yet to be quantified.\nHere we present simulations of fjord circulation and biological productivity using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm), and a new coupled representation of buoyant runoff plumes which enables decadal time period experiments of large three dimensional fjords. We investigate the effect on biological productivity of varying ice sheet runoff, ocean properties, near-surface winds and fjord geometry and bathymetry. We find that variations in ice sheet runoff are particularly important for biological productivity because the rate of discharge controls the depth at which the plumes reach neutral buoyancy and therefore whether the nutrient-rich deep water is delivered to the photic zone.",

            "abstract": "Water plays an important role in underpinning equitable, stable and productive societies, and the ecosystems on which we depend. Many international river basins are likely to experience ‘low water security’ over the coming decades. Hence, ensuring water security along with energy and food securities has been recognised as priority goals in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations. This water security is not rooted only in the limitation of physical resources, i.e. the shortage in the availability of freshwater relative to water demand, but also on social and economic factors (e.g. flawed water planning and management approaches, institutional incapability to provide water services, unsustainable economic policies). Until recently, advanced tools and methods are available for assessment of global water scarcity. However, integrating both physical and socio-economic indicators assessment of water security at global level is not available yet. In this study, we present the first global understanding of water security using a spatial multi-criteria analysis framework that goes beyond available water scarcity assessment. For assessing water security at global scale, the term ‘security’ is conceptualized as a function of ‘availability’, ‘accessibility to services’, ‘safety and quality’, and ‘management’. The Water security index is calculated by aggregating the indicators using both simple additive weighting (SAW) and ordered weighted average (OWA).",

The damage due to extreme events has increased during the recent decades and it may increase even further under the projected future climate. Real time monitoring of hydrologic extremes is essential to minimize losses to society and infrastructure. However, in many areas, where gauge based observations are not available in timely manner, real-time monitoring of droughts and floods has been challenging. In the absence of in-situ gauge based observations, satellite data from the various platform may provide an useful information for the real-time monitoring. Using the precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) a real-time monitor that updates on daily basis was developed for India. The hydrologic variables (soil moisture, runoff, and Evapotranspiration) were simulated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The real-time monitor was successfully evaluated for the drought and flood monitoring in India. The monitor provides soil moisture and total runoff conditions at a high resolution. Moreover, the monitor can provide a valuable information on daily streamflow monitoring at the selected gauge stations in India.",

            "abstract": "Luminescence dating has the potential to quantify the recent exhumation history of mountain ranges as a low-temperature thermochronometer. During rock exhumation, electrons get trapped through exposure to ionizing radiation whilst elevated temperatures cause thermally stimulated detrapping. The resulting luminescence signals measured in the laboratory can be used to constrain rock thermal histories through modelling of the kinetic parameters of electron trapping and detrapping. Here, we investigate and model laboratory kinetic processes of the luminescence of K-feldspar and assess their extrapolation over geological timescales. Samples were taken from the actively eroding Mont Blanc massif in the European Alps, along a 12 km long tunnel with ambient temperatures of 10-35 °C. In this setting rapid exhumation rates have been found during the last 2 million years (up to ~2 km/Myr), however, we intend to increase the temporal resolution to sub-Quaternary timescales using luminescence thermochronometry. Infra-red stimulated luminescence signals at 50 °C (IR50) and at 225 °C (post-IR IRSL225) of K-feldspar extracted from Mont Blanc tunnel samples were measured and our first results reveal a thermal signature from which rock cooling rates can be derived. Isothermal decay experiments show non-exponential decay, but interestingly, experiments with a range of regenerative doses reveal first-order kinetics. The observed thermal decay pattern is well-described by a model based on a physically plausible distribution of the density of states. Ultimately, we intend to use the IR50 and post-IR IRSL225 signals of K-feldspar as dual thermochronometers to determine the late-Quaternary cooling history of the Mont Blanc massif. Moreover, the luminescence signals may give insights into local thermal field evolution, before the influence of postglacial hydrothermal flow.",

            "abstract": "The carbon dioxide (CO2) retrieval algorithm based on optimal estimation method was developed and its performance was analyzed. In sensitivity analysis using simulated radiance spectra at difference surface and atmospheric conditions, the aerosol-related parameters such as total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and aerosol optical properties are the most important factor in CO2 retrieval, resulting in errors up to 6.5 ppm by inaccurate aerosol optical information. These errors are caused by the simplified aerosol assumptions in the forward model, which only represent a subset of three potential aerosol optical properties, and can be also increased in CO2 retrieval using real-spectra. As aerosols in the atmosphere are highly variable in their amount, vertical distribution and optical properties, their effect can be under-constrained (Frankenberg et al., 2012).\nIn this study, to reduce the errors caused by the simplified aerosol assumptions, modification of aerosol-related parameters in the forward model have been applied in CO2 retrieval algorithms, presenting by 12 parameters consisting of the vertical profile in terms of central height and width, aerosol size distribution and refractive index parameters as their optical parameters. The CO2 retrievals with two different approaches in handling aerosol information have been analyzed using the Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) spectra over East-Asia and evaluated through the comparison with collocated ground-based observations at several Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) sites. These results can improve the accuracy of CO2 retrieval algorithm taking into account aerosol information and provide useful information to reduce uncertainty and increase data availability.",

            "abstract": "At high latitudes the thermospheric dynamics are gov­erned by various heat and momentum sources. Recently several modeling studies have been attempt­ed to understand the physical process that control the high-latitude lower thermospheric dynamics. Kwak and Richmond [2007] and Kwak et al. [2007] studied the momentum forcing bal­ance that are mainly responsible for maintaining the high-latitude lower thermospheric wind system by using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermo­sphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (NCAR TIE-GCM). Kwak and Richmond [2014] analyzed the divergence and vorticity of the high-latitude neutral wind field in the lower thermosphere during the south­ern summertime. In this study, we extend previous works by Kwak and Rich­mond [2007, 2014] and Kwak et al. [2007], which helped to better understand the physical processes maintaining thermospheric dynamics at high latitudes, and here perform a “term analysis of the potential vorticity equation” for the high-latitude neu­tral wind field in the lower thermosphere, on the basis of numerical simulations using the NCAR TIE-GCM. These analyses can provide insight into the relative strength of the heating and the momentum forcing responsible for driving rotational winds at the high-latitude lower thermosphere. The heating is the net heat including the heat transfer by downward molecular and eddy heat conduction, the absorption of solar ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) ra­diation, auroral heating by particles, Joule dissipation of ionospheric currents, release of chemical energy by the atomic oxygen recombination, and radiative CO2, NO and O infrared emissions. The momentum forcing is associated with the viscous force and the frictional drag force from convecting ions.",

The goal of the SOL-TERRA project is to produce a Roadmap for a future coupled Sun-to-Earth operational space weather forecasting system covering domains from the Sun down to the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere and neutral atmosphere.\nThe first stage of SOL-TERRA is underway and involves reviewing current models that could potentially contribute to such a system. Within a given domain, the various space weather models will be assessed how they could contribute to such a coupled system. This will be done both by reviewing peer reviewed papers, and via direct input from the model developers to provide further insight.\nOnce the models have been reviewed then the optimal set of models for use in support of forecast-based SWE modelling will be selected, and a Roadmap for the implementation of an operational forecast-based SWE modelling framework will be prepared. The Roadmap will address the current modelling capability, knowledge gaps and further work required, and also the implementation and maintenance of the overall architecture and environment that the models will operate within.\nThe SOL-TERRA project will engage with external stakeholders in order to ensure independently that the project remains on track to meet its original objectives. A group of key external stakeholders have been invited to provide their domain-specific expertise in reviewing the SOL-TERRA project at critical stages of Roadmap preparation; namely at the Mid-Term Review, and prior to submission of the Final Report. This stakeholder input will ensure that the SOL-TERRA Roadmap will be enhanced directly through the input of modellers and end-users.\nThe overall goal of the SOL-TERRA project is to develop a Roadmap for an operational forecast-based SWE modelling framework with can be implemented within a larger subsequent activity.\nThe SOL-TERRA project is supported within the UK Space Agency’s National Space Technology Programme under contract number RP10G0348A03.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection within current sheet has been regarded as one of the crucial dissipation and heating processes of coherent structures in the solar wind turbulence. Counter-streaming of ions is an important phenomenon in the reconnection exhaust region ranged from the ion diffusion region to the extended outflow region. It has been suggested by theoretical and numerical models that the ions are going to be picked up by the ejecting magnetic field and show larger T_perpendicular than T_parallel, if the guide field is strong enough (in other word, the shear angle is relatively low). The pick-up behavior seems to favor the heating of heavy ions with high mass-to-charge ratio, since the high M/Q ions have larger gyro-period/transit-time and tend to be non-adiabatic more easily. The above statements from theoretical models have not been thoroughly testified in the solar wind observations, though the changes in total temperature and 1D reduced velocity distribution function had been studied. Until now, it remains unclear about the difference of full 3D velocity distribution for the proton and helium ions between the upstream and the exhaust regions. Here, we will analyze the plasma measurement data from WIND/3DP to explore and compare the parallel and perpendicular heating effect of different species of ions. As a preliminary result, the proton is found to show bi-directional streams in its velocity distribution in some reconnection exhaust regions. The thermalization of the counter-streaming protons will be presented. The relation between proton T_parallel/T_perpendicular and guide field strength (or shear angle) will be studied. The velocity distributions of helium ions will be illustrated, which shows the difference of heating effect between different M/Q ratios.",

            "abstract": "The Yellow River is the primary source of freshwater to the northern China. Increasing population and socio-economic development have put great pressure on water resources of the river basin. The anticipated climate and socio-economic changes may further increase water stress. Development of adaptation strategies would have significant implications for water and food security of this region. In this study, the outputs of multiple hydrological models forced with the bias-corrected climatic variables from multiple global climate models were used to assess the change in renewable water resources of the river basin in the 21st century. The outputs of multiple crop models were used to assess the change in agricultural water demand. The domestic and industrial water demands were estimated based on the future socio-economic conditions under the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Besides basic ecosystem needs for water which must be met, the water use in domestic and industrial sectors is considered to have a higher priority than the agricultural water use when water is insufficient. The results show that the renewable water resources of the basin would increase as global mean temperature increases while the water demand would grow much more rapidly, largely due to water demand increase in domestic and industrial sectors. In most of the sub-basins of the Yellow River basin, the available water resources can not sustain all the water use sectors starting from the next a few decades. As more water resources would be appropriated by domestic and industrial sectors, a part of irrigated area had to be converted to rainfed agriculture which led to a large reduction in food production. This study highlights the linked water and food security in a changing environment and suggests that the trade-off should be considered when developing regional adaptation strategies.",

            "abstract": "Transient luminous events above thunderclouds result from the quasi-static heating of the lower ionosphere by intense cloud to ground lightning discharges (e.g., Pasko, 2010). More recently, it was suggested that gravity wave instabilities (Liu et al., 2015) can cause small scale ionospheric irregularities (Qin et al., 2014, Fullekrug et al., 2014) which can assist the initiation of transient luminous events such that the response of the lower ionosphere to the forcing by thunderstorms is of major interest (e.g., Shao et al., 2012).\nThe variability of the lower ionosphere is well studied on time scales ranging from decades (solar cycle) down to tens of ms (microbursts), but on the time scale of transient luminous events ~<1 ms, plasma fluctuations in the lower ionosphere are less well known. This study uses recordings of the low frequency radio sky with a small aperture array of radio receivers operating in the frequency range from ~20-250 kHz (Fullekrug et al., 2015) to infer the existence of microfluctuations in the lower ionosphere from a high resolution array analysis. It is found that the observed microfluctuations result from very fast processes acting on time scales < 1 ms which result in a correlated multipath propagation of low frequency radio waves and a characteristic dilution of precision of radio noise source locations in the sky.\nThe observed dilution of precision has several physical causes. The general shape of the radio source results from the array geometry of the radio receivers, the splitting of the radio sources results from a birefringent wave propagation and the correlated multipath propagation of low frequency radio waves results from microfluctuations in the lower ionosphere. The influence of the array geometry on the dilution of precision is reduced by taking into account the impulse response of the array. This procedure reveals the splitting of one single radio source into two distinct source locations which result from a birefringent wave propagation. The remaining dilution of precision from the correlated multipath propagation of low frequency radio waves strongly suggests the existence of very fast processes acting on time scales < 1 ms in the lower ionosphere which might have an impact on the initiation of transient luminuous events above thunderstorms.",

            "abstract": "Since the deployment and subsequent touchdown of its Philae Lander on the surface of comet C67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014, the Rosetta spacecraft has left bound orbits around the comet and passed a number of milestones contributing to further achieving the science return goals of the mission. It performed two very close flybys in February and March of this year, allowing for the collection of data and high-resolution images of the nucleus and its close environment at a time of increasing cometary activity. Such increase in activity actually led to orbiter operational issues as the star tracker navigation was seriously impacted by the presence of dust particles, and since then the spacecraft had to be moved further away from the nucleus so as to guarantee its safety. This has meant a complete redesign of the operational scheme for the mission, whose science planning implementation is now being uplinked to the spacecraft much closer to execution onboard, with the Flight Dynamics team defining trajectories as late and as close as possible to the comet. In addition to science data acquired from the northern hemisphere of the comet while it progresses toward perihelion, attempts are being made to communicate with the Lander since renewed signal with Philae was obtained in mid-June. The aim is to be able to achieve as much of the Long Term Science goals as possible during the remaining lifetime of the Lander, albeit within the orbiter safety constraints. With perihelion within reach, orbiter science of the southern hemisphere is taking on more importance, and the combination of such science with continued Lander contact attempts will mark Rosetta’s passage across the perihelion for C67P.",

            "abstract": "Enormous submarine landslides having volumes up to thousands of km3 and long run-out may cause tsunamis with widespread effects. Clay-rich landslides, such as Trænadjupet and Storegga offshore Norway commonly involve retrogressive mass and momentum release mechanisms that affect the tsunami generation. Therefore, such landslides may involve a large amount of smaller blocks. As a consequence, the failure mechanisms and release rate of the individual blocks are of importance for the tsunami generation. Previous attempts to model the tsunami generation due to retrogressive landslides are few, and limited to idealized conditions. Here, we review the basic effects of retrogression on tsunamigenesis in simple geometries. To this end, two different methods are employed for the landslide motion, a series block with pre-scribed time lags and kinematics, and a dynamic retrogressive model where the inter-block time lag is determined by the model. The effect of parameters such as time lag on wave-height, wave-length, and dispersion are discussed. Finally, we discuss how the retrogressive effects may have influenced the tsunamis due to large landslides such as the Storegga slide. The research leading to these results has received funding from the Research Council of Norway under grant number 231252 (Project TsunamiLand) and the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement 603839 (Project ASTARTE).",

            "abstract": "Debris avalanches and pyroclastic flows due to lava dome collapses represent one of the most catastrophic volcanic hazards and have been responsible for many of the largest volcanic disasters in history. Dome collapse events occur frequently and repeatedly on volcanoes hosting a voluminous hydrothermal system. Hydrothermal alteration of volcanic rocks is recognized as having a large negative impact on rock strength properties. However, the relationship between hydrothermal alteration and repeated dome collapses is not well understood. The objective of this study is to contribute to a better understanding, through the case study of Tutupaca volcano, of the relation existing between lava dome collapses and hydrothermal alteration. Tutupaca volcano is a dacitic dome complex located at the southern end of the Peruvian arc. It is composed of a big basal edifice and two smaller domes (the Western and Eastern Tutupaca), which are constructed on the remnants of the hydrothermally altered basal volcano. Tutupaca volcano experienced at least four sector collapses, the younger being the collapse of the Eastern dome NE flank approximately 200 years ago. The collapse triggered a small debris avalanche (<1 km3) and an associated pyroclastic eruption and followed the same scenario that the 1997 sector collapse of Soufrière Hills, Monserrat. Debris avalanche deposits of both volcanoes are very similar. The presence of extensive volumes of altered rock containing sulfate minerals in the deposits indicates that weakening of edifice rocks by acid sulfate-argillic hydrothermal alteration likely helped promote flank collapse. The flank failure and dome collapse of Tutupaca volcano illustrates the potential of highly dangerous activity in all dome eruptions where hydrothermal creates weakened unstable edifices.",

            "abstract": "Reliable estimation of fracture stability in the subsurface is crucial to the success of exploration and production in the petroleum industry, and also for wider applications to earthquake mechanics, hydrogeology and waste disposal. Previous work suggests that fracture stability is related to fluid flow in crystalline basement rocks through shear or tensile instabilities of fractures.\nOur preliminary scoping analysis compares the fracture stability of 60 partly open (apertures 1.5-3 cm) and electrically conductive (low acoustic amplitudes relative to matrix) fractures from a 16 m section of a producing zone in a basement well in Bayoot field, Yemen, to a non-producing zone in the same well (also 16 m). We determine the Critically Stressed Fractures (CSF; Barton et al., 1995) and dilatation tendency (Td; Ferrill et al., 1999). We find that:\n1. CSF (Fig. 1) is a poor predictor of high fluid flow in the inflow zone; 88% of the fractures are predicted to be NOT critically stressed and yet they all occur within a zone of high fluid flow rate\n2. Td (Fig. 2) is also a poor predictor of high fluid flow in the inflow zone; 67% of the fractures have a LOW Td(< 0.6)\n3. For the non-producing zone CSF is a very reliable predictor (100% are not critically stressed) whereas the values of Tdare consistent with their location in non-producing interval (81% are < 0.6) (Fig. 3 & 4).\nIn summary, neither method correlates well with the observed abundance of hydraulically conductive fractures within the producing zone. Within the non-producing zone CSF and Td make reasonably accurate predictions. Fractures may be filled or partially filled with drilling mud or a lower density and electrically conductive fill such as clay in the producing zone and therefore appear (partly) open. In situ stress, fluid pressure, rock properties (friction, strength) and fracture orientation data used as inputs for the CSF and Td calculations are all subject to uncertainty. Our results suggest that scope exists to systematically quantify and explore the impacts of these uncertainties for better predictions of geomechanical stability and fluid conductivity in the subsurface.",

Here we report the study on fungi buried in deep-subsurface sediments by approaches of both cultivation and molecular diversity survey. Cultivation targeting fungi has been done using a sequential sediment samples obtained from the Baltic Sea, Landsort Deep site during the IODP expedition 347. 6 culture media with different nutrition and salt concentration have been tried for the fungi cultivation. 50 isolates of fungi were obtained from the sediment samples. The surface sediments showed richness of fungi strains but not for the deep sediments. Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions of RNA genes were amplified and for the identification of the isolates. The isolates were classified to 11 different genera. Pseudeurotium bakeri was the dominant strain throughout the glacial and interglacial sediments. We also found different representative fungal strains from glacial and interglacial sediments, suggesting the cultivated strains are buried from different sources. The survey of fungal diversity was done by sequencing the 18S RNA genes in the total DNA extracted from selected sediment samples. Fungi community showed different cluster in the glacial and interglacial sediments.Our results revealed the presence and activity of fungi in the deep biosphere of the Baltic sea and provided evidence of fungal community response to the climate change.",

            "abstract": "Multiphase flow problems are numerically difficult to solve, as it often contains nonlinear Phase transition phenomena A conventional technique is to introduce the complementarity constraints where fluid properties such as liquid saturations are confined within a physically reasonable range. Based on such constraints, the mathematical model can be reformulated into a system of nonlinear partial differential equations coupled with variational inequalities. They can be then numerically handled by optimization algorithms.\nIn this work, two different approaches utilizing the complementarity constraints based on persistent primary variables formulation[4] are implemented and investigated. The first approach proposed by Marchand et.al[1] is using “local complementary constraints”, i.e. coupling the constraints with the local constitutive equations. The second approach[2],[3] , namely the “global complementary constrains”, applies the constraints globally with the mass conservation equation. We will discuss how these two approaches are applied to solve non-isothermal componential multiphase flow problem with the phase change phenomenon. Several benchmarks will be presented for investigating the overall numerical performance of different approaches. The advantages and disadvantages of different models will also be concluded.\n",

            "abstract": "The EarthScope USArray provides an opportunity to obtain detailed images of the continental upper mantle at an unprecedented scale. The majority of mantle models derived from USArray data to date contain spatial variations in seismic-wave speed; however, in many cases these data sets do not by themselves allow a non-unique interpretation. Joint interpretation of seismic attenuation and velocity models can improve upon the interpretations based only on velocity. Surface-wave amplitudes are sensitive to factors in addition to attenuation, including source excitation, focusing by elastic structure, and local site amplification. Because of the difficulty of isolating attenuation from these other factors, little is known about the attenuation structure of the North American upper mantle.\nIn this study, Rayleigh wave travel time and amplitude in the period range 25-100 s are measured using an interstation cross-correlation technique. We consider three different approaches for separating the effects of local site amplification and attenuation on the amplitude measurements. The attenuation values determined with these three approaches contain the same first-order features, which gives us confidence that these features are robust: high attenuation in the western U.S. and low attenuation in the central and eastern U.S., with slightly higher attenuation along the eastern seaboard. However, we also identify several areas where we suspect the imaged attenuation values reflect unmodelled focusing effects rather than anelastic attenuation. We therefore identify attenuation values that are likely contaminated by unmodelled focusing effects using the Laplacian of the phase-velocity map, eliminate those values, and generate 2-D attenuation maps through a regional average of the remaining values.\nWe also investigate the range of intrinsic shear-attenuation values that are suggested by the Rayleigh wave attenuation maps at periods between 40 and 80 s. This preliminary model is the first whole-continent attenuation model constructed from USArray data; we conclude that future improvements to this model will result from more accurate computation of focusing effects using simulations rather than the observed travel times.",

            "abstract": "During the last deglaciation (21,000 to 7,000years ago) global sea level rise was punctuated by several abrupt meltwater spikes triggered by the retreat of ice sheets and glaciers world-wide. However, the debate regarding the relative timing, geographical source and the physical mechanisms driving these rapid increases in sea level has catalyzed debate critical to predicting future sea level rise and climate. Here we present a unique record of West Antarctic Ice Sheet elevation change derived from the Patriot Hills blue ice area, located close to the modern day grounding line of the Institute Ice Stream in the Weddell Sea Embayment. Combined isotopic signatures and gas volume analysis from the ice allows us to develop a record of local ice sheet palaeo-altitude that is assessed against independent regional high-resolution ice sheet modeling studies, allowing us to demonstrate that past ice sheet elevations across this sector of the WSE were considerably higher than those suggested by current terrestrial reconstructions. We argue that ice in the WSE had a significant influence on both pre and post LGM sea level rise including MWP-1A (~14.6 ka) and during MWP-1B (11.7-11.6 ka), reconciling past sea level rise and demonstrating for the first time that this sector of the WAIS made a significant and direct contribution to post LGM sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "The coupling of C, N and P cycles has rarely been studied through the air- land-water continuum. This is essential if we are to enhance land-atmosphere models to account for N and P limitations. It is also important for developing integrated catchment management solutions to deliver improved water quality combined with a wide range of other ecosystem functions and services.\nWe present results from a project which is part of the interdisciplinary pan-UK NERC Macronutrient Cycles Programme (macronutrient-cycles.ouce.ox.ac.uk/). Our aim is to quantify how coupled C, N & P cycles change across a land use intensification gradient from arable to grass, woodland and bog ecosystems and identify the implications for land-atmosphere C exchange. We focus on three key processes; photosynthesis, annual net primary productivity (ANPP) and decomposition and explore their consequences for biodiversity. Other aspects of the project track delivery to, and transformations within, the freshwater and coastal systems.\nWhen we explore relationships between C, N and P, results indicate all habitat types fall on a single land use intensification gradient. Stoichiometry suggests plant productivity is primarily N limited. P limitation occurs rarely but at all levels of intensification. Soil priming shows our soils are primarily C limited and, surprisingly, soil acidity provides one of the most powerful single predictors of processes and ecosystem services perhaps as it is a good integrator of many soil properties. Incorporating this knowledge into the UK land-atmosphere model JULES will be used to improve ANPP projections. These will then be used as inputs into a plant species model called MULTIMOVE to enable future scenarios of climate change, land use and air pollution on habitat suitability for > 1400 plant species to be explored. The enhanced Jules model will ensure both N and P limitations on C fluxes from above and below-ground are incorporated into future UK scenario applications.",

The study of PBAPs over the Indian tropical region becomes important as it hosts ~ 18% of the world population and has a distinct climate with a systematic and cyclic monsoon season which is different from the continental climates in Europe and America.\nIn this study, the PBAPs were characterized by the application of molecular genetic techniques involving DNA extraction, PCR amplifications, cloning and DNA sequencing. In addition, characterization of the fungal source emissions was performed to better understand the diversity, abundance, and relative contribution of the fungal aerosols. For the present study, DNA analysis was performed on a one-year air filter set of PM10 (particulate matter ≤10 mm) covering three distinct meteorological seasons, i.e. summer, monsoon, and winter. The results from DNA analysis revealed the presence of bacteria and fungi in the filter samples. The fungal source characterization performed by the DNA analysis revealed the ratio of Basidiomycota to Ascomycota to be 96:4, which is consistent with previously reported studies from airborne fungal communities in the European continental boundary layer air (Fröhlich-Nowoisky et al., 2009). In the study region, the highest species richness was found to be present in the family Agaricaceae (25.3%) followed by Polyporaceae (15.3%) and Marasmiaceae (10.81%). Agaricaceae, Polyporaceae and Psathyrellaceae were dominant families in the study region and the families like Clavariaceae, Nectriaceae, Phanerochaetachae, Pleurotaceae and Strophariaceae were found to be rare. The results will next be compared with the diversity and types of the fungi found in ambient PM10. More details will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Forest productivity is a basic and important component of terrestrial material flow and its importance increases according to recent climate warming and the increase in atmospheric–CO2 concentrations. Forest productivity study progresses through measurement by eddy-covariance data from flux tower and prediction by terrestrial ecosystem models. However, flux tower observation has spatiotemporal bias and limitation. On the other hand, tree-ring data have a close connection with forest ecosystem productivity. Compared to flux tower observation, we can collect tree-ring data from a larger number of sites and longer time scales. Comparisons between tree-ring observation and model-estimated productivity is important to reveal underlying mechanisms of forest ecosystem productivity and growth in wide spatiotemporal scale. This study aimed at revealing the relationship between temporal changes in tree-ring data and estimated forest ecosystem productivity in Japanese conifer-hardwood mixed forest. We also addressed climatic bias in the relationship by comparing between sites at different climatic conditions. Tree-ring data of Sakhalin spruce (Picea glehnii) were obtained from the International Tree Ring Data Bank. Six sites on the Hokkaido island (northern island of Japan) were selected for the present analysis. The Vegetation Integrated SImulator for Trace gasses (VISIT) model was validated by comparing with carbon flux data from Asia flux network sites. Past climatic parameters were obtained from ERA-20C reanalysis data from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts. Correlation between basal area increment and net ecosystem productivity was highest in the coldest site but this correlation weakened in warmer sites. This result implies that long-term growth trend was mainly restricted by cold stress associated with productivity reduction in colder sites but this factor is less important and other factors exert influence in warmer sites.",

This study aims to clarify the potential of ICESat/GLAS, which had been the only spaceborne LiDAR up to now, for forest resources monitoring on a regional scale. The study areas were three regions: Hokkaido Island in Japan (cool-temperate forest), Borneo Island (tropical forest) and Siberia (boreal forest). Firstly, we conducted field measurements at 106 points in Hokkaido and 37 points in Borneo to measure the average canopy height (Lorey's height) and the above-ground biomass (AGB) for each GLAS-footprint, then, we developed some models to estimate canopy height and AGB from the GLAS waveform parameters. Next, we applied the developed models to the GLAS data which were 14,000 points in Hokkaido, and 130,000 points in Borneo, to estimate canopy height and AGB on a regional scale. As a result, we clarified the forest condition concerning canopy height and AGB for each region, namely, the average value, the comparison between the average of each forest type, and the spatial distribution. Furthermore, we detected the AGB change over the years (forest degradation) and estimated the forest loss rate of 1.6% yr-1 in Borneo. Next, we applied the developed models in Hokkaido to the 1,600,000 points GLAS data observed in Siberia. As a result, we clarified that the average AGB in Siberia was a remarkable low value as compared with those in Hokkaido and Borneo, and that the AGB change over the years (forest degradation) was significant in the southern region of western Siberia. This study showed that spaceborne LiDAR had an ability of forest resources monitoring on a regional scale for various forests over the world.",

            "abstract": "Recently, an integrated geophysical survey has been completed along a profile from Baicheng, Xinjing to Da Qaidam, Qinghai, China, which crosses the northern and eastern Tarim basin, the Altyn Tagh Range, and the Qaidam basin, respectively. Along the profile, a wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction profile with 9 shot points has been carried out to acquire P and S wave velocities. Based on the velocities and constrained by gravitational and geomagnetic anomalies, the density and magnetization intensity of the crust and uppermost mantle along the profile were determined through a joint inversion of gravity with geomagnetism. Using these data and combined with geological analyses we constructed a geodynamic model for northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, which reveals a detailed structure of the crust and uppermost mantle, a deep tectonic setting of the superposed basins and a basin and range coupling mechanism.",

            "abstract": "During the last 100 years, the patterns and amount of fresh water and materials load from the land into estuaries have changed due to anthropogenic developments. BSi (Biogenic Silica; a main component of diatom frustules) flux from the land is especially known to be affected by such developments. Two estuarine barrages were constructed around Nakdong River estuaries (Noksan dam in 1934 and Nakdong estuarine barrage in 1987) and abrupt change of BSi flux is expected. To determine effects of dam constructions, we have analyzed BSi concentration, water content, grain size, ignition loss and radioactive isotope using sediment cores from two stations (ND1 and ND2) at Nakdong estuary. BSi concentration, water content and ignition loss of ND1, located near West Nakdong River, are 0.17-2.63%, 11.76-36.0% and 0.4-5.8% respectively and those of ND2, which has relatively high accumulation rate, are 0.85-2.17%, 15.53-31.98% and 1.4-4.19% respectively. Decrease of BSi flux is quite clear in ND2, however, not in ND1 which has low accumulation rate. The reduced BSi flux might be responsible for the recent dinoflagellates dominance over diatom in the nearby coastal areas.",

They are complex polymict breccias of impact, igneous, and sedimentary clasts set in a dark grey matrix [1; 2]. The rock also contains angular mineral fragments, including K-feldspar, plagioclase feldspar, and pyroxene [1; 2]. Mineral fragments are often > 1 mm wide, and clasts can be > 1 cm. This diverse breccia assemblage indicates formation via repeated impact events, supported by Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and U-Pb ages ranging from 1.3 to 4.4 Ga [1, 2, and references therein].\nIn this study we investigate the distribution of ages yielded by Ar/Ar, with nine aliquots analyzed to date, and additional analyses planned. In order to analyze only single phases, chips of matrix/clasts were restricted to visibly monomict fragments < 1 mm diameter, while mineral separates were analyzed as single crystals. Cosmogenic Ar corrections are from [3]. Analyses were undertaken at SUERC and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and the results pooled. The bulk of aliquots (n = 8) yielded ages of ca. 1.2-1.4 Ga indicating a major thermal event occurred at around the same time as crystallization of the Nakhlite group of meteorites. Select step ages are considerably older (> 2 Ga), supporting results of other chronometers that much older material is present in this sample. These results also demonstrate that some older fragments retained Ar during breccia formation.\n[1] Wittmann A. et al. (2015) Meteoritics & Planet. Sci., 50, 326-352.\n[2] Santos A. R. et al.

The design, manufacture, and results from lithium ion attachment ionisation sources for two mass spectrometry systems are presented. Trace gas analysis is investigated using a modified Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (CIMS) and vapour pressure (VP) measurements using a modified Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometer (KEMS) are presented.\nThe Li+ modified CIMS provided limits of detection of 4 ppt for acetone, 0.2 ppt for formic acid, 15 ppt for nitric acid and 120 ppt from ammonia. Despite improvements, the problem of burnout remained persistent. The Li+ CIMS would unlikely be suitable for field or aircraft work, but could be appropriate for certain lab applications.\nThe KEMS currently utilizes an electron impact (EI) ionisation source which provides a highly sensitive source, with the drawback of fragmentation of ionized molecules (Booth et al., 2009). Using Li+ KEMS the VP of samples can be measured without fragmentation and can therefore be used to identify VPs of individual components in mixtures. The validity of using Li+ for determining the VP of mixtures was tested by making single component VP measurements, which showed good agreement with EI measurements of Poly ethylene glycol (PEG) 3 and PEG 4, both when individually measured and when mixed. The Li+ KEMS was then used to investigate a system of atmospheric relevance, α-pinene secondary organic aerosol, generated in a reaction chamber (Alfarra et al., 2012). The VPs of the individual components from this generated sample are within the range we expect for compounds capable of partitioning between the particle and gas phase of an aerosol (0.1-10-5 Pa). Li+ source has a calculated sensitivity approximately 75 times less than that of EI, but the lack of fragmentation using the Li+ source is a significant advantage.",

            "abstract": "The West Bohemia/Vogtland region, central Europe, is a place of localized repeating swarm activity continuously monitored during the last two decades, allowing a detailed study of the driving mechanisms. Previous earthquake episodes where characterized by swarm-type activity with gradual onsets and decays which were not related to mainshocks. However, the latest activity in the year 2014 occurred exactly in the same location as previous swarm activity but consisted of three classical aftershock sequences triggered by a M4.4 event and two ~M3.5 events. The apparent system change from swarm-type to mainshock-aftershock characteristics can have important implications for the understanding of swarm and aftershock generation as well as for seismic hazard assessment in this region. Thus we have analyzed in detail the spatiotemporal aftershock sequence based on a relocated earthquake catalog. Our analysis shows that the largest mainshock occurred in a step-over region of the fault plane with increased Coulomb stress due to previous activity. Its rupture plane connecting both segments is significantly rotated compared to most aftershocks, which occurred in-plane. The aftershock characteristics are classical in the way that (i) the aftershocks are clearly triggered by the mainshock, (ii) the maximum magnitude of the aftershocks is approximately 1.2 units less than the mainshock magnitude (Bath law), and (iii) the decay can be well fitted by the Omori-Utsu law. However, the absolute number of aftershocks and the fitted c and p values of the Omori-Utsu decay are significantly larger than for typical sequences. The fit of the epidemic type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model reveals a time-dependent background activity which exponentially decays with time after the mainshock. Pore pressure simulations with an exponentially decreasing flow rate of the fluid source show a good agreement with the observed spatial migration front of the aftershocks extending approximately with log(t). Thus we conclude that the mainshock opened fluid pathways into the fault plane explaining the migration patterns and the exponential decrease of the flow rate due to a finite fluid source. This interpretation is backed by the independent observation of a postseismic increase of gas flow in a mofette on top of the activity.",

Understanding and constraining the processes governing the water vapor isotopic composition is therefore crucial in order to improve future projection of climate change.\nWe present here concomitant in-situ water vapor and precipitation isotope measurements carried out for several years at monitoring stations across the North Atlantic. Our observations have been carried out in different climate regions, which allow us to characterize the influence of sea surface temperature, and across several years, which allow us to separate the seasonal influence. Using this extensive dataset we focus specifically on the parameterization of the kinetic effects during evaporation from the ocean surface. We address the observed apparent lack of wind speed and sea surface temperature effect on the marine boundary layer water vapor isotopic composition by comparing the formulation by Merlivat and Jouzel (1979) and the formulation by Craig and Gordon (1964) against our water vapor and precipitation isotope observations and using calculations of backwards trajectories.",

The research team from Taiwan, supported by the Central Geological Survey (CGS), has been demonstrated at SW offshore Taiwan that indicated this area is potential gas hydrate region. Therefore, the Gas Hydrate Master Program (GHMP) was brought in the National Energy Program-Phase II (NEP-II) to continue research and development. In this study, the microbial community structure of potential gas hydrate bearing sediments of giant piston core MD-178-10-3291 (KP12N) from the Kaoping Canyon offshore SW of Taiwan were investigated. This core was found many empty spaces and filling huge methane gas (>99.9 %) that might dissociate from solid gas hydrate. 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and phylogenetic analysis showed that the dominant members of Archaea were ANME (13 %), SAGMEG (31 %) and DSAG (20 %), and those of Bacteria were Chloroflexi (13 %), Candidate division JS1 (40 %) and Planctomycetes (15 %). Among them, ANME-3 is only distributed at the sulfate-methane interface (SMI) of 750 cmbsf, and sharing similarity with the Hydrate Ridge clone HydBeg92. ANME-1 and SAGMEG distributed below 750 cmbsf. In addition, DSAG and Candidate division JS1 are most dominant and distributed vertically at all tested depths from 150-3600 cmbsf. Combine the geochemical data and microbial phylotype distribution suggests the potential of gas hydrate bearing sediments at core MD-178-10-3291 (KP12N) from the Kaoping Canyon offshore SW of Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "The characteristics of streamflow reflect the co-evolution of climate, soils, topography and vegetation of catchments. Hydrological metrics or signatures can represent the long-term behaviour and integrate the influence of all the streamflow drivers. Although this sort of relationship has been developed in regional studies exploring prediction of Flow Duration Curves and other streamflow metrics, little is known about the controls of other key streamflow characteristics especially in continent scale. This study aims to understand how catchment biophysical variables control key hydrological metrics such as baseflow index, elasticity of streamflow to rainfall variability and intermittency in continent scale and regionally. We used a set of catchment biophysical variables to model key streamflow signatures using multivariate power-law and beta regressions in 355 catchments located along the eastern Australian seaboard. Streamflow signatures were derived from daily streamflow time series data from 1980 to 2013. We tested 52 catchment biophysical characteristics related to climate, soil, topography, geography, geomorphology, vegetation and land-cover as predictors of the streamflow signatures. The prediction R-squared ranged from 63 to 72% when relationships are built in continent scale, but can be greater than 80% when regressions are regionalised. The interpretation of the modelled relationships offers new insights regarding the controls of flow characteristics.",

Taking advantages of the multi-source remote sensing data and the openness of the data sharing policies, CropWatch group reported their monitoring results by publishing four bulletins one year. In order to better analysis and generate the bulletin and provide an alternative way to access agricultural monitoring indicators and results in CropWatch, The CropWatch online system based on the WEBGIS techniques has been developed.\nFigure 1 shows the CropWatch online system structure and the system UI in Clustering mode. Data visualization is sorted into three different modes: Vector mode, Raster mode and Clustering mode.\nVector mode provides the statistic value for all the indicators over each monitoring units which allows users to compare current situation with historical values (average, maximum, etc.). Users can compare the profiles of each indicator over the current growing season with the historical data in a chart by selecting the region of interest (ROI).\nRaster mode provides pixel based anomaly of CropWatch indicators globally. In this mode, users are able to zoom in to the regions where the notable anomaly was identified from statistic values in vector mode.\nData from remote sensing image series at high temporal and low spatial resolution provide key information in agriculture monitoring. Clustering mode provides integrated information on different classes in maps, the corresponding profiles for each class and the percentage of area of each class to the total area of all classes. The time series data is categorized into limited types by the ISODATA algorithm. For each clustering type, pixels on the map, profiles, and percentage legend are all linked together.\nAll the three visualization methods are applied to four scales including 65 monitoring and reporting units (MRUs), 7 major production zones (MPZs), 173 countries and sub-countries for 9 large countries. Agro-Climatic information, Agronomic information and indicators related with crop area, crop yield and crop production are provided.",

            "abstract": "In seismology, effective media theory exploits the fact that bandlimited elastic waves are sensitive to small-scale heterogeneity in only an ‘effective’ manner. From effective media theories follow modern homogenization techniques, which seek to upscale a fine-scale medium into an effective medium that produces an identical long-period solution to the elastic wave equation. These techniques are currently finding heavy use in seismic waveform modelling, which has immediate applications to seismic full waveform inversion (FWI).\nFWI is usually formulated as a non-linear gradient-based inverse problem. As with most problems of this class, the solution is strongly dependent on the starting model: if a given starting model predicts 'cycle-skipped' synthetic data, the method is unlikely to converge to the global minimum. As low frequencies are less prone to this ‘cycle-skipping’, the issue is commonly solved by following a multi-scale approach. While this is often successful, it requires that each new frequency band satisfies the half-cycle criterion before being used. We propose to use effective media theory as a communicator between scales and frequency bands; to allow us to broaden the investigated frequency band earlier in the inversion workflow.\nTo accomplish this, we take advantage of the intuitive notion that the homogenized gradient should vanish at scales much larger than that probed by waves within a given frequency band. Practically, this involves first calculating a broadband waveform sensitivity. Then, within a narrow frequency band which includes the lowest frequency data, we calculate the gradient with respect to a modified misfit function. This modification comes in the form of a Lagrange multiplier constraint which forces the homogenized gradient to zero. Then, we cascade upwards through frequencies, adding constraints which enforce the homogenized gradient in any frequency band to equal the constrained gradient at the next lowest frequency band. By investigating the behaviour of the gradient across different scales of effective media, we hope to place additional physical constraints on the descent direction of a gradient-based FWI problem, to mitigate cycle-skipping issues, and to improve the quality of the solution.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols play a significant role in Earth’s climate by scattering and absorbing incoming sunlight and affecting the formation and radiative properties of clouds. The extent to which aerosols affect cloud remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty amongst all influences on climate change. Now, a new comprehensive datasets has been developed under the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme to quantify how changes in aerosol levels affect these clouds. The unique dataset is constructed from the Optimal Retrieval of Aerosol and Cloud (ORAC) algorithm used in (A)ATSR (Along Track Scanning Radiometer) retrievals of aerosols generated in the Aerosol CCI and the CC4CL ( Community Code for CLimate) for cloud retrieval in the Cloud CCI.\nThe ATSR instrument is a dual viewing instrument with on board visible and infra red calibration systems making it an ideal instrument to study trends of Aerosol and Clouds and their interactions. The data set begins in 1995 and ends in 2012. A new instrument in the series SLSTR(Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) will be launch in 2015. The Aerosol and Clouds are retreived using similar algorithms to maximise the consistency of the results\nThese state-of-the-art retrievals have been merged together to quantify the susceptibility of cloud properties to changes in aerosol concentration. Aerosol-cloud susceptibilities are calculated from several thousand samples in each 1x1 degree globally gridded region. Two-D histograms of the aerosol and cloud properties are also included to facilitate seamless comparisons between other satellite and modelling data sets.\n The analysis of these two long term records will be discussed individually and the initial comparisons between these new joint products and models will be presented.",

            "abstract": "We present a quantitative model of heat, mass and both major and trace element transport in a compacting crustal mush which accounts for phase change and chemical reaction. We find significant modifications to melt composition that are not captured by batch/fractional melting/crystallisation models, or by models that fail to capture the evolution of local bulk composition when calculating phase equilibria. Within an upwards-cooling crustal mush, a high porosity layer forms which migrates towards the top of the mush defined by the solidus isotherm. Despite occupying a high porosity, the melt in this layer has a major element composition corresponding to a progressively smaller fraction of batch (static) melting, because it is migrating into, and locally equilibrating with, mush at lower temperature. The high porosity layer resembles a conventional magma chamber, but is produced by changes in bulk composition in response to melt migration, rather than the addition of heat. Indeed, such a layer can form even when the mush is cooling overall. Moreover, the magma chamber is located in the coolest part region near the top of the mush, rather than the hottest region near the base.\nThis is a new method to produce a magma chamber within a crustal mush, and also to evolve the major and trace element composition of the melt in the chamber. The accumulated melt is less enriched in incompatible trace elements than predicted if it is assumed that melt with the same major element composition has been produced by batch or fractional melting. Thus trace elements appear to be less fractionated than major elements: the melt is under enriched, and the crystal cumulates are over enriched, in incompatible elements compared to batch/fractional melting model predictions. The creation of evolved magmas within the crust can be explained by melt migration and component transport through a reactive crystalline mush, with timescales, rates and thermal budgets consistent with natural systems.",

            "abstract": "We present observations of the South-East Indian Ridge (SEIR) collected during the STORM cruise (South Tasmania Ocean Ridge and Mantle) on the N/O L'Atalante early 2015. The SEIR between Australia and Antarctica displays large variations of axial morphology despite an almost constant intermediate spreading rate. The Australia-Antarctic Discordance (AAD) between 120°E and 128°E is a section of the mid-ocean ridge where the magma budget is abnormally low, and which marks the boundary between Indian and Pacific mantle domains with distinct geochemical isotopic compositions. The STORM project focuses on the area east of the discordance from 128 to 140°E, where gravity highs observed on satellite-derived maps of the flanks of the SEIR reveal numerous volcanic seamounts. A major objective of the STORM cruise was to test the hypothesis of a mantle flow from the Pacific to the Indian domains. We collected multibeam bathymetry and magnetic data between 136 and 138°E to map off-axis volcanic ridges up to 10 Ma-old crust. We mapped the SEIR axis between 129 and 140°E, and the northern part of the George V transform fault. We collected rock samples on seamounts and in the transform fault, basaltic glass samples along the ridge axis, and near-bottom samples and in-situ measurements in the water column. Our observations reveal that the off-axis seamounts form near the SEIR axis, and are not associated to off-axis deformation of the ocean floor. They show a general shallowing of the ridge axis from the AAD to the George V TF and the presence of robust axial segments near the transform fault. They allow us to describe the complex evolution of the transform fault system. They also permit to locate new hydrothermal systems along the ridge axis. STORM cruise scientific party: F. Barrere, C.

Several different mechanisms could excite Love waves in this frequency band: broadly speaking, we can differentiate between source effects, like pressure variations on the oblique sea floor, or internal effects in the medium along the propagation path, such as scattering and conversions.\nHere we will focus on the internal effects. We perform single scattering tests in 2D and 3D to gain a better understanding of the scattering radiation pattern and the conversion between P, S, Rayleigh and Love waves. Furthermore, we use random media with continuous variations of the elastic parameters to create a scattering regime similar to the Earths interior, e.g. Gaussian or von Karmann correlation functions. The aim is to explore the contribution of scattering along the propagation path to the observed Love to Rayleigh wave energy ratios, assuming a purely vertical force source mechanism.\nWe use finite different solvers to calculate the synthetic seismograms, and to separate the different wave types we measure the rotational and divergent components of the wave field.",

            "abstract": "We present an analysis of the regional methane (CH4) budget from South Asia, using new measurements and new modelling techniques. South Asia contains some of the largest anthropogenic CH4 sources in the world, mainly from rice agriculture and ruminants. However, emissions from this region have been highly uncertain largely due to insufficient constraints from atmospheric measurements. Compared to parts of the developed world, which have well-developed monitoring networks, South Asia is very under-sampled, particularly given its importance to the global CH4 budget. Over the past few years, data have been collected from a variety of surface sites around the region, ranging from in situ to flask-based sampling. We have used these data, in conjunction with column methane data from the GOSAT satellite, to quantify emissions at a regional scale. Using the Met Office’s Lagrangian NAME model, we calculated sensitivities to surface fluxes at 12 km resolution, allowing us to simulate the high-resolution impacts of emissions on concentrations. In addition, we used a newly developed hierarchical Bayesian inverse estimation scheme to estimate regional fluxes over the period of 2012-2014 in addition to ancillary “hyper-parameters” that characterize uncertainties in the system. Through this novel approach, we have characterized the effect of “aggregation” errors, model uncertainties as well as the effects of correlated errors when using regional measurement networks. We have also assessed the effects of biases on the GOSAT CH4 retrievals, which has been made possible for the first time for this region through the expanded surface measurements. In this talk, we will discuss a) regional CH4 fluxes from South Asia, with a particular focus on the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plains b) derived model uncertainties, including the effects of correlated errors c) the impacts of combining surface and satellite data for emissions estimation in regions where poor satellite validation exists and d) the challenges in estimating emissions for regions of the world with a sparse measurement network.",

            "abstract": "Building on growing momentum in the application of geophysical techniques to snow problems and, specifically, on new theory and an electrical geophysical snow hydrological model published recently; we demonstrate for the first time that the electrical self-potential geophysical technique can sense in-situ bulk meltwater fluxes. This has broad and immediate implications for snow measurement practice, modelling and operational snow forecasting. Our ability to measure, quantify and assimilate hydrological properties and processes of snow in operational models is disproportionally poor compared to the significance of seasonal snowmelt as a global water resource and major risk factor in flood and avalanche forecasting. Encouraged by recent theoretical, modelling and laboratory work, we show here that the diurnal evolution of aerially-distributed self-potential magnitudes closely track those of bulk meltwater fluxes in melting in-situ snowpacks at Rhone and Jungfraujoch glaciers, Switzerland. Numerical modelling infers temporally-evolving liquid water contents in the snowpacks on successive days in close agreement with snow-pit measurements. Muting previous concerns, the governing physical and chemical properties of snow and meltwater became temporally invariant for modelling purposes. Because measurement procedure is straightforward and readily automated for continuous monitoring over significant spatial scales, we conclude that the self-potential geophysical method is a highly-promising non-intrusive snow-hydrological sensor for measurement practice, modelling and operational snow forecasting.",

After reconstruction, obducted ophiolite and their sub-ophiolitic units can be found along a 200 kilometre-long north to south transect in western Anatolia. If related to a single event, the dimension of this ophiolite makes it an exceptional object of interest to study obduction and early subduction dynamics. This contribution aim to: (1) (re)-appraise the metamorphic pressure-temperature (PT) conditions and evolution of the sub-ophiolitic units of western Anatolia; (2) reconstruct the Anatolian ophiolite and (3) understand the dynamics of a large-scale and long-lived obduction. Directly below the ophiolite (mostly made of mantle-derived rocks) lies a metamorphic sole. The upper part of is this sole is made of garnet ± clinopyroxene amphibolites. In the northern part the sole is characterised by an important blueschist-facies overprint destabilizing the amphibolite paragenesis whereas it is lacking in the south. PT conditions were refined at 10.5 kbar and 780°C for the south and at 11 kbar and 725°C using pseudosection modelling. Field and petrological observations recognize three principal units in the accretionary complex (from top to bottom, OC1, 2 and 3) with PT conditions ranging from incipient metamorphism to blueschist facies conditions. OC1 represents most of the outcropping unit, is found all along the section and shows pristine oceanic rocks to very low grade metamorphics rocks (lawsonite - pumpelltyite facies). Blueschist facies rocks including Fe-Mg carpholite-bearing layers were found in OC2 and attest high-pressure and low-temperature conditions (~10 kbar – 350°C). OC3 exhibit a clear blueschist facies metamorphism, but higher PT conditions (17 kbar - 450°C). Both OC2 and 3 were only found in the northern area close to the suture zone. Combining these data and recent advances in our understanding of subduction zone interface processes we disscuss (i) the formation of metamorphic sole and their extension (ii) the significance ands mechanism of the blueschist overprint in sole; (iii) exhumation and detachment of units at various depths and their influence on the rheological behaviour of subduction zone.",

Numerically, particle methods can deal with micro-scale kinetics, but they generally need much computational resources if one tries to calculate macro-scale by them. On the other hand, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) can solve macro-scale dynamics efficiently, but it cannot reproduce the phenomenon without an appropriate extension. Usami et al. (2008, 2014) developed a code that uses both Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method and MHD. They divided a computational box into three domains; a PIC domain, a MHD domain and an interaction domain. Both PIC and MHD are calculated in the interaction domain and interlocked. They localized the PIC domain and enabled efficient implementation of simulations. In our previous study, we extended Usami's MHD domain to a hierarchical mesh that is controlled by Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique (Ogawa et al. 2014), aiming to connect the local PIC calculation with a global MHD simulation.\nIn this study, we apply the code to a simulation of magnetic reconnection in magnetotail. Outer boundary of the MHD domain is decided by data of another global MHD simulation of Earth's magnetosphere, and it leads to magnetic reconnection in the PIC domain. We will describe our method and show results in our poster.\nThis work was supported by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) 23340182.",

            "abstract": "In Nordic and mountainous regions, hydrological processes are more complex than for regular rainfall-driven watersheds. Snow accumulates in winter, acting as a reservoir, and melts during late spring and summer. In order to take into account these additional natural processes present in mountainous watersheds, snow modules have been created in order to help rainfall-runoff models to simulate river discharge. Many empirical degree-day snow models have been designed to simulate snowmelt and river discharge when coupled to a rainfall runoff model, but few of them simulate correctly the amount of snow water equivalent (SWE) at point scale. Simulating correctly not only the amount of snowmelt but also the water content of the snowpack has several potential advantages: it allows improving the model reliability and performance for short-term and long-term prediction, spatial regionalization, and it makes it possible to perform data assimilation using observed snow measurements. The objective of our study is to create a new simple empirical snow module, with a structure allowing the use of snow data for calibration or assimilation. We used a model structure close to the snow model defined by M.T. Walter (2005) where each of the processes of the energy balance is parameterized using only temperature and precipitation data. The conductive fluxes into the snowpack have been modeled using analyticalsolutions to the heat equation with phase change. This model which is in-between the degree-day and the physical energy-balance approaches. It has the advantages to use only temperature and precipitation which arewidely available data and to take account of energy balance processes without being computationally intensive. Another advantage is that all state variables of the model should be comparable with observable measurements.For the moment, the snow module has been parameterized at point scale and has been tested over Switzerland and the US, using MeteoSwiss and SNOTEL USGS datasets. Further developments on the model aim to extend the daily-point scale model to a basin scale with a sub-daily time scale using satellites and point scale snow data for calibration and evaluation.",

            "abstract": "The column-average dry air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2) and methane (XCH4) were measured with a portable Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS), EM27/SUN, using direct sunlight at 1) Caltech, in Pasadena, a northern Los Angeles suburb, 2) Chino, a dairy region east of Los Angeles, and 3) Railroad Valley (RRV), a desert playa in Nevada. They were conducted during the GOSAT/OCO-2 joint campaign for vicarious calibration and validation (cal/val) and its preparatory experiments in June-July 2015.\nJAXA’s GOSAT has been operating since 2009 to monitor the greenhouse gases XCO2 and XCH4 using surface-reflected sunlight from space. GOSAT carries a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) and a Cloud and Aerosol Imager (TANSO-CAI). NASA’s OCO-2 has been operating since 2014, carries a grating spectrometer to make precise XCO2 observations with a-few-kilometer resolution. Their polar orbits have 12:46 pm (GOSAT) and 1:30 pm (OCO-2) observing times. For cal/val, these sites were targeted with coincident , near simultaneous ground-based and vertical profiling measurements.\nThese sites are different types of suburban, dairy, and desert areas. Before the campaign, measurements from the JAXA EM27/SUN were compared with those from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and from the Caltech EM27/SUN at Pasadena. We compared the retrieved values and simultaneously observed diurnal enhancements by advection from the Los Angeles basin. Then, we observed a diurnal cycle at Chino dairy area, an area of concentrated husbandry, producing a CH4 point source. Finally, we conducted the cal/val campaign at RRV coincident with GOSAT and OCO-2 overpass observations. Over RRV, vertical profiles of CO2 and CH4 were measured using the Alpha Jet research aircraft as a part of the NASA Ames Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) . We will compare experimental results from the cal/val campaign for XCO2 and XCH4 with a portable FTS.",

This organization collects the geotechnical and geological information of borehole data more than 60,000 data. GI-base is the database system of the KG-NET and platform to use these borehole data. Kansai Geo-informatics Research Committee (KG-R) is tried to explain the geotechnical properties and geological environment using borehole database in Kansai area. In 2014, KG-R established the ‘Shin-Kansai Jiban Omi plain‘, and explain the subsurface geology and characteristics of geotechnical properties. In this study we introduce this result and consider the sedimental environment and characteristics in this area.\nOmi Basin is located in the central part of Shiga Prefecture which includes the largest lake in Japan called Lake Biwa. About 15,000 borehole data are corrected to consider the subsurface properties. The outline of topographical and geological characteristics of the basin is divided into west side and east side. The west side area is typical reverse fault called Biwako-Seigan fault zone along the lakefront. From Biwako-Seigan fault, the Omi basin is tilting down from east to west. Otherwise, the east areas distribute lowland and hilly area comparatively. The sedimentary facies are also complicate and difficult to be generally evaluated. So the discussion has been focused about mainly the eastern and western part of Lake Biwa.\nThe widely dispersed volcanic ash named Aira-Tn (AT) deposited before 26,000-29,000 years ago (Machida and Arai, 2003), is sometimes interbedded the humic layers in the low level ground area. However, because most of the sediments are comprised by thick sand and gravels whose deposit age could not be investigated, it is difficult to widely identify the boundary of strata.\nThree types of basement rocks are distributed mainly (granite, sediment rock, rhyolite), and characteristics of deposit are difference of each backland basement rock. Therefore, we considered the characteristics of area deposit as each riverine system. Otherwise, lakeside area are distributes many humic layers and sandy beach ridge. The results of each distinctive trend are useful to estimate of seismic properties and zonation.",

            "abstract": "In this work we present an approach, called “layer stripping”, to enhance the sensitivity of surface magnetotelluric responses to subtle subsurface temporal variations in electrical resistivity. The proposed methodology is based on the analytical solution of the one-dimensional magnetotelluric problem, and that both resolution and sensitivity to resistivity changes produced at a given depth increase when the data are acquired closer to the depth where the resistivity changes are taking place. Thus, given a well-known geoelectrical baseline model of a reservoir site, the layer stripping approach aims to remove the effects of the upper, unchanging, structures in order to obtain the time-varying magnetotelluric responses at the target depth. The layer stripping methodology is suggested for monitoring all types of reservoirs but in this work we focus on its application on CO2 geological storage sites. Different injections of CO2 are studied simulating one-dimensional and three-dimensional resistivity variations in the reservoir layer, and the feasibility of the method is appraised evaluating the error of the approach. The geoelectrical baseline model of the Hontomín site (Spain) for CO2 geological storage in a deep saline aquifer is used to assess how this methodology could be implemented in an actual monitoring survey. The resistivity model of the site defines the subsurface in the pre-injection state and allows applying the layer stripping approach to remove the effect of the upper structures not affected by injection of the CO2 gas from the surface MT responses. The proposed approach constitutes an innovative contribution to detect resistivity variations and locate them more precisely in the space. The obtained results show the potential of the method also to sense any possible leakage.",

It carries two solar-observing instruments: SWAP, an EUV imager observing the one-million-degree corona, and LYRA, a UV-EUV radiometer acquiring time-series in four broadband channels. The characteristics of both instruments make them highly complementary to bigger missions such as SDO for the observation of solar eruptions and flares.\nSWAP benefits from a large field-of-view and flexible off-pointing capabilities that allow the instrument to fill part of the observational gap between imagers and coronographs and to shed a new light on eruptive events (see e.g. West and Seaton, 2015; Kumar and Cho, 2014; Byrne et al., 2014)\nLYRA acquires at a very fast cadence (20 Hz nominally) and with a high signal-to-noise ratio, and can therefore be used for the detailed analysis of the short-timescale variations of solar irradiance, such as the so-called quasi-periodic pulsations appearing in flares that could be intrinsically related to the nature of the flaring process (see e.g. Dolla et al., 2012).\nThe two instruments provide data suitable for the detection of space weather related events such as flares, CMEs, dimmings, EUV waves, etc. Automated tools (e.g. SOFAST, see Bonte et al. 2012) are already operational and are used daily in the frame of space weather services such as the ESA's Space Weather Coordination Centre (SSCC). These tools should be soon enriched with new capabilities.",

            "abstract": "Although core formation was a key stage in the evolution of terrestrial planets, the physical processes which resulted in segregation of iron and silicate remain poorly understood. Formation of a silicate magma oceans provides an obvious mechanism for segregation of core-forming liquids, although recent work has strengthened arguments for a complex, multi-stage model of core formation. Extreme pressure1 and the effects of deformation2 have both been shown to promote percolation of Fe-rich melts in a solid silicate matrix, providing mechanisms for early, low temperature core-formation. However, the efficiency of these processes remains untested and we lack meaningful experimental data on resulting melt segregation velocities. Arguments regarding the efficiency of core formation through percolation of Fe-rich melts in solid silicate are based on simple, empirical models.\n Here, we review textural evidence from recent experiments which supports early core formation driven by deformation-aided percolation of Fe-rich melts. We then present results of novel in-situ synchrotron studies designed to provide time-resolved 3-D microimaging of percolating melt in model systems under extreme conditions. Under low strain rates characteristic of deformation-aided core formation, segregation of metallic (core-forming) melts by percolation is driven by stress gradients. This is expected to ultimately result in channelization and efficient segregation of melts noted in high-strain, low pressure experiments3. In-situ visualization also demonstrates that percolation of viscous metallic melts is surprisingly rapid. A combination of melt channelization and hydraulic fracture results in rapid, episodic melt migration, even over the limited time scale of experiments. The efficiency of this process depends strongly on the geometry of the melt network and is scaled to grain size in the matrix. We use both in-situ visualization and high-resolution ex-situ analysis to provide accurate constraints on melt migration velocities via this combined mechanism and will propose a model by which results can be scaled to core formation in the early solar system.\n ",

            "abstract": "Hydrological models are essential tools for drought risk management, often providing input to water resource system models, aiding our understanding of low flow processes within catchments and providing low flow predictions. However, simulating low flows and droughts is challenging as hydrological systems often demonstrate threshold effects in connectivity, non-linear groundwater contributions and a greater influence of water resource system elements during low flow periods. These dynamic processes are typically not well represented in commonly used hydrological models due to data and model limitations. Furthermore, calibrated or behavioural models may not be effectively evaluated during more extreme drought periods. A better understanding of the processes that occur during low flows and how these are represented within models is thus required if we want to be able to provide robust and reliable predictions of future drought events.\nIn this study, we assess the performance of dynamic TOPMODEL for low flow simulation. Dynamic TOPMODEL was applied to a number of UK catchments in the Thames region using time series of observed rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data that captured multiple historic droughts over a period of several years. The model performance was assessed against the observed discharge time series using a limits of acceptability framework, which included uncertainty in the discharge time series. We evaluate the models against multiple signatures of catchment low-flow behaviour and investigate differences in model performance between catchments, model diagnostics and for different low flow periods. We also considered the impact of surface water and groundwater abstractions and discharges on the observed discharge time series and how this affected the model evaluation. From analysing the model performance, we suggest future improvements to Dynamic TOPMODEL to improve the representation of low flow processes within the model structure.",

            "abstract": "The framework of fast response and slow feedback has emerged as a conceptual paradigm to understand the response of the climate system to external forcings. Fast response refers to rapid climate adjustment to an imposed external forcing that occurs before substantial change in global mean surface temperature, and slow feedback refers to climate response that is associated with a change in surface temperature.\nIn this study, we investigate the utility of the response-feedback paradigm in representing total climate change by developing a multivariate regression model of climate change. In contrast to most studies that examine response to a single climate forcing factor, we consider responses to two climate forcings applied separately and in combination. In our work, the change in a climate variable is represented by a linear combination of its sensitivity to CO2 forcing, solar forcing, and change in global mean surface temperature. In contrast to approaches pioneered by Gregory et al. (2004) in which regression parameters are derived from time-series data from a single simulation, in our work the parameters of the regression model are derived using time-mean results from a set of HadCM3L climate model step-forcing simulations. The regression model is then used to emulate HadCM3L-simulate climate change under a wide range of transient CO2/solar forcing scenarios.\nThe regression model emulates well HadCM3L-simulated temporal evolution and spatial distribution of climate change, including surface temperature, precipitation, runoff, soil moisture, cloudiness, and radiative fluxes, suggesting that total climate change can be represented well by the sum of fast response and slow feedback. We also discuss the limitation of the regression model and the underlying linear assumption of climate response.",

The prediction of flood risks or trends of flood risks is of major interest to people under direct threat, policy and decision makers as well as for insurance companies. A lot of research was and is currently done in view of detecting future trends in flood extremes or return periods. From a pure physically based point of view, there is strong evidence that those trends exist.

            "abstract": " Urban air temperature is higher than surrounding air temperature. It is called Urban Heat Island. Furthermore, according to climate change, Urban air temperature is expected to be increased in the future. Therefore, Preparing for high temperature event result from climate change is important as well as preparing for presence of the urban heat. In this study, we analyzed Seoul temperature change according to the climate change scenarios, and suggested some strategies to fight against climate change and urban heat island.\n For doing this, Firstly, Seoul was divided into 1km² cells which matches the climate change scenario resolution. Then, future temperature distribution was analyzed. In this time, future temperature means distribution means the average temperature in August 2010~2100 from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios.\n Secondly, Cells where temperature is over 33℃ are selected as the “high temperature region (HTR)”. For identifying HTUR characteristics, we did regression analysis with terrain, land cover, distance from rivers and mountains variables.\n As a result, most of the HTR was distributed to the industrial and business districts, and appeared as far away from the rivers and mountains. These result can be used in the further urban heat island studies, especially identifying urban type which vulnerable to climate change. Also, it can be helpful in establishing strategies corresponding to the future climate. ",

            "abstract": "Reactive mixing processes play a central role in a range of porous media systems, including CO2 sequestration operations, reactive geothermal dipoles, biofilms, or flow-through reactors. Many of these reactions are limited by fluid mixing processes that bring the reactants into contact. Hence, the temporal dynamics of effective global reactivity is determined by the creation of concentration gradients by fluid stretching and their dissipation by diffusion [1,2]. From the analysis of the elongation and aggregation of lamellar structures formed in the transported scalar fields, we derive analytical predictions for the probability density functions of concentration gradients in heterogeneous Darcy flows over a large range of Péclet numbers and permeability field variances. In this framework, we show that heterogeneous Darcy fields generate highly intermittent concentration fields, as manifested by the spatial scaling of structure functions. The resulting effective reaction rates display a range of temporal behaviors that depend on the degree of heterogeneity. In the large Damköhler limit, we derive analytical expressions for these temporal scalings in the different regimes that arise when exploring the Péclet number space. We generalize these results for different random flows, including turbulent flows.\n",

            "abstract": "Submarine mass failures (SMFs) present one of the significant marine Geo-hazards. Their importance as contributors to tsunami hazard has been recognized over the last 20-30 years, but they are seldom considered in the evaluation of quantitative tsunami impact or in the design of warning strategies.\nThis study aims to investigate the slope stability of the SMFs in the NE Atlantic, their companion tsunami and the associated hazard at the target coasts. It focuses on two major deep-water seamounts of the NE Atlantic, the Gorringe Bank and the Hirondelle, where evidences of large SMFs have been found.\nSlope stability analysis is often based on relationships between landslides and earthquakes. Here, within each considered seamount, slope failure potential is investigated through the pseudo-static method. This analysis allows establishing a relationship between the size of the SMF and the critical earthquake peak ground acceleration necessary to initiate it and therefore define the possible SMF scenarios. Numerical modelling of SMF-induced tsunami generation is then employed to test the tsunamigenic potential of each defined scenario. It is performed using a multi-layers viscous shallow-water model, where the lower layer represents the deformable slide that is assumed to be a viscous-incompressible fluid, and bounded by the upper layer of seawater assumed to be inviscid and incompressible. The propagation of tsunami waves is simulated employing non-linear shallow water equations.\nResults are presented in terms of: 1) slope stability curves that establish the relationship between the probable earthquake magnitudes and the possible sizes of SMFs, 2) possible SMF scenarios within each seamount, 3) potential of tsunami generation for each SMF, 4) tsunami coastal impact at target coasts. Results show that SMFs in the NE Atlantic have the potential of generating large tsunamis with significant impact along the surrounding coasts. Therefore, more attention must be accorded to deep-water submarine landslides-induced tsunamis in marine geo-hazards assessment at the region. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 603839 (Project ASTARTE - Assessment, Strategy and Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe).",

It is important to study the effect of Ni together with light elements on the elastic properties, such as sound velocity, of liquid Fe to give a constraint on the core composition. In this study, we have measured the compressional wave velocity (VP) of liquid Fe–Ni and Fe–Ni–C up to 6.6 GPa and estimated the effect of pressure on the and alloying elements (Ni and C) on the VP of liquid Fe-alloys.\nHigh-pressure experiments were carried out using 1500 ton Kawai-type multi-anvil press at BL04B1 beamline, SPring-8 synchrotron facility. VP was measured using pulse-echo overlap method. Used sample compositions were Fe-10wt%Ni and Fe-10wt%-4wt%C.\nThe obtained VP of liquid Fe–Ni was approximately 2%–3% smaller than that of liquid Fe. Thus, alloying with 10 wt% of Ni slightly reduces the VP of liquid Fe, whereas alloying with C is likely to increase the VP. The compressibility and density of liquid Fe–Ni and Fe–Ni–C were estimated from the measured VP data combined with the equation of state. In the relation between the density (r) and sound velocity (VP), it was found that the effect of C on the VP and r values was opposite to that of Ni at the lunar core condition (~ 5 GPa). This result gives an important constraint for estimating the light element in the lunar core by comparing with lunar seismic data.",

            "abstract": "The Last Glacial Maximum represents the most recent major sea level low stand in Earth history. Such changes in eustatic sea level impacted the oxygenation of marine basins, yet the characteristics and mechanisms of those impacts remain poorly known. Specific basin conditions are needed to develop, record, and preserve those paleoredox changes through time most effectively, including rapid sedimentation rates and silled basin morphologies. The anoxic Alfonso Basin, partially separated from the Gulf of California by a bathymetric sill, is such a place. The basin is located in a dry semiarid region dominated by dust inputs and only occasional tropical cyclone-induced fluvial contributions. We present the first multi-proxy reconstruction of southern Gulf of California paleoredox that covers an uninterrupted timespan from the Late Pleistocene to the present, with an emphasis on the Last Glacial Maximum. In this research we contrast geochemical data from a 47-meter-long sediment core (collected with the giant CALYPSO corer aboard the R/V Marion Dufresne) with the solid phase and pore water chemical data from a shorter but very detailed box core (collected on the R/V El Puma), both from Alfonso Basin. Our results show that during the Late Pleistocene and throughout the Holocene several paleoredox shifts occurred, often accompanied by differences in lamination (laminated/massive alternations) and trace element (Mo, V, U) compositions; detailed Fe chemistry (FeHR/FeTand Fe/Al ratios); as well as carbon and sulfur concentrations and isotope ratios. For example, FeHR/FeT ratios indicate values of roughly 0.15 during the Last Glacial Maximum (lower than theoretic threshold of 0.2 between oxic and anoxic), suggesting more oxic conditions, in comparison to 0.25 and higher in the Holocene. Most of the variability seen in these proxies is related to global sea level change, while some variability is instead related to local variations in paleoproductivity, often connected to varying aeolian supply of micronutrients through mineral dust. Our results also provide insights into microbially mediated diagenetic processes in Alfonso Basin and related impacts on paleoenvironmental proxies revealed by dissolved Fe and Mn in pore waters, as well as labile (oxyhydroxide) Fe fractions in the solid phase, among other indicators.",

Traditional methods (e.g. mercury intrusion, porosimetry, and pressure pulse) can effectively determine the parameters of pore and fracture for high-permeability rocks. However, these methods tend to fail for low-permeability rocks, especially quartz sandstone and granite. Thus, this work presented a novel method to determine the parameters of pore and fracture by analyzing the digital image of the casting thin sections under a microscope. Firstly, the size of representative elementary image was obtained by calculating pore parameters of different scales of samples. Then the method based on representative elementary image analyzed the casting thin sections of sandstone with low permeability, low anisotropy, and high water-binding capacity, and determined the parameters such as porosity, round-hole rate, roundness. Besides, this method analyzed the casting thin sections of low-permeability granite from Beishan, Gansu, China to determine more parameters such as fracture rate, length-width ratio of fracture, direction angle, and roundness. Finally, these parameters determined by the method were compared with those by transient pressure pulse method. The comparison demonstrated that the presented method can determine more high-accuracy parameters than transient pressure pulse method.\nKey words: digital image analysis, casting thin sections, pore, fracture, parameters analysis",

In this study simple and efficient implementation of fast marching method is presented. This method provides more information than ray tracing and is much less complicated than methods like full waveform being the perfect compromise.

            "abstract": "Estimating the resonance frequency and amplification factor of unconsolidated sediments by H/V spectral ratio (HVSR) analysis of seismic ambient noise has been widely used since Nakamura’s proposal in 1989. The fundamental frequency (f0) usually correlates well with the thickness of unconsolidated sediments above the bedrock. To measure f0 properly, Nakamura suggested to perform microzonation surveys at night when the artificial microtremor is small and does not fully disrupt the ambient seismic noise. As nightly fieldwork is not always a reasonable demand, we propose an alternative workflow of Nakamura’s technique to improve the quality of HVSR results obtained by ambient noise measurements of mobile stations during the day.\nThis new workflow includes the automated H/V calculation of one year of continuous seismic data of a stationary/permanent station located nearby the sites selected for microzonation. By means of an automated python script, the daily, weekly, monthly and seasonally variations of the fundamental frequency and the H/V amplitude at the site where the stationary station is installed are evaluated. Continuous HVSR analysis of sites with constant bedrock depth shows that the changes in the determined f0 and H/V amplitude are dominantly caused by the human behaviour which is stored in the ambient seismic noise (e.g. later onset of traffic in a weekend, quiet Sundays, differences between daily/nightly activity,…). This continuous analysis allows the characterisation of the deviation of the measured f0 to the true f0 throughout the whole year! Consequently, as mobile stations are affected by the same variation of the ambient noise, a correction factor can be applied on the calculated f0 of individual measurements during the microzonation survey and a proper Vs can be estimated.\nIn this presentation, we apply this workflow to two different case studies; i.e. a rural site with a shallow bedrock depth of 30 m and an urban site (Brussels, capital of Belgium, bedrock depth of 110 m) where human activity is continuous 24h/day. Our results show that microzonation with mobile stations should always be accompanied by a stationary seismic station to control the error.",

It is essential that all production and loss pathways of OH are understood and included in computer models in order to accurately predict OH concentrations for a range of environments, and in turn the rate of production of secondary products, for example ozone and organic aerosol. Direct measurement of total OH reactivity, the pseudo first order rate coefficient for OH loss by reaction with its sinks, is a very useful tool to test how complete our knowledge is of OH loss pathways. Comparison with values of total OH reactivity calculated by computer models using concentrations of simultaneously measured OH ‘sinks’ and unmeasured intermediates enables environments to be identified where there are unidentified ‘missing’ OH sinks. Total OH reactivity was measured using the laser flash photolysis combined with time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence technique during the ICOZA (Integrated Chemistry of OZone in the Atmosphere) campaign in July 2015 at the Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory (WAO), Norfolk, UK. Air masses sampled ranged from polluted air from the UK or Europe containing processed urban emissions to very clean air of marine origin. Data for measured and calculated OH reactivity will be presented in addition to a discussion of the magnitude of the ‘missing’ OH sink determined for each type of air mass.",

            "abstract": "It is well understood that grain boundaries influence many key physicochemical properties of crystalline materials and earth materials are no exception to this. Grain boundaries in the mineral olivine have reshaped our understanding of geophysical processes in the earth’s mantle, e.g. in form of enhanced element transport through grain boundary diffusion. Investigations of the relation between transport rate, energy and geometry of individual grain boundaries is compulsory to understand transport in aggregates with a lattice preferred orientation (LPO) that favours the presence and or alignment of specific grain boundaries over random grain boundaries in an undeformed rock. In this contribution, we perform classical molecular dynamics simulations of a series of symmetric and one asymmetric tilt grain boundaries of Mg2SiO4 (forsterite), ranging from 9.58° to 90° in misorientation and varying surface termination (see 1). Our emphasis lies on unravelling structural characteristics of high and low angle grain boundaries and how these influence grain boundary energy and self-diffusion processes. To obtain diffusion rates for different grain boundary geometries, we equilibrate the respective grain boundary systems at ambient pressure and temperatures from 1900-2200K and trace their evolution for run durations of more than100 ps. Subsequently, we track the mean square displacement of the different atomic species within the grain boundary layer over time to estimate self-diffusion constants for each grain boundary geometry and temperature. First results suggest that diffusion rates decrease with increasing grain boundary energy. We will discuss these results in the light of recent experimental data and show strength and limitations of the method applied.\n1.

            "abstract": "The South China continental margin is characterized by a widespread magmatic belt, prominent NE-striking faults and numerous rifted basins filled by Cretaceous-Eocene sediments. The geology denotes a transition from active to passive margin, which led to rapid modifications of crustal stress configuration and reactivation of older faults in this area.\nOur zircon fission-track data in this region show two episodes of exhumation: The first episode, occurring during 170–120Ma, affected local parts of the Nanling Range. The second episode, a more regional exhumation event, occurred during 115-70Ma, including the Yunkai Terrane and the Nanling Range.\nNumerical geodynamic modeling was conducted to simulate the subduction between the paleo-Pacific plate and the South China Block. The modeling results could explain the fact that exhumation of the granite-dominant Nanling Range occurred earlier than that of the gneiss-dominant Yunkai Terrane. In addition to the difference in rock types, the heat from Jurassic-Early Cretaceous magmatism in Nanling may have softened the upper crust, causing the area to exhume more readily than Yunkai.\nNumerical modeling results also indicate that (1) high lithospheric geothermal gradient, high slab dip angle and low convergence velocity favor the reversal of crustal stress state from compression to extension in the upper continental plate; (2) late Mesozoic magmatism in South China was probably caused by a slab roll-back; and (3) crustal extension could have occurred prior to the cessation of plate subduction. The inversion of stress regime in the continental crust from compression to crustal extension imply that the Late Cretaceous-early Paleogene red-bed basins in South China could have formed during the late stage of the subduction, accounting for the occurrence of volcanic events in some sedimentary basins. We propose that the rifting started as early as Late Cretaceous, probably before the cessation of subduction process.",

            "abstract": "The Costa Rica subduction zone offshore Osa Peninsula is known as an erosive margin with active seismicity and the subduction of the Cocos Ridge. One of the major unknowns in this margin is the nature of the unconformity at the base of the slope sediments in the upper plate and the high velocity materials below. To investigate the geologic processes across the unconformity, we examined the consolidation state and mineral assemblages of the sediments at the mid-slope Site 1380 drilled during IODP Expedition 344 by conducting microstructural observation, particle size analysis, X-ray fluorescence/diffraction analysis and resistivity measurement.\nThe general compaction trend is controlled primarily by grain-size sorting and the physical property transition is likely caused by massive sediment removal under normal fault regime, thickness of which range between ~600-850 m determined from the composite porosity-depth curve. Across the unconformity between the late Pliocene~late Pleistocene silty clay (Unit 1) and late Pliocene~early Pleistocene clayey siltstone (Unit 2), the mineral/element components of the sediments is marked by the transitions in zeolite compositions; Unit 1 consists of laumontite and heulandite, whereas below the unconformity, Unit 2 sediments contain analcime, laumontite, and heulandite, but laumontite become less abundant at lower depth. The experienced temperature of the sediments in Unit 2 is estimated to have reached between ~86 and 122℃ as inferred from analcime burial diagenesis. This may correspond with the greater depth range prior to mass movement and normal faulting. The initial analcime burial diagenetic zone was likely cut off by the sediment removal across the unconformity, and later overprinted by high temperature fluid along the boundary forming laumontite and heulandite in the vicinity.\nThese results illustrate that ridge subduction has substantial potential to cause mass movement, an extensional stress regime, and fluid flow from depth.

Most research have focus on estimating water table fluctuations among various shallow aquifer resulting from recharge and discharge change, however, the methods commonly applied are limited in that the subsurface system is more complex. In this paper, a reliable approach based on statistics theory is presented for quantifying the correlation relationship among water table, rainfall events and groundwater depletion process. The detail monitoring data are used to multivariate regression analysis and established the relationship model between water table and groundwater depletion in the proposed method. We further employed the model to obtain water table fluctuation trend with manual controlled depletion in different rainfall conditions. We also identify how this model applied to North China Plain and examine the water table error. The results show that controlling the depletion process based on different rainfall frequency can promote groundwater table recover and the model can provide a reliable method to groundwater management.",

The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between archaeal isoprenoid (iso-) GDGTs and bacterial branched (br-) in the Pearl River estuary and coastal South China Sea. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) was collected using 0.7 µm- and 0.2 µm-filters in winter and summer of 2012. The results exhibited that 1) the abundance of phospho IP-isoGDGTs is lower than phospho IP-brGDGTs in different seasons, and 2) phospho IP-brGDGTs collected from 0.2 µm-filter in winter are significantly higher than the summer. Linear regression analysis showed that the abundance of phospho IP-isoGDGTs and phospho IP-brGDGTs are significantly correlated, suggesting that the source archaea of the isoGDGTs may have functional relationship with the brGDGT-producing bacteria in the study area. Furthermore, the seasonal highest abundances of iso- and br-GDGTs always occurred in the transitional zone between river and estuary, indicating that the transitional area is a highly productive environment for the GDGT-producing organisms.",

            "abstract": "Modelled direct radiative forcing of aerosol in global aerosol models varies between -0.06 to -0.49 W m-2 making it currently one of the most uncertain factor in climate change. The variance in aerosol direct radiative forcing is regionally even much larger indicating significantly different spatial difference in aerosol load. This can be seen in global maps of modeled aerosol optical depths (AOD). A significant fraction of aerosol optical depth comes from aerosol water which also varies significantly between different models. In this study, we investigate the reasons for these differences in the models. We investigate how differences in modeled aerosol composition, relative humidity, and size distribution contribute to differences in AOD and optical depth of aerosol water. We compared aerosol-climate model data for aerosol optical depth against those observed by Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on board of Terra and Aqua satellites. Modeled relative humidities were compared against observations from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) flying on board NASA's Aqua satellite and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data. According to preliminary results, modeled transport of aerosol has significant implications on zonal distribution of aerosol optical depth. Models that underestimate transport of aerosol towards poles also have lower AOD over high latitudes. The contribution of water to the AOD can be significantly higher in models with low poleward transport. However, it is not be sufficient to compensate low total aerosol optical depth.",

            "abstract": "The Indian monsoon shapes the livelihood of ca. 40% of world’s population. Despite dedicated efforts, comprehensive picture of monsoon variability has proved elusive largely due to the absence of long-term qualitative high-resolution record from key climatic zones and variability of monsoon with respect to various forcing mechanisms (e.g., solar insolation) and teleconnections (e.g., El Niño-Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole). In this study, high-resolution molecular (n-alkane) isotopic (δD and δ13C ratios) reconstruction of mid-late Holocene (~5.0 cal ka) climate has been undertaken using lacustrine sediments from two climatically sensitive regions; (i) Arid Banni grasslands, western India with dominant moisture source derived from Indian summer monsoon (June-September) and (ii) Semi-arid Ennamangalam lake, south India with significant fraction of rainfall received during winter period (October to December) from Northeast (NE) monsoon. The climate reconstruction from western India based on δDn-alkane values shows prevalence of intensified monsoon until ca. 3 cal ka followed by gradual decrease in the precipitation. In contrast, climate reconstruction from south India is characterized by more negative δDn-alkane (intensified precipitation) values during late Holocene (~2.5 cal ka). The compilation of paleoclimate records shows that the precipitation pattern in Banni region responded linearly to gradually changing insolation and additionally amplified by climate systems like ENSO. However, intensified monsoon in South India shows strengthened NE monsoonal precipitation during late Holocene. The spatial inhomogeneity in the palaeohydrological record can be attributed to the persistence of inverse relationship between summer and winter monsoon. In addition, strong positive correlation between δDn-alkane and δ13Cn-alkane values from both region shows that the relative abundance of C3-C4 plants in the contemporary ecosystems are governed by rainfall amount.",

However, no significant earthquake has occurred since 1964 M6.3 Baihe earthquake on this fault system. In this study, we therefore adopted the geodetic data from 109 campaign-mode GPS stations, 61 continuous GPS stations and 388 leveling benchmarks from 2002 to 2011 to comprehend the characteristics of modern crustal deformation in SW Taiwan. Horizontal and vertical velocities inferred from GPS and leveling data are relative to the Chinese continental margin. Horizontal velocities decrease, from SE to NW, from ~54 mm/yr to ~1 mm/yr. A significant shortening of ~15 mm/yr has been noticed between the Liuchia (west) and Chukou (East) faults. The vertical velocity field represents ~10 mm/yr east of the Liuchia fault with the maximum rate of ~12.5 mm/yr. The subsidence rates larger than 10 mm/yr in the westernmost coastal area, reflecting the effect of artificial groundwater withdrawal. To estimate the slip rates on faults, we inverted the geodetic data using a 2D elastic kinematic fault model. We assumed a fault system comprising a creeping décollement and several branched faults locked near the surface in an elastic half space. The fault slip rates are estimated by least squares, while the optimized fault geometries and locking depths are searched by the Monte-Carlo inversion. Based on our optimal model, the probability to generate the next large earthquake on the branched active faults in SW Taiwan is low. However, this high strain accumulation may be released by the future earthquakes on the deep buried faults or by the transient slip events on the décollement.",

            "abstract": "In numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models, substantial efforts have been dedicated to the modeling of natural and ocean surfaces at the expense of lake surfaces. The increase of horizontal resolution of these models allow now to resolve smaller lakes. For that reason, accounting for lakes in modeling systems, has become challenging, especially in regions where lake fraction is high. The lake model FLake (Mironov, 2010) implemented in the surface modeling platform SURFEX (Masson et al., 2014) was first set up off-line at global scale driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis to estimate the best configuration of parameters such as lake depth and extinction coefficient of light, albedo of water, ice and snow. The 30-yr off-line simulations were evaluated for the biggest lakes against satellite surface temperature, freeze-up and break-up periods derived from ARC-Lake products. To assess the impact of lakes in the French CNRM-CM GCM, two global coupled simulations were performed, one with FLake model activated and the second where lakes were replaced by land. Results highlight a regional impact caused by the presence of lakes. Particularly a strong cooling and moistening effect in summertime in the lake vicinity is exhibited, with a direct impact on surface fluxes: stronger latent heat flux due to moister air, lower sensible heat flux due to thermal effects and stronger momentum flux caused by roughness effects.",

            "abstract": "This study will develop a numerical model to characterize the perturbation of local groundwater systems by underground tunnel construction. Tunnels and other underground spaces act as conduits that remove water from the surrounding aquifer, and may lead to drawdown of the water table. Significant declines in water table elevation can cause environmental impacts by altering root zone soil moisture and changing inflows to surface waters. Currently, it is common to use analytical solutions to estimate groundwater fluxes through tunnel walls. However, these solutions often neglect spatial and temporal heterogeneity in aquifer parameters and system stresses. Some heterogeneous parameters, such as fracture densities, can significantly affect tunnel inflows. This study will focus on numerical approaches that incorporate heterogeneity across a range of scales. Time-dependent simulations will be undertaken to compute drawdown at various stages of excavation, and to model water table recovery after low-conductivity liners are applied to the tunnel walls. This approach will assist planners in anticipating environmental impacts to local surface waters and vegetation, and in computing the amount of tunnel inflow reduction required to meet environmental targets. The authors will also focus on managing uncertainty in model parameters. For greater planning applicability, extremes of a priori parameter ranges will be explored in order to anticipate best- and worst-case scenarios. For calibration and verification purposes, the model will be applied to a completed tunnel project in Mount Mingtang, China, where tunnel inflows were recorded throughout the construction process.",

            "abstract": "Subduction and recycling of oceanic crust entrained in adiabatic upwelling mantle causes complex heterogeneities, chemically and physically [1-3]. Yet, the creation of such heterogeneites, and their impact on magmatism remain poorly constrained.\nThe model presented here assumes the presence of widely dispersed bodies of residual eclogites with varying bulk CaO/Na2O ratios, stirred by convection in the mantle. We examine the effects of such heterogeneities in eclogites on melting and phase relations, and on density and seismic velocity relations in mantle adiabatically upwelling from ~160 to ~90 km depth.\nRes2 [1] is the melting residue of a model altered MORB GA2 [2] at 5 GPa, following loss of a siliceous melt fraction during upwelling. Res3 is similar to Res2 (CaO/Na2O=4) but has a higher CaO/Na2O ratio (12).\nThe subsolidus phases are garnet, clinopyroxene and minor quartz/coesite. The Res2 solidus is at 1210±15°C at 3 GPa, 1375±25°C at 4 GPa, and 1410±15°C at 5 GPa [1]. The Res3 solidus is similar, but slightly higher in temperature than that of Res2 at 3 GPa, 1260±15°C.\nAlong a near-adiabatic path of Tp≈1360°C, the eclogites start to melt at higher pressure than ambient ‘dry’ mantle owing to the lower solidus of the former. The relative slopes of the adiabat and eclogitic solidus ensure self-fluxing continuous melting, caused by continuous exsolution of SiO2 out of clinopyroxene during adiabatic ascent.\nAt 5 GPa, near-solidus andesitic Res3 melts (~10%) are much less siliceous and sodic, more calcic and have higher Mg# than Res2 incipient dacitic melts (<5%). During further upwelling to 3 GPa, as eclogitic melt fractions increase, they become basaltic, and cotectics control melt compositions.\nSiliceous eclogitic melts formed will react out of existence with peridotitic mantle, effectively refertilising it and producing hybrid, pyroxene and garnet-rich rocks [3]. As eclogitic melts differ, a variety of refertilisied, hybrid mantle rocks are formed along adiabatic paths [1, this study]. Densities and seismic velocities of eclogitic residues also differ during upwelling.\nSubsequent melting of these sources may lead to compositional diversity in volcanic rocks.\n[1] Rosenthal et al.

            "abstract": "Providing natural hazards scientists the opportunity to question and engage directly with journalists in a workshop setting proved effective at shifting scientists’ attitudes on their role in media and public communication during natural disasters. Scientists surveyed after the encounter expressed a more responsive attitude to communicating during crises, increased willingness to support scientific peers’ communication efforts and more realistic perspectives on journalists’ needs and objectives. Geoscientists experienced unprecedented and intensive media and public scrutiny during the Canterbury, New Zealand earthquakes of 2010-2012. Following major quakes and aftershocks, there was a sustained high level of public demand for information and expert analysis of the underlying geological events and ongoing hazards and risks. Once the crisis ended, a period of reflection gave rise to understanding of the need for further media and communication training amongst natural hazards scientists. A workshop designed to explore scientists’ attitudes to public communication during disasters and challenge their views on media, press offices and the expectations of the public was developed and implemented by the Science Media Centre, New Zealand and Massey University. This research was developed as an evaluation of this workshop.\nQuantitative analysis with some qualititive analysis were the methods used.\nSome findings include:\na shift in how journalists were perceived by scientists after the workshop, largely influenced by perspectives shared during a panel where invited journalists reflected on their own experiences and answered questions from scientists.\ndiscussions on different spokespeople from different science institutions contributing to the public discussion showed a change in perception from a preference for one central spokesperson to increased support for a variety of perspectives from multiple scientists. This was influenced by insight provided by journalists during the workshop into the practical demands of media and the need for multiple voices in media coverage.\nchanges in how they would manage media queries, as well as a shift from passive to responsive attitudes towards communicating in crises.",

In recent years, efforts were made to create RSL databases following a standardized methodology. These regional databases provided a framework for developing our understanding of the primary mechanisms of RSL change since the Last Glacial Maximum and a long-term baseline against which to gauge changes in sea-level during the 20th century and forecasts for the 21st.\nHere we present two quality-controlled Holocene RSL database compiled for North America. Along the Pacific coast of North America (British Columbia, Canada to California, USA), our re-evaluation of sea-level indicators from geological and archaeological investigations yield 841 RSL data-points mainly from salt and freshwater wetlands or adjacent estuarine sediment as well as from isolation basin. Along the Atlantic coast of North America (Hudson Bay, Canada to South Carolina, USA), we are currently compiling a database including more than 2000 RSL data-points from isolation basin, salt and freshwater wetlands, beach ridges and intratidal deposits. We outline the difficulties and solutions we made to compile databases in such different depostional environment. We address complex tectonics and the framework to compare such large variability of RSL data-point. We discuss the implications of our results for the glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) models in the two studied regions.",

            "abstract": "Now that evasion of carbon dioxide (CO2) from inland waters is accounted for in global carbon models, it is crucial to quantify how these fluxes have changed in the past and forecast how they may alter in response to future local and global change.\nHere, we developed a sediment proxy for the concentration of summer surface dissolved CO2 concentration and used it to reconstruct changes over the past 150 years for three large lakes that have been affected by climate warming, changes in nutrient load and detrital terrigenous supplies. Initially CO2-neutral to the atmosphere, all three lakes subsequently fluctuated between near-equilibrium and supersaturation. Although catchment inputs have supplied CO2 to the lakes, internal processes have ultimately regulated decadal changes in lake surface CO2 concentration. Nutrient concentration has been the dominant driver of CO2 variability for a century although the reproducible, non-monotonic relationship of CO2 to nutrient concentration suggests the interplay between metabolic and chemical processes. Yet, for two of these lakes, climatic control of CO2 concentrations has been important over the last 30 years, promoting higher surface CO2 concentrations, likely by decreasing hypolimnetic carbon storage. This perspective challenges current knowledge on the processes and environmental drivers of variability in long-term CO2 concentrations in lakes.",

            "abstract": "In the mid-latitudes the seasonal predictability has been known to be low to moderate. However, significant predictive skill for the mean winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) has been recently reported for a number of different seasonal forecasting systems [e.g., Riddle et al. (2013), Scaife et al. (2014), Stockdale et al. (2015)]. Here we present results from a multi-system analysis, including CFSv2 (24 members), UKMO (24 members) and CMCC (9 members) seasonal prediction systems. For their common hindcast period (1997–2011) the skill for the NAO/AO reaches as high as +0.85 for the multi-system ensemble mean. Certainly, part of the skill increase in respect to the individual systems is related to the larger size of the multi-system ensemble, though blending different systems together may bring additional improvements since each system benefits differently from the various sources of natural seasonal predictability. Therefore, initiatives similar to the North American Multi-Model Ensemble can bring added value to seasonal predictions even if individual systems —sooner or later— exploit all their potential skill by increasing their ensemble size. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the NAO skill actually translates to better predictions of near-surface air temperature and precipitation anomalies in the domain influenced by the NAO (lower root-mean square errors and higher spatial correlation in respect to the corresponding observed anomalies).",

            "abstract": "Geoid anomalies are essential tools for the understanding of mantle density distribution and of the patterns of convection. Previous wavelet analyses of the geoid revealed the existence of density anomalies in the deep mantle linked to the long-term volcanic activity of the Central Pacific (Cadio et al., 2011). The South Atlantic displays geodynamic characteristics similar to those of French Polynesia: long lasting volcanic activity, dating back to the opening of the Atlantic; wide area covered by volcanic edifices and seamount chains; irregularity of age patterns and a broad regional depth anomaly. Preliminary wavelet analyses of the geoid anomalies in this area revealed strong correlation with deep velocity anomalies from different tomographic models. However, here, the lithospheric signal linked to the ocean basin and continents must be estimated because it contributes to long wavelengths in geoid spectrum. We tested different lithospheric models in order to estimate this contribution. At intermediate and long wavelengths, the residual geoid confirms the existence of density anomalies in the mantle correlated with the surface expression of the volcanism.\nCadio, C., I. Panet, A.

It is based on state of the art and well maintained Python modules, among which ObsPy plays an important role. To our knowledge, it is officially used for continuous monitoring at least in three notable places: the Observatory of the Piton de la Fournaise volcano (OVPF, France), the Auckland Volcanic Field (New Zealand) and on the South Napa earthquake (Berkeley, USA). It is also used by many researchers to process archive data, e.g. focussing on fault zones, intraplate Europe, geothermal exploitations or Antarctica.\nWe first present the general working of MSNoise, originally written in 2010 to automatically scan data archives and process seismic data in order to produce dv/v time series. We demonstrate that its modularity provides a new potential to easily test new algorithms for each processing step. For example, to experiment new methods of cross-correlation (done by default in the frequency domain), stacking (default is linear stacking, averaging), or dt/t or dv/v estimation (default is moving window cross-spectrum \"MWCS\", so-called \"doublet\"), etc.\nFinally, we present the last major evolution of MSNoise, from a \"single workflow: data archive to dv/v\" to a framework system that allows plugins and modules to be developed and integrated into the MSNoise ecosystem. Examples of plugins in development such as continuous PPSD (à la McNamarra & Buland) or continuous RSAM/SSAM (Endo & Murray, Stephens) will be presented.",

Forecasting solar photospheric magnetic field using the solar flux transport (SFT) model can achieve an acceptable match to the actual field. The observations from ground-based or spacecraft instruments can be assimilated to update the modeled flux. The local ensemble Kalman filtering (LEnKF) method is utilized to improve forecasts and characterize their uncertainty by propagating the SFT model with different model parameters forward in time to control the evolution of the solar photospheric magnetic field. Optimal assimilation of measured data into the ensemble produces an improvement in the fit of the forecast to the actual field.

The elevated Δ17O of atmospheric NO3- is due to oxidation with ozone. We analyzed the isotope composition of NO3- in weekly precipitation samples from 8 NADP/USNIP sites in the northwestern US between 1997-2004. Each site exhibits annual variation with lowest Δ17O during summer and highest Δ17O during winter. WA24 and WA19 exhibited the greatest (14.0‰) and least (8.9‰) annual variation, respectively.\nThis significant and variable amount of seasonal change motivated analyzing drivers of this variability. Potential factors that influence Δ17O were evaluated with linear regression. Meteorological variables were tested which may account for inter-week variation. Measures of fire activity were included for effects on atmospheric oxidation. Lastly, NADP ion concentrations were used as potential indicators of marine influence which could introduce halogen chemistry and alter oxidation.\nTemperature was the only variable to significantly correlate with Δ17O at all sites (P<0.0001 at ID11 to P=0.05 at WA98). Fire activity (number of fires, area burned) significantly correlated with Δ17O at 4 of 8 sites (p<0.05) and suggested potential influence at 3 additional sites (0.1> P >0.05). No potential indicators of marine influence showed a relationship with Δ17O at coastal sites (WA19 and WA98), but there was a significant relationship between concentrations of Na and Cl with Δ17O at UT01 site which is influenced by the Great Salt Lake. Overall, temperature and fire activity best explain variability in the Δ17O of NO3- in the northwestern US.\nUnderstanding this variability is crucial to correctly attribute NO3- sources in ecological studies between biological and atmospheric inputs in mixing models. Incorrect accounting of variability leads to unnecessary error and incorrect identification of NO3- sources in these systems.",

This is definitively the case for earthquakes occurring at active continental margins were thin oceanic crust subducts below thick continental crust and hence large lateral changes in crustal thickness occur as a function of distance to the deep-sea trench. Here, we conducted a case study of the 2002 Mw 6.4 Osa thrust earthquake in Costa Rica that was followed by an aftershock sequence. Initial relocations indicated that the main shock occurred fairly trenchward of most large earthquakes along the Middle America Trench off central Costa Rica. The earthquake sequence occurred while a temporary network of ocean-bottom-hydrophones and land stations 80 km to the northwest were deployed. By adding readings from permanent Costa Rican stations, we obtain uncommon P wave coverage of a large subduction zone earthquake. We relocated this catalog using a nonlinear probabilistic approach using a 1-D and two 3-D P-wave velocity models. The 3-D model was either derived from 3-D tomography based on onshore stations and a priori model based on seismic refraction data. All epicentres occurred close to the trench axis, but depth estimates vary by several tens of kilometres. Based on the epicentres and constraints from seismic reflection data the main shock occurred 25 km from the trench and probably along the plate interface at 5-10 km depth. The source location that agreed best with the geology was based on the 3-D velocity model derived from a priori data. Aftershocks propagated downdip to the area of a 1999 Mw 6.9 sequence and partially overlapped it. The results indicate that underthrusting of the young and buoyant Cocos Ridge has created conditions for interpolate seismogenesis shallower and closer to the trench axis than elsewhere along the central Costa Rica margin.",

Urbanization in such areas and stormwater management strategies enhancing infiltration have the potential to alter the infiltration rates and the subsurface water storage dynamics with consequences for the residence time of the water and nutrient transformations prior their discharge into receiving SW drains. Identifying first order control on the above processes will assist the improvement of assessment tools for better urban development. This work presents findings on the hydrodynamics of the GW-SW water exchange in two drains of the Perth Coastal Plain area (Western Australia, Australia) impacted by a SWT developing on a layered variable texture soil: a peri-urban drain and a restored living stream drain in urban residential area. A multi-technique approach was used to investigate water mass balance and fluxes over a reach scale and involved continuous records of hydrometric data for GW-SW interactions, passive tracers for water pathway identification, pore water temperature for vertical water exchange, and differential SW discharge using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. Results highlighted differences in the GW-SW interactions between both drains under stormflow and baseflow conditions. A substantial increase of GW discharge into the drain coincided with the full development of a SWT over a seasonal scale at the peri-urban drain, which suggests a more natural water infiltration and redistribution in the subsurface. In contrast, a large volume of infiltrated rain water was discharged into the living stream over a period of few weeks regardless of the development of the surrounding SWT, which suggests the influence of underground pipe system in water redistribution. The results contributed to identify key physical parameters to define urban typologies, quantify the subsurface storage discharge and residence time, and finally assess the transport and transformations of nutrients using a generalised Damköhler number. Future work will populate the framework with other study cases.",

Nevertheless a cost-benefit analysis as well as application and dissemination of such tools are proposed too.\nAt the same time, the CGIAM contributes to the definition of experimental installation and use of a Simplified Accelerometric Monitoring Network for school buildings comprehensive of testing phase on a limited number of structures.\nThe work proposes a synthetic overview of the employed methodologies as well as the first results arising from the research and implementation activities.",

To do that, we have developed an app IFEQ on smartphone based on the APIs provided by the J-SHIS that is an integrated system of Seismic Hazard Assessment. IFEQ can simulate a real situation of earthquake disaster you might experience at current spot. The hint of the IFEQ came from a question “What should I do IF a big EarthQuake hit now?”\nAn earthquake risk situation is estimated by a location information that is acquired from GPS, the detail comprehensive information of a 250m mesh obtained through J-SHIS APIs by the geomorphological classification and a probability of intensity 6 lower (JMA) within 30 years. A user’s photo was displayed with a risk situation surrounded by simply one touch.\nIFEQ helps oneself to overcome a gap between exist scenes and a horrible disaster by enhancing imagination. The results show people have more ideas to handle with the risk situation after using the App IFEQ.\nIFEQ App’s features are summarized as below:\n1. Visualizing an image photo with possible risks from a coming earthquake at present spot.\n2. Displaying an exceedance probability within 30-years and a maximum seismic intensity within 10,000-years on present location.\n3. User can obtain some advices of how to prepare for possible risks.\n4. A risk with five ranks is given, especially for items of Building Collapse, Liquefaction and Landslide.\nIFEQ can be downloaded freely from http://www.j-shis.bosai.go.jp/app-ifearthquake\nJ-SHIS APIs can be obtained from http://www.j-shis.bosai.go.jp/en/category/opencat/api",

            "abstract": "The present study investigates the use of long-term satellite data to assess the influence of aerosols upon cloud parameters over the Baltic Sea region. This particular area offers the contrast of a very clean environment (Fennoscandia) against a more polluted one (Germany, Poland).\nThe datasets used in this study consist of Collection 6 Level 3 daily observations from 2002 to 2014 retrieved from observations by the NASA’s Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instrument on-board the Aqua platform. The MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol index (AI) products are used as a proxy for the number concentration of aerosol particles while the cloud effective radius (CER) and cloud optical thickness (COT) describe cloud microphysical and optical properties respectively. Through the analysis of a 12-years dataset, distribution maps provide information on a regional scale about the first aerosol indirect effect (AIE) by determining the aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI). The ACI is defined as the change in cloud optical depth or effective radius as a function of aerosol load, for which AI is used as a proxy, for a fixed liquid water path (LWP).\nReanalysis data from ECMWF, namely ERA-Interim, are used to estimate meteorological settings on a regional scale. The relative humidity (RH) and specific humidity (SH) are chosen at the pressure level of 950 hPa and they are linearly interpolated to match MODIS resolution of 1 x 1 deg. The Lower Tropospheric Stability (LTS) is computed from the ERA- Interim reanalysis data as the difference between the potential temperature at 700hPa and the surface.\nIn order to better identify and interpret the AIE, this study proposes a framework where the interactions between aerosols and clouds are estimated by dividing the dataset into different regimes. Regimes are defined by:\nLiquid Water Path (LWP). The discrimination by LWP allows assessing the Twomey effect. The AIE is more evident when the LWP is lower.\nAerosol loading (both AOD and AI). Separated aerosol settings (AI/AOD <25th percentile versus AI/AOD > 75th percentile) provide information regarding the saturation effect.\nMeteorological environments. LTS determines an unstable thermodynamic environment (LTS <25th percentile) and a stable one ( LTS >75th percentile).",

            "abstract": "The earth’s crust can be divided into the brittle upper crust and the ductile lower crust based on the deformation mechanism. Observations shows heterogeneities in the lower crust are associated with fault zones.\nOne of the candidate mechanisms of strain concentration is shear heating in the lower crust, which is considered by theoretical studies for interplate faults [e.g. Thatcher & England 1998, Takeuchi & Fialko 2012].\nOn the other hand, almost no studies has been done for intraplate faults, which are generally much immature than interplate faults and characterized by their finite lengths and slow displacement rates.\nTo understand the structural characteristics in the lower crust and its temporal evolution in a geological time scale, we conduct a 2-D numerical experiment on the intraplate strike slip fault.\nThe lower crust is modeled as a 20km thick viscous layer overlain by rigid upper crust that has a steady relative motion across a vertical strike slip fault. Strain rate in the lower crust is assumed to be a sum of dislocation creep and diffusion creep components, each of which flows the experimental flow laws. The geothermal gradient is assumed to be 25K/km. We have tested different total velocity on the model. For intraplate fault, the total velocity is less than 1mm/yr, and for comparison, we use 30mm/yr for interplate faults.\nResults show that at a low slip rate condition, dislocation creep dominates in the shear zone near the intraplate fault’s deeper extension while diffusion creep dominates outside the shear zone. This result is different from the case of interplate faults, where dislocation creep dominates the whole region. Because of the power law effect of dislocation creep, the effective viscosity in the shear zone under intraplate faults is much higher than that under the interplate fault, therefore, shear zone under intraplate faults will have a much higher viscosity and lower shear stress than the intraplate fault. Viscosity contract between inside and outside of the shear zone is smaller under an intraplate situation than in the interplate one, and smaller viscosity difference will result in a wider shear zone.",

First, we simulate the formation\nof a stable magnetic flux rope in the corona starting from a sheared magnetic\nbipolar arcade driven by shearing and converging flows at the bottom, using\nisothermal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) modeling including gravity. Second, we\nfill the magnetic flux rope with hydrostatic plasma from chromosphere to corona\nand simulate a quiet sun in an equilibrium using full thermodynamic MHD\nwith anisotropic thermal conduction, optically thin radiative losses, and\nparameterized heating. Then, we add extra strong heating localized in two\ncircular regions covering chromospheric foot points of the flux rope. As the\nplasma is evaporated into corona, the lower part of the flux rope evolve into\nthermally unstable situation due to dominative radiative losses, where multiple\nblobs and threads of condensations form and move continuously mainly along local\nmagnetic field. Some of the condensations fall down to chromosphere without support\nof magnetic dips near the foot region of the flux rope. Others linger in magnetic\ndips and descend slowly.

            "abstract": "To better understand the levels and trends of carbonaceous aerosol emissions and the resulting ambient concentrations in China, we update an emission inventory of anthropogenic organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) and employ existing observational studies to analyze characteristics of these aerosols including temporal and spatial distributions, and the levels and shares of secondary organic carbon (SOC) in total OC. We further use ground observations to test the levels and inter-annual trends of the calculated national and provincial emissions of carbonaceous aerosols. The national OC emissions are estimated to have increased 29% from 2000 (2127 Gg) to 2012 (2749 Gg) and EC by 37% (from 1356 to 1857 Gg). Updated emission factors based on the most recent local field measurements, particularly for biofuel stoves, lead to considerably lower emissions of OC compared to previous inventories. Compiling observational data across the country, higher concentrations of OC and EC are found in northern and inland cities, while SOC/OC ratios are found in southern cities, due to the joint effects of primary emissions and meteorology. Higher OC/EC ratios are estimated at rural and remote sites compared to urban ones, attributed to more emissions of OC from biofuel use, more biogenic emissions of volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors to SOC, and/or transport of aged aerosols. For most sites, smaller SOC/OC is found for cold seasons, particularly at rural and remote sites, attributed partly to weaker atmospheric oxidation and SOC formation in winter. Enhanced SOC formation from oxidization and anthropogenic activities like biomass combustion is judged to have crucial effects on severe haze events characterized by high particle concentrations. Several observational studies indicate an increasing trend in ambient OC/EC (but not in OC or EC individually) from 2000 to 2010, confirming increased atmospheric oxidation of OC across the country. Combining the results of emission estimation and observations, the improvement over prior emission inventories is indicated by inter-annual comparisons and correlation analysis. It is also indicated that the estimated growth in emissions might be faster than observed growth, and that some sources with high primary OC/EC like burning of biomass are still underestimated.",

As a school we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and the amount of waste we send to the local landfill. Over an academic year we produce approximately 27 metric tons of food waste. Our system processes the food waste to compost in 14 days and the compost is used by our primary school students in a organic farming project.\nThere are two areas of improvement: a) if the composting system becomes anaerobic, there is an odor problem that is noticed by the school community; we will be testing the use of a bio-filter to eliminate the odor problem and, b) we will be working with an equipment vendor from Australia to install an improved grease trap system. The grease and oil that is collected will be sold to a local company here in Hong Kong that processes used cooking oil for making biofuels. This system will include a two stage filtration system and a heated vessel for separating the oil from the waste water.\nThe third project will be to evaluate biodegradable cutlery for the compositing in the system. Currently, we use a significant quantity of non-biodegradable cutlery that is then thrown away after one use. Several local HK companies are selling biodegradable cutlery, but we need to evaluate the different products to determine which ones will work with our composting system. \nThe food waste composting project at ISF Academy demonstrates the commitment of the school community to a greener environment for HK, the above listed projects will improve the operation of the system.",

Zircon inclusions were extracted from within the rapakivi texture -forming alkali feldspar ovoids and compared to zircon from the groundmasses of respective samples.\nU-Pb SIMS-analysis reveals statistical differences in the mean 207Pb/206Pb ages of the inclusion zircon populations in two of the studied granites (1635±3 Ma, 2σ, n=15 and 1634±3 Ma, 2σ, n=22), when compared to the groundmass zircon (1628±3 Ma, 2σ, n=18 and 1628±3 Ma, 2σ, n=19 respectively). The pattern is similar in the third sample, but the populations have overlapping mean 207Pb/206Pb ages (ovoids: 1631±3 Ma, 2σ, n=18; groundmass: 1629±3 Ma, 2σ, n=18). The ovoid inclusion zircon with regular chondrite-normalized REE-patterns and oscillatory zoning textures (in BSE images interpreted as primary magmatic growth zoning) record higher Hf and U abundances than comparable zircon in the groundmass populations.\nThese observations suggest that earlier bulk sample zircon U-Pb analyses from the Wiborg batholith granites may have been substantially affected by entrained zircon populations and overestimated the actual intrusion ages of the rocks. The ovoid material crystallized at an earlier stage and was remobilized during a later emplacement stage that is registered by the groundmass zircon. The similarity of groundmass ages in all samples (c. 1628 Ma) may point to a relatively short period of intensive magmatism involved with the emplacement of the Wiborg batholith. Based on the zircon trace element data the first stage magmas were either more fractionated or generated by lower degrees of crustal partial melting than the magmas of the second stage.",

They could serve as H2O carriers in the upper mantle and transition zone in hydrous compositional systems. Due to the critical role of water in controlling silicate phase relations and physical properties of the upper mantle, the crystal structures and physical properties of DHMS have been extensively studied. We synthesized coexisting phases of OH-clinohumite and hydrous olivine in multi-anvil press (P = 12 GPa, T = 1523 K), at Bayerisches Geoinstitut, Germany. OH-chondrodite and OH-clinohumite were characterized by Raman, and their crystal structures were refined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). We also studied their thermal expansivities by single-crystal (XRD), and the elasticity of by Brillouin Spectroscopy. We further constrain on Systematic trends between H2O content and physical properties among dense hydrous magnesium silicate (DHMS) phases along the forsterite-brucite join, such as thermal expansivity, compressibility, elasticity, as well as grüneisen parameters. This study suggests that hydrogen has significant effect on the physical properties of the upper mantle, and understanding the physical and chemical behaviors of DHMS phases is important for the study of water cycling in the mantle.",

            "abstract": "Visibility degradation due to fog can be very hazardous both to ground transportation and aviation traffic. However, prediction of fog using numerical models is difficult because fog formation is usually determined by local meteorological conditions that are hard to be measured and modeled with sufficient resolution. For this reason, there have been several attempts to build a coupled system of a fine resolution 1D model and a 3D mesoscale model with a usual grid resolution. In this study we uses the coupled system of the 1D PAFOG model and the 3D WRF model to simulate fogs formed at a southern coastal region of Korea, where the National Center for Intensive Observation of Severe Weather (NCIO) is located. Unique to NCIO is that it has a 300 m meteorological tower on which some basic meteorological variables (temperature, dew point temperature and winds) are measured at eleven different altitudes. In addition comprehensive cloud physics measurements are made with various remote sensing instruments such as cloud radar, wind profiler, microwave radiometer, micro rain radar. Several fog cases are identified during 2015 and will be simulated by the coupled system. The comprehensive set of measurement data from NCIO will be utilized as input to the model system and for evaluating the results. Particularly the data for initial and boundary conditions, which are tightly connected to the coupled model predictability, are extracted from the tower measurement. Furthermore, various sensitivity experiments will be done to enhance our understanding of the coastal fog formation mechanism. Detailed results will be discussed at the conference.",

            "abstract": "Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc) is an active volcanic complex covering a ~100 km² densely populated area in the western part of Naples (Italy) that is presently showing clear signs of unrest. Solfatara volcano, a tuff cone crater formed ~4000 yrs B.P. ago by phreato-magmatic eruptions represents the main degassing outflow of CFc. Magmatic gases which are exsolved from a ~8 km deep magmatic reservoir mix at 4 km depth with meteoric hydrothermal fluids then reach the surface in the Solfatara area. These hydrothermal and magmatic gases, mainly H2O and CO2, are released through both diffuse degassing structures and fumaroles.\nIn the frame of the MedSuv (Mediterranean Supervolcanoes) FP7 european project , we are performing a time-lapse electrical resistivity monitoring of an active degassing area of Solfatara. Using a 500-m-long cable and 48 electrodes, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is performed on a two-day basis since May 2013. The time-lapse inversion of the ERT gives an image of the temporal variations of resistivity up to 100 m depth that can be compared with the variations of ground deformation, CO2 flux, soil temperature and seismic ambient noise. Resistivity variations can originate from fluid composition, gas ratio and temperature. For example, the abrupt change of resistivity that was observed mid-2014 during a period of uplift and gas flux increase, could be associated with the rise of hydrothermal fluids.",

A first version of the map has been published and distributed eight years ago (WDMAM v1; Korhonen et al., 2007). We have produced a candidate which has been accepted as the second version of this map (WDMAM v2) at the International Union of Geophysics and Geodesy in Prag, in June 2015. On land, we adopted an alternative approach avoiding any unnecessary processing on existing aeromagnetic compilations. When available, we used the original aeromagnetic data. As a result the final compilation remains an acceptable representation of the national and international data grids. Over oceanic areas the marine data have been extended. In areas of insufficient data coverage, a model has been computed based on a modified digital grid of the oceanic lithosphere age, considering plate motions in the determination of magnetization vector directions. This model has been further adjusted to the available data, resulting in a better representation of the anomalies. The final grid will be periodically upgraded. Version 2.0 has been released and is available at wdmam.org to support both research and education projects. Colleagues willing to contribute data for future releases (and become a co-author of the map) should contact any of the authors or Jerome Dyment (chair of the WDMAM Task Force) at jdy@ipgp.fr .",

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) in northern forest soils is associated with a suite of minerals that can confer SOM stability, resulting in the potential for long-term storage of carbon. Increasingly, evidence is suggesting that SOM in certain mineral phases is dynamic and vulnerable to soil disturbance. The objective of this research was to investigate changes in a suite of mineral-associated pools of SOM through depth in a temperate forest soil to determine which mineral-associated carbon pools are most sensitive to forest harvesting disturbance. Sequential selective dissolutions representing increasingly stable SOM pools (soluble minerals (deionized water); humus-mineral complexes (Na-pyrophosphate); poorly crystalline minerals (HCl hydroxylamine); and crystalline secondary minerals (Na-dithionite + HCl)) of mineral soils through depth to 50 cm were carried out in podzolic soils sampled from temperate red spruce forests of contrasting stand age in Nova Scotia, Canada. Results of this analysis point to a loss of carbon from SOM within the B-horizon of the most recently harvested site from the pyrophosphate-extracted humus mineral complexed SOM, suggesting that it is this exchangeable pool that appears to be destabilized following clearcut harvesting at these study sites. This suggests that recovery from this landuse disturbance is dependent upon increasing storage of this SOM pool, and that mineral-associated pools, particularly pyrophosphate-extractable SOM, may be a useful indicator of changes to soil carbon storage following land use change.",

The observed seismicity in the Dead Sea basin was divided into 9 regions according to the spatial distribution of the earthquakes and the known tectonic features. The large number of recording stations and the good station distribution allowed the reliable determinations of 494 earthquake focal mechanisms. For each region, based on the inversion of the observed polarities of the earthquakes, we determine the focal mechanisms and the associated stress tensor. For 159 earthquakes out of the 494 mechanisms we could determine compatible fault planes. On the eastern side, the focal mechanisms are mainly strike-slip mechanism with nodal planes in the N-S and E-W directions. The azimuths of the stress axes are well constrained presenting minimal variability in the inversion of the data, which is in good agreement with the Arava fault on the eastern side of the Dead Sea basin and what we had expected from the regional geodynamics. However, larger variabilities of the azimuthal and dip angles are observed on the western side of the basin. Due to the wider range of azimuths of the fault planes, we observe the switching of sigma1 and sigma2 or the switching of sigma2 and sigma3as major horizontal stress directions. This observed switching of stress axes allows having dip-slip and normal mechanisms in a region that is dominated by strike-slip motion.",

            "abstract": "Results are presented of two large-eddy simulation (LES) runs of the entire year 2012 centered at the Cabauw observational supersite in the Netherlands. The LES is coupled to a regional weather model that provides the large-scale information. The simulations provide three-dimensional continuous time series of LES-generated turbulence and clouds, which can be compared in detail to the extensive observational dataset of Cabauw. The LES dataset is available from the authors on request.\nThis type of LES setup has a number of advantages. First, it can provide a more statistical approach to the study of turbulent atmospheric flow than the more common case studies, since a diverse but representative set of conditions is covered, including numerous transitions. This has advantages in the design and evaluation of parameterizations. Second, the setup can provide valuable information on the quality of the LES model when applied to such a wide range of conditions. Last, it also provides the possibility to emulate observation techniques. This might help detect limitations and potential problems of a variety of measurement techniques.\nThe LES runs are evaluated through a comparison with observations from the observational supersite and with results from the ‘‘parent’’ large-scale model. The long time series that are generated, in combination with information on the spatial structure, provide a novel opportunity to study time scales ranging from seconds to seasons. This facilitates a study of the power spectrum of horizontal and vertical wind speed variance to identify the dominant variance-containing time scales.",

            "abstract": "The cause of the progressive oxygenation of Earth’s biosphere remains poorly understood. The problem is bounded by the interplay of three irreversible, secular changes: the escape of H to space, which makes the planet more oxidized; the evolution of photoautotrophy – which converts solar energy into redox disequilbrium – and related metabolisms; and the cooling of the planet, which affects the exchange of material between Earth’s reduced interior and relatively oxidized surface through a variety of processes.\nThe first of these changes is quantitatively considered elsewhere, and is connected to the other two because H escape depends on atmospheric H2 and CH4 contents.\nThe second of these changes is an area of vigorous research, particularly over the past decade. Important work included efforts to constrain the timing of key evolutionary events using organic geochemical and genomic records, and to understand the timing and tempo of environmental oxidation, particularly preceding the “Great Oxidation Event” (GOE) at ~2.4 Ga. As the community sorts through various debates, evidence is accumulating that the pre-GOE period was a dynamic era of transient “whiffs” of oxidation, most likely due to small amounts of biogenic O2 that appeared as early as ~3.0 Ga. The implication is that O2 sinks generally overwhelmed substantial O2 sources through the first half of Earth history, and that a decrease in sink strength and/or increase in source strength could have resulted in increasing instability of trace pO2 in the runup to the GOE.\nThe most likely sinks are coupled to reductants in Earth’s interior, which leads us to the third major change—secular cooling of the planet. It is almost certain that this cooling led to changes in mantle dynamics, rates of plate motion, and melting behaviors, which in turn affected volcanism, crust composition, hydrothermal and metamorphic alteration, ocean nutrient budgets, and recycling at subduction zones. These factors have all been considered as possible drivers of surface redox evolution, but typically in isolation. We are tackling the grand challenge of developing an integrated theory of Earth evolution, grounded in the physics of a cooling planet, and motivated by the implications for chemical evolution of the biosphere. The framework of such a theory will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Mastery of the peculiar and powerful practices of science is increasingly important for the average citizen. With the rise of the Internet, most of human knowledge is at our fingertips. As content becomes a commodity, success and survival aren’t about who knows the most, but who is better able to explore the unknown, actively applying and extending knowledge through critical thinking and hypothesis-driven problem-solving. This applies to the economic livelihoods of individuals and to society at large as we grapple with climate change and other science-infused challenges.\nUnfortunately, science is too often taught as an encyclopedic collection of settled facts to be mastered rather than as a process of exploration that embraces curiosity, inquiry, testing, and communication to reduce uncertainty about the unknown. This problem is exacerbated by the continued prevalence of teacher-centric pedagogy, which promotes learning-from-authority and passive learning. The initial wave of massively open online courses (MOOCs) generally mimic this teaching style in virtual form.\nIt is hypothesized that emerging digital teaching technologies can help address this challenge at Internet scale in “next generation” MOOCs and flipped classroom experiences. Interactive simulations, immersive virtual field trips, gamified elements, rapid adaptive feedback, intelligent tutoring systems, and personalized pathways, should motivate and enhance learning. Through lab-like projects and tutorials, students should be able to construct knowledge from interactive experiences, modeling the authentic practice of science while mastering complex concepts. Freed from lecturing, teaching staff should be available for direct and intense student-teacher interactions.\nThese claims are difficult to evaluate with traditional assessment instruments, but digital technologies provide powerful new ways to evaluate student learning and learn from student behaviors. We will describe ongoing experiences with such technologies, and future plans, drawing from the experiences of > 2500 students who have taken the Habitable Worlds fully online general education class at ASU, and as part of the new Inspark Science Teaching Network.",

We noted that PM2.5 concentrations in the downwind site were slightly higher than those in the upwind and urban sites during the haze episodes, indicating the formation and evolution of fine particles during the transport.

            "abstract": "Meltwater at the base of an ice sheet has a significant influence on the flow dynamics and stability. Processes that lead to ice-sheet instability are at the forefront of research addressing uncertainty in the fate of modern ice sheets. A better understanding of subglacial meltwater is needed to assess the role of meltwater on ice-sheet instability and place modern observations of meltwater drainage into a longer-term context. Observations of subglacial channels and evidence of meltwater influence on ice-sheet dynamics are sparse in the geologic record around Antarctica. We present subglacial meltwater channels incised into the post-LGM sea scape of the Ross Sea continental shelf with clear relationships to glacial retreat landforms. We combine geomorphic and stratigraphic evidence to test the influence of meltwater on ice-sheet retreat during the last deglaciation. The channel systems are associated with small, closely-spaced ice-marginal landforms suggestive of rapid grounding line retreat. The channels were active during the late stages of retreat based on their positions in the southernmost portions of the troughs and cross-cutting relationships with glacial retreat landforms. Although channelized meltwater appears to be spatially limited, we have identified meltwater deposits within proximal grounding line facies from cores across the continental shelf in the western Ross Sea. Therefore, not only do we observe clear evidence of meltwater under the dwindling ice sheet, but basal meltwater in the Ross Sea is a pervasive feature and associated with geomorphic and sedimentologic expressions of rapid ice-sheet retreat. Ongoing work focuses on quantifying channel flow properties and reasonable meltwater production rates as well as further constraining evidence of meltwater in the Ross Sea and elsewhere around Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "The development of detailed models of the interior of the Earth and other terrestrial planets is frequently hampered by poorly constrained compositional parameters, namely Activation Energy and Volume, which are necessary to define Arrhenius viscosity. This results in the values of said parameters varying considerably to suit the needs of individual investigations. A computational exploration of the effects of Activation Energy and Volume on the Earth's mantle was thus conducted, with a view to developing a robust and versatile method for obtaining a first-degree approximation for the parameter values, and providing some context for future studies.\nA wide range of plausible mantle configurations was examined in both one and two dimensions, with the latter case utilising the modelling program ASPECT to generate a series of simple Earth-like planets which were allowed to evolve until a steady state was achieved. A comprehensive statistical analysis was then performed, allowing for suitable parameter values to be more effectively constrained for numerous given viscosity formulations. Activation Energy was seen to exhibit considerable influence over the bulk magnitude of viscosity values, while Activation Volume heavily impacted the viscosity contrast between the upper and lower mantle. This behaviour stems from the parameters controlling the temperature and pressure dependency of viscosity within the calculation. Results were found to be highly dependent on the minimum and maximum values imposed on the viscosity, reinforcing the need for a fuller understanding of the formulation.\nA notable impact on stress profiles, and hence tectonic regime, was also observed. As such similar calculations were performed on directly scaled Super-Earths, with the intention of providing some insight into scenarios conducive to particular tectonic regimes in planets outside our solar system.",

            "abstract": "Elastic properties of silicates, oxides and other transparent materials, especially their single crystal elastic moduli, texture and its evolution upon compression at Mbar pressures is a subject of continuous interest in geo- and planetary sciences. Picosecond laser ultrasonic technique was earlier proposed to measure elastic moduli of materials compressed in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) [1]. Recently the applications of picosecond laser ultrasonic interferometry have been extended to evaluation of spatially inhomogeneous samples |2]. In this communication we report characterization by this technique of a transparent polycrystalline sample (H2O ice) compressed in a DAC to ~1 Mbar. The method is suitable for measurements in multi-Mbar region due to a high in-depth resolution approaching 300 nm and limited by the used signal processing. In an inhomogeneous medium the transient reflectivity signal obtained by this technique contains at each time instance the information on the parameters of the medium in the spatial position of laser-generated picosecond acoustic pulse corresponding to this moment of time. The lateral resolution is defined by focusing of the laser radiation which can approach ≤1 μm if advanced focusing methods are applied. Here we present results of examination of characteristic features of micro-crystallinity of H2O ice at P up to 840 kbar by two-dimensional imaging based on this technique which provides, in addition, for each spatial position the value of elastic modulus of the sample material along the DAC axis [2]. A significant elastic anisotropy of H2O ice was recognised, its degree evaluated, and compared with the earlier experimental and theoretical data. Feasibility of extension to a three-dimensional imaging of texture (including information on orientation of crystallites or their groups) as well as its evolution upon further compression in a DAC is discussed. The method can be applied to any transparent compounds (silicates, oxides) or mixtures (e.g. MgO + MgSiO3) and can be extended to high temperatures if combined with the laser heating technique.\nThis work was supported by the ANR BLANC 2011 program (project LUDACism)\n1.

            "abstract": "Reconstructions of air and surface ocean temperatures of the Eemian interglacial (MIS5e) often infer higher values than those of the Holocene, with a recently estimated global sea level 6-9m meters above the present highstand. Many a study also have reported on Eemian climate instability with respect to both variability in temperatures and sea level. These variabilities are often explained by AMOC changes and by invoking massive bi-polar ice sheet losses. In spite of recent sea-level compilation studies on such fluctuations during the last interglacial using coral evidence, the questions remain how, where, and, notably, when could a rapid ice growth have occurred during the otherwise so warm but relatively short Eemian full-interglacial period? Ocean field data now indicate a relatively cool polar North Atlantic for a substantial part of the post-deglacial (T2) interval, whereas in the subpolar region ocean temperature peaked directly after T2 together with high insolation. Thus, based on circumstantial evidence significant glacier ice must have remained at sea-level along the polar periphery for rather long. In addition with other proxy data the overall sequence of events would therefore dictate a late global sea-level highstand during MIS5e.",

            "abstract": "We have collected three-component data from 122 Korean accelerometer stations for the month of December in 2014. We apply similar techniques described by Zha \\textit{et al.} (2013) to retrieve accurate station orientation angles, in order to rotate the horizontal component data into the radial and transverse frame of reference, and for subsequent measurement of Love wave group velocity dispersion. We simultaneously normalize all three components of a daily noise record via the frequency-time normalization (FTN) method. Each component is divided by the average signal envelope in an effort to retain relative amplitude information between all three components. Station orientations are found by a grid search for the orientation azimuth which maximizes the coherency between the radial-vertical cross-correlation and the Hilbert transformed vertical-vertical cross-correlation. After measuring orientation angles, we cross-correlate and rotate the data. Typically, the group velocity dispersion curves are measured using the frequency time analysis technique (FTAN), effectively producing spectrograms with significant uncertainty in the time-frequency plane. The spectrogram approach retains only the amplitude information of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). However, Kodera \\textit{et al} (1976) show that by taking into account the phase information, the concepts of instantaneous frequency and group-time delay can be used to compute the first moment of the signal power in the frequency and time domains. During energy reassignment, the signal power calculated using the STFT at a point (\nt\n0\n,\nf\n0\n) is reassigned to the location of the first moment (\nt\n^\ng\n,\nf\n^\ni\n), where\nt\n^\ng\nis the group-time delay and\nf\n^\ni\nis the instantaneous frequency. We apply the method of energy reassignment to produce precise Rayleigh and Love wave group velocity measurements in the frequency range 0.1 - 1.0 Hz. Tests on synthetic data show more accurate retrieval of group velocities at low and high frequencies compared to classic measurement techniques. We regionalize the measurements to make maps of group velocity distributions. The increased accuracy of the measurements provide stronger constraints for the S-velocity structure in the uppermost crust.",

            "abstract": "Geometrical and frictional heterogeneities, such as kinks/bends and stress/friction anomalies, are commonly observed on seismogenic faults. However, whether they may nucleate, promote, or stop earthquake ruptures remains controversial. Here we investigate the effects of fault heterogeneity on earthquake ruptures through dynamic rupture simulations on a “slip-weakening” fault. We demonstrate that such heterogeneity can act as a barrier to earthquake ruptures, depending on the effective normal stress and geometry associated with the heterogeneity. Furthermore, we find that such barrier effect is most prominent when the barrier sits at an intermediate range of the barrier-nucleation distances. However, instead of stopping ruptures, the barrier may also induce ruptures that propagate faster than shear wave velocity (supershear). The barrier-induced supershear ruptures may be transient and the durations are proportional to the reduction in main rupture speed caused by the barrier. We also demonstrate that the emergence of supershear ruptures can be delineated by two linear boundaries, which are related to the barrier size and the barrier-nucleation distance. Considering such a barrier in long-term earthquake cycles, we observe that the barrier can also turn into asperities experiencing large coseismic slip. These results suggest that a strong barrier patch on the fault may not necessarily stop coseismic ruptures and thus reduce the maximum size of earthquakes. Instead, the barrier could experience large coseismic slip and/or induce supershear ruptures that play important roles in near-field ground shaking and damage.",

The first measurement of the interstellar magnetic fluctuation spectrum by Voyager 1 was consistent with interstellar Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum, ruling out any significant local wave sources, such as an instability. We show that both linear dispersion analysis and kinetic plasma computer simulations should be approached with much caution when drawing conclusions about the wave generation and resulting particle scattering in pitch angle, especially for very tenuous rings. Using hybrid-kinetic and PIC models we carefully examine the nonlinear phase of pickup ion (PUI) scattering on self-generated fluctuations to reveal a critical dependence on the number of pseudo-particles present in the simulation. It is shown that narrow rings modeled with very high number of particles (1 million per cell) could become stable in the nonlinear phase. The second part of this presentation deals with more realistic pickup rings derived from the distribution of primary energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) originating in the solar wind and the inner heliosheath. The width of these distributions allow them to remain stable on the timescales of at least a few months. These results lend additional support to the secondary PUI theory of the origin of the IBEX ribbon.",

Between 1950 and 2012, a significant decline in the monsoon season (June to September) precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET), and total runoff was observed in many sub-continental river basins that are key to water availability in the one of the most populated regions (e.g. Central India) in the world. On the other hand, significant increases in precipitation, ET, and total runoff were noticed in majority of the basins during the period of 1901-1949, which highlight a diametric nature in changes in the surface water availability. The central Indian region where the changes in surface water availability were more prominent experienced an increase (decline) of 19 (-8) % in total runoff and 8 (-6) % in ET during the pre (post) 1950 periods. While the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Mahanadi, Narmada, and Godavari river basins experienced declines in the monsoon season precipitation, ET, and total runoff, a significant increase in air temperature was noticed in 15 out of 18 sub-continental basins during the period of 1950-2012. Sea surface temperature (SST) in the Indian Ocean increased more than 1.0ºC during the period of 1950-2012, which is strongly associated with the declining trends in surface water availability in the sub-continental river basins.

            "abstract": "The dissociation of gas hydrates along the continental shelf can potentially trigger submarine landslides. The hazard produced by such landslides can generate tsunamis, damage or destroy infrastructure, and result in a catastrophic release of methane to the ocean and atmosphere. Here we develop a 1D numerical model to identify the conditions under which the dissociation of gas hydrates can trigger submarine landslides. In particular we focus on high saturation hydrate anomalies (e.g., lenses and nodules) that unload the sediment particle contacts and prevent normal consolidation. These areas are of interest because upon dissociation they can generate excess pore pressure from rapid consolidation and from fluid flow due to changes in the averaged density of pore constituents. Our model tracks the evolution of pore pressure and effective stress as the hydrate anomalies decay using lab derived constitutive relationships from consolidation experiments. To quantify the potential for slope failure, we use a rate- and state-dependent frictional model adapted from standard fault mechanics treatments to assess the stability of finite slip patches subjected to these excess pore pressures. We find that submarine landslides will occur if the size of the slip patch exceeds a critical nucleation length. Thus, excess pore pressures generated by hydrate dissociation have the potential to trigger submarine landslides, if not significantly weaken the sediment such that external forces (e.g., nearby earthquakes) can trigger failure. Our results illustrate the fundamental mechanisms through which the dissociation of gas hydrates can pose a significant geohazard. Further tests using this model will help to better assess the risks of hydrate-triggered slope failure in a changing environment",

Landslide inventory of 2009 Typhoon Morakot, 5×5 m DEM, and aero photo have been interpreted by GIS software to assess the slope type and the scale of landslide events. The research database includes 276 landslides which orthographic projection areas are smaller than 1 ha. The slopes were also classified into dip, orthoclinical-dip, escarpment, and orthoclinical- escarpment 4 types of slope based on the slope aspect to the bedding orientation. The sliding plane, or so call the failure plane, was identified by aero photo, field reconnaissance and verification, and DEM before and after the typhoon event. Colluvium material deposited on the slip plane was removed based on the scarp and foot position, mass movement pattern, weak plane orientation, and the micro topography of a landslide to achieve the reasonable sliding plane. The maximum depth of sliding surface is explored through the slope type and sliding plane in total of 276 landslide cases. Results demonstrate that the average maximum depth, Dam, of dip slope is 4.6 m, Dam of orthoclinical-dip, escarpment, and orthoclinical-escarpment slopes are 5.8, 6.0, and 6.3 m respectively. In general, Dam is creasing with the average slope of landslide, the relationship of both factor is achieved in the study. Meanwhile, the orthographic projection area of landslide is increasing with the slope angle till the angle up to 40 degree then decreasing. The depth also varies with landslide magnitude. Finally, the relation of the depth normal to slope surface and the depth in gravity direction of landslides in four types slope are proposed, the R square values are 0.862 to 0.891 showing a good correlation between two types of depth.",

            "abstract": "Global river models (GRMs) are elemental for large-scale predictions and impact analyses. However, they have limited capability in providing accurate flood information at fine resolution for practical purposes. Hyperresolution (~1km resolution) modelling is believed to improve the representation of topographical constraints, which consequently result to better predictions of surface water flows and flood inundation at regional to global scales. While numerous studies have shown that finer resolutions improve the predictions of catchment-scale floods using local-scale hydrodynamic models, the impact of finer spatial resolution on predictions of large-scale floods using GRMs is rarely examined. In this study, we assessed the suitability of a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic GRM, CaMa-Flood, in the hyperresolution simulation of a regional-scale flood. The impacts of finer spatial resolution and representation of sub-grid processes on simulating the 2011 immense flooding in Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand was investigated. River maps ranging from 30-arcsecond (~1km) to 5-arcminute (~10km) spatial resolutions were generated from 90m resolution HydroSHEDS maps and SRTM3 DEM. Simulations were executed in each spatial resolution with the new multi-directional downstream connectivity (MDC) scheme in CaMa-Flood turned on and off.\nWhile the predictive capability of the model slightly improved with finer spatial resolution when MDC scheme is turned on, it significantly declined when MDC scheme is turned off; bias increased by 35% and NSE-coefficient decreased by 60%. These findings indicate that GRMs which assume single-downstream-grid flows are not suitable for hyperresolution modelling because of their limited capability to realistically represent floodplain connectivity. When simulating large-scale floods, MDC scheme is necessary for the following functions: provide additional storage for ovehrbank flows, enhance connectivity between floodplains which allow more realistic flood routing, and maintain flow capacity across varying spatial scales. These results explicate that simulating at hyperresolution alone will not necessarily increase the predictive capability of GRMs – more realistic representation of sub-grid flow physics is necessary in hyperresolution modelling.",

            "abstract": "The 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku Earthquake (M 7.2) was an unusually large earthquake, which occurred near the volcanic regions. To understand the mechanism of inland earthquakes, it is important to study the structure around the area. Okada et al. (2012) observed aftershocks precisely and estimated the seismic velocity structure. Iinuma et al. (2009) detected coseismic and aseismic slips with GPS observations. Mishina (2009) and Ichihara et al. (2014) conducted 2-D and 3-D MT surveys respectively. However, the MT station distributions of the previous MT surveys were sparse. We carried out denser surveys and showed more precise resistivity structures around the area. We conducted MT surveys at 66 stations (59 stations from October until November in 2012 and 7 stations from October until November in 2014) around the area and estimated 3-D resistivity structures using inversion code of Siripunvaraporn and Egbert (2009) with full impedance tensor as response functions. The result of our final resistivity structures is similar to the one in Ichihara et al. (2014), but is more complex. We found a low resistivity zone to the northeast of Mt. Kurikoma below 3km depth. This anomaly is connected with a low resistivity zone located under Mt. Kurikoma below 10km depth. The locations of aseismic and co-seismic slips in Iinuma et al. (2009) correspond to the locations of low resistivity and high resistivity zones in our model respectively. This may represent that low resistivity zones are brittle and high resistivity zones are ductile.",

            "abstract": "The mid-Pliocene occurred between 3.264 and 3.025 Ma BP, and was characterized by several periods of relatively warm climatic conditions. It has been researched extensively, in part due to the availability of proxy data, allowing for data/climate model comparisons, but also because it is thought that it can give insights into the characteristics of future climate, due to the fact that periods of the mid-Pliocene were characterised by CO2 levels similar to present. However, it is now being realised that the orbital forcing during the mid-Pliocene is also important for properly understanding its relevance to future climate. Computational resource limitations associated with running General Circulation Model (GCM) experiments often restrict the number of simulations that can realistically be carried out, inhibiting the study of the long-term evolution of climate on orbital timescales (>10s kyr). Here, we model the evolution of climate over the Marine Isotope Stage K1 interglacial period in the mid-Pliocene warm period in response to variations in orbital forcing, using an emulator approach. An emulator is a fast statistical model based on the output of a more complex model, in this case the Hadley Centre climate model (HadCM3); the premise of this approach being that once the emulator is built no additional GCM runs are required. A 40-member ensemble of simulations are run using HadCM3, with atmospheric CO2 and the three orbital parameters varying within ranges appropriate for the Pliocene. Latin hypercube sampling is used to optimally and efficiently sample the 4-D parameter space, and the model results are used to develop and calibrate an emulator. Combined with various CO2 scenarios, this is then used to simulate climate at 1 kyr intervals over the period 3.08 to 3.04 Ma, which includes MIS K1. The emulator projections are then compared with existing model simulations [Prescott et al., 2014], as well as proxy data. It is demonstrated that climate emulators may provide a useful tool for rapidly simulating the long-term evolution of climate, both past and future, with relatively small computational cost.",

            "abstract": "Hydropower ranks first among renewable sources of power production and provides globally about 16% of electricity. While it is praised for its low greenhouse gas emissions, it is accused of its large water consumption which surpasses that of all conventional and most renewable energy sources (except for bioenergy) by far. Previous studies mostly applied a gross evaporation approach where all the current evaporation from the plant’s reservoir is allocated to hydropower. In contrast, we only considered net evaporation as the difference between current evaporation and actual evapotranspiration before the construction of the reservoir. In addition, we take into account local water stress, its monthly fluctuations and storage effects of the reservoir in order to assess the impacts on water availability for other users. We apply the method to a large dataset of almost 1500 globally distributed hydropower plants (HPPs), covering ~43% of global annual electricity generation, by combining reservoir information from the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) database with information on electricity generation from the CARMA database. While we can confirm that the gross water consumption of hydropower is generally large (production-weighted average of 97 m3/GJ), other users are not necessarily deprived of water. In contrast, they also benefit in many cases from the reservoir because water is rather stored in the wet season and released in the dry season, thereby alleviating water stress. The production-weighted water scarcity footprint of the analyzed HPPs amounts to -41 m3 H2Oe/GJ. It has to be noted that the impacts among individual plants vary a lot. Larger HPPs generally consume less water per unit of electricity generated, but also the benefits related to alleviating water scarcity are lower. Overall, reservoirs promote both, energy and water security. Other environmental impacts such as flow alterations and social impacts should, however, also be considered, as they can be enormous.",

            "abstract": "While there is scientific consensus that global and local mean sea level (GMSL and LMSL) is rising since the late 19th century, it remains unclear how much of this rise is due to natural variability or anthropogenic forcing. Distinguishing both contributions requires an extensive knowledge about the persistence of natural high and low stands in GMSL and LMSL. This is challenging, since observational time series represent the superposition of various processes with different spectral properties. Here we provide a probabilistic upper range of long-term persistent natural GMSL/LMSL variability (P=0.99), which in turn determines the minimum/maximum anthropogenic contribution since 1900. To account for different spectral characteristics of various contributing processes, we separate LMSL (corrected for vertical land motion) into a slowly varying volumetric (mass and density changes) and a more rapidly changing atmospheric component. Based on a combination of spectral analyses of tide gauge records, barotropic and baroclinic ocean models and numerical Monte-Carlo experiments, we find that in records where transient atmospheric processes dominate the spectra, the persistence of natural volumetric changes tends to be underestimated. If each component is assessed separately, natural centennial trends are locally up to ~1.0 mm/yr larger than in case of an integrated assessment, therefore erroneously enhancing the significance of anthropogenic footprints. The GMSL, however, remains unaffected by such biases. On the basis of a model assessment of the separate components, we conclude that it is virtually certain (P=0.99) that at least 45% of the observed increase in GMSL is of anthropogenic origin.",

            "abstract": "The albedo of glaciers may be altered by deposition of light-absorbing aerosols, which consequently has an impact on their energy- and mass balance. Icelandic volcanoes have produced frequent eruptions within the recent past that spread tephra over extensive areas. The glaciers of Iceland are thus an ideal location for studies related to the influence of supraglacial tephra layers on ablation.\nThe two latest subglacial eruptions that induced considerable amounts of ashfall over major Icelandic ice caps were the one of Eyjafjallajökull in April and May 2010 and the one of Grímsvötn in May 2011. The different chemical compositions of the ashes produced by those two eruptions are also noticeable in their distinct thermal properties.\nIn summer 2015, a field experiment was conducted on western Vatnajökull ice cap. In this experiment, the influence of volcanic tephra from both eruptions on surface ablation is monitored by automated measurements. Artificial plots with varying types and thicknesses of tephra were installed on the glacier. Two types of pristine tephra were compared. One was sampled from inside the caldera of Eyjafjallajökull volcano and one from rocky outcrops at the southern caldera rim of Grímsvötn volcano. Tephra thickness across the different artificial plots ranged from 0.5 to 200 mm. The surface ablation on the plots was continuously monitored by automated measurements. For selected plots, additionally changes of the albedo and the temperature profile through the tephra layer were measured. An automatic weather station was set up for continuous meteorological monitoring.\nWe here present first results from this field experiment. Analyses of the overall variability of surface ablation with tephra thickness are shown alongside with indications of dependencies on meteorological conditions, mainly solar radiation and rainfall. Special emphasis is placed on highlighting differences between the effects of the two different types of tephra.",

The lack of reliable validation data for the satellite-based greenhouse gas observing missions in the tropical regions is a common limitation in global carbon-cycle modeling studies that have a tropical component.

Unfortunately, in ungauged basins the use of traditional floodplain mapping techniques is prevented by the lack of the extensive data required. The main aim of the present work is to overcome this limitation by defining an alternative simplified procedure for a preliminary, but efficient, floodplain delineation. To validate the method in a data-rich environment, eleven flood-related morphological descriptors derived from DEMs have been used as linear binary classifiers over the Ohio River basin and its sub-catchments. Their performances in identifying the floodplains have been measured at the change of the topography and the size of the calibration area, and the best performing classifiers among those analysed have been applied and validated across the continental U.S. The results suggest that the classifier based on the index ln(hr/H), named the Geomorphic Flood Index (GFI), is the most suitable to detect the flood-prone areas in ungauged basins and for large-scale applications, providing good accuracies with low requirements in terms of data and computational costs.",

            "abstract": "Microorganisms are responsible for most geochemical sulfur cycling in the ocean. On both modern and geological time scales, stable isotope ratios often serve as a mechanism to track conspicuous or coupled microbial processes, which in turn inform burial fluxes. The most common example of this approach is the use of sulfur isotopes in sulfate and sulfide (both aqueous and in mineral form) to track everything from rates of microbial processes through to the presence/absence of certain metabolic processes in a given environment. The use of oxygen isotope ratios in sulfate has developed in a similar fashion, providing complementary information to that of sulfur isotopes. Through our current work, we will extend the application of oxygen isotopes to include the trace stable oxygen isotope, 17O. These data are facilitated by a new laser F2 fluorination technique running at Harvard, and accompanied by the calibration of a suite of common sulfate standards. At first blush, 16O - 17O - 18O systematics should carry mass-dependent microbial fractionations with process-specific mass laws that are resolvable at the level of our analytical precision. We look to calibrate these biogeochemical effects through the integrated picture captured in marine pore water sulfate profiles, where the 18O/16O is known to evolve. In compliment, riverine sulfate (the sulfate input to the ocean) is an oxidative weathering product and is posited to carry a memory effect of tropospheric O2. Interestingly, the 17O/16O of that O2 carries a mass-independent signal reflecting the balance between stratospheric reactions and Earth surface biospheric fluxes. Through this presentation, we look to calibrate the controls on the balance between biospheric and atmospheric contributions to the marine sulfate reservoir. This is enabled by a series of isotope mass-balance models and with the ultimate goal of developing the geological triple oxygen isotope records of sulfate as a new environmental proxy for paleo-environmental reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "Mantle plumes are thought to originate at thermal or thermo-chemical boundary layers, and since their origin is relatively fixed compared to plate motion they produce hotspot tracks at the position of their impingement. When plumes reach the surface close to mid-ocean ridges, they generate thicker oceanic crust due to their increased temperature and hence higher degree of melting. Observations of these thickness variations allow estimates about the buoyancy flux and excess temperature of the plume. One example is the interaction of the Tristan plume with the South Atlantic Mid-Ocean Ridge, however, conclusions about the plume properties are complicated by the fact that the Tristan plume track has both on- and off-ridge segments. In these cases, where a plume is overridden by a ridge, it is assumed that the plume flux has a lateral component towards the ridge (the plume is \"captured\" by the ridge). Additionally, sea floor spreading north of the Florianopolis Fracture Zone did not start until 112 Ma -- at least 15 Ma after the plume head arrival -- while the Atlantic had already opened south of it. Therefore, the plume is influenced by the jump in lithosphere thickness across the Florianopolis Fracture zone.\nWe present crustal thickness and plume tracks of a three-dimensional regional convection model of the upper mantle for the Tristan-South Atlantic ridge interaction. The model is created with the convection code ASPECT, which allows for adaptive finite-element meshes to resolve the fine-scale structures within a rising plume head in the presence of large viscosity variations. The boundary conditions of the model are prescribed from a coarser global mantle convection model and the results are compared against recently published models of crustal thickness in the South Atlantic and hotspot tracks in global moving hotspot reference frames. In particular, we investigate the influence of the overriding ridge on the plume head.\nThus, our comparison between models of plume-ridge interaction and observations of crustal thickness in the South Atlantic can improve the estimate about the buoyancy flux and excess temperature of the Tristan plume\nover time.

            "abstract": "Advanced, reliable and transparent tools and data to assess earthquake risk are inaccessible to most, especially in less developed regions of the world while few, if any, globally accepted standards currently allow a meaningful comparison of risk between places. The Global Earthquake Model (GEM) is a collaborative effort that aims to provide models, datasets and state-of-the-art tools for transparent assessment of earthquake hazard and risk. As part of this goal, GEM and its global network of collaborators have developed the OpenQuake engine (an open-source software for hazard and risk calculations), the OpenQuake platform (a web-based portal making GEM’s resources and datasets freely available to all potential users), and a suite of tools to support modelers and other experts in the development of hazard, exposure and vulnerability models. These resources are being used extensively across the world in hazard and risk assessment, from individual practitioners to local and national institutions, and in regional projects to inform disaster risk reduction. Practical examples for how GEM is bridging the gap between science and disaster risk reduction are:\n- Several countries including Switzerland, Turkey, Italy, Ecuador, Papua-New Guinea and Taiwan (with more to follow) are computing national seismic hazard using the OpenQuake-engine. In some cases these results are used for the definition of actions in building codes.\n- Technical support, tools and data for the development of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk models for regional projects in South America and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n- Going beyond physical risk, GEM’s scorecard approach evaluates local resilience by bringing together neighborhood/community leaders and the risk reduction community as a basis for designing risk reduction programs at various levels of geography. Actual case studies are Lalitpur in the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal and Quito/Ecuador.\n In agreement with GEM’s collaborative approach, all projects are undertaken with strong involvement of local scientific and risk reduction communities. Open-source software and careful documentation of the methodologies create full transparency of the modelling process, so that results can be reproduced any time by third parties.",

            "abstract": "Titan's polar surface is dotted with hundreds of lacustrine depressions. Their morphology suggests that their development would be associated to karstic-like processes, involving Titan's liquids (methane, ethane) dissolving the solid surface, presumably composed of organics and ices. In the present work, we test whether or not surface dissolution could be a major landshaping process on Titan using a solutional denudation rates model. The model is based on thermodynamics (solute solubility in solvents) and climatic (temperature, precipitation rates) parameters and has already been used to describe the dissolution of carbonates in karstic areas on Earth. It allows inference of rough formation timescales for topographic depressions of a given depth, developed by chemical erosion only. We computed and compared the denudation rates of pure solid organics in liquid hydrocarbons and of minerals in liquid water over Titan and Earth timescales. We then investigated the denudation rates of superficial organic layers in liquid methane over one Titan year. At this timescale, such a layer on Titan would behave like salts or carbonates on Earth depending on its composition, which means that dissolution processes would likely occur but would be 30 times slower on Titan compared to the Earth due to the seasonality of methane precipitation. Assuming that Titan's past climatic conditions remained close to the present ones, and assuming an average depth of 100 m for Titan's lacustrine depressions, these could have developed in a few tens of millions of years at polar latitudes higher than 70°N and S, and a few hundreds of million years at lower polar latitudes. The ages determined are consistent with the youth of the surface (<1 Gyr) and the repartition of dissolution-related landforms on Titan.",

            "abstract": "The rheology of the lithosphere is of key importance for the physics of the lithosphere. Yet, it is probably the most uncertain parameter in geodynamics as experiments have to be extrapolated to geological conditions and as existing geophysical methods such as EET estimation make simplifying assumptions about the structure of the lithosphere.\nHere, we therefore discuss a new method that employs thermo-mechanical lithospheric-scale forward models of the lithosphere using a realistic initial geometry constructed from geophysical data sets. We employ experimentally determined creep-laws for the various parts of the lithosphere, but assume that the parameters of these creep-laws as well as the temperature structure of the lithosphere are uncertain. This is used as a priori information to formulate a Bayesian inverse problem that employs topography, gravity, horizontal and vertical surface velocities to invert for the unknown material parameters and temperature structure. In order to test the general methodology, we first perform a geodynamic inversion of a synthetic forward model of intraoceanic subduction with known parameters. This requires solving an inverse problem with 14–16 parameters, depending on whether temperature is assumed to be known or not. With the help of a massively parallel direct-search combined with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, solving the inverse problem becomes feasible. Results show that the rheological parameters and particularly the effective viscosity structure of the lithosphere can be reconstructed in a probabilistic sense. This also holds, with somewhat larger uncertainties, for the case where the temperature distribution is parametrized.\nFinally, we apply the method to a cross-section of the India–Asia collision system. In this case, the number of parameters is larger, which requires solving around 1.9 × 106 forward models. The resulting models fit the data within their respective uncertainty bounds, and show that the Indian mantle lithosphere must have a high viscosity. Results for the Tibetan plateau are less clear, and both models with a weak Asian mantle lithosphere and with a weak Asian lower crust fit the data nearly equally well.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography of potentially hazardous volcanoes is a prime tool to assess the location and dimensions of magmatic reservoirs. Magma rheology and volcanic eruptive style are to a first order controlled by processes occurring within the conduit or in the magma chamber, such as crystallization and bubble exsolution. Seismic velocities are strongly affected by these processes, but the limited number of constrained measurements does not allow yet establishing a firm link between seismic tomography and the textural and hence rheologic state of volcanic systems. Elastic parameters of vapor-saturated, partially molten systems are thus providing fundamental information for the identification of such reservoirs under volcanoes.\nWe investigated a chemically simplified melt analogous to trachyte, which undergoes plagioclase crystallization and bubble exsolution. A Paterson-type apparatus was employed to measure the seismic velocities at a constant pressure of 250 MPa and at a frequency of 0.1 MHz. The temperature was decreased at a rate of 0.5 or 0.1 °C/min from 850 to 700 °C and velocities were recorded every 45 minutes. In order to characterize the microstructure evolution, we conducted series of cold-seal experiments at identical pressure conditions but with rapid-quenching at each of the recorded temperatures.\nMagmatic processes such as crystallization, bubble nucleation and coalescence have been recognized throughout the measurements of seismic velocities in the laboratory. Compression and shear wave velocities increase non-linearly during crystallization. At crystal fraction exceeding 45 vol%, the formation of a crystal network favors the propagation of seismic waves through magmatic liquids. However, bubble nucleation induced by crystallization leads to an increase of magma compressibility resulting in a lowering of the wave propagation velocities. These two processes occurring simultaneously have thus competing effects on the seismic properties of magmas. In addition, when the bubble fraction is less than 10 vol%, the decrease in seismic velocities is more pronounced than for higher bubble fractions. The effect of bubble coalescence on elastic properties is thus lower than the effect of bubble nucleation.",

Main reason behind this phenomenon is the need of fast marketing of the agricultural production to urban residents and financial provision. Thus, using the areas nearby cities for agricultural activities brings out advantage of easy transportation of productions and fast marketing. For decades, heavy migration to cities has directly and negatively affected natural grasslands, forests and agricultural lands. This pressure has caused agricultural lands to be changed into urban areas. Dense urbanization causes increase in impervious surfaces, heat islands and many other problems in addition to destruction of agricultural lands.\nConsidering the negative impacts of urbanization on agricultural lands and natural resources, a periodic monitoring of these changes becomes indisputably important. At this point, satellite images are known to be good data sources for land cover / use change monitoring with their fast data acquisition, large area coverages and temporal resolution properties. Classification of the satellite images provides thematic the land cover / use maps of the earth surface and changes can be determined with GIS based analysis multi-temporal maps.\nIn this study, effects of heavy urbanization over agricultural lands in Istanbul, metropolitan city of Turkey, were investigated with use of multi-temporal Landsat TM satellite images acquired between 1984 and 2011. Images were geometrically registered to each other and classified using supervised maximum likelihood classification algorithm. Resulting thematic maps were exported to GIS environment and destructed agricultural lands by urbanization were determined using spatial analysis.",

            "abstract": "There has been recently growing numbers of facilities for water curtain cultivation of strawberry and lettuce in Korea. These areas are nearly all located in the fluvial deposits near streams which can replenish water resources into exhausted groundwater aquifers during peak season. The purpose of this study is on groundwater chemistry and the change in physical and chemical properties due to stream-groundwater exchange or mixing in the representative agricultural area among the Jurassic granitic terrain of Korea. In the study area, groundwater level continuously decreased from November through March due to intensive use of groundwater, which forced stream water into aquifer. After March, groundwater level was gradually recovered to the original state. To evaluate the extent and its variations of stream water mixing into aquifer, field parameters including T, pH, EC and DO values, concentrations of major ions and oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopic ratios were used. Field measurements and water sample collections were performed several times from 2012 to 2015 mainly during peak time of groundwater use. To compare the temporal variations and areal differences, 21 wells from four cross sections perpendicular to stream line were used. While water temperature, EC values and concentrations of Ca, Mg, Si, HCO3 showed roughly gradual increase from stream line to 150 m distance, pH and DO values showed reverse phenomenon. This can be used to evaluate the extent and limit of stream water introduction into aquifer. However, individual wells showed yearly variations in those parameters and this dynamic and unstable feature indicates that mixing intensity of stream water over groundwater in this hyporheic zone varied year by year according to amounts of groundwater use and decrease of groundwater level.",

ETT are used to relocate SIL database earthquakes using P- and S- arrival times. Results are compared with the initial locations from the SIL database and locations from local sub-networks in Iceland. The SIL database locations are estimated using 5 different 1-D velocity models for different regions. The arrival times were re-referenced to one single model (the SIL model). Minor discrepancies in archived travel-time reduction were identified and removed together with outliers. Travel times are decomposed into 1) the prediction of a 1-D reference velocity model; 2) deterministic variation of residuals from that 1-D model constructed by smoothing over a regional scale; and 3) a smaller-scale, stochastic component. The stochastic component is separated into a spatially incoherent part (noise) and a spatially coherent part assumed to correspond to remaining structural signal. The stochastic structural component is interpolated and summed to the other two travel time components in order to construct the ETTs. Relocation is computed with a non-linear grid-search algorithm. The resulting ETTs are useful for improving earthquake location where 1-D velocity models are frequently used and a fast secondary relocation process is required. Moreover, ETTs are “cleaned” travel times that can be used as input into 3D tomography, where the error estimation (incoherent component of residuals) serves as a useful guideline for data weighting.",

            "abstract": "Submarine canyons are morphological incisions into continental margins that act as major conduits of sediment from shallow- to deep-sea regions. Different transport processes and triggering mechanisms involving various time-scales can operate through them. Canyon heads are key areas for understanding the shelf-to-canyon sedimentary dynamics and assessing the predominant hydrodynamic and sedimentary processes shaping their morphology. High-resolution multibeam bathymetries were conducted at the various heads from the Almanzora-Alías-Garrucha canyon system to recognize their specific morphological features. A direct connection from the Almanzora River was evidenced by the coalescence of cyclic steps on the prodelta deposits and their continuation towards various canyon heads. This suggests the occurrence of flood events causing hyperpycnal flows that progress directly into the canyon. A second type of canyon head results from the formation and merging of linear gullies at the southern limit of the prodelta, being interpreted as the morphological expression of the distal off-shelf transport of flood-related hyperycnal flows potentially transformed into wave-supported sediment gravity flows. These two canyon head occur at 80-90 m water depth, incising only the outer shelf. A third canyon head morphological type was found at much shallower water depths (10-20 m), being disconnected from any major river source. They cut into the infralittoral prograding wedge and some tributaries show crescent shaped bedforms (CSB) along their axis. These CSB have been observed until a water depth of 90 m and have been interpreted as the result of storm-induced sediment gravity flows. An instrumented mooring was deployed from October 2014 to April 2015 to monitor the contemporary sediment transport processes through a canyon axis with CSB. The sedimentary dynamics was governed by storms, with several down-canyon transport events, but none of the storms triggered a sediment gravity flow.",

Particularly, global cities that are located on or near the coasts are often situated in low lying areas and these locations put global cities at greater risk to SLR. Localized flooding will profoundly impact vulnerable communities located in high-risk urban areas. Building community resilience and adapting to SLR is increasingly a high priority for cities. On the other hand, Article 6 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change addresses the importance of climate change communication and engaging stakeholders in decision making process. Importantly, Community Based Adaptation (CBA) experiences emphasize that it is important to understand a community’s unique perceptions of their adaptive capacities to identify useful solutions and that scientific and technical information on anticipated coastal climate impacts needs to be translated into a suitable language and format that allows people to be able to participate in adaptation planning.\nTo address this challenge, this study has put forth three research questions from the lens of urban community engagement in SLR adaptation, (1) What, if any, community engagement in addressing SLR occurring in urban areas; (2) What information do communities need and how does it need to be communicated, in order to be better prepared and have a greater sense of agency? and (3) How can government agencies from city to federal levels facilitate community engagement and action?. To answer these questions this study has evolved a framework “COREDAR” (COmmunicating Risk of sea level rise and Engaging stakeholDers in framing community based Adaptation StRategies) to communicate and transfer complex climate data and information such as projected SLR under different scenarios of IPCC AR5, predicted impact of SLR, prioritizing vulnerability, etc. to concerned stakeholders and local communities, and to engage them in framing actionable urban CBA adaptation strategies to rising sea-level. Thus, this study seeks to provide insights on communicating risk of climate change (SLR) and to develop a robust picture of urban CBA through effective decision making that are grounded in pressing community priorities in a case study approach.",

LOTUS will develop processing scheme for extracting high-resolution sea surface heights, wave heights and wind speeds from SAR mode data. Over land, the LOTUS will develop processing scheme for extracting high-resolution river and lake heights, soil moisture, and snow water equivalents.

            "abstract": "Environmental science requires the fusion of ever growing volumes of data from multiple simulation and observation platforms. In the UK, the Centre for Environmental Analysis (CEDA) provides infrastructure to support the analysis of such data. CEDA delivers both a curated archive, and an environment to exploit that data alongside other datasets. Over 3 petabytes (PB) of data are now available in the archive and this will rise considerably in the next 12 months as key datasets are acquired and made available via the JASMIN super data cluster. JASMIN incorporates over 17 PB of disk, co-located with tape and computing facilities for data analysis via batch, hosted and cloud computing\nThe first of the European Sentinel series of satellites, Sentinel-1A was launched in April 2014, followed by Sentinel-2A in July 2015. Synthetic Aperture Radar data from Sentinel-1A data is already flowing, with around one terabyte per day being archived at CEDA. Recent data are stored on-line for direct access to users; older data will be moved to near-line tape, reinstating for users on demand. It is expected that most UK science users will access, process and analyse the data in the JASMIN-CEMS hosted environment avoiding the need to download and store data on their local machines. Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3 data will follow soon, with landcover mapping expected to be an important application for Sentinel 2 data.\nThe same approach will be adopted for CMIP6 data, where we expect to both host the largest possible CMIP cache and provide a specific resource for one of the constituent MIPS: HIRESMIP. We expect to provide the UK climate community (and related European collaborators, such as the PRIMAVERA consortium) a 2 PB disk cache alongside a complete copy of HIRESMIP (10-50 PB) on tape.\nThis paper describes these challenging use cases and presents recent infrastructure developments, including how the facility for Climate and Environmental Monitoring from Space, CEMS, exploits JASMIN.",

            "abstract": "The hypocenters of microseismic events induced by hydro-fracturing for developing shale gas provide important information on the characteristics of the fracture networks. This information is crucial to evaluate the production rate and also make a plan for efficient hydro-fracturing design. Therefore, the accurate hypocenter determination of microseismic events is very important from the economic point of view and the tolerable location error should be only dozens of meters for this purpose. In this study, we test three methods, which are widely used for locating earthquakes in seismology, to determine the hypocenters of microseismic events generated during the commercial shale gas development and recorded at a dense sub-surface array. We selected 1-hour time window and applied automatic picking algorithm to identify events and measure P and S arrival times of them. Our automatic picking algorithm identified 84 events in given time window and 73 of them are reliably located by all three methods. The first method is based on linear and iterative inversion and locates individual events separately. The second method simultaneously locates clustered events and reduces location errors due to incorrect velocity model by introducing the station terms. The third method locates only relative rather than absolute locations of clustered events using double difference algorithm. 1D P and S-wave velocity models are constructed based on well-logging data. Automatically measured P and S arrival times are used for determining absolute locations and relative arrival times measured by waveform cross-correlation are utilized for relative locations. Our preliminary result indicates that double difference method combined with waveform cross-correlations is more applicable than other two methods in that it satisfies the required accuracy for the microseismic monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Advanced hyperspectral and LIDAR data offer a great potential to map and monitor invasive plant species and their impact on ecosystems. These species are often difficult to detect over large areas with traditional mapping approaches. One challenge is the combination of the remote sensing data with the field data for calibration and validation. Therefore, our goals were to (1) develop an approach that allows to efficiently map species invasions based on presence-only data of the target species and remote sensing data; and (2) use this approach to create distribution maps for invasive plant species in two study areas in western Europe, which offer the basis for further analysis of the impact of invasions and to infer possible management options.\nFor this purpose, on the island of Sylt in Northern Germany, we collected vegetation data on 120 plots with a size of 3 m x 3 m with different cover fractions of two invasive plant species; the moss Campylopus introflexus and the shrub Rosa rugosa. In the forest of Compiègne in Northern France, we sampled a total of 50 plots with a size of 25 x 25 m, targeting the invasive tree Prunus serotina. In both study areas, independent validation datasets containing presence and absence points of the target species were collected. Airborne hyperspectral data (APEX), which were simultaneously acquired for both study areas in summer 2014, provided 285 spectral bands covering the visible, near infrared and short-wave infrared region with a pixel size of 1.8 and 3 m. First results showed that mapping using one-class classifiers is possible: For C. introflexus, AUC value was 0.89 and OAC 0.72, for R. rugosa., AUC was 0.93 and OAC 0.92. However, for both species, a few areas were mapped incorrectly. Possible explanations are the different appearances of the target species in different biotope types underrepresented in the calibration data, and a high cover of species with similar reflectance properties.",

The groundwater recharge models of Lanyang Plain and Taipei Basin have successfully been estimated in two years ago (2013-2014). The third year of the project integrates with geophysical, geochemistry, and hydrogeology models to estimate the groundwater recharge model in Taichung Basin region. Taichung Basin is mainly covered by Pre-Pleistocene of thick gravel, sandy and muddy sediment rocks within a joint alluvial fan, whereas the depth of the hydrological bedrock remains uncertain. Two electrical resistivity geophysical tools were carried out utilizing direct current resistivity and audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) explorations, which could ideally provide the depth resolutions from shallow to depth for evaluating the groundwater resources. The study has carried out 21 AMT stations in the southern Taichung Basin in order to delineate hydrological bedrock in the region. All the AMT stations were deployed about 24 hours and processed with remote reference technique to reduce culture noises. The quality of most stations shows acceptable in the area which two stations were excluded due to near-field source effect in the southwestern basin. The best depth resolution is identified in 500 meters for the model. The preliminary result shows that the depths of the bedrock gradually changes from southern ~20 m toward to ~400 m in central, and eastern ~20 m to 180 m in the western basin inferred from the AMT model. The investigation shows that AMT method could be a useful geophysical tool to enhance the groundwater recharge model estimation without dense loggings in the region.",

            "abstract": "Rocks containing large soft magnetic components together with high-coercivity remanence carriers are difficult to analyze by hysteresis loops, first-order reversal curves, or other in-field measurements because the induced magnetization in moderate fields outweighs the remanent component, making it difficult to precisely recover the latter. However, strong remanent aeromagnetic anomalies originating from coarse-grained rocks that contain abundant multidomain magnetite, such as the Mt. Harcus intrusions (Musgrave Province, South Australia), attest that such rocks can also contain strong remanent components. To better identify and characterize thisremanent component it is useful to measure the Preisach distribution in the remanent region using field steps adapted to the distribution of the coercive fields of the sample.\nMeasuring remanence directly confers a variety of advantages, including higher sensitivity to remanent components as compared to in-field measurements. The technique allows the quantification of total remanence carried by individual components in samples with complex mineralogies. Moreover, magnetostatic interaction between induced and remanent magnetization components is avoided and does not distort the inferred remanence distribution. We provide several examples for this measurement approach and show how it can be used to distinguish multiple remanence fractions and their interactions.",

            "abstract": "Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 is a mid-Pleistocene interglacial, characterized by a minimum in orbital eccentricity, and therefore often studied as a climate analogue for the Holocene (MIS 1). However, a slightly different phasing of obliquity and precession between these two interglacials sparks strong interrogatives about the MIS 1-11 alignment and its meaningfulness for Holocene predictions.\nMIS 11c represents an unusually long warm subphase immediately after the “Mid-Brunhes Event” (≈430 ka bp), which marks the passage from the 40 ka (obliquity-) to the 100 ka (eccentricity-driven) world. The following subphases MIS 11b and MIS 11a, represent a series of cold-warm oscillations, terminated by the glacial inception of MIS10.\nOur aim is to describe atmospheric circulation patterns and their changes through glacial and interglacial transitions while tracking the evolution of the respective terrestrial temperatures and levels of biomass burning.\nWe worked on a peat core from Tenaghi Philippon, an intramontane peat deposit in Eastern Macedonia (Greece); its position at the convergence zone of Atlantic, monsoonal and Siberian-influenced climates makes it an excellent archive to study climate change during MIS11 in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nWe show the stable hydrogen isotopic composition of higher plant waxes (δD) as proxy for changes in atmospheric circulation and related shifts of moisture source, together with changes in air temperature based on GDGTs (Glycerol Dialkyl Glycerol Tetraethers) analysis. In addition, we studied the chain-length distribution of higher plant-wax n-alkanes to derive the “aquatic index” (Paq), a measure of wetland aggradation. Paq varies between 0.2 and 0.9, indicating pronounced shifts of the water table throughout the record, and neatly traces Termination V (the warming leading to MIS11), MIS11c as well as the inception of MIS10.\nLevoglucosan in turn, a marker for biomass burning, shows a strong glacial-interglacial dichotomy with low levels throughout Termination V and MIS11 followed by elevated values after the MIS10 glacial inception.",

During this period the global CH4 growth rate showed large and unexpected variations, providing an excellent test case for the inverse modelling approach. Although estimates from single inversions are difficult to test, for lack of truly independent flux estimates on the scales addressed by the inversion, results of inversion inter-comparisons have made us aware of the size of the challenge. It is difficult to obtain robust estimates beyond the scale of broad latitudinal bands, because of uncertainties in atmospheric transport and limitations in the availability of measurements. Several efforts have been made in the past years to meet the challenge, including the use of different kinds of measurements (tall tower networks, satellites), and modelling approaches (inversion techniques and the use of process models). The aim of this presentation is to provide an overview of those activities, including new directions (new instrumentation, and ways of combining different kinds of data) and the propects they offer for the near future.",

            "abstract": "Despite several decades of development, general circulation models are still affected by persistent, unresolved systematic biases, particularly in the Tropics. The problems caused by these biases are especially acute in seasonal and decadal forecasting, where any drift in the model can dominate a forecast. Fixing these biases requires correction algorithms for which the physical basis is difficult to justify.\nIn this study, we identify the causes of systematic biases present in the tropical Pacific in the ECMWF’s seasonal prediction System 4 model, via the detailed analysis of the initial drift away from observations in retrospective forecasts (“hindcasts”). Specifically, we examine the chain of events that lead to the spurious northward displacement of the West Pacific intertropical convergence zone by a few degrees in operational seasonal hindcasts.\nBy comparing hindcasts both with a coupled ocean and sea-surface temperatures prescribed from observations, we are able to trace the source of this drift back to a pulse of easterly wind bias in the atmosphere component of the model that lasts for the first 40 days and extends over much of the western Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Collisionless shock waves play a crucial role in producing high energy particles (cosmic rays) in space. While most of the past studies about particle acceleration assume the presence of a single shock, in space two shocks frequently come close to or even collide with each other. Hietala et al. [2011] observed the collision of an interplanetary shock and the earth’s bow shock and the associated acceleration of energetic ions. The kinetic natures of a shock-shock collision has not been well understood. Only the work done by using hybrid simulation was reported by Cargill et al. [1986], in which they focus on a collision of two supercritical shocks and the resultant ion acceleration.\nWe expect similarly that electron acceleration can also occur in shock-shock collision. To investigate the electron acceleration process in a shock-shock collision, we perform one-dimensional full particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. In the simulation energetic electrons are observed between the two approaching shocks before colliding. These energetic electrons are efficiently accelerated through multiple reflections at the two shocks (Fermi acceleration). The reflected electrons create a temperature anisotropy and excite large amplitude waves upstream via the electron fire hose instability. The large amplitude waves can scatter the energetic electrons in pitch angle so that some of them gain large pitch angles and are easily reflected when they encounter the shocks subsequently. The reflected electrons can sustain, or probably even strengthen, them.\nWe further discuss observational results of an interaction of interplanetary shocks and the earth’s bow shock by examining mainly Cluster data. We focus on whether or not electrons are accelerated in the shock-shock interaction.",

Water and aeolian dust (60-70%), in combination with biological oxidation or inorganic precipitation processes, or even a combination of both, induce varnish growth rates of a few µm per 1000 a, indicating that element enrichment and aging processes are of major importance for the varnish formation.\nA combination of 200 nm-fs laser- and 213 nm-ns laser ablation- inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), focused ion beam (FIB) slicing, and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy-near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (STXM-NEXAFS) was chosen for high-spatial-resolution analyses. The aim was to identify provenance, chemistry, and dynamics of the varnishes, and their formation over the millennia.\nTo this end, mineral dust and adjacent varnishes were sampled in six arid to semi-arid deserts, in Israel, South Africa, California, and Saudi Arabia. Dust minerals incorporated in the varnishes were examined by STXM-NEXAFS spectroscopic and element mapping at the nm scale. Varnishes from different locations can be distinguished by element ratio plots of Pb/Ni vs. Mn/Ba. A comparison of dust element ratios of particles <50 µm to ratios of adjacent varnishes reveals much lower values for dust. However, the factors between the element ratios of dust and of varnish are similar for four of six regions (Mn/Ba: 6 ± 2; Pb/Ni: 4 ± 3). Two of the six regions diverge, which are South African (Mn/Ba: 20, Pb/Ni: 0.5) and Californian (Anza Borrego Desert: Mn/Ba: 4.5; Pb/Ni: 16.5) varnishes.\nThe results indicate that the enrichment and degradation processes might be similar for most locations, and that Mn and Pb are preferably incorporated and immobilized in most varnishes compared to Ba and Ni. The Pb/Ni ratios of the South African varnishes are indicators for either a preferred incorporation of Ni compared to Pb from available dust, and therefore possibly a different genesis, or it shows a changed dust source over time, or even an additional element source. The latter two arguments, or even Pb pollution by automobiles, might also be true for the Anza Borrego varnish with its higher Pb/Ni ratios.

This model diversity has reduced little over the past decade, despite advances in scientific understanding. We apply a novel, multi-variable perturbation approach to quantify the sensitivity of ozone and OH to important climate-relevant variables, poorly-characterized physical processes and uncertain anthropogenic emissions, using three independent global chemistry transport models. We show a clear sensitivity of tropospheric ozone to precursor emissions and to atmospheric humidity which is similar over the models, but note large differences for methane lifetime, highlighting substantial differences in the sensitivity of OH to primary and secondary production. This approach allows us to identify key areas where model improvements are required while providing valuable new insight into the processes driving tropospheric composition change.",

            "abstract": "Glacier area on the Tibetan Plateau (TP hereafter) and its change were studied in different drainage basins by time series of Landsat satellite images since the 1970s. High resolution of various optical images of good quality, with minimal cloud and snow cover, were selected for glacier extraction on TP. There were 240 scenes of Landsat MSS with 60 m spatial resolution in 1970s. There are 150 scenes of Landsat7 ETM+ images (spatial resolution: 30m) were selected for periods of 1999-2002. 148 scenes of L1T were selected from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) of Landsat 8 with 30-m multi-spectral spatial resolutions. All satellite data were mosaicked to represent three periods, i.e. 1970s, 2000s, 2013/2014. The majority date in each period was adopted as the mosaic image date: i.e. 1976, 2001 and 2013. Glacier outlines were digitized manually based on the three mosaics by RGB: 432, with reference of SRTM DEM v4.1 and Google Earth imagery. The adjacent glaciers were regarded as continuous ice body, or glacier complexes that have not been subdivided into single glaciers. The debris-covered ice was not involved in the study. Overall glacier area uncertainty was evaluated at three study sites here where our previous regional studies available by different methods, which includes the Mt. Qomolangma, Mt. Naimona’Nyi, Mt. Geladandong. All evaluations were carried out in the same periods. The largest difference between the data sets was within ~±8%. In 1976, glaciers cover 1.7% of the TP study area as a whole, however, 56% of all the studied glacier area locates in interior drainage basins (IB hereafter). Glacier area on the TP has decreased at an accelerating rate over the last several decades, from 44,366 ± 4329 km2 in 1976 to 42,210 ± 2469 km2 in 2001 (area change was -2,156 km2 by -4.86%, or -0.19% a-1), and further decreased to 41,137 ± 2269 km2 in 2013 (area change was -1,073 km2 by -2.54%, or -0.21% a-1).\nICESat/GLAS data from 2003–2009 were used to calculate glacier surface elevation and its mass changes over TP. Glacier surface elevation changes were calculated, and glacier mass changes evaluated, for each glacier in the Second Chinese Glacier Inventory. For external catchments on TP, glacier mass change totalled by -16.13 ± 5.8 Gt a-1 during 2003-2009. For internal basins on TP, glacier mass change totalled by -4.32 ± 1.2 Gt a-1 during 2003-2009.",

One the most important question is how this seismic gap will break in the future. This question is not only important from a scientific point view but also it is relevant for seismic hazard assessment. In this contribution, we propose a methodology to identify the most suitable region for future earthquakes in a mature seismic gap. We adopt a deterministic approach by using some geophysical/geodetic parameters as b value, trench parallel gravity anomaly and interseismic coupling. These parameters represent a physical constraint for short/long term suitable regions for future great earthquakes. In order to weight the contribution of each parameter, we assume the short-long term seismic index (SLTS index), we perform a Monte Carlo simulation using as a calibration measurement the greatest earthquakes occurred in the region. In order to visualize the regional distribution of the SLTS index in the megathrust, we divide the fault in bins of 20 x 20 km. In each bin, we calculate the SLTS index and the moment deficit since the last greatest earthquake. Model results using this SLTS index highlight the most likely domains of short-long term asperities able to nucleate earthquakes in the region. The slip distribution of the Iquique 2014 earthquake validates the reliability of this SLTS index.",

            "abstract": "The continuous growth of the human population demands an equally growing supply for fresh water and food. As a result, available land for efficient agriculture is constantly diminishing which forces farmers to cultivate inferior croplands and intensify agricultural practices, e.g., increase the use of synthetic fertilizers. This intensification of marginal areas in particular will cause a dangerous rise in nitrate discharge into open waters or even drinking water resources. In order to reduce the amount of nitrate lost by surface runoff or lateral subsurface transport, bufferstrips have proved to be a valuable means. Current laws, however, promote rather static designs (i.e., width and usage) even though a multitude of factors, e.g., soil type, slope, vegetation and the nearby agricultural management, determines its effectiveness. We propose a spatially explicit modeling approach enabling to assess the effects of those factors on nitrate discharge from arable lands using the fully distributed hydrology model CMF coupled to the complex biogeochemical model LandscapeDNDC. Such a modeling scheme allows to observe the displacement of dissolved nutrients in both vertical and horizontal directions and serves to estimate both their uptake by the vegetated bufferstrip and loss to the environment. First results indicate a significant reduction of nitrate loss in the presence of a bufferstrip (2.5 m). We show effects induced by various buffer strip widths and plant cover on the nitrate retention.",

Coming satellite missions as, CYGNSS and GEROS, are focusing on GNSS ocean reflected measurements. Thus, simulation studies, highlighting the assumptions for the data retrievals and the precision and the accuracy, are of interest for assessing the observational data content.\nSimulations of the low-elevation ocean reflected GNSS signal reveal a ducting of the signal when applying a model of the boundary layer. This effect is presented during varying conditions of the sea surface roughness, ocean wind and temperature, density and gradient of the water vapor profile in the boundary layer.\nThe model for the sea surface roughness impedance, wind speed, and rms ocean wave-height show a stronger signal damping for a smoother ocean surfaces (sea state 0) compared to a rough sea (sea state 4). While the real part of the signal shows the reverse effect. At the same time the reflection zone enhances for rough sea states. Simulations, including a standard atmosphere and a boundary layer, give a significant ducting of the received signal, leading to a much larger reflection zone (and broader received power spectra).\nThe spectral analysis of the simulated surface reflected signals shows spectral structures that could be used for the extraction of parameters as, boundary layer height and atmosphere water vapor density, sea surface roughness, ocean wave heights, and surface wind speed. The presented simulations will quantify how these parameters are derived from the observations.\nOur simulator uses a finite difference solution to the parabolic wave equation using the split-step sine transformation. The ocean surface is modeled through the use of an impedance model, which gives an accurate lower boundary condition in the determination of the electromagnetic field. A semi-isotropic Philips spectrum is used to represent the air-sea interaction.",

            "abstract": "Mo isotopes have been widely used as a tool to constrain redox-conditions during major global events such as the oxygenation of the oceans in the Precambrian and Cretaceous Ocean Anoxic Events. In addition, Mo isotopes have considerable, yet underexplored potential to quantitatively track local redox-variation at high resolution on shorter timescales.\nHere we present data from piston core M77/2-024-5 that was retrieved in the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone in the context of Collaborative Research Centre (SFB) 754 of the Deutsche Forschungs Gemeinschaft (DFG). The age model for this core is well constrained and the core covers the last 140 ka with a hiatus between 20 and 50 ky BP. The oxygen minimum zone along the Peru continental margin is thought to have been better ventilated and therefore less pronounced during glacial periods compared to interglacials. Concentrations of redox-sensitive trace elements show high-amplitude changes and indicate periods of strongly sulphidic conditions with high Mo fixation rate and oxygenated periods with limited Mo fixation (Scholz et al 2014).\nMo isotopes do not show straightforward correlations with elemental redox tracers and are only weakly correlated with Mo/U and total organic carbon (TOC). However, Mo isotopes become significantly heavier around the last glacial maximum (Δ98Mo of 0.4 permil). The observed signatures indicate that the Mo isotope composition is dominated by changes in the operating Mo delivery mechanism, i.e. particulate transport versus molecular diffusion. Our results suggest that Mo isotopes can track local redox variation therefore adding to our understanding of this complex indicator for marine environmental change.\nScholz et al., (2014), Nature Geosciences, Vol. 7, Pages 433-437",

            "abstract": "Evidence from seaward dipping reflector distributions has recently suggested that segmentation plays a major role in the pattern of volcanism during breakup, particularly in the South Atlantic. At a larger scale, variations in mantle temperature and lithosphere thickness can enhance or reduce volcanism. To understand what generates along strike variation of volcanism at conjugate margins, we measure the thickness of earliest oceanic crust in the South Atlantic, south of the Walvis and Rio Grande ridges. We use data from 29 published wide-angle and multichannel seismic profiles and at least 14 unpublished multichannel seismic profiles. A strong linear trend between initial oceanic crustal thickness and distance from hotspot centres, defined as the commencement of Walvis and Rio Grande ridges, with a regression coefficient of 0.7, is observed. At 450km south of the Walvis Ridge, earliest oceanic crustal thickness is found to be 11.7km. This reduces to 7.0km in the south at a distance of 1,420km. Such a linear trend suggests rift segmentation plays a secondary role on volcanism during breakup. To explore the cause of this trend, we use a 2D numerical model of extension capable of predicting the volume and composition of melt generated by decompressional melting during extension to steady state seafloor spreading. We explore the effect of both mantle temperature and lithosphere thickness on melt production with a thermal anomaly (hot layer) 100km thick located below the lithosphere with an excess temperature of 50-200°C, and lithospheric thickness ranging from 125-140km, covering the thickness range estimated from tomographic studies. By focusing on a set of key seismic profiles, we show a reduction in hot layer temperature is needed in order to match observed oceanic crustal thickness, even when the effect of north to south variations in lithosphere thickness are included. This model implies that the observed oceanic thickness requires the influence of a hot layer up to 1,500km away from the hotspot centre, with temperatures decreasing from 200 to 75°C from north to south. This decrease in mantle temperature, also seen in published thermobarometry results, suggests that temperature is the primary control of volcanism during breakup of the southern South Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "Standard Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) have repeatedly been hobbled by the inability of rock to conductively transfer heat at rates sufficient to re-supply heat extracted convectively via artificially made fracture systems. At the root of this imbalance is the basic magnitude of thermal diffusivity for most rocks, which severely hampers heat flow once the cooled halos about fractures reach ~0.1 m or greater. This inefficiency is exacerbated by the standard EGS design of mainly horizontally constructed fracture systems with inflow and outflow access at the margins of the fracture network.\nWe introduced an alternative system whereby the heat exchanger mimics a conventional radiator in an internal combustion engine, which we call a Radiator-EGS (i.e., RAD-EGS). The heat exchanger is built vertically with cool water entering the base and hot water extracted at the top. The RAD-EGS itself consists of a family of vertical vanes produced through sequential horizontal drilling and permeability stimulation through propellant fracking. The manufactured fracture zones share the orientation of the natural transmissive fracture system. As below about 700 m, S1 is vertical and the average strike of transmissive fractures parallels SHmax, creating vertical fractures that include S1 and SHmax requires drilling stacked laterals parallel to SHmax. The RAD-EGS is also based on the observation that the longevity of natural hydrothermal systems depends on thermal recharge through heat convection but not heat conduction.\nIn this paper, we present numerical simulations that examine the effects of the depths of the injector and extraction wells, vane size, coolant flow rate, the natural crustal geothermal gradient, and natural regional background flow on geothermal energy extraction.",

This stabilizes the structure relative to the anhydrous assemblage of the Earth’s lower mantle and explains the high-temperature stability of these minerals. Molecular dynamic calculations of these minerals demonstrate the mobility of H in these hydrous solid solutions, suggesting a geophysical means to detect the presence of water in the Earth’s lower mantle.",

These initial results come the UK’s Ice in Clouds Experiment – Dust (UK ICE-D). UK ICE-D was an aircraft and ground-based project based in Cape Verde off the coast of Senegal, Africa during August 2015. The overall goal of this experiment was to determine how desert dust affects primary nucleation of ice particles in convective and layer clouds as well as the subsequent development of precipitation and glaciation of the clouds. This was accomplished by making focused observations when dust was present in high concentrations and when almost no dust was present. Here we focus on examining the differences in hydrometeor types derived from the dual-polarised X-band radar observations observed in the high and low dust loadings with specific emphasis on the role of supercooled rain drops in these two situations.

            "abstract": "Peatlands contain around one third of the global soil carbon (C) stock. Understanding the processes in peatland C cycling, and in particular those involved in the release of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere, is a current research priority. Natural open-water pools are a common feature of many peatlands, and previous research suggests pools can be strong sources of atmospheric GHGs, particularly CH4, and thus have the potential to play an important role in global radiative forcing. The area of open-water in peatlands is rapidly expanding in a warming Arctic (e.g. Walter et al., 2007) while artificially created pools are becoming more commonplace in the recent drive to restore the hydrological functioning of drained peatlands by blocking ditches.\nWe present the results of >2 years of comprehensive field monitoring from pool complexes in the Flow Country of northern Scotland, the largest expanse (c.4000 km2) of blanket bog in Europe. Concentrations and fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are presented from 12 intensively monitored pools and the adjacent terrestrial surface. We examined both natural (n = 6) and artificial (n = 6) pools, which allowed us to quantify how pools created during restoration compare to undisturbed sites. C and hydrology budgets were determined for the study pools and the adjacent terrestrial surface. Dissolved concentrations of GHGs ranged from 0.08−4.68 mg CO2-C L-1 and 0.01−731 µg CH4-C L-1 in natural pools, and 0.29−10.38 mg CO2-C L-1 and 0.04−239 µg CH4-C L-1 in artificial pools. GHG fluxes from natural pool surfaces ranged between -2.47−653 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 and -31.7−14.8 g CO2 m-2 d-1. Artificial pool GHG fluxes were -8.19−581 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 and -7.66−34.9 g CO2 m-2 d-1. We provide more accurate GHG budgets for peatlands with natural pool complexes by considering their relative importance at the landscape-scale, and outline the potential effect on GHG fluxes when creating artificial pools during peatland restoration activities.\nWALTER, K.

            "abstract": "Effects of absorbing aerosol on atmospheric dynamics are usually investigated with help of general circulation models or also regional models that represent the atmospheric system as realistic as possible. Reducing the complexity of models used to study the effects of absorbing aerosol on atmospheric dynamics helps to understand underlying mechanisms. In this study, by using ECHAM6 General Circulation Model (GCM) in an Aquaplanet setting and using simplified aerosol climatology, an initial idealization step has been taken. The analysis only considers direct radiative effects, furthering the reduction of complex model results. The simulations include cases including aerosol radiative forcing, no aerosol forcing, coarse mode aerosol forcing only (as approximation for mineral dust forcing) and forcing with increased aerosol absorption. The results showed that increased absorption affects cloud cover mainly in subtropics. Hadley circulation is found to be weakened in the increased absorption case. To compare the results of the idealized model with a more realistic model setting, the results of the regional model COSMO-MUSCAT that includes interactive mineral dust aerosol and considers the effects of dust radiative forcing are also analyzed. The regional model computes the atmospheric circulation for the year 2007 twice, including the feedback of dust and excluding the dust aerosol forcing. It is investigated to which extent the atmospheric response to the dust forcing agrees with the simplified Aquaplanet results. As expected, in the regional model mineral dust causes an increase in the temperature right above the dust layer while reducing the temperature close to the surface. In both models the presence of aerosol forcing leads to increased specific humidity, close to ITCZ. Notwithstanding the difference magnitudes, comparisons of the global aquaplanet and the regional model showed similar patterns. Further detailed comparisons will be presented.",

In combination with the improvements of global geoids it has furthermore provided an opportunity to improve the MDT related to ocean currents.\nAfter the launch of CryoSat-2 in 2010 the coverage was increased dramatically while the introduction of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and SAR interferometry (SARin) mode increased the amount of useful echoes in the Arctic Ocean. The new types of radar observation modes have been investigated and methods to retrack and classify the waveforms have been implemented in LARS the advanced retracking system (LARS).

Due to its inert behaviour it has also been extensively used as a tracer of transport in the ocean, the troposphere and the stratosphere. We here combine long-term tropospheric records obtained from the Cape Grim Baseline station, Tasmania, with stratospheric data from high-altitude aircraft and balloon campaigns. We then assess the novel use of several alternative transport tracers (e.g. C2F6, C3F8 and HFC-23) in the stratosphere. The results indicate good suitability for some of these gases in terms of their inertness, tropospheric growth rates and measurement precisions. In addition we and compare the derived mean ages to those obtained from SF6 and find indications for the possibility of the existence of a stratospheric SF6 sink. The latter finding would also imply that the total atmospheric lifetime of SF6 is substantially shorter than previously believed, with further implications for its use as a transport tracer in the stratosphere.",

            "abstract": "The North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) is possibly a major influence on global climate through its influence on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but the decadal-scale cyclicity and limited observations (≈50 years) of the NPO make it difficult to explore this relationship. One approach to this problem is to use marine archives (e.g., corals and sediments) to build significantly longer records of the oceanic expression of the NPO—the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). For example, the strengthened winds associated with positive NPO sea level pressure distributions increase gyre circulation, increasing upwelling in the coastal northeastern Pacific and equatorward flow of the California Current. However, marine archives along the coast are potentially influenced by both NPGO and ENSO and are not ideal. Here we demonstrate that corals from the Revillagigedo Islands—in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP)—provide a relatively “clean” record of NPGO variability. In particular, coral Δ14C and δ18O show fluctuations between salty / Δ14C “young” waters (native to the ETNP) and fresh / Δ14C “old” waters (similar to those upwelled off the California margin). This variability is highly coherent and consistent with the NPGO index, such that positive NPGO (and therefore NPO) corresponds to a increased presence of California Current waters in the ETNP. ENSO appears to have little influence on this record, probably because of minimal change in seawater Δ14C associated with the poleward propagating Kelvin waves associated with ENSO. Pre-instrumental records of NPGO, like these from the Revillagigedo Island corals, are necessary to begin understanding the tropical-subtropical drivers of NPO, ENSO, and other ocean-atmosphere climate phenomena.",

            "abstract": "Several studies in the past three decades have demonstrated the role played by monitoring chemical and isotopic composition of dissolved gases in groundwaters hosted in volcanic area, which represents by now a powerful tool to evaluate the state of activity of volcanoes and its evolution. The first step to make it possible, is a comprehensive understanding of fluids circulation inside the volcano edifice, starting from groundwaters characterization up to the identification of the underground pathways and their relationships with tectonic structures, that enhance interactions between waters and magmatic gases.\nIn this work, we focussed on chemical composition of inert dissolved gases (He, Ne, N2) and He isotope abundances coming from groundwaters circulating in Mt Etna, as having great contrast between magmatic and shallow sources and no chemical interaction with rocks. We identified waters which intersect anomalous degassing areas, such as well evident or buried tectonic structures. These waters show both nearly magmatic He isotopic composition and high ratios of dissolved magmatic gases (He, CO2) versus the atmospherics ones (N2). Along the hydrologic flow-lines and faraway from the degassing structures, we found waters with lower He isotopic ratios and consequently richer of atmospheric-derived gases (Ne, N2). On this basis, we set-up a model of unidimensional dispersion-advection, coupled to a two-layer dynamic exchange of volatiles between the aquifer surface and atmosphere. The model is able to quantitatively explain the progressive “dilution” of the magmatic signal through several kilometres-long distances, from the source point of the anomaly towards the final stage of flow-lines at the coast. Typical hydro geological parameters, such as rock permeability, could be constrained by this approach. Moreover, anomalous compositions found along water flow-lines could represent possible new sources of degassing, allowing to detect hidden degassing structures.",

            "abstract": "Winds are usually considered to force the ocean but recent studies suggested that oceanic mesoscale activity, characterized by eddies, filaments and fronts, could also affect the wind field. These structures feature abrupt changes in sea surface temperature (SST), surface pressure and surface currents that could impact the atmosphere by enhancing/reducing air-sea fluxes, accelerating/decelerating winds, modifying the wind-pressure balance… At this time, the detailed processes associated to such coupling, its intensity and significance remain a matter of research.\nHere, a state-of-the-art WRF-OASIS-NEMO coupled model is set up over a wide tropical channel (45°S-45°N) at various resolutions: 3/4°, 1/4° and 1/12° in both the ocean and the atmosphere. Several experiments are conducted in forced, partially or fully coupled modes, to highlight the effect of resolution and the role of SST vs. current feedback to energy injection into the ocean and the atmosphere.\nIn strong mesoscale activity regions, a negative wind power input from the atmosphere to the ocean is seen at scales ranging from 100km to more than 1000km. Nonexistent at 3/4°, this negative forcing, acting against oceanic mesoscale activity, is almost twice more important at 1/12° than at 1/4°. In addition, partially coupled simulations, i.e. without current feedback, show that the impact of thermal coupling on this process is very limited.\nEnergy injection to the marine atmospheric boundary layer also features imprints from oceanic mesoscale. Energy injection by scales shorter than 300km represents up to 20% of the total. Finally we show that increasing oceanic resolution, and therefore mesoscale activity, is necessary to resolve the full wind stress spectrum and has an upscaling effect by enhancing atmospheric mesoscale, which is larger scale than in the ocean. Using 1/4°oceanic resolution instead of 1/12° leads to a 50% loss of energy in the atmospheric mesoscale.",

MOVE-PWV retrievals have comparatively similar trends and reasonable agreement with REF-PWV with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.4 mm and R2 of 0.61 indicating a statistical significance at the 1% level (p-value of 0.01). Especially PWV retrievals from the June cases showed better agreement (mean bias of 2.1 mm and RMSE of 3.8 mm) with the other cases. We further investigated the relationships of determinant factors of GPS signals with the PWV retrievals for the detailed error analysis. As a result, both multipath (MP) errors of L1 and L2 pseudo-range had the best indices (0.75~0.99 m) for the June cases. We also found that both position dilution of precision (PDOP) and signal to noise ratio (SNR) values in June cases during the 1st period (0000~0100 UTC) are better (lower and higher) than those in Non-June cases, which is strongly associated with good accuracy (RMSE of 3.5 mm) of PWV in June cases. These results clearly demonstrate those effects on PWV accuracy, that is, analytic results of the key factors (MP errors, PDOP, and SNR) that could affect GPS signals should be considered for obtaining more stable performance. Taking advantage of MOVE, we would provide water vapor information with high spatial and temporal resolutions in case that weather dramatically changes such as in Korean Peninsula.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic archipelago of Svalbard is covered by very different types of glaciers reaching from large, flat and evenly formed ice caps to small, steep and narrow valley glaciers. Due to this high level of complexity and variability any glacier mass balance modeling is especially challenging. On such a regional-scales, it requires spatially distributed input data that reliably reproduce the variability of climate elements across the different terrain situations.\nModeling of glacier mass balance under such circumstances is increasingly based on output from regional climate models. However, the limited accuracy and spatial resolution of accordingly derived meteorological input often poses limitations when looking on subregional or local scales. Moreover, such meteorological input is still rarely available for larger regions and longer time periods.\nThis contribution presents and compares two very different studies. First, an evaluation is shown that analyses to which extent it is possible to derive reliable region-wide glacier mass balances for Svalbard on the basis of only coarse resolution (10 km) regional climate model output. A basic, index-based model with predefined parameters is used for mass-balance calculations in this case. All necessary calibrations and adjustments are done exclusively on the side of model forcing, i.e. the air temperature and precipitation fields of the regional climate model. Second, the contribution presents first results of an archipelago-wide energy balance modeling effort that is forced by 500 m resolution data of the recently developed high-resolution surface climatology HiRSvaC500. This dataset is especially designed to be applied in glacier mass balance modeling across Svalbard.\nIn situ reference for both modeling studies is provided by several hundred point mass balance measurements. This contribution shows and explains differences between the results of the two modeling studies. It outlines challenges and solutions during mass balance model calibrations and applications. And, in addition, it especially deals with the influences of the different, regionally varying accuracies of the applied modeling approaches and their impact on the reliability of Svalbard-wide glacier mass balance numbers.",

            "abstract": "Our world is full of many different types of granular materials. This includes materials such as silt, sand, and gravel and have various sizes and properties. It is of interest to simulate and visualize granular media as it can provide additional analysis and insight into geologic events such as landslides or debris flows. Unfortunately, this can be a computationally complex problem due to the large amount of physical interaction between granular materials. To help alleviate this problem, we have developed a method to represent granular media using a technique called a 3D Voronoi Subdivision Tree. The idea behind our method is to take a convex terrain volume and use a subdivision tree to build smaller, granular subpieces contained within the volume. We use a 3D Voronoi subdivision technique to create smaller granular convex cells and then store them in the tree. The tree is dynamic and adaptive as it only represents individual granular media when they are needed. In addition, as each of the granular subpieces are created, we can also store attributes of that granular material in the tree node. This ensures a diversity of granular materials contained within the volume. In order to maintain performance during simulation, we can dynamically replace parts of the granular volume with smaller granular subpieces just by traversing the tree. In essence, this allows for many different granular materials to be represented within the volume while reducing computational complexity. As such, this helps with simulation performance so that focus can be placed on simulation analysis. We feel our method is helpful for simulating geologic events with granular materials and will assist geoscientists in understanding them.",

            "abstract": "The tropical cyclone mesoscale structure is not represented in global climate models (GCM) with horizontal resolution of 0.5° to 1°. It is however possible to simulate initiation and intensification of tropical depressions vortices (TDV) that have characteristics similar to observed tropical cyclones. This is especially interesting to analyze modification of the cyclonic activity related, for example, to global warming. In this framework, it is necessary to understand how TDV characteristics are related to the GCM formulation. We use the LMD-Z GCM to study the sensitivity of TDV characteristics to different formulations of the convective scheme. Using the “zoom” capability of LMD-Z, the horizontal resolution is set to 0.75° over a large region covering West Africa and the North Atlantic. The GCM is free to run in this region and is tied to ERA-Interim reanalysis outside that region. We use the Tiedtke convective scheme with entrainment and closure based on the moisture convergence, or with an entrainment based on the relative humidity of the environment, and additionally with a closure based on CAPE. Each configuration is run for 10 years between 2000 and 2009 with prescribed SST.\nAn original approach is used to track TDV and the results are compared to ERA-Interim. Another tracking algorithm based on vorticity, wind speed and warm core, is also used to estimate the associated cyclonic activity and to compare it to observations (i.e. the IBTrACS dataset). Results show a large sensitivity of the TDV characteristics (such as initiation, duration, strength) to the formulation of the convective scheme. For example, the entrainment based on the relative humidity tends to increase the convective precipitation in the moist environment of the vortices above the ocean, leading to stronger and more numerous TDVs with longer duration. On the opposite, most TDV initiated over West Africa dissipate too soon over the continent with the entrainment based on the relative humidity and do not reach the North Atlantic. The origin of the TDV in the GCM is thus dependent on characteristics of the convective scheme. Implications for the study of the sensitivity of cyclonic activity to large-scale forcing, related for example to a warmer climate, are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Ice-surface roughness is a poorly parameterised component of most surface energy balance models, often being represented by a single constant value, or effective roughness length. Yet it plays an important role in determining sensible heat flux, which may contribute ~30% to the overall surface energy balance at high-latitudes. Measurements of ice-surface roughness have thus far been dominated by microtopographic and one-dimensional profile-based approaches, which generate rather crude assessments of roughness length. The availability of fine-resolution and multi-temporal topographic datasets offers an opportunity to develop more robust methods. Using a combined Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) approach, we demonstrate that glacier-wide surface roughness can be characterised over multiple time periods, meaning sensible heat transfer can be much better parameterised in energy balance modelling.\nHere we present fine-scale topographic data from 30 plots, each measuring 2 m x 2 m, acquired on Kårsaglaciären, Northern Sweden over a period of four days. Glacier surface types included smooth/superimposed ice, runnels, cryoconite, sun cusps, blocky crystalline ice, supraglacial channels, dirty ice, light/medium/dense scree-covered ice, shallow/deep crevasses and snow. We test multiple methods for extracting z0 and demonstrate a novel 3D approach that uses the dense point cloud rather than a decimated (2D) product. Z0 is shown to vary widely over different surface types, with values ranging over more than an order of magnitude. The evolution of surface roughness is also shown to vary with surface type, with some plots becoming rougher and others becoming smoother through time. Finally, we use a glacier-wide DEM generated from TLS to correlate the detrended standard deviation of elevations in each plot with the calculated z0 values and thus produce a glacier-wide characterisation of ice-surface roughness.",

We focus on the well-documented elevated passive margin in southern Scandinavia, and quantify the relative contributions of crustal isostasy and dynamic topography in controlling topography. We find that most topography is compensated by the crustal structure, suggesting a topographic age related to ~400 Myr old orogenesis. In addition, we infer that dynamic uplift (~300 m) has rejuvenated existing topography within the last ~10 Myr. Such uplift can, combined with a general sea level fall, explain observations that have traditionally been interpreted in favor of a peneplain uplift model. We conclude that the high topography along the Scandinavian margin cannot represent remnants of a peneplain uplifted within the last ~20 Myr. Topography must have been high since ~400 Myr. Our results demonstrate that the enigmatic topography on passive margins cannot be attributed to a single causal mechanism.",

            "abstract": "In our recent studies [1-3] we showed that partitioning of many chalcophile elements could be described by a simple relationship as a function of the FeO content of the silicate liquid.\nLogDi ~= A-0.5nlog[FeO]\nwhere A is a constant, n is the constant related to the valency of element i and [FeO] is the concentration of FeO in the silicate melt. For many chalcophile and moderately chalcophile elements (e.g., Zn, Cr, Pb, Sb, In), the fitted slope n depends only on the valency of the element. More lithophile elements (e.g., Ti, Nb, Ce, Ga) exhibit concave upwards behavior on a plot of logD versus log[FeO] due to their strong interaction with oxygen in sulphide, which increases with the increasing FeO content of the silicate liquid. Strongly chalcophile elements, like Cu, Ag and Ni have the opposite trend (concave downwards) and their D decreases both at high (> 10-12wt %) and very low (< 1wt%) FeO contents of the silicate melt. These changes correlate with increasing S content of the silicate melt (up to 11 wt%) as the FeO content of the silicate melt declines to ~0.3wt%. An experiment at 1.5 GPa/1420oC having 4 wt% S and 0.28 wt% FeO in the silicate melt has DCu (sulf/sil) ~ 84, which is about 6 times lower than the DCu(sulf/sil) at identical p-T conditions but at 8 wt% FeO in the silicate melt.\nOur new experimental data on Re partitioning between sulphide and silicate melt in the CMAS+FeO system show that Re behaves similarly to the highly chalcophile elements and exhibits concave downwards behaviour on the LogD/LogFeO diagram. With the highest DRe (sulf/sil) at around 1.5-2.0x104 at 1.5-6.0 wt% FeO in the silicate melt, DRe (sulf/sil) declines to the values of 50-150 at ~0.5 wt% and > ~15 wt% FeO in the silicate melt, respectively. This means that at highly reducing conditions Re is similarly or less chalcophile than some of the highly lithophile elements, like Ta (D ≈ 9), Nb (D ≈ 600), Ti (D ≈ 6) [3].\nThe results mean that in oxidised bodies like Mars and reduced bodies like Mercury, most “lithophile” elements partition more strongly into sulphide than Re and Cu.\n[1] Kiseeva E.

            "abstract": "The tectonically active setting and climatic conditions give Taiwan a high exposure to severe natural hazards. After the Pingtung Earthquake and Morakot Typhoon which occurred in 2006 and 2009, the turbidity currents caused a series of submarine cable breaks along the Gaoping and Fangliao Submarine Canyons off SW Taiwan. Large amounts of terrestrial sediments were fast transported bypass the narrow continental shelf and rapidly moved southward through submarine canyons to the deep sea. Two piston cores which were taken from the Tsangyao Ridge and its adjacent area (OR5-1302-2-MT7 and MT6) might shed light on understanding the export of terrestrial organic carbon to the abyss by submarine geo-hazards. The 210Pb profile of MT7 in conjunction with the grain size data indicates the existence of the Pingtung Earthquake and Morakot Typhoon related deposits. The sedimentation rate of these two cores which derived from 210Pb is approximately 0.05 cm/yr. The cores collected from the Gaoping Submarine Canyon, Gaoping Slope and Fangliao Submarine Canyon are used for analyzing TOC, organic C/N and δ13C ratios. The concentrations of total organic carbon are ~0.5%, and C/N rations almost remain between 4 and 8. The high TOC (~1%) and C/N ratio (>10) are observed in the samples with plant debris. The fluctuation of TOC and C/N ratios in near-shore samples is higher than deep sea. In terms of δ13C-values, it progressively decreases with distances from coastal zone to the deep sea. Due to the larger proportions of land-derived organic carbon, the δ13C-values in the surface sediment of upper Gaoping Submarine Canyon, Gaoping Slope, and the turbidite layers at the head of Fangliao Submarine Canyon are lighter. Furthermore, we use the TOC concentrations and δ13C-values to estimate the fractional contributions of terrestrial organic carbon by a simple two component mixing model, and integrate with the 210Pb-derived sediment accumulation rates to evaluate the organic carbon burial between event layers and normal accumulation period. Our results show the extreme natural geohazard events not only fast transported sediments into the deep sea but also delivered large amounts of organic carbon into abyss, and it may play an important role on the global carbon cycling system.",

Data are replicated to, or are produced at, NCI: in many cases they are processed to higher-level data products. Individual data sets within these collections can range from multi-petabyte climate models and large volume raster arrays, down to gigabyte size, ultra-high resolution data sets.\nAll data are quality assured to being ‘published’ and made accessible as services. Persistent identifiers are assigned during publishing at both the collection and data set level: the granularity and version control on persistent identifiers depend on the dataset.\nHowever, most NERDIP collections are dynamic: either new data is being appended, or else models/derivative products are being revised with new data, or changed as processing methods are improved. Further, because the data are accessible as services, researchers can log in and dynamically create user-defined subsets for specific research projects: inevitably such extracts underpin traditional ‘publications’. Being able to reproduce these exact data extracts can be difficult and for the very larger data sets preserving a copy of large data extracts is out of the question.\nA solution is for the researcher to use provenance workflows that at a minimum capture the version of the data set used, the query and the time of extraction. In parallel, the data provider needs to implement version controls on the data and deploy tracking systems that time stamp when new data are appended, or when modifications are made to existing data and record what these changes are. Where, when and how persistent identifiers are minted on these large and dynamically changing data sets is still open to debate.",

            "abstract": "Rising surface temperatures have been causing firn layers on Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves to compact, a process that is strongly implicated in ice shelf disintegration. Firn compaction is expected to warm the ice column and given sufficiently wet and compacted firn layers, to allow meltwater to penetrate into surface crevasses and thus enhance the potential for hydrofracture. On Larsen C Ice Shelf a compacting firn layer has previously been inferred from airborne radar and satellite data, with strongly reduced air contents in Larsen C’s north and north-west. The hydrological processes governing firn compaction, and the detailed firn structures they produce, have so far remained uncertain however. Using integrated seismic refraction, MASW (Multi-Channel Analysis of Surface Waves), seismoelectric and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data, we reveal vertical and horizontal changes in firn structure across Larsen C Ice Shelf. Particular attention is paid to the spatial prevalence of refrozen meltwaters within firn, such as the massive subsurface ice layer discovered recently by the NERC-funded MIDAS project in Cabinet Inlet in Larsen C’s extreme northwest. Such ice layers or lenses are particularly dramatic manifestations of increased ice shelf densities and temperatures, and contrast sharply with the relatively uncompacted firn layers present in the ice shelf’s southeast. We consider our observations in the context of a one-dimensional firn model for Larsen C Ice Shelf that includes melt percolation and refreezing, and discuss temporal changes in firn layer structures due to surface melt and ponding.",

Model outputs have been incorporated into a decision-support tool that enables users from a wide spectrum of coastal stakeholders (e.g. nuclear energy, utility providers, local government, environmental regulators, communities) to explore the potential impacts of flooding on both operational (events to 10 years) and strategic (10 to 50 years) timescales. Examples illustrate the physical and economic impacts of flooding from combined extreme water levels, wave overtopping and high river flow for Fleetwood, NW England; changes in the extent of likely flooding arising from an extreme event due to sea-level rise for Oldbury, SW England; and the relative vulnerability to overtopping and breaching of sea defences for Dungeness, SE England. The impacts of a potential large-scale beach recharge scheme to mitigate coastal erosion and flood risk along the southern shoreline of Dungeness are also examined using a combination of coastal evolution and particle-tracking modelling. The research goal is to provide an evidence base for resource allocation, investment in interventions, and communication and dialogue in relation to sea-level rise to 2500 AD.",

We develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for joint inversion of Rayleigh- and Love-wave dispersion curves that is able to yield robust radially and azimuthally anisotropic shear velocity profiles, with resolution to depths down to the transition zone.The inversion technique doesn't involve any linearization procedure or strong a priori bounds around a reference model. In a fixed dimensional Bayesian formulation, we choose to set the number of parameters relatively high, with a more dense parametrization in the uppermost mantle in order to have a good resolution of the Litosphere-Astenosphere Boundary region. We apply the MCMC algorithm to the inversion of surface-wave phase velocities accurately determined in broad period ranges in a few test regions. In the Baikal-Mongolia region we invert Rayleigh- and Love- wave dispersion curves for radially anisotropic structure (Vsv,Vsh) of the crust and upper mantle. In the Tuscany region, where we have phase velocity data with good azimuthal coverage, a different implementation of the algorithm is applied that is able to resolve azimuthal anisotropy; the Rayleigh wave dispersion curves measured at different azimuths have been inverted for the Vsv structure and the depth distribution of the 2-ψ azimuthal anisotropy of the region, with good resolution down to asthenospheric and transition zone depths.",

            "abstract": "The success of any model prediction is largely dependent on the accuracy with which its parameters are known. In characterising fracture networks in naturally fractured rocks, the main issues are related with the difficulties in accurately up- and down-scaling the parameters governing the distribution of fracture attributes. Optimal characterisation and analysis of fracture attributes (fracture lengths, apertures, orientations and densities) represents a fundamental step which can aid the estimation of permeability and fluid flow, which are of primary importance in a number of contexts ranging from hydrocarbon production in fractured reservoirs and reservoir stimulation by hydrofracturing, to geothermal energy extraction and deeper Earth systems, such as earthquakes and ocean floor hydrothermal venting.\nThis work focuses on linking fracture data collected directly from outcrops to permeability estimation and fracture network modelling. Outcrop studies can supplement the limited data inherent to natural fractured systems in the subsurface. The study area is a highly fractured upper Miocene biosiliceous mudstone formation cropping out along the coastline north of Santa Cruz (California, USA). These unique outcrops exposes a recently active bitumen-bearing formation representing a geological analogue of a fractured top seal. In order to validate field observations as useful analogues of subsurface reservoirs, we describe a methodology of statistical analysis for more accurate probability distribution of fracture attributes, using Maximum Likelihood Estimators.\nThese procedures aim to understand whether the average permeability of a fracture network can be predicted reducing its uncertainties, and if outcrop measurements of fracture attributes can be used directly to generate statistically identical fracture network models.",

Management tools incorporating both human and natural processes are a fundamental part of forging sustainable solutions to these challenges. While cities are in some ways complex, they also are constructed following relatively consistent methods and norms, particularly in the post-WWII period of rapid urban growth. This regularity can provide insights into the function of urban systems. Using Pittsburgh, PA, the influence of the road network on sewer network characteristics and resulting sewer hydrology is demonstrated. As sewers generally follow road right of ways to simplify access, urban drainage networks inherit extremely dense and rectilinear forms, distinct from most drainage networks. These forms focus flows and dictate patterns of cross-connections between human and hydrologic systems. With improved understanding of resulting patterns, designs for more sustainable, next-generation infrastructure can be more effectively implemented.",

The highest concentration of Chl a was found Amundsen Polynya (AP), during austral summer in 2014 and 2012. Average concentration of Chl a was 3.92μg/l in 2014, 1.56μg/l in 2012 at AP. The major phytoplankton groups were diatoms and prymnesiophytes and minor groups are cryptophytes, chlorophytes, dinophytes, and crysophytes. Variability in composition of phytoplankton at SIZ, AP and IS in the Amundsen Sea was distinct. The predominance of Phaeocystis antarctica (70-90%) at all station was found in austral summer in both 2012 and 2014, except at SIZ in 2012. The CDOM values are in the range of 0.07~0.98m-1 and were relatively high at the surface of the AP. The CDOM values at AP in mixed layer depth with 0.33m-1 in average was very higher than any other region of the Southern Ocean. The CDOM showed positive correlation with Chl a and no clear relation with salinity, which implies biological process is the main source of CDOM in the study area. The high CDOM related with P. antarctica in the AP suggest the potential heat absorbing factor and source of CO2 by photobleaching of the Amundsen Sea. The CDOM can be negative effect on the function of the biological pump by phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean. Variation of S value are great from 9μm-1 to 27μm-1, which indicates mixture or young and old CDOM at the surface layer, but higher in S value in AP below 100m depth reflects the high primary productivity in upper layer and the low S value shown the old refractory DOM at SIZ and IS.\nKeywords : Chl a, CDOM, slope diatoms, Phaeocystis, polynya, Amundsen Sea",

            "abstract": "The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; 55 Ma) was a ~170 kyr period of global warming associated with rapid and massive injections of 13C-depleted carbon into the ocean and atmosphere, reflected in sedimentary components as a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE). Carbon cycle modelling has indicated that the shape of the CIE, which consists of a rapid onset, a prolonged phase of stable low δ13C and subsequent recovery, is best explained by an initial large pulse (3,000 Pg), followed by ~50 kyr of slow continuous release of 13C-depleted carbon (1,480 Pg). Suggested sources include submarine methane hydrates, terrigenous organic matter and thermogenic methane and CO2 from hydrothermal vent complexes in the Norwegian Sea. Here, we test the latter hypothesis by dating the active phase of a hydrothermal vent relative to the CIE through dinoflagellate cyst and carbon isotope stratigraphy. We find that activity in this vent system post-dates the onset of the PETM, excluding the possibility that it triggered the PETM. However, our record indicates the vent system was active during the ~60 kyr long “body” phase and thus represents the first actual proof of PETM carbon release from a particular reservoir.\nTo test whether the pulsed release of carbon from these vent systems may have caused the long duration of the body of the PETM, we conduct a suite of experiments using a simple carbon cycle box model (LOSCAR). Our experiments indicate that pulsed carbon input from several vent systems over a prolonged period as suggested from the vent-literature (4-12 pulses within 60 kyr; total volume of 1,480 Pg) matches the CIE and deep ocean carbonate dissolution as recorded in sediment records. We therefore conclude that methane and CO2 from the Norwegian Sea vent complexes may have been the main source of carbon during the PETM, following its dramatic onset.",

The dust is observed by both the difference of ion and electron densities as measured from the Langmuir probe as well as directly from the signals by dust impacts on the spacecraft as measured by the RPWS antennas, with excellent agreement for the dust distribution in space inferred by these two independent methods. The observations are consistent with a simple power law for the dust size distribution with the smallest sizes of dust particles inferred to be 1 nm in the plume region and 10 nm in both the plume edge region as well as the trail region.

We report characteristics of blocks in the Hioki mélange, which constitutes part of the youngest (late Oligocene to early Miocene) portion of the Shimanto accretionary complex, Shikoku, southwest Japan. The Hioki mélange is regarded as a tectonic mélange which has formed at a few km depth below the surface (e.g., Hibbard et al., 1993; Underwood et al., 1993).\n The ample exposure of the mélange in the study area provides a good opportunity to observe detailed structure of the block-in-matrix fabrics. The matrix, which is partly folded, is composed of dark gray shale and some green tuff and dark brown shale. Foliations of the matrix, which are manifested by cleavages, roughly strike ENE–WSW and steeply dip mostly toward the north. Blocks consist mainly of sandstone. The size of blocks ranges from millimeter to meter in length of major axes. These blocks are divided into brecciated, boudinage, and playted types on the basis of their shapes. Each type of blocks can be observed throughout the study area. We measured size and aspect ratio of blocks that are more than 10 cm in length of major axes. The average and standard deviation of the block size are 28.5 cm and 41.0 cm, respectively. The median of the aspect ratio is 2.0. To compare with the characteristics of blocks, we also measured length of the major axis and the aspect ratio for blocks of a sedimentary mélange (the Cretaceous Ukibuchi Formation), which also constitutes part of the Shimanto accretionary complex. The Ukibuchi Formation consists mainly of dark-gray shale matrix containing sandstone blocks. The average and standard deviation of block size are 12.2 cm and 8.6 cm, respectively. The median of aspect ratio is 1.6. Each parameter is lower than those of blocks in the Hioki mélange.",

The zone plate has an open support grid identical to those used to successfully launch transmission gratings in previous solar radiometers and is otherwise free-standing with no support membrane that would absorb EUV radiation. The measured efficiency of 3.0 ± 0.1% at 30.4 nm is consistent with detailed modeling of the efficiency and accounting for the geometrical transmittance of the support grid. The binary nature of the zone plate, consisting of opaque gold bars and open spaces with no support membrane, results in excellent long-term stability in space against contamination, radiation damage, and other effects that could alter the efficiency and instrument throughput. The zone plate’s focusing property enables the rejection of out-of-band radiation by small apertures and high signal to background values that are superior to previous radiometers. The 4 mm outer diameter of the zone plate and the 25 mm focal length for 30.4 nm radiation enable a compact instrument that is attractive for small CubeSats and other space flight missions where resources are extremely limited.",

            "abstract": "Afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation are the major mechanisms of postseismic deformations caused by large earthquakes and hence provide us information on the mechanical and rheological properties of subduction zones. A number of studies have investigated the postseismic deformations of past huge earthquakes. For the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, Sun et al. [2014, Nature] indicated that viscoelastic relaxation is dominant based on their numerical model that explains both off-shore and on-shore geodetic data. However, the spatial extent of their off-shore geodetic data was limited in the area around the main rupture of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, and was not sufficient to reveal the whole postseismic deformation. To fill the gap in the site distribution, we have constructed 20 GPS/acoustic seafloor observation sites along the Japan Trench in Sep. 2012 and have repeatedly conducted surveys for 2.5 years since then. Estimated positions for individual surveys are weighted by their error and linearly fitted to get a displacement rate of the site. Our results clearly show spatial variation: trench-ward low rates (-5 cm/yr) in the north region of the main rupture zone, land-ward high rates (~10 cm/yr) in the main rupture zone, and trench-ward high rates (5-15 cm/yr) in the south region of the main rupture zone. Our results in the north region and the main rupture zone are roughly explained by the viscoelastic responses expected from the model of Sun et al. [2014]. However, slight systematic difference between them are also seen, which indicates the necessity of minor improvement of the viscoelastic model itself. Meanwhile, the displacements in the south region significantly differ from the viscoelastic response indicating significant contribution of afterslip near the trench. Thus, our observational facts provide new insight to the postseismic deformation process of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and will be utilized for improving the existing models.",

            "abstract": "In the last few decades exponential growth of population and rapid industrialization has resulted in high aerosol loading over Gangetic basin (GB) in Northern India. Gangetic basin is the food basket of India and its agricultural yield is mainly dependent on South Asian summer monsoon. Hence, understanding the aerosol-cloud-rainfall interactions is crucial and demand utmost attention. In this study, we have used more than a decade (2002-2013) of Radiosonde measurements from 5 WMO stations over the GB to illustrate enhancement of CAPE and cloud thickness with increase in AOD under deep cloudy conditions. Enhancement in mean atmospheric temperature below cloud layer at higher aerosol loading was also observed. These observations suggest that increase in aerosols increases the atmospheric temperature below cloud base and causes increase in CAPE, which, in turn, invigorates the cloud dynamics and eventually results\nin deeper cloud systems. Simultaneously, analysis of decade long satellite and in-situ observational datasets provided compelling evidence of aerosol-induced cloud invigoration, from cloud macrophysical as well as microphysical observations, which fostered a net atmospheric cooling nearly twice compared to the aerosol direct effect. Moreover, a striking positive association between aerosol loading and daily surface rainfall during Indian summer monsoon was found. The observed aerosol-induced heating of lower atmosphere, intensification of cloud dynamics, deepening of clouds, intensification of precipitation rate and daily rainfall coherently suggested an increase in surface water with increase in aerosol loading. Hence, this study not only demonstrates the importance of aerosol-induced microphysical perturbations during Indian summer monsoon but also is a major step forward in understanding the impact of aerosols on surface water under continental conditions.",

The signal’s troposphere phase delay is linked with the density of all gaseous constituencies, including one of the most important - water vapour. Current GNSS processing methodology does not provide a framework for effective estimation of line-of-sight troposphere delay between satellite and receiver because of that a new functional and stochastic modelling should be introduced. The project founded by National Science Foundation is looking to fill that gap by providing both: effective estimation procedure and assimilation methodology for line-of-sight GNSS observations.\nThis paper shows first results of the: validation and assimilation of GNSS data into NWP model. The investigated case studies cover severe weather events, such as : intensive storms, prolonged intensive rains, gusty winds. We applied the 3DVAR and 4DVAR assimilation schemes and used Integrated Water Vapour and Zenith Troposphere Delay from GNSS network in Poland\nThe results show impact of the newly introduced data on the location and intensity of the rain field the correction to the temperature and water vapour field is visible. Obtained data are validated against radiosonde profiles, automatic weather stations ground-based measurements and radar images.",

            "abstract": "Recently, landslides due to heavy rain and/or earthquakes have been increasing and severe damage occurred in Japan in some cases (e.g., Chigira et al., 2013, Geomorph.). One of the principle factors activating landslides is groundwater. Continuous measurements of moisture in soil and/or pore pressure are performed to investigate the groundwater behavior. However, such measurements give information on only local behavior of the groundwater. To monitor the state of target slope, it is better to measure signals affected by the behavior of groundwater in a widely surrounding region. The elastic waves propagating through the medium under the target slope are one of candidates of such signals. In this study, we measure propagating waves through a sand soil made in laboratory, injecting water into it from the bottom. We investigate the characteristics of the propagating waves.\nWe drop sand particles in a container (750 mm long, 300 mm wide and 400 mm high) freely and made a sand soil. The sand soil consists of two layers. One is made of larger sand particles (0.2-0.4 mm in diameter) and the other is made of smaller sand particles (0.05-0.2 mm in diameter). The dry density of these sand layers is about 1.45 g/cm3. We install a shaker for generating elastic waves, accelerometers and pore pressure gauges in the sand soil. We apply small voltage steps repeatedly, and we continuously measure elastic waves propagating through the sand soil at a sampling rate of 51.2 ksps for a period including the water injection period.\nWe estimate the spatio-temporal variation in the maximum cross-correlation coefficients and the corresponding time lags, using template waveforms recorded in the initial period as references. The coefficient for the waveforms recorded at the accelerometer attached to the tip of the shaker is almost stable in high values with a slight decrease down to 0.94 in the period when the sand particles around the shaker are considered to become wet. On the other hand, the coefficients for the waveforms recorded by accelerometers located more than 300 mm away from the shaker gradually decreased down to about 0.5. Carefully taking into account of the temporal variations in the source time function, we estimate the propagation characteristics of elastic waves, and compare the temporal variation of them and the record of the pore pressure gauges.",

            "abstract": "The properties of grain boundaries strongly differ from those of the crystal lattice, and there is growing evidence that the presence of grain boundaries influence detected geophysical signals such as electrical conductivity and seismic velocities especially in aggregates with a LPO that favours the alignment of specific grain boundaries. However, neither the anisotropic frequency or energy distribution of grain boundary networks are understood in olivine dominated aggregates, neither with nor without LPO.\nWe used electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD to detect the orientations of over 1.4x104 grains corresponding to roughly 5000mm length of grain boundary separating them. Subsequently we used a stereological approach to determine the grain boundary character distribution, GBCD, defined as the relative areas of grain boundaries of different types, distinguished by their five degrees of freedom (Rohrer, 2007).\nThe grain boundary planes showed a preference for low index planes, which is in agreement with recent findings on other materials (e.g. MgO, TiO2, SrTiO3, MgAl2O4). However, our inferred surface energies are controversial with respect to previously simulated surface energies (Watson et al., 1997; de Leeuw et al., 2000; Gurmani et al., 2011). We find that the principal crystallographic planes have the lowest energies and that at 60° misorientation specific grain boundaries with common [100] axis of misorientation are favored compared to 60° misorientations about random axis of rotation. This seems to support the results of (Faul and Fitz Gerald, 1999), even though our data imply that 90°/[001] (100)(010) should be even less favorable for the propagation of melt films. These differences and similarities will be discussed with respect to the different methods and their limitations.\n",

In order to precisely image the structure of the shallow hydrothermal system, we performed an extended electrical DC resistivity survey at Solfatara, with about 40 2-D profiles of length up to 1 km, as well as soil temperature and CO2 flux measurements over the area. We then realized a 3-D inversion from the ~40 000 resistivity data points, using E4D code (Johnson et al., 2010).\nAt large scale, results clearly delineate two contrasted structures:\n- A very conductive body (resistivity < 5 Ohm.m) located beneath the Fangaia mud pools, and likely associated to a mineralized liquid rich plume.\n- An elongated more resistive body (20-30 Ohm.m) connected to the main fumarolic area and interpreted as the gas reservoir feeding the fumaroles.\nAt smaller scale, our resistivity model originally highlights the 3-D anatomy of a fumarole and the interactions between condensate layers and gas chimneys. This high-resolution image of the shallow hydrothermal structure is a new step for the modeling of this system.",

            "abstract": "We use oceanic and atmospheric model simulations to investigate and resolve a disagreement between observations of atmospheric O2/N2 and CO2 data and air-sea fluxes estimated from an ocean inversion. Atmospheric observations of O2/N2 and CO2 can be combined to calculate atmospheric potential oxygen (APO=O2/N2+1.1CO2), a powerful atmospheric tracer for ocean biogeochemical processes that is not influenced by terrestrial photosynthesis or respiration. A recent study identified a deep APO minimum in the Northwest Pacific from measurements collected on a repeat transect between New Zealand and Japan. This minimum could not be reproduced in atmospheric model simulations forced with air-sea fluxes estimated from ocean data, suggesting that oxygen uptake in the Northwest Pacific must be under-estimated by a factor of two.\nWe use an updated ocean inverse method to estimate new air-sea fluxes from the ocean interior measurements at a higher spatial resolution than previous work using a suite of ten ocean general circulation models (OGCMs). These new air-sea flux estimates are able to match the atmospheric APO data when used as boundary conditions for an atmospheric transport model. The relative roles of thermal and biological processses in contributing to oxygen absorption by the North Pacific and other ocean regions is investigated.",

            "abstract": "Anabranching rivers (including anastomosing) are a relatively common channel pattern, especially among the world’s biggest rivers, and are defined as a system of multiple channels separated by immobile alluvial islands. The origin of anabranching remains poorly understood and is an important topic of research. Previous studies on Australian rivers and a recent empirical compilation show that floodplain width (relative to the size of the channel) might play an important role in the formation of anabranching rivers. To test this idea further we carried out two sets of morphodynamic simulations using Delft3D. In the first set we create a generic channel-floodplain complex with uniform floodplain and channel width, slope, and grain size and allow the system to adjust to passing floodwaves. In successive runs we hold all variables constant, except we increase floodplain width. Results of these simulations show a transition from single channel to braided to anabranching as floodplain width increases. Anabranching arises because as floodplain width increases, alluvial bar growth occurs on the floodplain. The emergence of bars causes flow bifurcation, and subsequent bifurcation instability leads to reduction of channels and the emergence of multiple anabranches. Transition to a stable anabranching pattern is achieved because as anabranches increase their cross-sectional area, Shields stresses on the intervening bars are reduced until they bars stop migrating. To test the idea that alluvial bar growth can be a precursor to anabranching we carried out a second experiment set using boundary conditions from four different field scale anabranching rivers. Results from these simulations show that anabranching can initiate from alluvial bar growth. Compared to field measurements of anabranching rivers our simulations accurately predict number of channels, supporting the idea that relatively wide floodplains might be an important attribute of anabranching rivers.",

It is a widely recognized fact that the increasing temperature in association with anthropogenic activities can affect the hydrological cycle, which leads to extreme events. In addition a shift in extremes of the spatial pattern of ISMR has recently been observed (Ghosh et al., 2011). Such changes in rainfall on temporal and spatial scale can further affect the stream flow over a given region subsequently making water resource management a difficult task (Mondal and Mujumdar, 2015).\nThe hydrological models used for the stream flow estimation are dependent on various climate variables as input data. These climate variables could be obtained through either observational networks or climate model outputs. Due to the scarcity of the observational data over the Indian region and the coarse resolution of global climate model output, which is used as input to hydrologic models, large uncertainties are introduced in stream flow output (Overgaard et al., 2007).\nIn the present study we have used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (Skamarock et al. 2008) to downscale the essential climate variables (surface temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, etc.) as an input for its coupled hydrological extension, WRF Hydro (NCAR user's guide). We will present the results obtained from the WRF-hydro simulation to estimate the stream flow over the Thamirabarani river basin in Southern Tropical Indian region. Preliminary simulations using WRF to estimate the precipitation showed the reasonable quantitative agreement with observed values. An attempt will be made to demonstrate how these results can further be used for developing flood-forecasting techniques and for local regional water resource management.",

The parallel geo-processing engine makes the data ingestion fast and easily.\nRaster function, definition of a raster processing algorithm, is a very important component in ArcGIS platform for on-demand raster processing and analysis. The scientific data analytics is achieved through the MDMD and raster function templates which perform on-demand scientific computation with variables ingested in the MDMD. For example, aggregating monthly average from daily data; computing total rainfall of a year; calculating heat index for forecasting data, and identifying fishing habitat zones etc.\nAddtionally, MDMD with the associated raster function templates can be served through ArcGIS server as image services which provide a framework for on-demand server side computation and analysis, and the published services can be accessed by multiple clients such as ArcMap, ArcGIS Online, JavaScript, REST, WCS, and WMS.\nThis presentation will focus on the MDMD model and raster processing templates. In addtion, MODIS land cover, NDFD weather service, and HYCOM ocean model will be used to illustrate how ArcGIS platform and MDMD model can facilitate scientific data visualization and analytics and how the analysis results can be shared to more audience through ArcGIS Online and Portal.",

            "abstract": "The El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects atmospheric conditions and cloud physical properties such as cloud fraction (CF) and cloud top height (CTH). However, an impact of the ENSO on physical properties in high–ice cloud is not well known. Therefore, this study attempts to reveal relationship between variability of ice cloud physical properties and ENSO. Ice clouds are inferred with the multiband IR method in this study. Ice clouds are categorized in terms of cloud optical thickness (COT) as thin (0.1< COT <0.3), opaque (0.3< COT <3.6), thick (3.6< COT <11), and deep convective (DC) (11< COT) clouds, and relationship between ENSO and interannual variability of cloud physical properties is investigated for each category during the period from January 2003 to December 2014. The deseasonalized anomalies of CF and CTH in all categories correlate well with Niño3.4 index, with positive anomaly over the eastern Pacific and negative anomaly over the western Pacific during El Niño condition. However, the global distribution of these correlation coefficients is different by cloud categories. For example, CF of DC correlates well with Niño3.4 index over the convergence zone, while, that of thin cloud shows high correlation extending to high latitude from convergence zone, suggesting a connection with cloud formation. The global distributions of average rate of change differ by cloud category, because the different associate with ENSO and gradual trend toward La Niña condition had occurred over the analysis period. In this conference, detailed results and relationship between variability of cloud physical properties and atmospheric conditions will be shown.",

            "abstract": "This contribution presents a pair of processing tools for the modelling of diffusion profiles in crystals. FINDIF is a finite-difference model coded in C++ that allows for diffusion anisotropy (within the limitations of a square grid), composition dependence tied to diffusing species, varying mineral phases, dynamic temperature-dependent partitioning and variable conditions of temperature. In this regard it provides an open-ended tool for the modelling of complex diffusion geometries in natural samples. AutoDiff uses a database of profiles generated in FINDIF to enable rapid matching of profiles measured in natural samples with those in the database. This provides a quick method to determine timescales from natural crystals that does not involve lengthy iteration of finite difference methods. This also provides a constraint on whether the profile is likely to be diffusion-generated or could represent crystal growth processes, as deviations from ideal profiles indicate a difference in process from that assumed; e.g., a simple square-wave initial geometry assumption versus the presence of growth effects.\nFinally, a method for propagating uncertainties in diffusional geochronometers is resented, that incorporates several key parameters in measured data that can influence the accuracy of the end result. This can be presented as a full statistical treatment (via Monte Carlo methods) or as a near-equivalent method that can estimate uncertainties with good precision with less computational overhead, suitable for rapid investigation.",

            "abstract": "The burning of forests in the Amazonia region is a globally significant source of carbonaceous aerosol, containing both absorbing and scattering components [1]. In addition biomass burning aerosol (BBA) are also efficient cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), modifying cloud properties and influencing atmospheric circulation and precipitation tendencies [2]. The impacts of BBA are highly dependent on their size distribution and composition.\nA bottom-up emissions inventory, the Brazilian Biomass Burning Emissions Model (3BEM) [3], utilising satellite products to generate daily fire emission maps is used. Injection of flaming emissions within the atmospheric column is simulated using both a sub-grid plume-rise parameterisation [4], and simpler schemes, within the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem, v3.4.1) [5]. Aerosol dynamics are simulated using the sectional MOSAIC scheme [6], incorporating a volatility basis set (VBS) treatment of organic aerosol [7]. For this work we have modified the 9-bin VBS to use the biomass burning specific scheme developed by May et al. [8].\nThe model has been run for September 2012 over South America (at a 25km resolution). We will present model results evaluating the modelled aerosol vertical distribution, size distribution, and composition against measurements taken by the FAAM BAe-146 research aircraft during the SAMBBA campaign. The main focus will be on investigating the factors controlling the vertical gradient of the organic mass to black carbon ratio of the measured aerosol.\nThis work is supported by the Nature Environment Research Council (NERC) as part of the SAMBBA project under grant NE/J010073/1.\n[1] D.

            "abstract": "In 9 October 2006, 25 May 2009, and 12 February 2013, North Korea conducted three successive nuclear tests near the China-Korea border. Based on 297 broadband stations distributed in East China, South Korea, and Japan, the digital seismograms from these nuclear tests are collected to investigate the geometric spreading and attenuation of seismic Pn waves in Northeast China and Korean Peninsula. A highly accurate broadband Pn-wave data set generated by North Korean nuclear tests is used to constrain parameters of a frequency-dependent log-quadratic geometric spreading function and a power-law Pn Q model. The geometric spreading function and apparent Pn wave Q is obtained for the studied area between 2.0 and 10.0 Hz. By taking the two-station amplitude ratios of the Pn spectra, followed by correcting it for the known spreading function, we can strip the effects of source and crust legs from the apparent Pn Q, and retrieve the P-wave attenuation information along the pure upper mantle path. We then use a tomographic approach to obtain the upper mantle P-wave attenuation in Northeast China and Korean Peninsula. The Pn wave spectra observed in China are compared with those recorded in Japan, and the result reveals that the high-frequency Pn signal across the oceanic path attenuated faster than those through the continental path.

            "abstract": "Submarine slope failures are a likely cause for tsunami generation along the East U.S. coast. A possible source are the large slope failures along western Great Bahama Bank (GBB). Numerical models simulate tsunami generation and propagation through the Straits of Florida, caused by these Pleistocene mass wasting events. In order to estimate the likelihood and extent of future landslides, distribution, characteristics, and possible triggering mechanisms of previous failures and their associated mass transport deposits (MTD) have to be investigated.\nIn 2013, the University of Hamburg acquired 2D high-resolution multichannel seismic data, multibeam data, and subbottom profiles inside the Santaren Channel, along the slopes of western GBB and Cay Sal Bank (CSB). The two platforms are different in two ways. CSB is part of the Cuban Fold and Thrust Belt while GBB is situated in a tectonically quiet zone. In addition, the slopes of western GBB are on the leeward side of the bank, while the eastern slopes of CSB are in a windward position. Differences in nature and size of mass wasting events between the Cay Sal side and the western GBB side of the dataset show how influential the tectonically active Cuban Fold and Thrust Belt is to the generation of large MTDs in this area.\nIn the study area, the slope failures can be divided in two categories; small-scale in situ failures with high frequencies on the slopes, dominant on the western GBB side, and large landslides with a lower frequency, but higher volumes and transport distances on the toe of the slope and in the basin, dominant on the Cay Sal side. The distribution of in situ failures, such as slump and debris flow alternation, shows the interplay between high and low inner strength of the sediment, respectively. On the other hand, large MTDs caused by submarine landslides suggest movement in an unconfined manner. Internal sediment preconditions derived from sea level oscillations are suggested as triggering mechanisms for slumps and debris flows, referring to their high frequency. Earthquake shaking is likely to be the causal process for large landslides clustered along northern Cay Sal.",

            "abstract": "Mmax, the size of the largest possible earthquake in a region, is one of the least certain parameters used to assess seismic hazard. In a strict sense, Mmax can only be interpreted if you assume that the distribution of earthquake magnitudes has some upper limit, i.e., the truncated Gutenberg-Richter distribution. Unfortunately, you cannot estimate Mmax and its uncertainty using only the magnitudes recorded so far; you also need to incorporate independent data such as those from geodesy or paleoseismology, and these data have additional uncertainties. Rather than struggling with Mmax, some seismologists have suggested using a different parameterization of the magnitude distribution: one that is tapered rather than truncated, shifting the focus to the point at which the taper begins, the so-called “corner magnitude.”\nIn this presentation, we describe frequentist and Bayesian methods for estimating the corner magnitude; we demonstrate that you can obtain a confidence interval for the corner magnitude using one or more earthquake catalogs of sufficient length; we suggest that the corner magnitude varies with tectonic regime; and we explain why our results are different from those of previous studies.",

Do we see the gas flow pattern described for Mallik [Uddin, M. et al., J. Can. Petrol Tech, 50, 70-89, 2011] in a pilot scale test? If so, what are the driving forces?\nLARS has a network of temperature sensors and an electric resistivity tomography (ERT) enabling a good spatial resolution of gas hydrate occurrences, water and gas distribution, and changes in temperature in the sample. A gas flow meter and a water trap record fluid flow patterns and a backpressure valve has controlled the depressurization equivalent to the three pressure stages (7.0 – 5.0 – 4.2 MPa) applied in the Mallik field test. The environmental temperature (284 K) and confining pressure (13 MPa) have been constant.\nThe depressurization induced immediate endothermic gas hydrate dissociation until re-establishment of the stability conditions by a consequent temperature decrease. Slight gas hydrate dissociation continued at the top and upper lateral border due to the constant heat input from the environment. Here transport pathways were short and permeability higher due to lower gas hydrate saturation. At pressures of 7.0 and 5.0 MPa the LARS tests showed high water flow rates and short irregular spikes of gas production. The gas flow patterns at 4.2 MPa and 3.0MPa resembled those of the Mallik test. In LARS the initial gas surges overlap with times of hydrate instability while water content and lengths of pathways had increased. Water production was at a minimum. A rapidly formed continuous gas phase caused the initial gas surges and only after gas hydrate dissociation decreased to a minimum the single gas bubbles get trapped before slowly coalescing again. In LARS, where pathways were short and no additional water was added, a transport of microbubbles is unlikely to cause a gas surge as suggested for Mallik.",

The voxel model has been combined with a regional hydrostratigraphic layer model.\nThe case is part of a pilot project partly financed by VTU (Foundation for Development of Technology in the Danish Water Sector) and involves many different datatypes such as borehole information, geophysical data, human related elements (landfill, pipelines, basements, roadbeds etc).\nIn the last few years, there has been increased focus on detailed geological modeling in urban areas. The models serve as important input to hydrological models. This focus is partly due to climate changes as high intensity rainfalls are seen more often than in the past, and water recharge is a topic too. In urban areas, this arises new challenges. There is a need of a high level of detailed geological knowledge for the uppermost zone of the soil, which typically are problematic due to practically limitations, especially when using geological layer models. Furthermore, to accommodate the need of a high detail, all relevant available data has to be used in the modeling process. Human activity has deeply changed the soil layers, e.g. by constructions as roadbeds, buildings with basements, pipelines, landfill etc. These elements can act as barriers or pathways regarding surface near groundwater flow and can attribute to local flooding or mobilization and transport of contaminants etc.\nA geological voxel model is built by small boxes (a voxel). Each box can contain several parameters, ex. lithology, transmissivity or contaminant concentration. Human related elements can be implemented using tools, which gives the modeler advanced options for making detailed small-scale models. This case demonstrates the workflow and the resulting geological model for the pilot area.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the surface wave and shear wave velocity structure of the Sea of Japan based on group and phase velocity measurements made on broad-band, cross-correlated ambient noise. Continuous data from terrestrial broadband stations surrounding the sea are filtered, cross correlated on a day-by-day basis, and then stacked. The correlation functions are processed with multiple filters and group velocities are manually selected from 7s to 50s. Subsequent to multiple filtering, we apply phase-matched filtering and unwrap the phase of the resulting signal. This phase is then used to determine phase velocities by selecting an appropriate number of wave-cycles appropriate for the average velocity structure. The interstation dispersion curves are then inverted for 2D isotropic and anisotropic surface wave maps at discrete periods. In a second stage of inversion, the 2D isotropic inversion results are combined at each spatial node to create a \"1D\" dispersion curve. We use a linearized, iterative process to model the 1D dispersion at each node for depth-dependent shear-wave velocities. The 1D models are then combined to form at 3D model of shear wave velocity. We image slow shear-wave anomalies under the central basin and relatively fast velocities under the Yamamoto and Japan Basins and offshore of the western Japan shelf. Current estimates of azimuthal anistoropy from our inversions are poorly constrained due to sparse data distribution. Ongoing efforts are aimed at refining anisotropy estimates by increasing data density from noise correlations by increasing the spatial coverage of our database. Our isotropic and anisotropic models will be presented, as will a first attempt at defining lithospheric thickness based on radial anisotropy determined from our inversions.",

            "abstract": "Global and regional environmental changes have profoundly influenced the evolutionary processes of hominoid primates, particularly during the mid to late Miocene. Recently, a new fossil hominoid was discovered in the Shiutangba (STB) section of the Zhaotong Basin in Yunnan on the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau, and was assigned to the species of Lufengpithecus cf. lufengensis with the age of ~6.2 Ma, the terminal Miocene. To understand the relationship between paleoclimate and hominoid evolution, here we present sedimentary, clay mineralogy and geochemical proxies for the 16 m thick late Miocene sedimentary sequence (ca. 6.7-6.0 Ma) from the STB section. Our results show that Lufengpithecus cf. lufengensis lived in a mildly warm and humid climate in a lacustrine or swamp environment rather than hot and humid conditions. A comprehensive comparison among mid to late Miocene records from Yunnan hominoid sites, Siwalik and tropical Africa indicates that warm and humid ecological shifts in South and Southeast Asia are much later than tropical Africa. The presence of the Tibetan plateau may have influenced regional climatic conditions, and the warm and humid condition in the southern China (and perhaps Southeast Asia in general) offered an important refuge for hominoids.",

The active Tonga-Kermadec oceanic arc extends 2500 km northward of New Zealand and hosts many tens of submarine volcanoes with around a dozen forming islands. Despite its obious volcanic setting, the impacts of explosive volcanism and volcano-tectonic related tsunami are an often overlooked in archaeological and paleo-botanical histories, mainly due the lack of good Holocene subaerial exposures. The inhabited small uplifted coral platform islands east of the volcanic arc in Tonga collectively cover only <550 km2. Inspired by local mythology of gods flying overhead with baskets of ash, and an analysis of the high-level wind distribution patterns, lake and wetland sites were investigated along the Tongan chain. In most cases former lagoon basins lifted above sea-level by a combination of tectonic rise and the lowering of mean sea levels by around 2 m since the Mid-Holocene form closed lake or swampy depressions. Coring reveaed between 6 and 20 mineral layers at each site, withn humic sediment or peat. Over thirty new radiocarbon dates were collected to develop a chronology for the sequences and the mineral layers were examined mineralogically and geochemically. These sites reveal mainly tephra fall layers of <6500 cal. years B.P., including several very large and regionally significant tephras. Erupted compositions range from basaltic to dacitic, with some showing compositional change during eruption. In addition, some large eruptions appear to have generated regionally significant tsunami, represented by characteristically mixed sandy layers with lithologies including shell fragment, foraminifera and volcanic particles.",

            "abstract": "The North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) is a 1500 km long active strike-slip fault that spans northern Turkey. During the past century a series of migrating earthquakes have sequentially activated different segments of the fault. The last major events of this sequence are the 1999 Izmit and Düzce earthquakes, which are consistent with a gradual westward migration in seismicity. The next active segment of the fault may be close to the city of Istanbul, posing a major risk for its population.\nHistorically, the NAFZ exhibits a recurrent migrating sequence of high magnitude earthquakes along the fault zone, suggesting that it accommodates most of the plate motion between Anatolian and Eurasian plates in a narrow shear zone. From GPS studies following the Izmit and Düzce events, this motion does not appear to be constrained to the upper crust, and may extend at least to the lower crust. However, the geometry of the fault in the lower crust and upper mantle is at present poorly understood and previous tomographic studies do not provide a consistent picture of the velocity structure in this region.\nTo better constrain the geometry of the shear zone at depth, in particular beneath the most recently active segment of the fault, an array of 70 temporary seismic stations with a 7 km spacing was deployed for 18 months as part of the FaultLab project. Amongst all the events recorded, those of magnitude ≥ 5 and situated between 27 and 98 degrees from the centre of the array were selected to perform 3D teleseismic tomography. Synthetic resolution tests indicate that structures as small as the average station spacing can be recovered to a depth of approximately 80 km.\nThe work aims to provide a higher resolution image of the velocity structure beneath the western segment of the NAFZ, leading to a better understanding of the shear zone in the lower crust and upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Very little is known till now about the interior of asteroids. The information available has been so far mainly obtained through remote observations of the surface and inferred from theoretical modeling. Observations of asteroids deep interior and regolith structure are needed to better understand the asteroid accretion and dynamical evolution, and to provide answers that will directly improve our ability to understand and model the mechanisms driving Near Earth Asteroids (NEA) deflection and other risk mitigation techniques.\nRadar operating from a spacecraft is the only technique capable of characterizing the internal structure and heterogeneity from submetric to global scale for the benefit of science as well as for planetary defence or exploration.\nAccess to the deep interior structure requires a low-frequency radar (LFR) that is able to penetrate and propagate throughout the complete body. The LFR will be a bi-static radar similar to the CONSERT radar designed for the Rosetta mission and will perform a tomography of the asteroid.\nOn the other hand, the characterization of the first tens of meters of the subsurface with a submetric resolution will be achieved by a monostatic radar operating at higher frequencies (HFR). It will allow the identification of the layering and the reconnection of the surface features to the internal structure. Its design will be based on the design of the WISDOM radar developped for the ExoMars mission.\nThis presentation reviews, in the context of the AIDA/AIM mission, the benefits of radar measurements performed from a spacecraft. The concept of both HFR and LFR are presented as well as the expected performances of the instruments.",

            "abstract": "Seismic unrest was observed within the subglacial caldera of Bárdarbunga on 16 August 2014, followed by seismicity tracing the path of a lateral dyke extending underneath the Vatnajökull glacier out to 45 km to the north east of the volcano. A short subaerial fissure eruption occurred at the site of the Holuhraun lavas, just north of the glacier edge on 29 August, before recommencing in earnest on 31 August with a large effusive eruption and accompanying slow caldera collapse, which lasted for approximately 6 months.\nThe glacier surface around Bárdarbunga was monitored using aerial altimeter profiling. Several shallow depressions, known as ice cauldrons, formed around the caldera rim and on Dyngjujökull glacier above the dyke propagation path. The cauldrons range in volume from approximately 0.0003 km3 to 0.02 km3. Two types of melting were observed: high initial heat flux over a period of days which gradually disappears; and slower but more sustained melting rates. We present time series data of the development and evolution of these cauldrons, with estimates of the heat flux magnitudes involved.\nThe nature of the heat source required to generate these cauldrons is not obvious. Two scenarios are explored: 1) small subglacial eruptions; or 2) increased geothermal activity induced by the dyke intrusion. We investigate these scenarios using numerical modelling, considering the surface heat flux produced, and timescales and spatial extent of associated surface anomalies. It is found that a magmatic intrusion into rocks where the groundwater is near the boiling point curve can cause rapid increase in geothermal activity, but even a shallow intrusion into a cold groundwater reservoir will have a muted thermal response. Thus, our results indicate that minor subglacial eruptions are the most plausible explanation for the observed rapid melting far from known geothermal areas. These results have implications for the interpretation of thermal signals observed at ice-covered volcanoes, highlighting the importance of reservoir/bedrock thermal state prior to intrusion.",

However, it is still uncertain the continent-wide Antarctic and Greenland ice mass balance before the satellite gravimetry and altimetry missions. In this study, we estimate long-term (1979-2010) polar ice mass variations by comparing observed and modeled polar motion excitations (χ1,χ2). Excitations of polar motion associated with wind and current are estimated with ECMWF and GECCO2, respectively, and they are corrected from observed excitations. Residual excitations are mainly due to fluid mass redistribution on the Earth’s envelope, and they are compared with modeled excitations associated with atmospheric pressure (ECMWF), ocean bottom pressure (GECCO2), terrestrial water storage (GLDAS), mountain glaciers (GLIMS) and polar ice sheets. Ice mass variations in polar ice sheets during 1979-2010 are estimated based on surface mass balance from numerical models (ECMWF and RACMO2) and ice dynamic observations. Observed and modeled excitations agree very well over seasonal and inter-annual time scale. In addition, both χ1 show similar quadratic variations indicating that polar ice mass balance used here is reasonable. However, there exist significant difference for the quadratic trend in χ2, and it is not certain to explain it yet. This study shows that long-term geodetic observations are potentially useful to understand history of polar ice mass balance and to project future sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "Early Earth had a higher amount of radiogenic elements as well as a higher amount of leftover primordial heat. Both contribute to the increased temperature in the Earth’s interior and it is mainly this increased mantle potential temperature Tp that controls the dynamics of the crust and upper mantle and the predominant style of tectonics in the Early Earth.\nWe conduct 3D petrological-magmatic-thermomechanical numerical modelling experiments of the crust and upper mantle under Early Earth conditions using a plume tectonics model setup. For varying crustal structures and a mantle potential temperature increase (ΔTp, compared to present day conditions), a hot lower thermal boundary layer introduces spontaneously developing mantle plumes and after repeated melt removal, depleted mantle lithosphere is formed self-consistently. New crust is produced in the form of both volcanics and plutonics.\nFor an increase in mantle potential temperature ΔTp= 250 K, presumably corresponding to an Archean mantle, models show large amounts of subcrustal decompression melting and consequently large amounts of magmatism, which in turn influence the dynamics.\nIn a first active phase (10-20 Ma) rising diapirs within the crust lead to the formation of the typical dome and keel pattern (e.g. Kaapvaal craton in South Africa, Pilbara craton in northwest Australia). A long passive phase follows with strong growth of crust and lithosphere. Both crust and lithosphere thickness are regulated by thermal-chemical instabilities assisted by lower crust eclogitization. Eclogitization depth is reached after ~80 Ma and linear or cylindrical drips originate at the crust or lithosphere bottom. Delamination of lower crust and lithosphere then occurs as one ‘catastrophic’ event within the next 20 Ma.",

Melt inclusion data are corrected for post-entrapment modifications including diffusive Fe-loss, H2O loss and post-entrapment crystallization. The primitive magma compositions calculated from corrected melt inclusion data are used to estimate the degree of partial melting and compositions of slab-derived fluids beneath Kyushu volcanic front. The result show that magmatism of four volcanoes in Kyushu arc is divided into two groups (Group A and B). Group A indicates high K2O contents in primitive magmas and in fluids at Aso and Kuju volcanoes, northern Kyushu arc. Group B indicates low K2O contents in primitive magmas and in fluids at Kirishima and Kaimon volcanoes, southern Kyushu arc.\nK2O contents of Group A and B are impossible of explaining by degree of partial melting and the origin of hydrous mantle. High K2O content in fluids is attributed to dehydration of phengite-bearing slab at deep depth (about 140 km) in Group A compared with shallow depth (about 100 km) in Group B. Phengite is dehydrated from submerging plate beneath 110 km depth. This study suggests that compositions of primitive magmas beneath Kyushu arc are reflected by the depth of slab and the kind of dehydrating hydrous minerals.",

            "abstract": "Estimating the anthropogenic component of carbon dioxide emissions from direct atmospheric measurements is difficult, due to the large natural carbon dioxide fluxes. One way of determining the fossil fuel component of atmospheric carbon dioxide is the use of radiocarbon measurements. Whilst carbon reservoirs with a reasonably fast carbon exchange rate all have a similar radiocarbon content, fossil fuels are completely devoid of radiocarbon due to their age. Previous studies have 14CO2 (UK) this approach is compromised by the high density of 14CO2 emitting nuclear power plants. Of the 16 nuclear reactors in the UK, 14 are advanced gas cooled reactors, which have one of the highest 14CO2 emission rates of all reactor types. These radiocarbon emissions not only lead to a serious underestimation of the recently added fossil fuel CO2, by masking the depletion of 14C in CO2, but can in fact overshadow the depletion by a factor of 2 or more. While a correction for this enhancement can be applied, the emissions from the nuclear power plants are highly variable, and an accurate correction is therefore not straightforward. We present the first attempt to quantify UK fossil fuel CO2 emissions through the use of 14CO2. We employ a sampling strategy that makes use of a Lagrangian particle dispersion model, in combination with nuclear industry emission estimates, to forecast “good” sampling times, in an attempt to minimize the correction due to emissions from the nuclear industry. As part of the Greenhouse gAs Uk and Global Emissions (GAUGE) project, 14CO2measurements are performed at two measurement sites in the UK and Ireland, as well as during science flights around the UK. The measurement locations have been chosen with a focus on high emitting regions such as London and the Midlands.\nWe discuss the unique challenges that face the determination of fossil fuel emissions through radiocarbon measurements in the UK and our sampling strategy to deal with them. In addition we present the first results of our ground based measurements, and their implications for how radiocarbon measurements might be used, even in seemingly impractical locations.",

            "abstract": "Capacity expansion on resource networks is essential to adapting to economic and population growth and pressures such as climate change. Engineered infrastructure systems such as water, energy, or transport networks require sophisticated and bespoke models to refine management and investment strategies. Successful modeling of such complex systems relies on good data management and advanced methods to visualize and share data.\nEngineered infrastructure systems are often represented as networks of nodes and links with operating rules describing their interactions. Infrastructure system management and planning can be abstracted to simulating or optimizing new operations and extensions of the network. By separating the data storage of abstract networks from manipulation and modeling we have created a system where infrastructure modeling across various domains is facilitated.\nWe introduce Hydra Platform, a Free Open Source Software designed for analysts and modelers to store, manage and share network topology and data. Hydra Platform is a Python library with a web service layer for remote applications, called Apps, to connect. Apps serve various functions including network or results visualization, data export (e.g. into a proprietary format) or model execution. This Client-Server architecture allows users to manipulate and share centrally stored data. XML templates allow a standardised description of the data structure required for storing network data such that it is compatible with specific models.\nHydra Platform represents networks in an abstract way and is therefore not bound to a single modeling domain. It is the Apps that create domain-specific functionality. Using Apps researchers from different domains can incorporate different models within the same network enabling cross-disciplinary modeling while minimizing errors and streamlining data sharing. Separating the Python library from the web layer allows developers to natively expand the software or build web-based apps in other languages for remote functionality. Partner CH2M is developing a commercial user-interface for Hydra Platform however custom interfaces and visualization tools can be built. Hydra Platform is available on GitHub while Apps will be shared on a central repository.",

By creating a virtual research environment (VRE) using a service oriented architecture (SOA) tailored to the needs of Earth Science (ES) communities, the EVEREST project will provide a range of both generic and domain specific data management services to support a dynamic approach to collaborative research. EVER-EST will provide the means to overcome existing barriers to sharing of Earth Science data and information allowing research teams to discover, access, share and process heterogeneous data, algorithms, results and experiences within and across their communities, including those domains beyond Earth Science. Data providers will be also able to monitor user experiences and collect feedback through the VRE, improving their capacity to adapt to the changing requirements of their end-users. The EVER-EST e-infrastructure will be validated by four virtual research communities (VRC) covering different multidisciplinary ES domains: including ocean monitoring, selected natural hazards (flooding, ground instability and extreme weather events), land monitoring and risk management (volcanoes and seismicity). Each of the VRC represents a different collaborative use case for the VRE according to its own specific requirements for data, software, best practice and community engagement. The diverse use cases will demonstrate how the VRE can be used for a range of activities from straight forward data/software sharing to investigating ways to improve cooperative working. Development of the EVEREST VRE will leverage on the results of several previous projects which have produced state-of-the-art technologies for scientific data management and curation as well those initiatives which have developed models, techniques and tools for the preservation of scientific methods and their implementation in computational forms such as scientific workflows.",

            "abstract": "We present the results of an experimental investigation of the mechanisms controlling slip of simulated fault gouges composed of calcite (CaCO3). Shear (friction) tests were carried out using the saw-cut, direct-, as well as the ring-shear geometries, at conditions spanning the brittle-to-ductile transition. Sheared gouges were recovered for micro- and nanostructural study. Experiments using an effective normal stress of 50 MPa and sliding velocities (v) of 0.1 to 10 µm/s showed velocity (v-) weakening in the temperature range from ~80-100ºC to ~550ºC, frequently associated with stick-slip. Below 80-100ºC, and > ~550ºC, stable v-strengthening was observed. The microstructures of all gouges recovered from tests performed at 20° to 200°C showed the presence of nanocrystalline shear bands with internal, fibrous, mirror-like patches and a crystallographic preferred orientation. By contrast, at 400° to 600°C, microstructures showed evidence for localized slip in a boundary shear alongside more distributed deformation, involving grain size sensitive (GSS) and/ or grain size insensitive (GSI) creep of ~10-30 µm-sized grains. Our interpretation is that fault gouge strength and its velocity dependence are controlled by a competition between dilatant granular flow vs. creep-controlled compaction. Specifically, the transition from v-strengthening to v-weakening behaviour at 80° to 100°C is interpreted to occur due to accelerated intergranular diffusive mass transfer at elevated temperatures, while at 550° to 600°C, localized, v-weakening slip involving balanced dilatant flow and creep-controlled compaction gives way to pervasive, stable v-strengthening viscous/ plastic shear involving GSS and/ or GSI deformation. Our results have important implications for seismicity in limestone terrains, and for the interpretation of natural fault rock microstructures. The sheared gouge micro- and nanostructures reported demonstrate the importance of nanoscale fault slip processes in limestone at upper crustal conditions, and suggest that natural calcite shear zone microstructures apparently formed by plastic flow may potentially represent seismogenic faults.",

Based on a field free and chemistry free radial expansion model and from computed photoionization frequencies of dominant cometary neutrals we derive a benchmark expression of ne/nN as a function of cometocentric distance, r, and heliocentric distance, d. For mid-October 2014 when r=10 km and d=3.1 AU the model gives a ratio of ne/nN = 9.8×10-7, which is in good agreement with the ratios of 1-2×10-6 derived from observations by the dual Langmuir probe (LAP), the Mutual Impedance Probe (MIP) and the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA). Further comparisons with observations will be presented at the meeting. We discuss various effects/processes that can cause deviations between the benchmark ne/nN values and the observations. In particular, the presence of electric fields (e.g., the solar wind’s convective electric field and the ambipolar electric field) - accelerating the cometary ion population – can act to markedly reduce ratios from the benchmark values. On the other hand, additional plasma sources (electron impact ionization and charge exchange with the solar wind) act in the opposite way, i.e., towards increasing ratios. Near perihelion, and in particular in the near nucleus environment (tens of km), these particular effects are anticipated to be of less significance, while other processes become increasingly important. In particular, with a denser neutral background collisional electron cooling becomes more efficient, reducing the electron temperature and increasing the efficiency of dissociative recombination as a plasma neutralizing process. This, combined with solar EUV attenuation and possibly also nanograin charging, can set ne/nN ratios well below the benchmark values.",

            "abstract": "Composition of kimberlites is ambiguous due to assimilation and fractional crystallization. We propose that the evolution history of minerals can be used to decipher the magmatic history of kimberlites. We use Fe-Ti oxides (chromite and ilmenite) from six kimberlites from the Ekati Diamond Mine and dissolution experiments to elucidate the petrogenesis of kimberlites. Experiments at 0.1 MPa and variable ƒO2s in a diopside-anorthite melt show that the dissolution rate of ilmenite is highly sensitive to ƒO2. No significant difference was observed in chromite. Zoning in chromite is related to the Fe-content and oxidation state of the melt. Experiments at 1 GPa explore the development of chromite surface resorption features in the system Ca-Mg-Si-H-C-O. Five kimberlites contain a low abundance of ilmenite, owing to a relatively high ƒO2, though ilmenite constituted 65% of oxide macocrysts in one kimberlite. Chromite compositions evolve from Mg-chromite to magnesio-ulvöspinel-magnetite (MUM) in all but one kimberlite where chromite evolves to a pleonaste composition perhaps as a result of rapid emplacement. The high abundance of MUM spinel and low abundance of ilmenite in the matrix could be related to the change in the stable Ti-phase with increasing ƒO2. Core compositions of macrocrysts vary for different mantle sources but rims converge to a composition slightly more oxidized and Mg-rich than chromite from depleted peridotite. Ilmenite commonly has rims composed of perovskite, titanite and MUM. We suggest a model where the kimberlite melt composition is controlled by the co-dissolution and co-precipitation of silicates (predominantly orthopyroxene and olivine) to explain chromite evolution in kimberlites. Resorption-related surface features on chromite macrocrysts show trigon protrusions-depressions on {111} faces and step-like features along the crystal edges resembling products of experiments in H2O fluid. We propose predominantly H2O magmatic fluid in Ekati kimberlites.",

This study investigated calibration performances according to the length of calibration period, objective functions, hydrologic model structures and optimization methods. To do this, the combination of three global optimization methods (i.e. SCE-UA, Micro-GA, and DREAM) and four hydrologic models (i.e. SAC-SMA, GR4J, HBV, and PRMS) was tested with different calibration periods and objective functions. Our results showed that three global optimization methods provided close calibration performances under different calibration periods, objective functions, and hydrologic models. However, using the agreement of index, normalized root mean square error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency as the objective function showed better performance than using correlation coefficient and percent bias. Calibration performances according to different calibration periods from one year to seven years were hard to generalize because four hydrologic models have different levels of complexity and different years have different information content of hydrological observation.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by a grant (14AWMP-B082564-01) from Advanced Water Management Research Program funded by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korean government.",

The ecosystem function and services are tightly coupled with the biodiversity, particularly via food web and biogeochemical cycles and here carbon is one of the central elements. The photosynthetic carbon fixation by plants, which forms the basis of the food web, is known to be highly sensitive to meteorological changes including radiation, temperature, precipitation and CO2 concentration. Thus an analysis of the effect of future climate change on the carbon cycle processes including photosynthetic production in a biogeographical region, which is important from the viewpoint of the biodiversity conservation, such as “biodiversity hotspot”, might enable us to discuss the relevance between climate change and biodiversity.\nIn ISI-MIP (Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project) phase 1, we have estimated NPP (net primary production), plant biomass and soil organic carbon by seven global biome models under climate conditions from 1901 to 2100 based on four RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways for 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 W m-2 stabilization targets) and five global climate models. In the present study, we analyzed these outputs to reveal the effects of changes on NPP, plant biomass and soil organic carbon in 20 biodiversity hotspots in various climatic regions. Although NPP of whole world tended to increase under RCP 8.5 W m-2 scenario, some biome models have shown that NPP of the hotspots in tropical regions decrease.",

            "abstract": "As oceanic plates form it is thought that they will inherit an internal anisotropic fabric due to basal shear, developing a fast seismic axis parallel with the seafloor spreading direction. Studying this process in-situ however has proven difficult given the lack of seismic instrumentation over the oceans. In this study we instead utilise the worldwide distribution of seismicity along mid-ocean ridges (MOR), as well as the source-side shear wave splitting technique, to characterise seismic anisotropy and therefore upper mantle dynamics beneath MOR earthquakes. To achieve this we collate over 80 “null” seismic stations distributed globally that appear lie above effectively isotropic upper mantles. These then allow us to then isolate the anisotropic signature beneath the earthquake or source, instead of beneath the receiver, by using direct teleseismic S phases.\nGlobally on average we find that around 40% of measurements from ridge earthquakes produce splitting of the shear wave, with the other 60% recording a null result (i.e. lack of splitting), likely reflecting complex processes happening beneath MORs. Of the shear wave splitting seen, the magnitude is moderate (delay times average 1.2s), suggesting considerable seismic anisotropy beneath some MOR locales. The distribution of nulls versus splits is not homogeneous however, with localised pockets of coherent nulls or coherent splits with similar fast directions. The seismic properties appear to change abruptly over relatively short distances, such as across adjacent transform faults, or on different limbs of a triple junction, suggesting local ridge processes control the anisotropy rather than the larger scale mantle flow.",

            "abstract": "In this study we investigate the crustal structure beneath the Rwenzori region by analyzing a 1-year ambient-noise data set recorded by a network of 33 broadband seismic stations that have operated between September 2009 and August 2011. The Rwenzori region, located between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, is part of the western (Albertine) branch of the East African Rift System (EARS). The region of study is situated between the Albert Rift and the Edward Rift segments and covers an area of approximately 120 km by 50 km.\nThe main objective of the seismological experiment was to address the questions of the uplift of the Rwenzori Mountains in an extensional regime and the absence of a crustal root beneath the mountain range. Any model proposed to address these questions requires the knowledge of the structure of the Rwenzori horst and surrounding rift shoulders. Previous results from local travel-time tomography revealed the presence of low-velocity anomalies in the upper crust beneath the mountain range relative to higher velocities in the surrounding shoulders. However, since the stations used in the previous study only covered the northern part of the region, the resolution of the models proposed by the body-wave tomography was very low beneath the Rwenzori Mountains. Hence, the limits of the Rwenzori horst at depth relative to the rift shoulders are still poorly known.\nThe main objective of our ambient-noise tomography (ANT) is to provide an explanation for the building of Rwenzori Mountains. Due to the small aperture of the seismological network, we are mainly interested in the shallow crustal structure including the boundaries between the central Rwenzori horst and the surrounding rift shoulders as well as the variations in the thickness of the sedimentary basins. We expect that the ANT images will be able to delineate the boundaries between the main tectonic features including the limits of the Rwenzori horst at depth.",

            "abstract": "Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are bacterial membrane lipids that are ubiquitous in soils and peat, as well as in sediments of lakes, rivers and coastal marine environments. It has been found that the distribution of brGDGTs changes systematically with ambient temperature and pH, attesting to their potential as proxy indicators for paleoclimatic reconstruction. In lacustrine sedimentary archives, brGDGTs can originate from two sources: (1) allochthonous soil organic matter and (2) autochthonous brGDGTs produced within the lake system, both of which display fairly distinct temperature-brGDGT relationships. Until now, disentangling the relative contribution of these sources was impossible, complicating the use of brGDGTs for quantitative paleotemperature reconstructions. BrGDGTs in soils display a narrow range with respect to their stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C), generally between ‑27 and ‑30 ‰, whereas we recently found contrasting δ13C values as low as ‑43 ‰ to ‑46 ‰ for brGDGTs in sediments of a small Alpine lake. To trace the origin of this distinct isotope signal, we determined the 13C content of brGDGTs in suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the water column of Lake Lugano (Switzerland). The δ13C of SPM-derived brGDGTs decreased systematically from ‑34 ‰ in the mixolimnion to ‑41 ‰ in the anoxic monimolimnion of Lake Lugano, providing evidence for aquatic in situ production of 13C-depleted brGDGT. In order to study whether the negative δ13C offset of water column- vs. soil-derived brGDGTs may serve as an indicator for lacustrine brGDGT production, we also analyzed surface sediments from 36 lakes across the Alpine Region. In most (~85 %) of the studied lake sediments, the δ13C of brGDGTs ranged between ‑34 ‰ and ‑45 ‰, indicating predominance or a substantial contribution of aquatically produced brGDGTs. However, in some lakes (~15 %) δ13C values between ‑27 ‰ and ‑30 ‰ suggest a mainly allochthonous (i.e., soil) source. Our data demonstrate the great potential of compound-specific C isotope analysis to constrain the origin of brGDGTs in lake sediments, possibly allowing the identification of freshwater environments that are particularly suited for brGDGT-based paleoenvironmental reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "This study uses a data set from either overflying aircraft or ground-based radars operating at Ku and Ka bands, combined with in-situ microphysical measurements to develop radar reflectivity (Ze)-ice water content (IWC) and Ze-snowfall rate (S) relationships that are suited for retrieval of snowfall rate from the GPM radars.\nDuring GCPEX, the NASA DC-8 aircraft, carrying the JPL APR-2 KU and KA band radars overflew the UND Citation aircraft, making microphysical measurements in the ice clouds below. On two days, 19 and 28 January 2011, there are a total of almost 7000 1-sec colocations of the aircraft, where a collocation was defined as having a combination of a spatial separation of less than 3 km and a time separation of less than 10 minutes.\nDuring the NASA GPM Mid-latitude Continental Convective Cloud Experiment (MC3E), the Citation aircraft made in-situ observations over Oklahoma in 2011. We evaluated the data from two types of collocations. First, there were two Citation spirals on 27 April 2011, over the NPOL radar. At the same time, the UHF-band KUZR radar was collecting data in a vertically-pointing mode. Also, the Ka band KAZR Doppler radar was operating in a zenith orientation. Reflectivities and Doppler velocities, without and with appreciable Mie-scattering effects of the hydrometers (for KUZR and KAZR, respectively), are thus available during the spirals. Also during MC3E, six deep convective clouds with a total of more than 5000 5-sec samples and a range of temperatures from -40 to 0C were sampled by the Citation at the same time that NEXRAD reflectivities were measured at about the same position.\nThese data allows us to evaluate various backscatter models and to develop multi-wavelength Z-IWC and Z-S relationships. We will present the results of this study.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake stress drop is fundamental to understanding the physics of the rupture process. Although it is superficially simple to calculate an estimate of stress drop from the corner frequency of the radiated spectrum, it is much harder to be certain that measurements are reliable and accurate. The same is true of other measurements of stress drop and radiated energy. The large number of studies of earthquake stress drop, the high variability in results (~0.1-100 MPa), the large uncertainties, and the ongoing scaling controversy are evidence for this. We investigate the resolution and uncertainties of stress drops calculated using an empirical Green’s function (EGF) approach.\nEarthquakes in 3 sequences at Parkfield, California are recorded by multiple borehole stations and have abundant smaller earthquakes to use as EGFs (Abercrombie, 2014). The earthquakes in the largest magnitude cluster (M~2.1) exhibit clear temporal variation of stress drop. Independent studies obtained a similar pattern implying that it is resolvable for these well-recorded, simple sources. The borehole data reveal a similar temporal pattern for another sequence, not resolvable in an earlier study using surface recordings. The earthquakes in the third sequence have complex sources; corner frequency measurements for this sequence are highly variable and poorly resolved.\nWe use the earthquakes in the first cluster to quantify the uncertainties likely to arise in less optimal settings. The limited signal bandwidth and the quality of the EGF assumption are major sources of error. Averaging across multiple stations improves the resolution, as does using multiple good EGFs (Abercrombie, 2015).\nWe adapt the approach to apply to larger data sets. We focus on New Zealand, with the aim of resolving stress drop variability in a variety of tectonic settings. We investigate stacking over stations and multiple EGFs, and compare earthquakes (M~3-6) from both the overlying and the subducting plates.",

            "abstract": "Japan launched Venus Climate Orbiter ‘Akatsuki’ (JAXA’s mission code name: PLANET-C) to observe the dynamics of the Venus atmosphere globally and clarify the mechanism of the atmospheric circulation. The launch was on May 21st , 2010 from the Tanegashima Space Center. The cruise to Venus was smooth, however, the first Venus Orbit Insertion (VOI) trial on December 7th, 2010 tuned out to be a failure. Later Akatsuki has been orbiting the sun. Fortunately we keep the spacecraft in a healthy condition and surprisingly we have found another chance to let this spacecraft to meet Venus in 2015. Next VOI trial will be done on December 7th, 2015 and we report the result of this operation at this AGU meeting.\nThis mission is planed to answer the question described below. The radius of the Earth and Venus are almost the same. In addition the radiation from the sun is also almost the same. The climates of these planets, however, are much different. For example, the strong zonal wind is observed on Venus with the period of 4 days, where Venus rotates westward with the period of 243 days. The wind speed is about 100 m s-1. This is called super rotation. We will investigate from data from Akatsuki what attributes to the difference of the climates between Earth and Venus. AKATSUKI was designed for remote sensing from an equatorial, elliptical orbit to tract the atmospheric motion at different altitudes using 5 cameras (3xIR, UV, Visible) and by the radio occultation technique.\nThe first VOI has failed due to a malfunction of the propulsion system. The check valve between the helium tank and the fuel tank was blocked by an unexpected salt formation during the cruising from the Earth to Venus. As a result the main engine (orbital maneuvering engine, OME) became oxidizer-rich and fuel-poor condition, which led to an abnormal combustion in the engine with high temperature, and finally the engine was broken. We decide to use RCS thrusters for Trajectory Control Maneuvers’ (TCMs) and finally insert Akatsuki into the orbit. Total thrust force of 4 RCS thrusters is 20 % of that of the main thruster and the orbit after VOI-R becomes a larger ellipse (apoapsis altitude will be finally 3.2x106km ) than the original plan in 2010. We have already done major 6 TCMs before July 31st, 2015 to let the spacecraft to meet Venus in December.",

            "abstract": "Northern Eurasia (NE) is a distinct and crucial region because it has the physical size necessary to effect regional and global climate, and interacting socioeconomic and political drivers have provided the impetus to quell or exacerbate change. The circumboreal zone contains the largest stocks of terrestrial carbon on Earth, and NE holds 2/3 of that carbon pool. Recent climate change data and models agree that temperature increases in NE have been and will be among the greatest on the planet, leading to longer growing seasons, increased evapotranspiration, extreme fire weather, increased permafrost, ice, and snow melting, all of which are altering NE ecosystems. Moreover, socioeconomic and political forces have often driven land cover and ecosystem changes in NE.\nSatellite data, paired with cooperative partnerships that have evolved over the decades, have enabled researchers to improve our understanding of these complex interacting systems. Analyses of long-term data reveal increasing abandonment of marginal croplands, shifts in crop types and agricultural practices, and increasing logging. Despite regional differences, these changes influence carbon storage, changes in surface albedo, wildlife distribution and habitat, and the availability of food and fodder. Detailed individual-species and bioclimatic models project the northward migration of keystone species and pests. These changes across NE feedback to regional and global climate systems with global consequences.\nThis talk will synthesize past decades of key international NE research and introduce new highlights. Using long-term satellite data, we have developed detailed maps that have not been previously available, which increase our understanding of these complex interacting systems.\nOver the decades, as strides have made in understanding the complexity of NE, our ability to continue collaborative interactive research is being limited by political pressures outside of the purview of science.",

            "abstract": "An important class of loops in the solar atmosphere, cool transition region loops, have received little attention mainly due to instrumental limitations. We analyze a cluster of these loops in the on-disk active region NOAA 11934 recorded in a Si IV 1402.8 Å spectral raster and 1400Å slit-jaw (SJ) images taken by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. We divide these loops into three groups and study their dynamics, evolution and interaction.The first group comprises geometrically relatively stable loops, which are finely scaled with 382~626 km cross-sections. Siphon flows in these loops are suggested by the Doppler velocities gradually changing from -10 km/s (blue-shifts) in one end to 20 km/s (red-shifts) in the other. Nonthermal velocities from 15 to 25 km/s were determined. The obtained physical properties suggest that these loops are impulsively heated by magnetic reconnection occurring at the blue-shifted footpoints where magnetic cancellation with a rate of 1015 Mx/s is found. The released magnetic energy is redistributed by the siphon flows. The second group corresponds to two active footpoints rooted in mixed-magnetic-polarity regions. Magnetic reconnection in both footpoints is suggested by explosive-event line profiles with enhanced wings up to 200 km/s and magnetic cancellation with a rate of ~1015 Mx/s. In the third group, an interaction between two cool loop systems is observed. Mixed-magnetic polarities are seen in their conjunction area where explosive-event line profiles and magnetic cancellation with a rate of 3×1015 Mx/s are found. This is a clear indication that magnetic reconnection occurs between these two loop systems. Our observations suggest that the cool transition region loops are heated impulsively most likely by sequences of magnetic reconnection events.",

            "abstract": "EarthScope’s USArray now provides broadband seismic data across the contiguous U.S. and southeastern Canada. We used teleseismic receiver functions and surface wave tomography to map crustal structure beneath the entire array. Crust thickness was estimated with multi-mode Ps receiver function images using <0.5 Hz Ps and <0.25 Hz 2p1s and 2s1p reverberations between the free-surface and Moho. In areas of sedimentary basins or large impedance contrasts in the middle crust the reverberations alone often provide clearer images of the Moho than the Ps mode, because of interference from conversions at shallow interfaces is reduced at greater lag times. The new results enable large-scale comparison of the structural legacy of multiple rifting and collision events in eastern North America. Some Proterozoic rift segments defined by Bouguer gravity and surface geology maintain locally thin crust while others lack correlated Moho topography or are areas of locally thicker crust. Locally thin crust is found at southern end of the mid-continent rift (MCR) in northern Kansas and southern Nebraska, along the Reelfoot rift, and beneath inferred rifts in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. The Oklahoma aulacogen is not associated with a coherent change in crust thickness along its length, at least at a scale resolvable by USArray data and our imaging approach. The MCR extending northeast from Nebraska to Lake Superior has locally thicker crust, consistent with other recent results. We suggest that magmatic additions to the lower crust overwhelmed extension in the northern mid-continent rift, but not the rift segments further south and east. Collision events of the Grenville orogeny and Paleozoic orogens that created the Appalachian Mountains are still associated with ~45-55 km thick crust extending from the Grenville front eastward across the Appalachian Mountains to the fall line that marks the abrupt geomorphic transition to the coastal plains. Despite the ~45-55 km crust thickness long-wavelength elevations (>50 km) across this area rarely exceed 1 km. Along the fall line we find ~15-20 km of seaward thinning that is coherent from Alabama to Pennsylvania, with a transition width similar to or less than the ~70 km.",

Both the relative stability of the stream network and the degree of disconnection along the network length can strongly affect stream ecology, including fish migration and nutrient spiraling. Previous data suggests that stream network lengths decrease measurably as discharge decreases, and that evapotranspiration may be an important control on stream network persistence. We hypothesized that changes in sapflow timing and magnitude across a gradient from rain-dominated to snow-dominated elevations would be reflected in the stability of the stream network in a steep watershed draining to the Middle Fork Salmon in central Idaho. We expected that the relative timing of water availability across the gradient would drive differences in water delivery to both trees and the stream network.\nHere we present results that highlight the stability of sapflow timing across the gradient and persistence of the stream network at this site. We discuss geologic controls on network stability and present a conceptual framework identifying characteristics of stable flowheads. We test this framework at four sites in central Idaho with mapped stream networks. We also discuss late summer sapflow patterns across the elevation gradient and their linkages to soil and atmospheric characteristics. Finally, we compare these patterns to those observed at other sites and discuss the role of vegetation in controlling spatiotemporal patterns across the stream network.",

The changes in tilt of the ground surface were recorded by tiltmeters at four observation points located 10-15 km next to the active crater. A spectral analysis of both the tilt and seismic data revealed that ground deformations data is positively correlated with the intensity of seismic signals at the same observation points. Variation in volcanic tremor amplitude of long –period signals is related to the intensity of gas emissions during the eruption. Therefore, we suggest that the long-period tilt of the ground surface are caused by the deformation of walls in a channel due to variations of pressure in the magmatic melt during gas expansion.",

            "abstract": "We present the first direct observation of fluid flow and solute transport in a microscopic rough-walled fracture using micro-PIV to assess the evolution of non-Fickian tailing as eddies developed at larger fluid velocities. These observations demonstrated a previously-unidentified, important phenomenon: normalized BTCs became highly skewed towards later times up until a limiting fluid velocity, beyond which tailing decreased and peak concentrations increased. Further microscopic observation of particle trajectories clarified the likely cause of the reduced tailing at higher velocities. Tailing increased until the onset of eddies in large-aperture regions. As eddies became fully developed, particles were initially entrained in the eddies, but then cast back into the main flow channel, which reduced tailing. Numerical studies designed to more clearly understand the 3D nature of flow and transport showed that streamlines swirled near the fracture walls in a large-aperture region and re-entered the main flow channel. These numerical results support our interpretation of the experimental observation. This study, based on combined direct observations and numerical simulations, clearly demonstrated that there was no well-defined separation stream surface delineating so-called immobile (recirculation) and mobile zones in the 3D nature of the flow and transport and the tails decreased with growing eddies due to mass transfer by advective paths from eddies into the main flow channels. These experimental and numerical results contradict results from numerous previous studies based upon simulations in 2D fracture geometries and highlight the need for caution when using 2D simulations to understand 3D transport processes.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the magnitude of, and controls over, carbon fluxes in arctic ecosystems is essential for accurate assessment and prediction of their responses to climate change. In 2013, we harvested vegetation and soils in the most common plant community types in source areas for fluxes measured by eddy covariance towers located in three representative Alaska tundra ecosystems along a toposequence (a ridge site of heath tundra and moist non-acidic tundra, a mid-slope site of moist acidic tussock tundra, and a valley bottom site of wet sedge tundra and moist acidic tussock tundra) at Imnavait Creek, Alaska. This harvest sought to relate biomass, production, composition, and C and N stocks in soil and vegetation, to estimates of net ecosystem CO2 exchange obtained by micrometeorological methods. Soil C and N stocks in the seasonally unfrozen soil layer were greatest in the wet sedge community, and least in the heath community. In contrast, moist acidic tussock tundra at the valley bottom site had the highest C and N stocks in vascular plant biomass, while nearby wet sedge tundra had the lowest. Overall, soil C:N ratio was highest in moist acidic tussock tundra at the mid-slope site. Aboveground biomass of vascular plants in moist acidic tundra at the mid-slope site was nearly three times higher than that measured thirty years earlier in vegetation harvests of nearby areas at Imnavait Creek. Other harvests from sites near Toolik Field Station suggest that vascular plant biomass in moist acidic tundra has increased in multiple sites over this time period. Increased biomass in the mid-1990s corresponds with a switch from mostly negative to mostly positive spatially-averaged air temperature anomalies in the climate record. All our sites have been annual net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere over nine years of measurement, but in the last two years, the valley bottom site has been a particularly strong source, due to CO2 losses in fall and winter that correspond with a longer period before the soil freezes fully. Mobilization of soil C under the modest long-term warming that occurred in these ecosystems may have made available more soil N, leading to greater vascular plant productivity. Whether recent increases in C loss overwinter are sustainable over the longer term, and whether they will lead to further vegetation change, remains to be seen.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography models have revealed that there exist two large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean in the Earth’s lower mantle. Waveform modeling results suggest both LLSVPs have steep sharp side boundaries，which imply that they probably are compositionally heterogeneous from the ambient mantle. When applying the surface plate motion history in the last a few hundred million years (Ma) as the driving mechanism, numerical modeling has successfully reproduced the geographical distribution of the two LLSVPs in thermochemical mantle convection. However, two prominent seismic features of the LLSVPs, the steep side boundaries and the high elevation, can hardly be obtained in previous geodynamic models. Here, we include in our mantle convection model the effects of iron-spin transition of ferropericlase which substantially change physical property of the mantle. Our results show that iron-spin transition plays a dominant role in controlling the structure and stability of LLSVPs. Large chemical blocks with steep side boundaries and high elevations up to ~1200 km above core-mantle boundary (CMB) emerge in our models with the volume content of ferropericlase ~20%. Such blocks cause a shear wave velocity decrease of ~3.5% which is consistent with the seismic observations. Our results also show that these LLSVPs are transient structures in the lower mantle, which can typically last for a few hundred million years before destroyed by large-scale mantle motion.",

            "abstract": "With nearly seven years of IBEX observations, we can now trace the time evolution of heliospheric ENAs through over half a solar cycle. At the north and south ecliptic poles, the spacecraft attitude allows for continuous coverage of the ENA flux; thus, signal from these vantages have much higher statistical accuracy and time resolution than anywhere else in the sky. By assuming pressure balance across the termination shock, and comparing the solar wind dynamic pressure measured at 1 AU with the heliosheath plasma pressure derived from the observed ENA fluxes, we show that the heliosheath pressure measured at the poles correlates well with the solar cycle. The analysis requires time-shifting the ENA measurements to account for the travel time out and back from the heliosheath. The time shifts at the north pole range from 5.1 years at 700 eV, the low end of the IBEX-Hi energy range, to 3.2 years at 4.3 keV, the top IBEX-Hi energy. These time shifts assume a common mean distance to the ENA source region for all energies. For the south pole, the best-fit time shifts range from 4.1 to 2.6 years across the IBEX-Hi energy range. Hence, the ENA source at the south is somewhat closer than at the north, consistent with an asymmetric heliosphere model. We will present the details of this analysis, as well as estimates of the scale size of the heliosheath in the polar directions.",

Both of the geomagnetic storms show a multi-step development. We examine the plasma and magnetic field characteristics of the driving coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in connection with the development of the geomagnetic storms. A particular effort is to reconstruct the in situ structure using a Grad-Shafranov technique and compare the reconstruction results with solar observations, which gives a larger spatial perspective of the source conditions than one-dimensional in situ measurements. Key results are obtained concerning how the plasma and magnetic field characteristics of CMEs control the geomagnetic storm intensity and variability: (1) a sheath-ejecta-ejecta mechanism and a sheath-sheath-ejecta scenario are proposed for the multi-step development of the 2015 March 17 and June 22 geomagnetic storms, respectively; (2) two contrasting cases of how the CME flux rope characteristics generate intense geomagnetic storms are found, which indicates that a southward flux-rope orientation is not a necessity for a strong geomagnetic storm; and (3) the unexpected 2015 March 17 intense geomagnetic storm resulted from the interaction between two successive CMEs plus the compression by a high-speed stream from behind, which is essentially the ``perfect storm\" scenario proposed by \\citet{liu14a}, so the ``perfect storm\" scenario may not be as rare as the phrase implies.",

            "abstract": "The terrestrial hydrologic cycle (groundwater, overland flow, land surface and vegetation) is a complex, coupled system with processes spanning a wide range of scales. Surface and subsurface flow dynamics govern residence time or water age, which is a key metric of flow, storage and water availability for human use and ecosystem function. However, open questions remain regarding the timing and distribution of these flowpaths, and how they interact with geology and hydrologic variables such as recharge at large scales. Although observations in small catchments have shown a fractal distribution of ages, residence times are difficult to directly quantify or measure in large basins. Here, we present the results of flow and transport simulations of major watersheds across North America. These results are used to compute distributions of water ages. The watersheds evaluated have peak ages from 1.5 – 10.5 years, in agreement with ages from isotopic observations using bomb-derived radioisotopes. The peak age is controlled by the mean hydraulic conductivity, which is a function of the prevailing geology. All river basins are also characterized by a wide range of residence times—from 0.1 to 10,000 years. The shape of the residence time distribution depends on aridity, which in turn determines water table depth and the frequency of shorter flowpaths. Finally, we present a path forward where computational hydrology can be used, in conjunction with observations and theory, to understand scaling relationships.",

            "abstract": "A portion of the total motion across the Pacific-North American plate boundary in southern California is accommodated by a complex network of seismically-active oblique-reverse slip faults in the Transverse Ranges region. Most notably, existing geologic and geophysical data support the presence of a large seismogenic reverse fault, the Ventura fault, which has a previously estimated slip rate of 4.4-6.9 mm/yr. The Ventura fault appears to link with several other faults and may represent a potential source for future ~M8.0 earthquakes. A reverse fault of this size and slip rate should be detectable with modern geodetic techniques; however, our past attempts to use continuous GPS data to map out the interseismic strain patterns did not clearly delineate the fault’s slip rate and/or locking depth. Accurate measurement of interseismic deformation across the Ventura fault requires further examination with a spatially denser data set. We, therefore, combine GPS velocities from the current Plate Boundary Observatory Network and the Southern California Earthquake Center’s Crustal Motion map into a single local reference frame to provide a dense GPS network for strain rate inversions. Additionally, we process InSAR data from the Envisat and ERS satellites using the persistent scatterer method resulting in >1 million line of sight velocity estimates throughout the region. Velocity profiles across the InSAR data do not clearly delineate any significant line of sight strains associated with the Ventura fault, but strain rate inversions of the GPS network reveal clear horizontal contraction gradients along the fault structure. Mechanical models of the Ventura fault predict average slip rates between 2.7-3.2 mm/yr, but with maximum slip rates near the coast, where the existing long term slip rate estimates were made. Thus, the existing slip rate estimate may have been made in a location with nearly maximum slip rates for the Ventura fault and may overestimate the seismic hazard.",

            "abstract": "The main source of seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle is the deformation-induced crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of olivine. The interpretation of seismic anisotropy relies on models and experiments that predict certain relationships between olivine CPO and the deformation kinematics. Under some conditions, such as the interiors of oceanic plates, these relationships may be quite simple. However, near plate boundaries flow patterns are complex and the interpretation of seismic anisotropy is not straight-forward. In this contribution we describe the effect of deformation history on the re-orientation of olivine CPO as a function of strain. High pressure and temperature deformation experiments were performed on the Åheim dunite, which exhibits a pre-existing texture. Experiments were conducted in three different configurations with the pre-existing foliation at 0°, 45°, and 90° to the axis of compression, simulating three unique deformation histories. Deformation microstructures and texture are analyzed using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The experiments show that up to strains of ~0.7 the three configurations evolve differently from one another, and from models initiated with random textures. Moreover, none of the models achieved the expected textural steady-state. The experiments results are then compared to numerical simulations using a Viscoplastic Self Consistent (VPSC) approach, and D-Rex. The input for the models is the Åheim dunite CPO in the three configurations used in the experiments. It is shown that, generally, texture symmetry evolves similarly in the models and the experiments although there are notable differences in texture strength. To achieve better agreement between experiments and models, new model parameterizations are proposed. Finally, we use the new parameterization of D-Rex to simulate a range of plausible deformation histories and associated seismic anisotropy in a variety of flow settings.",

Using the system, in this study, various coupling effects between electrodes and the samples are discussed including contact resistance, lead resistance, temperature dependence, and heat produced within the samples by applied current. The lead resistance was over 10 times higher than the resistance of the conductive samples such as graphite or nichrome, even though the electrodes and lead lines were made of silver. Furthermore, lead resistance itself showed very strong temperature dependence, so that it is essential to subtract the lead resistance from the measured values at corresponding temperature. Minimization of contact resistance is very important, so that the axial loads are needed as big as possible unless the deformation of sample occurs.",

            "abstract": "Seismic monitoring at injection sites (e.g., CO2 sequestration, waste water disposal, hydraulic fracturing) has become an increasingly important tool for hazard identification and avoidance. The information obtained from this data is often limited to seismic event properties (e.g., location, approximate time, moment tensor), the accuracy of which greatly depends on the estimated elastic velocity models. However, creating accurate velocity models from passive array data remains a challenging problem. Common techniques rely on picking arrivals or matching waveforms requiring high signal-to-noise data that is often not available for the magnitude earthquakes observed over injection sites.\nWe present a new method for obtaining elastic velocity information from earthquakes though full-wavefield wave-equation imaging and adjoint-state tomography. The technique exploits the fact that the P- and S-wave arrivals originate at the same time and location in the subsurface. We generate image volumes by back-propagating P- and S-wave data through initial Earth models and then applying a correlation-based extended-imaging condition. Energy focusing away from zero lag in the extended image volume is used as a (penalized) residual in an adjoint-state tomography scheme to update the P- and S-wave velocity models.\nWe use an acousto-elastic approximation to greatly reduce the computational cost. Because the method requires neither an initial source location or origin time estimate nor picking of arrivals, it is suitable for low signal-to-noise datasets, such as microseismic data. Synthetic results show that with a realistic distribution of microseismic sources, P- and S-velocity perturbations can be recovered. Although demonstrated at an oil and gas reservoir scale, the technique can be applied to problems of all scales from geologic core samples to global seismology.",

            "abstract": "Moist convection is a fundamental process in our climate system, but is usually parameterized in climate models. The underlying approximations introduce significant uncertainties and biases, and there is thus a general thrust towards the explicit representation of convection. For climate applications, convection-resolving simulations are still very expensive, but are increasingly becoming feasible. Here we present recent results pertaining to the development and exploitation of convection-resolving regional climate models. We discuss the potential and challenges of the approach, highlight validation using decade-long simulations, explore convection-resolving climate change scenarios, and provide an outlook on the use of next-generation supercomputing architectures.\nDetailed results will be presented using the COSMO model over two computational domains at a horizontal resolution of 2.2 km. The first covers an extended Alpine region from Northern Italy to Northern Germany. For this domain decade-long simulations have been conducted, driven by both reanalysis as well as CMIP5 model data. Results show that explicit convection leads to significant improvements in the representation of summer precipitation, and to substantial differences in climate projections in terms of precipitation statistics.\nThe second domain covers European (with 1536x1536x60 grid points) and the respective simulations exploit heterogeneous many-core hardware architectures. Results demonstrate realistic mesoscale processes embedded in synoptic-scale features, such as line convection along cold frontal systems, or the triggering of moist convection by propagating cold-air pools. Currently a 10-year simulation using this set up is near completion. To efficiently use GPU-based high-performance computers, the model code underwent significant development, including a rewrite of the dynamical core in C++. It is argued that today’s largest supercomputers would in principle be able to support – already now – global convection-resolving climate simulations, provided the respectively refactored codes would be available.",

            "abstract": "The favored theory for lunar origin is the giant impact hypothesis, where a protoplanet collides with the growing Earth and creates an orbiting disk of material that forms the Moon. However, the astonishing isotopic similarity between the Earth and Moon cannot be explained by current giant impact models without appealing to highly specific circumstances. Here, we demonstrate that a condensation model for lunar origin, achieved via a previously unrecognized class of post-impact states, produces the Moon's major characteristics. The required class of post-impact states is defined by (i) a high degree of vaporization and (ii) rapid rotation. When these two criteria are met, the mantle, atmosphere and disk (MAD) form a dynamically and thermodynamically continuous structure that quickly mixes, thereby diluting initial compositional heterogeneities. Then, partial condensation from the pressure-supported mass beyond the Roche limit produces a Moon that is isotopically similar to the bulk silicate Earth and depleted in volatile and moderately volatile elements. Initially, the condensed liquid is composed of silicates. As the structure cools, metal exsolves in the accreting Moon and moonlets. We calculate ~2wt% metal is exsolved from a bulk silicate Earth composition, which is consistent with estimates of the mass of the lunar core. Thus, similar tungsten isotopes are established in the Earth and Moon as metal is exsolved in both bodies after mixing. In our model, the criterion for lunar origin shifts, away from specific impact parameters that inject terrestrial material into orbit, to any collision that transforms the Earth into a rapidly rotating and substantially vaporized MAD planet. Impacts that can transform the Earth are common during the end stages of planet formation. Therefore, the characteristics of our Moon are a natural consequence of forming the Earth.",

These large low shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) cover almost half of the outer core surface and represent about 3% of the Earth’s volume, making them the most prominent features in the lower mantle. Despite their large scale, there is still much debate about their origin and composition, in particular, whether they are a thermal, chemical or thermo-chemical anomaly. The reported sharpness of the boundaries of large low shear velocity provinces suggests that they are at least in part compositional anomalies. One potential explanation is that they comprise the relics of subducted slabs, and thus have mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB).\nThe high temperature and pressure elastic properties of MORB phases, needed to estimate the seismic properties of MORB mineral assemblages are unknown. Here we report the high temperature and pressure elastic properties of several aluminous phases and the α-PbO2 phase of SiO2, which comprise about 20 percent of MORB material each.

            "abstract": "Melt-induced weakening can play critical role for enabling lithospheric deformation in the areas of intense mantle-derived magmatism, such as mid-ocean ridges, rift zones and hot spots. It implies significant reduction in the long-term brittle strength of the deforming lithosphere subjected to frequent melt percolation episodes. Such weakening corresponds to conditions when shear stress reaches the tensile yield strength of rocks at nearly equal melt and lithostatic pressures. The dominant features of melt transport in this regime are planar, sharply localized zones (dykes) in which melt is transported though the lithosphere from the source region. Mechanical energy dissipation balance shows that the long-term effective strength of the melt-weakened lithosphere is a strain-averaged rather than a time-averaged quantity. Its magnitude is mainly defined by the ratio between melt pressure and lithostatic pressure along dykes during short dyke emplacement episodes, which control most of the lithospheric deformation and mechanical energy dissipation. We quantified the range of expected values of the lithospheric strength by performing 2D numerical hydro-mechanical experiments on melt-bearing rock deformation as well as seismo-mechanical experiments on long-term lithospheric deformation assisted by frequent short-term dyke propagation episodes. These numerical experiments showed that the long-term lithospheric strength in the areas of intense magmatism can be as low as few MPa and is critically dependent on the availability of melt for enabling frequent episodes of dyke propagation through the lithosphere. Short-lived viscous-plastic deformation is localized along propagating weak dykes whereas bulk of the lithosphere only deforms elastically and is subjected to large deviatoric stresses. The experiments suggest that it is not the high strength of the elastically deforming strong lithospheric blocks but the low strength of visco-plastically deforming dykes that define the long-term effective strength of the lithosphere. Thus, the low long-term strength of the melt-weakened lithosphere is associated with high volume-averaged deviatoric stress for this lithosphere. Possible geodynamic implications of melt-induced weakening for modern and early Earth tectonic processes are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Global warming and climate change have caused significant damage and loss of life worldwide. The pattern of natural disasters has gradually diversified and their frequency is increasing. The impact of climate change on flood risk in urban rivers is of particular interest because these areas are typically densely populated. The occurrence of urban river flooding due to climate change not only causes significant loss of life and property but also causes health and social problems. It is therefore necessary to develop a scientific urban flood management system to cope with and reduce the impacts of climate change, including flood damage. In this study, we are going to introduce Integrated Inland-River Flood Analysis System in Seoul to conduct predictions on flash rain or short-term rainfall by using radar and satellite information and perform prompt and accurate prediction on the inland flooded areas. In addition, this urban flood management system can be used as a tool for decision making of systematic disaster prevention through real-time monitoring.",

            "abstract": "TGO launch is expected in early 2016. Why do we need more orbital imaging of Mars given the near-global coverage by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on Mars Express and the Context Camera (CTX) on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), plus the very high-resolution coverage by MRO’s High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE)? CaSSIS extends the monitoring of past missions to future years to track longer-term changes, and provides contemporaneous imaging of regions that may have unique signatures such as trace gases detected by other experiments on TGO. CaSSIS will provide the highest resolution (~4.6 m/pixel) coverage of Mars everywhere except the ~2% of Mars’ surface covered by HiRISE (and only ~0.5% in colour or stereo) and another few percent covered by the Mars Orbital Camera (MOC). Although CTX has a similar imaging scale (~5.5 m/pixel), it does not provide colour images and useful stereo coverage is ~10% of Mars; CaSSIS uses a rotation mechanism to acquire along-track stereo with matching illumination of the surface. HRSC has provided >90% global stereo and colour coverage, but the highly elliptical orbit and wide-angle optics result in >10 m/pixel scale. Also, the HRSC images are acquired at different emission and phase angles per colour. The 72 degree inclined orbit of TGO means that it rotates through all local times of day several times per Mars season, so CaSSIS will have the unique ability to monitor how surfaces change with time of day as well as season, which could prove important to understanding recurring slope lineae (RSL) and frost distributions. This orbit also provides more opportunities to monitor the middle latitudes, for example to find new impacts that expose shallow clean ice. The 4 CaSSIS colour bands include matches to the 3 HiRISE colour bands, to extend monitoring of key sites. In summary, CaSSIS is by design complementary to past/continuing orbital imaging experiments. ",

            "abstract": "Introduction: NASA’s Dawn spacecraft will orbit the dwarf planet Ceres in August and September 2015 in HAMO (High Altitude Mapping Orbit) with an altitude of about 1,500 km to characterize for instance the geology, topography, and shape of Ceres before it will be transferred to the lowest orbit. One of the major goals of this mission phase is the global mapping of Ceres.\nData: The Dawn mission is equipped with a fram-ing camera (FC). The framing camera will take about 2600 clear filter images with a resolution of about 120 m/pixel and different viewing angles and different illumination conditions. \nData Processing: The first step of the processing chain towards the cartographic products is to ortho-rectify the images to the proper scale and map projec-tion type. This process requires detailed information of the Dawn orbit and attitude data and of the topography of the target. Both, improved orientation and high-resolution shape models, are provided by stereo processing of the HAMO dataset. Ceres' HAMO shape model is used for the calculation of the ray intersection points while the map projection itself will be done onto a reference sphere for Ceres. The final step is the controlled mosaicking of all nadir images to a global mosaic of Ceres, the so called basemap.\nCeres map tiles: The Ceres atlas will be produced in a scale of 1:750,000 and will consist of 15 tiles that conform to the quadrangle schema for small planets and medium size Icy satellites. A map scale of 1:750,000 guarantees a mapping at the highest availa-ble Dawn resolution in HAMO.\nNomenclature: The Dawn team proposed to the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to use the names of gods and goddesses of agriculture and vege-tation from world mythology as names for the craters. This proposal was accepted by the IAU and the team proposed names for geological features to the IAU based on the HAMO mosaic. These feature names will be applied to the map tiles.",

            "abstract": "Based on daily 500 hPa heights from ERA-Interim reanalysis, this study analyzed the day-to-day circulation variance in cold season (October-March) during the global-warming hiatus by employing composite and correlation analysis. Two same-length time periods, i.e., the hiatus period (1999-2013) and the rapid warming period (1984-1998), are compared. Spectral analysis reveals that over the mid-high latitude northern hemisphere the most outstanding peak in the daily 500hPa height variance is of quasi bi-weekly (QBW) time scale (about 10-20d), which accounts for about 32% of the total variance. During the global-warming hiatus, the QBW disturbances have changed remarkably in Northeast Asia. On average in the domain of 128°E-142°E, 42°N-50°N the QBW variance has changed from 1860m2 in the rapid warming period to 2475m2 in the hiatus, increasing by about 33% and being statistically significant at the 95% level. The time-lag analysis shows that the QBW signal could be traced back to about 14 days ago with a origin around Ural Mountains, then the signals developed and moved southeastward, its location about 10 days ago was located in West Siberia, about 6 days ago located in Mongolian Plat. at finally move to Northeast Asia. Compared the propagation process between the two periods, we found that the path was basically the same, but there are evident difference in their signal intensity along its eastward propagation. Comparing with the rapid warm period, the QBW during the hiatus got much intensive as the signal move across the West Siberia. And the enhanced signal keeps its intensity till to Northeast Asia. The intensification of QBW may be related to the changes in the background circulation. During the hiatus period, there are anomalous large-scale changes in 500hPa heights, with a strengthened Ural ridge and a westward East Asia trough. Accordingly, there is a stronger east-west pressure gradient in western Siberia, being a condition beneficial to strengthen the QBW. The possible connection of the background circulation to the surface temperature cooling over Siberia during the hiatus and the underlying mechanisms, however, requires further investigation.",

            "abstract": "Long-standing biases of climate models limit the skills of climate prediction and projection. The monsoonal tropical Indian Ocean (IO) has been overlooked in bias studies because model errors compensate among seasons and do not manifest prominently in the annual means. In the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble, we have identified a common error pattern in climate models that resembles the IO dipole (IOD) mode of interannual variability in nature, with an excessive equatorial easterly wind bias during boreal autumn accompanied by physically consistent biases in precipitation, sea surface temperature (SST), and subsurface ocean temperature. The analyses show that such IOD-like biases can be traced back to errors in the South Asian summer monsoon. A southwest summer monsoon that is too weak over the Arabian Sea generates a warm SST bias over the western equatorial IO. In boreal autumn, Bjerknes feedback helps amplify the error into an IOD-like bias pattern in wind, precipitation, SST, and subsurface ocean temperature. Such mean state biases result in an interannual IOD variability that is too strong. Most models project an IOD-like future change for the boreal autumn mean state in the global warming scenario, which would result in more frequent occurrences of extreme positive IOD events in the future with important consequences to Indonesia and East Africa. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) characterizes this future IOD-like projection in the mean state as robust based on consistency among models, but the authors’ results cast doubts on this conclusion since models with larger IOD amplitude biases tend to produce stronger IOD-like projected changes in the future.",

            "abstract": "Patterns of functional diversity reflect the inter- and intraspecific variability of plant traits and are linked to other aspects of biodiversity, environmental factors and ecosystem function. To study the patterns at plot and stand level, spatially continuous trait measurements are required. Remote sensing methods based on airborne observations can offer such continuous high-resolution measurements, resolving individual trees of a forest at a regional extent.\nThe study was performed at the Laegern forest, a temperate mixed forest dominated by deciduous and coniferous trees (Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies; 47°28'42.0“ N, 8°21'51.8“ E, 682 m asl; Switzerland). Canopy height, plant area index and foliage height diversity were derived from full-waveform airborne laser scanning data. These structural traits were used to calculate functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence at a range of scales. A Bayesian multiresolution scale analysis was used to infer the scales at which functional diversity patterns occur. The radiative regime of the forest was simulated using the 3D radiative transfer model DART. Using a voxel-based forest reconstruction allowed us to derive top of canopy, bottom of canopy and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation.\nThe results of this study will provide new insights on linking forest canopy structure to the radiative regime of the forest. Light availability is a critical factor determining plant growth and competition. Within canopy light scattering is mainly driven by the arrangement of leaves and their leaf optical properties. Therefore, we expect a link between the structural complexity of the forest as encompassed by functional diversity and the light availability within and below the canopy. Ultimately, this information can be used in dynamic ecosystem models such as ED2, allowing us to predict the influence of functional diversity and radiative properties on ecosystem functioning under current conditions and under different global-change scenarios.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that, under the influence of planetary rotation, the primary force balance for large scale convective planetary flows is between pressure gradients and the Coriolis force; these flows are termed geostrophic. Convective flows are never purely geostrophic because buoyancy (which powers convection) is necessarily present and so is viscous dissipation. Nevertheless, provided rotation is dominant, the first order geostrophic balance is preserved and these flows are often referred to as quasi-geostrophic (QG). When buoyancy is perpendicular to rotation, the non-axial QG flows are rigid, that is, they have small variations along the direction of rotation. QG numerical models of thermal convection, in which only the non-axial flows are evolved, have been developed to take advantage of this 2D structure of QG flows. These models can reproduce faithfully some of the features of fully three-dimensional (3D) numerical models. The chief advantage of such QG models is that, because of their 2D nature, a much higher numerical resolution is achievable than for 3D models for the same computing cost and can thus be used to study aspects of convection under a regime not accessible in 3D models. In existing QG models, buoyancy is restricted to its non-axial component and the modelled region of convection is limited to that outside the tangent cylinder. Here, we present an extension on these models by incorporating the axial component of buoyancy and by modelling convection inside the tangent cylinder. When buoyancy is parallel to rotation, the non-axial QG flows are no longer rigid and include an axial gradient. To capture the first order dynamics inside the tangent cylinder, we must also track the evolution of non-rigid flows. We show that our model can reproduce the salient features of 3D numerical models near onset. Further, our model also captures features of well developed, fully turbulent convection, such as production of zonal jets.",

            "abstract": "Exchanges of axial angular momentum between the Earth's core and the mantle lead to variations in the rotation rate of the mantle, observed as length of day (LOD) variations. LOD changes at decadal timescale are dominantly the result of core-mantle angular momentum exchanges. This is verified based on predictions of the changes in core angular momentum calculated on the basis of flows that can explain the observed changes in Earth's magnetic field. Similarly, a periodic LOD change with a period of approximately 6 years can also be shown to be of core origin. We expect that core flow variations at longer timescale (hundreds of years) should also lead to LOD changes though this is more difficult to confirm with available data on Earth rotation. While the core contribution to LOD changes at decadal timescale and for the 6 year signal is well established on the basis of angular momentum budget, the nature of the torque responsible for the angular momentum exchange remains a question mark. In this presentation, I will review our knowledge of the core contribution to LOD changes. I will also present results from recent attempts at identifying the nature of the torque between the core and mantle.",

In here we consider several tidal parameters that have been improved or are newly determined from recent geodetic observations and analyses. First, providing the internal structure of the Moon, especially its viscosity profile, we compute its tidal quality factors (i.e., Q) and Love numbers (i.e., k2, k3, and h2) for the monthly, annual, triennial, and sexennial tidal periods. Second, we compare these theoretical values with observational ones. As a result of this comparison, we can find a viscosity profile with the low-viscosity zone which is consistent with the frequency-dependent quality factors although its viscosity range is slightly larger than that constrained previously. In addition, we can completely or nearly explain each Love number by considering the above constraint on the viscosity range revised here, at least limited to the monthly tide. Finally, we conclude that this layer reaches just below or inside the place where many seismic nests of deep moonquakes are located.",

            "abstract": "Microbial production is the major source of N2O, the strongest greenhouse gas produced within the nitrogen cycle, and the most important stratospheric ozone destructant released in the 21st century. Wastewater treatment is an important and growing source of N2O, with best estimates predicting N2O emissions from this sector will have increased by >25% by 2020. Novel treatment employing partial nitritation-anammox, rather than traditional nitrification-denitrification, has the potential to achieve a neutral carbon footprint due to increased biogas production – if N2O production accounts for <0.5-1% of total nitrogen turnover. As a further motivation for this research, microbial pathways identified from wastewater treatment can be applied to our understanding of N cycling in the natural environment.\nThis study presents the first online isotopic measurements of offgas N2O from a partial-nitritation anammox reactor 1. The measured N2O isotopic composition – in particular the N2O isotopic site preference (SP = δ15Nα - δ15Nβ) – was used to understand N2O production pathways in the reactor. When N2O emissions peaked due to high dissolved oxygen concentrations, low SP showed that N2O was produced primarily via nitrifier denitrification by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOBs). N2O production by AOBs via NH2OH oxidation, in contrast, did not appear to be important under any conditions.\nOver the majority of the one-month measurement period, the measured SP was much higher than expected following our current understanding of N2O production pathways 2. SP reached 41‰ during normal operating conditions and achieved a maximum of 45‰ when nitrite was added under anoxic conditions. These results could be explained by unexpectedly strong heterotrophic N2O reduction despite low dissolved organic matter concentrations, or by an incomplete understanding of isotopic fractionation during N2O production from NH2OH oxidation by AOBs – however the explanation most consistent with all results is a previously unknown N2O production pathway associated with anammox metabolism.\nHarris et al.

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas and contributes strongly to stratospheric ozone depletion through the formation of NO. Concentrations of N2O in the atmosphere have increased by approximately 20% since the pre-industrial era owing largely to the intensification of agriculture and the use of mineral nitrogen fertilizers. Top-down methods can be used to constrain the emissions of N2O using observations of atmospheric concentrations. Inverse modelling is a top-down approach, which relates changes in N2O concentrations to the emissions with the help of an atmospheric transport model. Using the global inverse model, LMDz-PyVar, we estimated N2O emissions from 1996 to 2012 (covering the period when sufficient atmospheric observations are available). Emissions were estimated monthly with a horizontal resolution of 3.25° × 1.875°.\nFrom the inversion, we estimate a global mean emission of 17.0 ± 0.8 TgN y-1, however, the emissions varied substantially from year-to-year. The largest inter-annual variability was located in the tropics and subtropics, where it appears to be correlated with ENSO climate variability. We did not find any significant trend in the global emission over 1996 – 2012, however, we did find important trends on continental scales. In South and East Asia, South America and Africa, N2O emissions increased, consistent with increasing use of N-fertilizer. In contrast, in Europe and North America, N2O emissions decreased. In Europe, this is correlated with a decrease in N-fertilizer use, while in North America the decrease is possibly due to climate variability and changes in agricultural practices.",

            "abstract": "Publically funded laboratories have a responsibility to generate, archive and disseminate analytical data to the research community. Laboratory managers know however, that a long tail of analytical effort never escapes researchers' thumb drives once they leave the lab. This work reports on a research data management project (Digital Mineralogy Library) where integrated hardware and software systems automatically archive and deliver analytical data and metadata to institutional and community data portals. The scientific objective of the DML project was to quantify the modal abundance of heavy minerals extracted from key lithological units in Western Australia. The selected analytical platform was a TESCAN Integrated Mineral Analyser (TIMA) that uses EDS-based mineral classification software to image and quantify mineral abundance and grain size at micron scale resolution.\nThe analytical workflow used a bespoke laboratory information management system (LIMS) to orchestrate: (1) the preparation of grain mounts with embedded QR codes that serve as enduring links between physical samples and analytical data, (2) the assignment of an International Geo Sample Number (IGSN) and Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to each grain mount via the System for Earth Sample Registry (SESAR), (3) the assignment of a DOI to instrument metadata via Research Data Australia, (4) the delivery of TIMA analytical outputs, including spatially registered mineralogy images and mineral abundance data, to an institutionally-based data management server, and (5) the downstream delivery of a final data product via a Google Maps interface such as the AuScope Discovery Portal. The modular design of the system permits the networking of multiple instruments within a single site or multiple collaborating research institutions. Although sharing analytical data does provide new opportunities for the geochemistry community, the creation of an open data network requires: (1) adopting open data reporting standards and conventions, (2) requiring instrument manufacturers and software developers to deliver and process data in formats compatible with open standards, and (3) public funding agencies to incentivise researchers, laboratories and institutions to make their data open and accessible to consumers.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to consider the potential legacy of increased onshore, unconventional gas production by examining the integrity of decommissioned, onshore, oil and gas wells in the UK. In the absence of a history of unconventional hydrocarbon exploitation in the UK, conventional onshore sites were considered and an examination of pollution incidents records had suggested that only a small fraction of operational, onshore wells could show integrity failures. A consideration of groundwater and surface water quality monitoring could find no regional impact of historic or current conventional oil and gas exploitation in the UK. As a more direct measure of well legacy this study considered the fugitive emissions of methane from former oil and gas wells onshore in the UK as a measure of well integrity. The survey considered 102 decommissioned (abandoned) wells from 4 different basins that were between 8 and 78 years old; all but one of these wells would be considered as having been decommissioned properly, i.e. wells cut, sealed and buried by soil cover to the extent that the well sites were being used for agriculture. For each well site the soil gas methane was analysed multiple times and assessed relative to a nearby control site of similar land-use and soil type. The results showed that of the 102 wells surveyed, 30% had soil gas CH4 at the soil surface that was significantly greater than their respective control. Conversely, 39% of well sites had significant lower surface soil gas CH4 concentrations than their respective control. We interpret elevated soil gas CH4 concentrations to be the result of well integrity failure, but do not know the source of the gas nor the route to the surface. Where elevated CH4 was detected it appears to have occurred within a decade of the well being decommissioned. The flux of CH4 from wells was 364 ± 677 kg CO2eq/well/yr with a 27% chance that any well would be a net sink of CH4 independent of well age. This flux is low relative to the activity commonly used on decommissioned well sites (eg. sheep grazing). The problem of poorly, or inappropriately decommissioned wells and orphaned wells will also be considered.",

            "abstract": "The summer rainfall climate of East Asia underwent large and abrupt changes during past climates. However, current interpretations of said changes are typically formulated in terms of modulation of summer monsoon intensity, and do not account for the known complexity in the seasonal evolution of East Asian rainfall, which exhibits sharp transition from the Spring regime to the Meiyu, and then again from the Meiyu to the Summer regime.\nWe explore the interpretation that East Asian rainfall climate undergoes a modulation of its seasonality during said paleoclimate changes. Following previous suggestions we focus on role of the westerlies over Asia, that its latitude relative to Tibet is critical in determining the stepwise transitions in East Asian rainfall seasons. In support of this linkage, we show from observational data that the interannual co-variation of June (July-August) rainfall and upper tropospheric zonal winds show properties consistent with an altered timing of the transition to the Meiyu (Summer), and with more northward-shifted westerlies for earlier transitions.\nWe similarly suggest that East Asian paleoclimate changes resulted from an altered timing in the northward evolution of the jet and hence the seasonal transitions, in particular the transition of the jet from south of the Plateau to the north. In an extreme scenario - which we speculate the climate system tended towards during stadial (cold) phases of D/O stadials and periods of low Northern Hemisphere summer insolation - the jet does not jump north of the Plateau, essentially keeping East Asia in prolonged Spring conditions.\nWe argue that this hypothesis provides a viable explanation for a key paleoproxy signature of D/O stadials over East Asia, namely the heavier mean d18O of precipitation as recorded in speleothem records. The southward jet position prevents the low-level monsoonal flow - which is isotopically light - from penetrating into the interior of East Asia; as such, precipitation there will be heavier, consistent with speleothem records. This hypothesis can also explain other key evidences of East Asian paleoclimate changes, in particular the occurrence of dusty conditions during North Atlantic stadials, and the southward migration of the Holocene optimal rainfall.

            "abstract": "It has been established that main reservoirs within deposits of Abalak and Bazhenov formations are confined with carbonate rocks. Carbonate rocks are often fractured, irregularly distributed, genesis of carbonate material is not obvious, reservoir properties can strongly change at short distances. It complicates prediction of prospective carbonate rocks location in the sedimentary column and laterally. Main objective of the work was to reveal genesis of carbonate material and environmental factors influencing on reservoir properties of carbonate rocks.\nCarbonate rocks of different types have been studied in details using petrographic, mineralogical, geochemical methods. To reveal genesis of carbonate material and environmental conditions during its precipitation analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes distribution and analysis of gas-liquid inclusions in calcite were carried out.\nAs a result three groups of carbonates have been distinguished: methane-derived carbonates that precipitated as a result of microbial activity in the upper part of marine sediments; high-temperature calcite that precipitated from hydrothermal fluids, fills cracks within methane-derived carbonates of the first group; secondary limestones and dolomites that precipitated during katagenesis or also from hydrothermal fluids. Main reservoirs are associated with: 1. limestones at top of Abalak deposits with numerous cracks and caverns partially filled with high-temperature calcite – fractured cavernous reservoir; 2. dolomitized silicites within Bazhenov formation – fractured microporous reservoir. In both cases reservoir properties were formed as a result of secondary alterations of carbonate rocks, particularly induced by hydrothermal fluids migrating from underlying strata. For this reason presence of reservoirs in carbonate rocks is closely connected with the areas of excessive fissuring where fluids migration pathways exist.\nThe work has been carried out with support of RFBR (Russian Foundation for Basic Research) grant №14-05-31344.",

            "abstract": "Two major droughts in the past decade had large impacts on carbon exchange in the Amazon. Recent analysis of vertical profile measurements of atmospheric CO2 and CO by Gatti et al. [Nature, 506(7486), 76–80, 2014] suggests that the 2010 drought turned the normally close-to-neutral annual Amazon carbon balance into a substantial source of nearly 0.5 PgC/yr, revealing a strong drought response. In this study, we revisit this hypothesis and interpret not only the same CO2/CO vertical profile measurements, but also additional constraints on carbon exchange such as satellite observations of CO, burned area, and fire hotspots. The results from our CarbonTracker South America data assimilation system suggest that carbon uptake by vegetation was indeed reduced in 2010, but that the magnitude of the decrease strongly depends on the estimated 2010 and 2011 biomass burning emissions. We have used fire products based on burned area (GFED4), satellite-observed CO columns (IASI), fire radiative power (GFASv1) and fire hotspots (FINNv1), and found an increase in biomass burning emissions in 2010 compared to 2011 of 0.16 to 0.24 PgC/yr. We derived a decrease of biospheric uptake ranging from 0.08 to 0.26 PgC/yr, with the range determined from a set of alternative inversions using different biomass burning estimates. Our numerical analysis of the 2010 Amazon drought results in a total reduction of carbon uptake of 0.24 to 0.50 PgC/yr and turns the balance from carbon sink to source. Our findings support the suggestion that the hydrological cycle will be an important driver of future changes in Amazonian carbon exchange.",

            "abstract": "Bed topography, together with ice thickness, is an essential characteristic of glaciers and ice sheets for many glaciological applications. Despite significant technical advances, it remains challenging to measure ice thickness remotely, especially in deep troughs occupied by outlet glaciers. The method of mass conservation, that combines radar-derived ice thickness data with high-resolution InSAR-derived ice velocity vectors, provides an effective method for generating a high-resolution bed from sparse radar sounding profiles, and has been successfully applied along the coast of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Applying the same technique to the coast of the Antarctic Ice Sheet presents a number of challenges. The coverage of ice thickness data collected in Antarctica, for example, is much less comprehensive compared to Greenland, especially in the wake of NASA's Operation IceBridge (OIB) Mission in 2010-2015. Here, we combine radar sounder data collected by various centers (OIB/Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets, the British Antarctic Survey and University of Texas) acquired between 1998 and 2011, with high-resolution ice motion data from interferometric SAR (ALOS PALSAR, RADARSAT-2 and Envisat ASAR) to reconstruct bed topography beneath major Antarctic outlet glaciers at an unprecedented level of detail. The results reveal some important features not known previously at that level of detail and shed light on the vulnerability of these glaciers in a warming climate. We find for example that Recovery glacier is deeper than in previous mappings and has long grooves parallel to the flow direction. Denman Glacier, East Antarctica, flow along a deep, narrow trough more than 2,000 m below sea level that extends more than 100 km inland. We find ridges and bumps in the vicinity of the grounding line of Thwaites Glacier, in the Amundsen Sea sector, that are consistent with the pattern of grounding line retreat. We have also a new mapping of the trough upstream of David Glacier and the Gogineni trough upstream Byrd Glacier. These features, mapped for the first time, have vast implications for the modeling of the Antarctic ice sheet in a warming climate.\nThis work was performed at the UC Irvine under a contract with NASA's Cryospheric Sciences Program, grant NNX15AD55G.",

            "abstract": "Organics in the atmospheric aerosols occupy 20 to 70% of the total mass. Since the proportion of organics is so large that it’s important to understand their detailed characteristics. Polymeric compounds called HUmic-Like Substance (HULIS) are known to be present in the atmospheric aerosols. Biomass burning can be a source of HULIS. In this study, atmospheric aerosols were collected at Cape Hedo, a northern tip of Okinawa Island, and we characterized overall features of the organics collected in different seasons. In Okinawa, continental air mass prevails in spring, fall and winter, while maritime air mass from Pacific Ocean prevails in summer. Thus, it is relatively straightforward to identify sources of organics in different seasons. We measured total organic carbon (TOC) and water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) concentrations, and absorbance and fluorescence intensity for the aerosol samples collected during Nov 2012 and July 2014 (n=90). As a result, TOC and WSOC showed almost the same trend, higher concentrations when continental air mass prevailed in fall and winter, while lower concentrations in summer. Percentages of WSOC in TOC accounted for 33-44%. Absorption efficiency, absorbance per 1 ppm organic carbon concentration, of the samples showed higher values in winter and fall, and lower values in summer. Fluorescence efficiency, normalized fluorescence with quinine sulfate per 1 ppm organic carbon concentration, were also different, it is likely that different types of organics were present in the aerosols from different seasons. We are also planning to measure HULIS in the aerosols and will be discussed a link between their contribution and trans-boundary air pollution in Asia.",

            "abstract": "Here we introduce the Global 3-second Water Body Map (G3WBM), developed by an automated algorithm to process the multi-temporal Landsat Global Land Survey (GLS) database. We used 33,890 scenes from 4 GLS epochs in order to delineate a seamless water body map, without cloud and ice/snow gaps. Permanent water bodies were distinguished from temporal water-covered areas by calculating the frequency of water body existence from overlapping, multi-temporal, Landsat scenes. By analyzing the frequency of water body existence at 3 arc-second resolution, the G3WBM separates river channels and floodplains more clearly than previous studies. The global totals of delineated permanent water body area and temporal water-covered area are 3.25 and 0.49 million km2 respectively, which highlights the importance of river-floodplain separation using multi-temporal scenes. The accuracy of the water body classification was validated in Hokkaido (Japan) and in the contiguous United States using an existing water body databases. There was almost no commission error, and about 70% of lakes >1 km2 shows relative water area error <25%. Though smaller water bodies (<1 km2) were underestimated mainly due to omission of shoreline pixels, the overall accuracy of the G3WBM should be adequate for larger scale research in hydrology, biogeochemistry, and climate systems and importantly includes a quantification of the temporal nature of global water bodies.\nAt the AGU presentation, we will also discuss how this new water body map can be used to improve global river hydrodynamic simulations. Using the developed water body map and other data sources, we generated the global 3-second flow direction map, global river width map, and hydrologically adjusted DEM. Beyond the SRTM and HydroSHEDS domain (60N-60S), these new datasets cover all land areas except Antarctica (i.e. N85-S60, except Antarctica). We will show how these new topography datasets will improve the river-floodplain hydrodynamic simulations.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial carbon dioxide removal (tCDR) through dedicated biomass plantations is considered as one climate engineering (CE) option if implemented at large-scale. While the risks and costs are supposed to be small, the effectiveness depends strongly on spatial and temporal scales of implementation.\nBased on simulations with a dynamic global vegetation model (LPJmL) we comprehensively assess the effectiveness, biogeochemical side-effects and tradeoffs from an earth system-analytic perspective. We analyzed systematic land-use scenarios in which all, 25%, or 10% of natural and/or agricultural areas are converted to tCDR plantations including the assumption that biomass plantations are established once the 2°C target is crossed in a business-as-usual climate change trajectory. The resulting tCDR potentials in year 2100 include the net accumulated annual biomass harvests and changes in all land carbon pools.\nWe find that only the most spatially excessive, and thus undesirable, scenario would be capable to restore the 2° target by 2100 under continuing high emissions (with a cooling of 3.02°C). Large-scale biomass plantations covering areas between 1.1 - 4.2 Gha would produce a climate reduction potential of 0.8 – 1.4°C. tCDR plantations at smaller scales do not build up enough biomass over this considered period and the potentials to achieve global warming reductions are substantially lowered to no more than 0.5-0.6°C.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the (non-economic) costs for the Earth system include negative impacts on the water cycle and on ecosystems, which are already under pressure due to both land use change and climate change. Overall, tCDR may lead to a further transgression of land- and water-related planetary boundaries while not being able to set back the crossing of the planetary boundary for climate change. tCDR could still be considered in the near-future mitigation portfolio if implemented on small scales on wisely chosen areas.",

Slab roll-back of the Pacific plate and mantle upwelling in the Meso-Cenozoic caused the extension and spreading of continental segments in the South China Block, leading to profound variations of the local temperature conditions. We processed 201 teleseismic events beneath 87 stations in the Hainan, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces in the South China Block, and extracted 4172 high-quality receiver functions. We imaged topographies of the mantle discontinuities by using phase-weighted common conversion point (PW-CCP) stacking of the receiver functions, which effectively improves the P-to-S converted phases. We found that the average depths of the discontinuities at 410 km and 660 km depth are 429 km and 680 km, respectively, while no clearly defined discontinuity at 520 km depth was detected. We mapped the thickness of the mantle transition zone (MTZ), which can reflect temperature and/or compositional heterogeneities as well as the presence of water, and used our results to discuss possible geodynamic implications. In particular, we found that the MTZ beneath the Leizhou Peninsula in the Hainan province is 43 km thinner than average. This scenario is compatible with a “Hainan plume” responsible for positive temperature anomalies of 380 K and 220 K at the 660 km and 410 km discontinuities, respectively. Prominent uplifting of the 660 km boundary beneath the coast regions may also support a horizontal channel flow of the Hainan plume.",

A description of the defects at the atomic scale is necessary to describe how their mobility depend on pressure, temperature, stress.\nA key stage in multiscale numerical modeling is the description of the collective behavior of defects which depends not only on their mobilities, but also on their interactions. Creep mechanisms usually involve interaction between different kind of defects. In diffusion creep, grain boundaries are sources and sinks for point defects. In dislocation creep dislocations not only glide, but also climb by emitting absorbing point defects.\nIn this presentation we describe new results on the interaction between point defects and dislocations in mantle minerals and how dislocation mobilities are affected resulting in novel deformation mechanisms in the lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "Small Island Developing States (SIDS) classified as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are particularly vulnerable to the projected impacts of climate change. Given their particular vulnerabilities, climate adaptation investments are being made through both national and international efforts to build the capacity of various sectors and communities to reduce climate risks and associated disasters. Despite these efforts, reducing climate risks is not free of various challenges and barriers. This paper aims to synthesise a set of critical socio-economic barriers present at various spatial scales that are specific to Least Developed Country SIDS. It also aims to identify the processes that give rise to these barriers. Drawing on theories from natural hazards, a systematic literature review method was adopted to identify and organise the set of barriers by focussing both on academic papers and grey literature. The data revealed a notable lack of studies on adaptation within African and Caribbean LDC-SIDS. In general, there was a paucity of academic as well as grey literature being produced by authors from LDC-SIDS to challenge existing discourses related to adaptation barriers. The most common barriers identified included those related to governance, technical, cognitive and cultural. Three key findings can be drawn from this study in relation to formal adaptation initiatives. Firstly, the lack of focus on the adaptive capacity needs of Local Government or Island Councils and communities was a key barrier to ensuring success of adaptation interventions. Secondly, international adaptation funding modalities did little to address root causes of vulnerability or support system transformations. These funds were geared at supporting sectoral level adaptation initiatives for vulnerable natural resource sectors such as water, biodiversity and coastal zones. Thirdly, there is a need to recognise the significance of cultural knowledge and practices in shaping adaptive choices of communities in SIDS.",

Here, for the rst time we present two-dimensional (2-D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the TS including pickup ions (PUIs) self-consistently, and compare the simulation results with V2 observations. We nd that: (1) PUIs play a key role in the energy dissipation of the TS, and most of the incident ion kinetic energy is transferred to the thermal energy of PUIs. The PIC simulation indicates for the upstream parameters chosen for V2 conditions that the density of PUIs is about 25% and the PUIs gain the largest fraction (approximately 86.6%) of the downstream thermal pressure. (2) The simulated heliosheath ion distribution function is a superposition of a cold core formed by transmitted solar wind ions (SWIs), the shoulders contributed by the hot re ected SWIs and directly transmitted PUIs, and the wings of the distribution dominated by the very hot re ected PUIs. The V2 Faraday cups observed the cool core of the distribution, so they saw only a tip of the iceberg. (3) The nonstationarity of the shock front is mainly caused by ripples along the shock front and these ripples form even if the percentage of PUIs is high. These simulation results agree reasonably well with the V2 experimental data. The relevance of the shock front ripples to the multiple TS crossings observed by V2 is also discussed in this paper.",

Additional evidence has been provided by Doppler measurements. The observations reveal opposite velocities for both hot and cool plasma on the two sides of a prominence barb. This motion is persistent for several hours and has been interpreted in terms of rotational motion of prominence feet. Several authors suggest that such barb motions are rotating helical structures around a vertical axis similar to tornadoes on Earth. One of the difficulties of such a proposal is how to support cool prominence plasma in almost-vertical structures against gravity. In this work we model analytically a tornado-like structure and try to determine possible mechanisms to support the prominence plasma. We have found that the Lorentz force can indeed support the barb plasma provided the magnetic structure is sufficiently twisted and/or significant poloidal flows are present.",

The CME occurred in the active region 11944 (S12W08) near the disk center on 2014 January 7 and was associated with an X1.2 flare. A new CME reconstruction procedure based on a polarimetric technique is adopted, which shows that the CME changed its propagation direction by around 28° in latitude within 2.0 R⊙ and 43° in longitude within 6.5 R⊙. This significant non-radial motion is consistent with the finding of Mostl et al. (2015). We use nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) and potential field source surface (PFSS) extrapolation methods to determine the configurations of the coronal magnetic field. We also calculate the magnetic energy density distributions at different heights based on the extrapolations. Our results show that the active region coronal magnetic field has a strong influence on the CME propagation direction. This is consistent with the \"channelling'' by the active region coronal magnetic field itself, rather than deflection by nearby structures. These results indicate that the active region coronal magnetic field configuration has to be taken into account in order to determine CME propagation direction correctly.",

            "abstract": "Climate model biases are systematic errors affecting geophysical quantities simulated by coupled general circulation models and Earth system models against an observational target. To this regard, sea-surface temperature (SST) biases are a major concern due to the central role of SST properties for the dynamical coupling between the atmosphere and the ocean, and for the associated variability. Strong SST biases can be detrimental for the overall quality of historical climate simulations, they contribute to uncertainty in simulated future climate scenarios and complicate the initialization and assessment of decadal climate prediction experiments.\nInter-hemispheric and inter-basin connections are apparent between climatological SST biases. They often resemble the imprint on SSTs of dominant large-scale oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Still, climatological values only provide a static description of a phenomenon, and the hypothesis of teleconnections between regional model biases requires further substantiation. We propose a dynamic linear model developed within a Bayesian hierarchical framework for probabilistic assessment of spatial and temporal characteristics of SST biases in ensemble climate simulations. In our formulation, the statistical model distinguishes between seasonal and longer-term bias components. In the considered Bayesian framework, the conditional estimation of bias components and their evolution accounts for uncertainty in model Gaussian error parameters through sampling of the posterior distribution of associated variances by a Monte Carlo Markov Chain.\nIn this contribution we illustrate a first application of the model using ensembles of decadal hindcasts initialized over the period 1960-2000 CE and performed with the MiKlip prototype system for decadal climate predictions. We focus on the tropical Atlantic Ocean – a region where climate models are typically affected by a warm SST bias - to demonstrate how our approach allows for a more reliable estimation of model biases, and for a more efficient identification of associated sources of heterogeneity, non-stationarities and propagation pathways.",

To this end, the Eddy Diffusivity Mass Flux scheme with multiple plumes, named ED(MF)n, is implemented in a Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) model. This way, the LES is used as a non-hydrostatic larger-scale model, providing a convenient platform for investigating the behavior of parameterizations across the boundary-layer gray zone. First, as a feasibility study, a single plume is launched in every column of the LES in an offline, diagnostic way, without affecting the simulation. We find that the plumes are sensitive to the LES columns in which they rise, feeling the presence of LES clouds. A plume budget analysis shows that the plume termination height is mostly determined by the mixing term, and not so much by the buoyancy term. Then, the ED(MF)n is made interactive with the resolved flow, replacing the LES-subgrid scheme. The work performed by the scheme reduces with increasing LES resolution, due to the size-filtering applied in the ED(MF)n framework. An encouraging result is that the total specific humidity flux is conserved across the investigated range of LES resolutions, covering the gray zone between 10m (large-eddy resolving) and 10km (regional-scale). The sensitivity of the results to various model parameters is assessed.",

            "abstract": "The exposure of pyrite to oxygen and water in mine waste environments is known to generate acidity and the accumulation of secondary iron minerals. Sulfates and secondary iron minerals associated with acid mine drainage (AMD) exhibit diverse spectral properties in the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The use of hyperspectral imagery for identification of AMD mineralogy and contamination has been well studied. Fewer studies have examined the impacts of hydrologic variations on mapping AMD or the unique spectral signatures of mine waters. Open-pit mine lakes are an additional environmental hazard which have not been widely studied using imaging spectroscopy. A better understanding of AMD variation related to climate fluctuations and the spectral signatures of contaminated surface waters will aid future assessments of environmental contamination. This study examined the ability of multi-season airborne hyperspectral data to identify the geochemical evolution of substances and contaminant patterns at the Leviathan Mine Superfund site. The mine is located 24 miles southeast of Lake Tahoe and contains remnant tailings piles and several AMD collection ponds. The objectives were to 1) distinguish temporal changes in mineralogy at a the remediated open-pit sulfur mine, 2) identify the absorption features of mine affected waters, and 3) quantitatively link water spectra to known dissolved iron concentrations. Images from NASA’s AVIRIS instrument were collected in the spring, summer, and fall seasons for two consecutive years at Leviathan (HyspIRI campaign). Images had a spatial resolution of 15 meters at nadir. Ground-based surveys using the ASD FieldSpecPro spectrometer and laboratory spectral and chemical analysis complemented the remote sensing data. Temporal changes in surface mineralogy were difficult to distinguish. However, seasonal changes in pond water quality were identified. Dissolved ferric iron and chlorophyll-a concentrations were determined to be the major influences on pond water spectral variation.",

            "abstract": "Most computational fluid-dynamics codes are developed using the Eulerian description. To find the numerical solution, fluxes are estimated on the surface of the finite volume using a truncation series. Spurious numerical oscillations and artificial numerical diffusion are consequences, particularly in regions across flow discontinuities. Diffusion often is introduced synthetically in many schemes to gain computational stability. Occasional switching to a diffusive upwind scheme, for example, is one classic strategy to manage the numerical oscillations [see e.g., Ghannadi & Chu 2015].\nLagrangian-block simulation offers an alternative that could minimize the spurious oscillations and false diffusive error. The blocks move in the direction of the flow. The squares of the block widths expand in proportion to the diffusivities. The block simulation procedure consists of (i) Lagrangian advection and diffusion, (ii) division into portions, and (iii) reassembly of the portions into new blocks. The blocks are renewed in each time increment to prevent excessive distortion. Details of the Lagrangian-block simulations method have been given in a series of papers by Tan & Chu (2012), Chu & Altai (2012, 2015}.\nIn this paper, the exchanges across turbulence interfaces are considered for two problems. The first series of the simulations are conducted to find the mass and momentum exchanges across a shallow flow of two different depth. In the simulations, the advection and diffusion of three separated systems of blocks that contain the mass, momentum and potential vorticity are carried out using the Lagrangian-block simulation method. The simulation results are compared with data obtained from a previous laboratory investigation and related to the shear instability problem in rotating shear flow previously considered by Chu (2014). The second problem involves the turbulence generation across the interface of an internal waves. The simulation shows the development of gravitational stable interface in part of the interface and the overturning in another part of the unstable interface. The process is not quantitative known until the compilation of results obtained from the present Lagrangian-block simulation. The development of the interface however is of great significance to many geo-environmental applications.",

            "abstract": "The Early-Middle Pleistocene Transition (EMPT) is the term used to describe the prolongation and intensification of glacial-interglacial climate cycles that initiated after 900,000 years ago. During the transition glacial-interglacial cycles shift from lasting 41,000 years to an average of 100,000 years. The structure of these glacial-interglacial cycles shifts from smooth to more abrupt ‘saw-toothed’ like transitions. In fact we argue there is shift from a bimodal climate to a tripartite climate system (see Figure). Despite eccentricity having by far the weakest influence on insolation received at the Earth’s surface of any of the orbital parameters; it is often assumed to be the primary driver of the post-EMPT 100,000 years climate cycles because of the similarity in duration. The traditional solution to this is to call for a highly nonlinear response by the global climate system to eccentricity. This ‘eccentricity myth’ is due to an artefact of spectral analysis which means that the last 8 glacial-interglacial average out at about 100,000 years in length despite ranging from 80,000 to 120,000 years. With the realisation that eccentricity is not the major driving force a debate has emerged as to whether precession or obliquity controlled the timing of the most recent glacial-interglacial cycles. Some argue that post-EMPT deglaciations occurred every four or five precessional cycle while others argue it is every second or third obliquity cycle. We review these current theories and suggest that though phase-locking between orbital forcing and global ice volume may occur and seem to primarily driven by the timing of precession; the chaotic nature of the climate system response means the relationship is not consistent through the last 900,000 years.",

An earlier study has shown the main benefits of convection-permitting resolution in hourly statistics and the diurnal cycle of precipitation intensities. Here, we investigate whether the improved simulation of precipitation in the convection-permitting model is affecting future climate projections. Overall, the future scenario (ECHAM5 with A1B forcing) brings weak changes in mean precipitation, but stronger hourly intensities in the morning and less frequent and more intense daily precipitation. The two model simulations produce similar changes in climate, despite differences in their physical characteristics linked to the formation of convective precipitation. A significant increase in the morning precipitation probably due to convection forced by large-scale processes is found when considering only the most extreme events (above 50 mm/day). In this case, even the diurnal cycles of precipitation and convection-related indices are similar between resolutions, leading to the conclusion that the 7 km model sufficiently resolves the most extreme convective events. In this region and time periods, the 7 km resolution is deemed sufficient for most assessments of near future precipitation change. However, conclusions could be dependent on the characteristics of the region of investigation.",

Urban and suburban watershed input/output budgets for nitrogen have shown surprisingly high retention which has led to detailed analysis of sources and sinks in soils these watersheds. Home lawns, thought to be major sources of reactive nitrogen in suburban watersheds, have more complex coupled carbon and nitrogen dynamics than previously thought, and are likely the site of much nitrogen retention. Riparian zones, thought to be an important sink for reactive nitrogen in many watersheds, have turned out be nitrogen sources in urban watersheds due to hydrologic changes that disconnect streams from their surrounding landscape. Urban effects on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and nitrogen deposition have strong effects on soil nitrogen cycling processes and soil:atmosphere fluxes of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane. Efforts to manage urban soils and watersheds through geomorphic stream restoration, creation of stormwater management features and changes in lawn and forest management can have significant effects on watershed carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Urban soils present a basic and applied science frontier that challenges our understanding of biological, physical, chemical and social science processes. The watershed approach provides an effective platform for integrating these disciplines and for articulating critical questions that arise from surprising results. This approach can help us to meet the challenge of urban soils, which is critical to achieving sustainability goals in cities across the world.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the nitrogen cycle at ecosystem, landscape, regional and global scales is a great current challenge in environmental science. Large amounts of “missing nitrogen” dominate nitrogen balances at all scales and have complicated efforts to address the effects of excess reactive nitrogen pollution on tropospheric ozone levels, coastal eutrophication and drinking water quality, and to determine “critical loads” for atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Uncertainty about nitrogen balances has led to increased interest in nitrogen gas fluxes as a fate of excess nitrogen. Denitrification, the conversion of reactive nitrogen oxides such as nitrate and nitrite into nitrogen gases, is a challenging process to study in terrestrial ecosystems. This process is difficult to quantify because of problematic measurement techniques, high spatial and temporal variability, and a lack of methods for scaling point measurements to larger areas. A particular challenge is that small areas (hotspots) and brief periods (hot moments) account for a high percentage of nitrogen gas flux activity. However, recent advances have yielded new methods capable of producing well constrained estimates of denitrification at the ecosystem scale, new ideas about the occurrence of hotspots and hot moments at ecosystem and landscape scales, and powerful new tools for extrapolation and validation. Progress on the challenges of denitrification suggest that we are poised for advances more generally across the genomes-to-ecosystems cascade.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of sub seasonal monsoon characteristics of Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is highly crucial for agricultural planning and water resource management. The Climate forecast System version 2 (CFS V2), the state of the art coupled climate model developed by NCEP, is currently being employed for the seasonal and extended range forecasts of ISM. Even though CFSV2 is a fully coupled ocean- atmosphere- land model with advanced physics, increased resolution and refined initialisation, its ISM forecasts, in terms of seasonal mean and variability needs improvement. Numerous works have been done for verifying the CFSV2 forecasts in terms of the seasonal mean, its mean and variability, active and break spells, and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) - monsoon interactions. Most of these works are based on either rain fall strength or rainfall based indices. Here we evaluate the skill of CFS v2 model in forecasting the various sub seasonal features of ISM, viz., the onset and withdrawal days of monsoon that are determined using circulation based indices, the Monsoon Intra Seasonal Oscillations (MISO), and Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures. The MISO index, we use here, is based on zonal wind at 850 hPa and Outgoing Long wave Radiation (OLR) anomalies. With this work, we aim at assessing the skill of the model in simulating the large scale circulation patterns and their variabilities within the monsoon season. Variabilities in these large scale circulation patterns are primarily responsible for the variabilities in the seasonal monsoon strength and its temporal distribution across the season. We find that the model can better forecast the large scale circulation and than the actual precipitation. Hence we suggest that seasonal rainfall forecasts can be improved by the statistical downscaling of CFSV2 forecasts by incorporating the established relationships between the well forecasted large scale variables and monsoon precipitation.",

Given the importance of organic ligands in governing iron solubility and copper bioavailability in natural waters, the organic complexation of dissolved iron and copper in these samples was determined from multiple analytical windows applied to competitive ligand exchange- adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry. This study constitutes the first dataset of iron speciation in San Francisco Bay and expands upon prior work evaluating the potential for copper toxicity in this urbanized estuary. Recent advances in voltammetric techniques emerging from a Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) working group on metal-binding ligands in the marine environment, and insights gained from high-resolution ligand measurements from the U.S. GEOTRACES program, highlight how metal-binding ligands in San Francisco Bay compare with those of the coastal and open ocean.",

Funded through the European FP7 collaborative project ERA-CLIM, ERA-20C is part of a suite of experiments that also includes a model-only integration (ERA-20CM) and a land-surface reanalysis (ERA-20CL). Its data assimilation system is constrained by only surface observations obtained from ISPD (3.2.6) and ICOADS (2.5.1). Surface boundary conditions are provided by the Hadley Centre (HadISST2.1.0.0) and radiative forcing follows CMIP5 recommended data sets. First-guess uncertainty estimates are based on a 10-member ensemble of Data Assimilations, ERA-20C ensemble, run prior to ERA-20C using ten SST and sea-ice realizations from the Hadley Centre.\nIn November 2014, the European Commission entrusted ECMWF to run on its behalf the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) aiming at producing quality-assured information about the past, current and future states of the climate at both European and global scales. Reanalysis will be one of the main components of the C3S portfolio and the first one to be produced is a global modern era reanalysis (ERA5) covering the period from 1979 onwards. Based on a recent version of the ECMWF data assimilation system, ERA5 will replace the widely used ERA-Interim dataset. This new production will benefit from a much improved model, and better characterized and exploited observations compared to its predecessor.\nThe first part of the presentation will focus on the ERA-20C production, provide an overview of its main characteristics and discuss some of the key results from its assessment. The second part of the talk will give an overview of ERA5, and briefly discuss some of its challenges.",

            "abstract": "Internal multiples are waves reflected more than once at interfaces before reach to the surface receivers. Internal multiples are usually generated below coal seams, salt domes, basalt and igneous rocks with high velocity contrast, and behave differently compared to primary reflections and surface-related multiples. Internal multiple reflections have different propagation paths compared with primary reflections and surface-related multiples, thus can complement illuminations where other waves are unavailable. We propose a novel approach to image structures with internal multiples. With this method, internal multiples are separated and used as data for reverse time migration. Instead of applying image condition directly to the source and receiver waves, we decompose both source and receiver waves extrapolated into up- and down-going waves. Then apply the image condition to up-going source and receiver waves to form an up-up image, and apply to down-going source and receiver waves to form a down-down image. We use a similarity analysis to compare the up-up and down-down images, and separate true images from artifacts. Numerical examples with simple velocity models are used to demonstrate how to construct up-up and down-down image conditions and eliminate migration artifacts. Finally, we test the 2D SMAART JV model with salt structures for migration using internal multiples.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n The research was funded by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41430321, 41374138).

            "abstract": "Decisions in catchment management are increasingly based on the predictions of catchment models. But hydrological models are subject to epistemic uncertainties that are difficult to model as simple aleatory variables. This will include the effects of model structure and data inconsistencies or disinformation that will result in non-stationarity of error characteristics in model calibration. This suggests that there will be limits to predictability and that a different approach to testing models as hypotheses about catchment response might be needed. Following Beven and Smith (ASCE JHE 2015) an event based approach is suggested for both checking data for consistency and assessing the information contributed by individual events to model conditioning. This raises issues of the effect of disinformative events on how well a model can predict subsequent events, and what happens in prediction when we will not know beforehand whether an event is informative or disinformative. The impact on assessing models as fit for purpose within the decision or policy making context will also be discussed.",

Obviously, the goal is to allow users to \"ask any question, any time\" thereby enabling them to \"build their own product on the go\".\nOne of the most influential initiatives in Big Geo Data is EarthServer which has demonstrated new directions for flexible, scalable EO services based on innovative NewSQL technology. Researchers from Europe, the US and recently Australia have teamed up to rigourously materialize the concept of the datacube. Such a datacube may have spatial and temporal dimensions (such as a satellite image time series) and may unite an unlimited number of scenes. Independently from whatever efficient data structuring a server network may perform internally, users will always see just a few datacubes they can slice and dice. EarthServer has established client and server technology for such spatio-temporal datacubes. The underlying scalable array engine, rasdaman, enables direct interaction, including 3-D visualization, what-if scenarios, common EO data processing, and general analytics. Services exclusively rely on the open OGC \"Big Geo Data\" standards suite, the Web Coverage Service (WCS) including the Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS). Conversely, EarthServer has significantly shaped and advanced the OGC Big Geo Data standards landscape based on the experience gained.\nPhase 1 of EarthServer has advanced scalable array database technology into 100+ TB services; in phase 2, Petabyte datacubes will be built in Europe and Australia to perform ad-hoc querying and merging. Standing between EarthServer phase 1 (from 2011 through 2014) and phase 2 (from 2015 through 2018) we present the main results and outline the impact on the international standards landscape; effectively, the Big Geo Data standards established through initiative of Earth Server include OGC, ISO, and INSPIRE.",

For some sites the most viable option is to treat the water to a high standard via reverse osmosis (RO) and to inject it into deep aquifers. The design and implementation of these field-scale injection schemes requires a thorough understanding of the anticipated water quality changes within the target aquifers. In this study we use reactive transport modeling to integrate the results of a multi-scale hydrogeological and geochemical characterization, and to analyze a series of short-term push-pull experiments with the aim to better understand and reliably accurately predict long-term water quality evolution and the risks for mobilizing geogenic arsenic.\nSequential push-pull tests with varying injectant compositions were undertaken, with concentrations recorded during the recovery phase reaching levels of up to 180 ppb above the ambient concentrations observed prior to the push-pull experiments. The highest As concentrations were observed in conjunction with the injection of aerobic water, while de-oxygenation of the injectant lowered As concentrations significantly. The lowest As concentrations were observed when the injectant was de-oxygenated and acid-amended. The latter was underpinned by complementary laboratory As sorption experiments using sediments from the target aquifer at various pHs, which, consistent with literature, show a decrease in As sorption affinity under alkaline conditions.\nIn the model-based analysis of the experimental data, model parameters for each conceptual model variant were estimated through an automatic calibration procedure using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) whereby bromide and temperature data were used to constrain flow, solute and heat transport parameters. A series of predictive model scenarios were performed to determine whether advanced manipulation of the injectant composition is required.",

            "abstract": "CO2 storage in deep saline formations is considered as an attractive option to cut down greenhouse gas emissions. Among the major challenges is the development of efficient technologies for controlling and monitoring the evolution of CO2 plumes during and after injection in the underground. As an alternative to the most commonly used geophysical approaches for subsurface characterization, we propose a pressure-based tomographical approach to track CO2 plume history. By taking into account the direct relationship between saturation and flow properties, pressure tomography has the potential not only to detect a plume but also to estimate the saturation of CO2. The experimental set-up of pressure tomography involves injection of brine or CO2 at variable depths (sources). We use a time-lapse approach, considering first the CO2-free formation, and then the multi-phase CO2-brine system. By applying a rapid eikonal-based inversion technique, pressure fluctuations at observation locations (receivers) are utilized to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the apparent single-phase and mixed-phase diffusivity. Evolution of the plume shape is then delineated by comparison of diffusivity tomograms derived from different times. Finally, an integrated value of CO2 saturation within the plume is obtained by means of a single-phase proxy. Applicability of this novel approach is evaluated in different virtual formations. The time-lapse pressure tomographic investigation revealed that knowledge about the spatial heterogeneity of permeability has a remarkable impact on proper characterization of plume shape.",

            "abstract": "Over the recent past, important advances have been made in the area of micro-CT scanning of natural porous media. The acquired pore-space geometries enable detailed investigations of flow and transport via pore-scale direct numerical simulation (DNS). In this work, we utilize pore-scale DNS to investigate single-phase pore-scale dispersion. We focus on data stemming from beadpacks, Bentheimer sandstone, and Ketton and Estaillades carbonates. Our DNS results clearly show the transition from ballistic dispersion to the asymptotic Fickian regime (see figure a) at decimeter or meter scale depending on the medium type. We outline a universal Lagrangian model for tracer dispersion that is based on a low-dimensional parametrization of the complex three-dimensional motion of tracer particles (see figure b). We relate the process parameters to certain pore-geometry characteristics such as the tortuosity. Our model accurately captures the wide range of flow and transport dynamics observed in the samples considered. We establish the accuracy of the model by validating its limiting dispersion behavior, the resulting velocity statistics, and also, most challenging, snapshots of tracer plumes at travel times encompassing both ballistic and Fickian behavior.",

            "abstract": "Jupiter’s moon Europa is believed to contain a subsurface water ocean whose finite electrical conductance imposes clear induction signatures on the magnetic field in its surroundings. The evidence rests heavily on measurements performed by the magnetometer on board the Galileo spacecraft during multiple flybys of the moon. Europa’s interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere has become a major target of research in planetary science, partly because of the potential of a salty ocean to harbor life outside our own planet. Thus it is of considerable interest to develop numerical simulations of the Europa-Jupiter interaction that can be compared with data in order to refine our knowledge of Europa’s subsurface structure.\n In this presentation we show aspects of Europa’s interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere extracted from a multifluid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code BATS-R-US recently developed at the University of Michigan. The model dynamically separates magnetospheric and pick-up ions and is capable of capturing some of the physics previously accessible only to kinetic approaches. The model utilizes an adaptive grid to maintain the high spatial resolution on the surface required to resolve the portion of Europa’s neutral atmosphere with a scale height of a few tens of kilometers that is in thermal equilibrium. The model also derives the electron temperature, which is crucial to obtain the local electron impact ionization rates and hence the plasma mass loading in Europa’s atmosphere.\nWe compare our results with observations made by the plasma particles and fields instruments on the Galileo spacecraft to validate our model. We will show that multifluid MHD is able to reproduce the basic features of the plasma moments and magnetic field observations obtained during the Galileo E4 and E26 flybys at Europa.",

            "abstract": "Glacial Isostatic Adjustment models most often assume a mantle with a viscoelastic Maxwell rheology and a given ice history model. Here we use a Bayesian Monte Carlo with Markov Chains formalism to invert the global GIA signal simultaneously for the mechanical properties of the mantle and for the volume of the various ice-sheets using as starting ice models two distinct previously published ice histories. Burgers as well as Maxwell rheologies are considered.\nThe fitted data consist of 5720 paleo sea level records from the last 35kyrs, with a world-wide distribution. Our ambition is to present not only the best fitting model, but also the range of possible solutions (within the explored space of parameters) with their respective probability of explaining the data, and thus reveal the trade-off effects and range of uncertainty affecting the parameters.\nOur a posteriori probality maps exhibit in all cases two distinct peaks: both are characterized by an upper mantle viscosity around 5.1020Pa.s but one of the peaks features a lower mantle viscosity around 3.1021Pa.s while the other indicates lower mantle viscosity of more than 1.1022Pa.s.\nThe global maximum depends upon the starting ice history and the chosen rheology: the first peak (P1) has the highest probability only in the case with a Maxwell rheology and ice history based on ICE-5G, while the second peak (P2) is favored when using ANU-based ice history or Burgers rheology, and is our preferred solution as it is also consistent with long-term geodynamics and gravity gradients anomalies over Laurentide. P2 is associated with larger volumes for the Laurentian and Fennoscandian ice-sheets and as a consequence of total ice volume balance, smaller volumes for the Antactic ice-sheet. This last point interfers with the estimate of present-day ice-melting in Antarctica from GRACE data. Finally, we find that P2 with Burgers rheology favors the existence of a tectosphere, i.e. a viscous sublithospheric layer.",

During this time Rosetta followed the comet from almost 3.5 AU through perihelion at 1.25 AU and away from the Sun again. Part of the scientific payload scrutinizing the comet is the ROSINA experiment, the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis. The suite of instruments consists of the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer DFMS, the Reflectron Time-Of-Flight mass spectrometer RTOF, and the COmet Pressure Sensor COPS. From the combined measurements by ROSINA, the composition and dynamics of the volatiles in the coma of the comet are derived.\nOn 13 August 2015, comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko reached perihelion, the point along its orbits that is closest to the Sun. Furthermore equinox occurred in May 2015 leading to a change in season – the previous summer hemisphere is now in winter and vice versa.\nOne of the goals of ROSINA is to track the activity of the comet during its apparition and to investigate potential changes in the chemical composition as the spacecraft orbits around the nucleus. In this presentation we will summarize some key findings obtained during the first year and a half of the nominal mission and present first results comparing the pre- and post perihelion neutral gas coma. The goal of these observations is to gather information about the formation and the composition of the comet and ultimately our early Solar System.",

            "abstract": "Jupiter's magnetosphere is radially stretched in the middle magnetosphere owing to force balance between outward centrifugal, plasma pressure gradient and anisotropy forces, and an inward JxB force associated with an azimuthal current. In this paper we discuss recent modelling of Jupiter's magnetodisc, and discuss the implications for the upcoming Juno mission. In particular, we discuss recent work including anisotropic hot plasma pressure in the computation of the magnetodisc structure. We show that the anisotropy current is comparable to the hot plasma pressure current in the middle magnetosphere between 20-40RJ, and that for reasonable magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current system parameters, Jupiter’s magnetosphere resides close to the limit of the firehose instability. We further show that, using anisotropic pressure, variations in the hot plasma temperature over the range observed by spacecraft data are sufficient to explain the latitudinal changes in the main oval and Ganymede footprint latitudes observed using the Hubble Space Telescope. Juno will traverse the middle magnetosphere in the early-to-mid interval of the main mission, and will provide direct in-situ measurements of the plasma pressures and flows, along with the magnetic field. Using the magnetodisc model, we provide predictions for Juno observations and discuss how these measurements will further constrain the models.",

            "abstract": "Asthenospheric properties vary widely beneath continents. Beneath the tectonically and magmatically active western U.S., a shallow asthenospheric layer with very low seismic velocities exists. The top of this layer is typically marked by a negative velocity gradient that is too vertically localized (< 30 km) to be explained by a thermal gradient alone. In some regions the positive velocity gradient at the lower boundary of the asthenosphere also appears to be localized enough to produce scattered waves. Beneath the thick, high velocity cratonic mantle lithosphere in the U.S., a low velocity asthenospheric layer is present, but it is deeper, its seismic velocities are higher, its velocity contrast with the overlying lithosphere is smaller, and this velocity gradient is typically gradual enough (> 50 km in depth) to be consistent with a purely thermal gradient. These contrasts in seismic properties point to lateral variations in asthenospheric viscosities and in the degree of coupling between the lithosphere and deeper mantle.\nAs the EarthScope Transportable Array completes its time in the eastern U.S., the asthenosphere beneath this region of Paleozoic orogenesis and Mesozoic rifting is coming into focus. In the southeastern U.S., we have analyzed data from the 85 broadband stations of the 2010-2014 SESAME EarthScope Flexible Array and adjacent Transportable Array and permanent stations. Rayleigh wave tomography reveals a low velocity asthenosphere beneath a lithospheric layer of intermediate thickness (typically 120-130 km). Minimum asthenospheric velocities lie between values in the western U.S. asthenosphere and those in the cratonic asthenosphere. Common conversion point stacks of Sp receiver functions show little coherent scattering from the top of the asthenosphere, indicating that the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is relatively gradual, with the exception of a few zones (such as one in the north of our region where the Appalachian orogen meets the craton). SKS splitting fast polarizations across the region follow a pattern with a 90˚ period in backazimuth. This result is consistent with different orientations of olivine a-axes in the asthenosphere versus the lithosphere, and will be compared to depth-varying azimuthal anisotropy from the Rayleigh wave tomography.",

We merged two huge orogenic and anorogenic datasets containing over 14,000 chemical analyses and processed them through factor analysis, in order to reduce the large number of geochemical parameters describing each sample (major/trace elements, isotopic ratios) through a smaller number of factors.\nBinary diagrams obtained combining seven resulting factors allow to distinguish the anorogenic field from the orogenic one. Anorogenic rocks usually fall in a narrow range of variation, while orogenic are characterized by a greater variability and by alignment along different trends. These different trends account for large heterogeneities of the sub lithospheric mantle due to extensive recycling of geochemically different materials through time, supporting the idea that different reservoirs are responsible for the Mediterranean volcanism [1].\nThe spatio-temporal evolution of the We-Me lamproites allows us to speculate a two-step evolution of the mantle beneath southern Spain. This evolution has been evaluated in light of the three models. We therefore propose that a type C model accounting for the presence of two juxtaposed slabs beneath the We-Me is the most feasible model to describe the geodynamic evolution of this area.\n[1] Conticelli et al.

            "abstract": "Rift initiation in thick, strong continental lithosphere challenges current models of continental lithospheric deformation, in part owing to gaps in our knowledge of strain patterns in the lower crust. New geophysical, geochemical, and structural data sets from youthful magmatic (Magadi-Natron, Kivu), weakly magmatic (Malawi, Manyara), and amagmatic (Tanganyika) sectors of the cratonic East African rift system provide new insights into the distribution of brittle strain, magma intrusion and storage, and time-averaged deformation. We compare and contrast time-space relations, seismogenic layer thickness variations, and fault kinematics using earthquakes recorded on local arrays and teleseisms in sectors of the Western and Eastern rifts, including the Natron-Manyara basins that developed in Archaean lithosphere. Lower crustal seismicity occurs in both the Western and Eastern rifts, including sectors on and off craton, and those with and without central rift volcanoes. In amagmatic sectors, lower crustal strain is accommodated by slip along relatively steep border faults, with oblique-slip faults linking opposing border faults that penetrate to different crustal levels. In magmatic sectors, seismicity spans surface to lower crust beneath both border faults and eruptive centers, with earthquake swarms around magma bodies. Our focal mechanisms and Global CMTs from a 2007 fault-dike episode show a local rotation from ~E-W extension to NE-SE extension in this linkage zone, consistent with time-averaged strain recorded in vent and eruptive chain alignments. These patterns suggest that strain localization via widespread magma intrusion can occur during the first 5 My of rifting in originally thick lithosphere. Lower crustal seismicity in magmatic sectors may be caused by high gas pressures and volatile migration from active metasomatism and magma degassing, consistent with high CO2 flux along fault zones, and widespread metasomatism of xenoliths. Volatile release and migration may be critical to strength reduction of initially cold, strong cratonic lithosphere. Our comparisons suggest that large offset border faults that develop very early in rift history create fluid pathways that maintain the initial along-axis segmentation until magma (if available), reaches mid-crustal levels.",

            "abstract": "Climate change scenarios projected for the 21st century predict drying of the Amazon, greening of monsoon tropical Asia and no change in the tropics of Australia. Dry season variability is increasing with complex associated forest responses and feedbacks as they become exposed to longer and/or more intense dry seasons. The functional response of tropical forests to dry seasonal periods is thus crucial to forest resilience, as forests may respond with either enhanced photosynthesis (due to more sunlight) or may dry down with greater susceptibility to fires and release of greenhouse gases and severe public health haze alerts. In this study, we use multiple satellite remote sensing datasets representing forest canopy states, environmental drivers (light and water status), and disturbance (fires), along with in situ flux tower measures of photosynthesis to assess whole ecosystem patterns and test mechanisms of forest- dry season climate interactions. We compare photosynthesis patterns and dry season responses of Asia-Oceania tropical forests with neotropical forests to better understand forest resilience to climate change and human impacts. In contrast to the neotropics, human activities in monsoon tropical Asia have resulted in intensive transformations of tropical forests. We find forest disturbance exerts a strong influence on tropical forest functioning and a partial loss or degradation of tropical forests can reverse dry seasonal responses with substantial impacts on carbon fluxes. Neotropical forests displayed large variations in dry season forest responses due to spatially variable dry season lengths and magnitude, whereas most of monsoon Asia tropical forests lacked well-defined dry seasons, yet were highly sensitive to shorter term, intense drought events that impacted severely upon the disturbed forests. Our results highlight the interactions among rainfall, radiation and forest health with the relative importance of each factor varying with the characteristics and stages of dry seasonal periods. We find the role of the dry season in sustaining rainforests must be better understood to improve earth system model and future climate predictions.",

            "abstract": "We use broadband waveform data for 305 local earthquakes from the Eastern Himalayan and Indo-Burman plate boundary systems, to model the seismic attenuation in NE India. We measure the decay in amplitude of coda waves at discreet frequencies (between 1 and 12Hz) to evaluate the quality factor (Qc) as a function of frequency. We combine these measurements to evaluate the frequency dependence of Qc of the form Qc(f)=Qof η, where Qo is the quality factor at 1Hz and η is the frequency dependence. Computed Qo values range from 80–360 and η ranges from 0.85–1.45. To study the lateral variation in Qo and η, we regionalise the Qc by combining all source-receiver measurements using a back-projection algorithm. For a single back scatter model, the coda waves sample an elliptical area with the epicenter and receiver at the two foci. We parameterize the region using square grids. The algorithm calculates the overlap in area and distributes Qc in the sampled grids using the average Qc as the boundary value. This is done in an iterative manner, by minimising the misfit between the observed and computed Qc within each grid. This process is repeated for all frequencies and η is computed for each grid by combining Qc for all frequencies.\nOur results reveal strong variation in Qo and η across NE India. The highest Qo are in the Bengal Basin (210–280) and the Indo-Burman subduction zone (300–360). The Shillong Plateau and Mikir Hills have intermediate Qo (~160) and the lowest Qo (~80) is observed in the Naga fold thrust belt. This variation in Qo demarcates the boundary between the continental crust beneath the Shillong Plateau and Mikir Hills and the transitional to oceanic crust beneath the Bengal Basin and Indo-Burman subduction zone. Thick pile of sedimentary strata in the Naga fold thrust belt results in the low Qo. Frequency dependence (η) of Qc across NE India is observed to be very high, with regions of high Qo being associated with relatively higher η.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 Napa was recognized as a right‐lateral strike‐slip fault. About 400 aftershocks occurred, mainly in the near‐source range, in the two months after the earthquake. They mostly occurred between 8 and 11 km depth interesting an area of about 10 km2 north‐northwest‐trending with respect to the mainshock hypocenter. However, the aftershock distribution was not able to constrain the mainshock fault plane.\nSince Parsons et al. (2014) have shown that Coulomb static stress change does not completely explain near‐source aftershock distribution, we explore whether dynamic strain transfer, enhanced by source directivity, contributed to trigger the aftershock sequence. Indeed, dynamic strain transfer triggering attributes enhanced failure probabilities to increased shear stresses or strains, to permeability changes and maybe to fault weakening. In this respect, we observe that a single inverse power law fits the decay of aftershock density as function of distance from the fault plane, suggesting that dynamic stress/strain might have played a role in the aftershocks triggering. To test this hypothesis, we used Peak‐Ground Velocities (PGVs) as a proxy for peak‐dynamic strain/stress field, accounting for both fault finiteness and source directivity. We first use a point source to retrieve the best parameters of the directivity function from the inversion of the PGVs. Next, the same PGVs are used to jointly infer the surface fault projection and the dominant horizontal rupture direction. Finally, we map the peak‐dynamic strain/stress, modified by source geometry and directivity, to resolve the relationship between the aftershocks location and the\nareas of large dynamic strain values. Thus, we believe that dynamic strain/stress actually contributed to the Napa aftershock distribution. Our results may help to better constrain the Napa causative fault and complement Coulomb static stress change to identify areas that will be more likely affected by aftershocks.",

            "abstract": "The theoretical treatment of cloud and precipitation microphysics in models is becoming increasingly sophisticated as computing power increases. As grid resolutions reduce in size to a few kilometers and less, the explicit parameterization of microphysical processes are being found to cause the greatest uncertainty in simulations where clouds and precipitation are predominant. Constraining these processes with remote sensing data is highly desirous in order to improve parameterizations. However, because these processes typically involve two hydrometeor species interacting in a particular volume, remotely sensing their interactions range from challenging to impossible. Using in situ data collected during various field programs we seek to determine what sets of radar measurables at which frequencies and resolutions provide the most information regarding the processes of riming and aggregation in convective and stratiform clouds. We accomplish this by applying standard parameterizations of particle collection microphysics to particle size distributions measured by probes from aircraft flying in situ. From this we calculate radar observables (reflectivity and Doppler velocity) at a number of standard frequencies at varying resolutions. The information content regarding the microphysical processes present within various combinations of radar measurables at variable resolution is then quantified. Our objective is to show 1) whether diagnosis of certain microphysical processes is possible with radar remote sensing and 2) if so, which combinations of measurements at which resolutions are optimal.",

The frontal mountains of this range rise abruptly against the vast Indo-Gangetic plains along the range-bounding Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT), which marks the present day principal displacement zone between Indian and Eurasian plates. With an aim of understanding the morphotectonics of different mountain segments in such a zone of intense tectonic activities, we have analyzed geomorphic indices like ‘basin asymmetry factor’ (AF), ‘transverse topography asymmetry factor’ (T), ‘basin elongation ratio’ (BR) and ‘hypsometric integral’ (HI) of fifty six drainage basins of 3rd streams in conjunction with ‘mountain-front sinuosity’ (Smf), ‘valley-floor width to height ratio’ (Vf) and drainage characteristics of the two large, neighboring segments of the frontal Siwalik mountains. Referred to here as the ‘eastern segment’ and ‘western segment’, these two mountain-segments are separated from each other and adjoining mountain-segments by antecedent streams of fourth and fifth order. In both the mountain-segments, the Smf values are mostly between 1.0–1.6 and, likewise, the Vf of most of the streams, calculated at a fix distance of 800m from the mountain-front, is invariably <1.0. The AFs of 64% of the western-segment’s drainage basins and 65% of the eastern-segment’s drainage basins indicate their down-tilting towards the west. The azimuths of the Ts of theses basins are not always in conformity with AF suggested down-tilting, but the azimuths of the larger magnitude Ts are by and large in conformity with the AF suggested down-tilting. However, the BR and HI values of all the drainage basins of a mountain-segment do not show any spatial variation. These results suggest that both the studied mountain-segments are actively uplifting, but with faster rate in their eastern part. Moreover, the drainage pattern and deflections in and around both the segments reveal their lateral progression from east to west.",

The sliding event appears to be of post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) age. The evacuation site exhibits a 30° steep and 2000 m high failure plane, the slide deposits in the Chile Trench are preserved as scattered 10-600 m high angular blocks incorporated in a ~60 m high debris fan. The combination of a steep and high failure surface (high velocity) and the apparent cohesiveness of the displaced material (little disintegration) makes Reloca Slide a likely source for a local tsunami. Our numerical simulations show that a comparable event at the lower slope would generate waves of > 8 m offshore amplitude that would impact the Chilean coast within ~25 minutes.\nReloca Slide is unique along the Central Chilean margin by its size and particular morphology. Yet, much of the unfailed lower slope along a ~1500 km long stretch shares general morphology, tectonic situation and sedimentary properties with the Reloca Slide source region. It is therefore of high relevance for risk mitigation to understand preconditioning factors and triggering mechanisms of as critical boundary conditions for similar potential future events.\nCore samples were taken directly from the failure plane, oedometer tests indicate a former burial depth of ~ 500 m. Samples are used to run geotechnical experiments for an improved understanding of the mechanics of the failure process. We are particularly interested in the question of whether the failure of the lowermost slope is a continuing process linked to the subduction of the Nazca Plate (e.g. a process needed to re-establish a critically tapered accretionary wedge), or, alternatively, if it is related to particular local conditions or an exceptional triggering event. We report on results from direct and rotary shear experiments to characterize frictional properties and strength of the materials at the detachment surface of the slide.",

An in-depth look at this phenomenon is now afforded by a more comprehensive set of AGCM ensemble experiments. Each experiment is designed to quantify the impact of a specific local dry soil moisture anomaly, prescribed somewhere in North America, on the general circulation. The locations tested in the different experiments span much of the continent, allowing a comprehensive picture of the circulation’s sensitivity to soil moisture anomalies. The main result is that while the sensitivity does vary with the imposed anomaly’s geographical location, a dry anomaly in general tends to induce, just to the east, a northerly flow at 250 mb, with (at times) consequent impacts on surface meteorological variables.

Here we present an 8,000 year sediment record from Xing Yun Lake in Yunnan, China that provides a semi-quantitative estimate of lake level change using stable isotopes of authigenic calcite as well as within-lake productivity using stable isotopes of organic matter. Substantial drops in lake level occur at 6,600 years BP, consistent with previous studies of a weaker monsoon system in the mid-Holocene due to declining summer insolation. Lake levels stabilize at 4,700 years BP and remain steady due to the topography surrounding the lake. From 5,600 to 5,100 and from 4,600 to 4,000 years BP, primary productivity decreases and is coincident with significant regional aridity as well as cooler Western Tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures. Variability in the stable isotopes of both calcite and organic matter after 1,500 years BP is primarily controlled by human activities. This study shows broad agreement with previous work on the Tibetan Plateau and provides one of the first continuous records of lake hydrologic balance from a crucial region affected by the Indian Summer Monsoon.",

This drought is the strongest multidecadal drought of the 20th century, globally. It has strongly impacted ecosystems, water availability, and populations. However, an increase of surface water has been observed during the same period: higher discharge of Sahelian rivers, and a general increase in pond's surface. This phenomenon, \"less rain but more surface runoff\", is referred to as the “Sahelian paradox”.\nThe causes of this paradox are still debated. The role of the significant increase in cropped areas, often cited for cultivated Sahel, does not hold for pastoral areas in central and northern Sahel. Degradation of vegetation as a result of the drought, soils erosion, may also play an important role.\nMost Sahelian watersheds are still poorly gauged or ungauged, which makes it difficult to quantify surface runoff and its determinants.\nA method is developed to estimate runoff over ungauged ponds watersheds. It is tested for the Agoufou pond in the Gourma region in Mali, where in situ data are available for 2007-2014. A 3D model is first developed to relate water volume to height surface. This model is combined with daily evaporation and precipitation, to estimate the water supply to the pond which is a proxy for runoff over the watershed. This model highlights a spectacular increase of the runoff coefficient over the last 60 years.\nThe method is then applied to two ungauged Sahelian watersheds in Mauritania and Niger, where pond surfaces by remote sensing are the only information. The runoff coefficients also increased in the last 60 years over these watersheds.\nThe runoff derived for the Agoufou pond is used to evaluate simulations with the KINEROS2 model. We discuss to what extent the changes in rain intensity, soil hydrological properties and land-use land cover are able to cause the observed change in runoff over the last 60 years.",

            "abstract": "Unusual silicate glasses were found in northern Chile in one of the driest place on earth, the Atacama Desert. The scoria-type melted rocks are littered on the ground at several localities distributed along a longitudinal band of about 50km. The silicate glasses have a stable natural remanent magnetization carried by fine-grained magnetite and acquired during cooling. At one locality, fine-grained overbank sediments were heated to form a 10 to 20 cm-thick layer of brick-type samples. Magnetic experiments on oriented samples demonstrate that the baked clays record a thermoremanent magnetization acquired in situ above 600°C down to more than 10cm depth and cooled under a normal polarity geomagnetic field with a paleointensity of 40µT. In some samples of the silicate glass, large grains of iron sulphides (troilite) are found in the glass matrix with numerous droplets of native iron, iron sulphides and iron phosphides indicating high temperature and strong redox conditions during melting. The paleomagnetic record of the baked clays and the unusual mineralogy of the silicate glasses indicate a formation mainly by in situ high temperature radiation. Paleomagnetic experiments and chemical analyses indicate that the silicate glasses are not fulgurite type rocks due to lightning events, nor volcanic glasses or even metallurgical slags related to mining activity. The existence of a well-developped baked clay layer indicates that the silicate glasses are not impact-related ejectas. The field, paleomagnetic and mineralogical observations support evidence for a thermal event likely related to a major airburst. The youngest calibrated 14C age on a charcoal sample closely associated with the glass indicates that the thermal event occurred around 12 to 13 ka BP. The good conservation of the surface effects of this thermal event in the Atacama Desert could provide a good opportunity to further estimate the threats posed by large asteroid airbursts.",

            "abstract": "The Planetary Society (TPS) is a non-profit space advocacy group with a stated mission to “empower the world's citizens to advance space science and exploration.” In 2009, TPS began work on LightSail, a small, citizen-funded spacecraft to demonstrate solar sailing propulsion technology. The program included a test flight, completed in June 2015, with a primary mission slated for late 2016.\nTPS initiated a LightSail public engagement campaign to provide the public with transparent mission updates, and foster educational outreach. A credentialed science journalist was given unrestricted access to the team and data, and provided regular reports without editorial oversight. An accompanying website, sail.planetary.org, provided project updates, multimedia, and real-time spacecraft data during the mission. Design approaches included a clean layout with text optimized for easy reading, balanced by strong visual elements to enhance reader comprehension and interest. A dedicated “Mission Control” page featured social media feeds, links to most recent articles, and a ground track showing the spacecraft’s position, including overflight predictions based on user location. A responsive, cross-platform design allowed easy access across a broad range of devices. Efficient web server performance was prioritized by implementing a static content management system (CMS).\nDespite two spacecraft contingencies, the test mission successfully completed its primary objective of solar sail deployment. Qualitative feedback on the transparent, embedded reporting style was positive, and website metrics showed high user retention times. The website also grew awareness and support for the primary 2016 mission, driving traffic to a Kickstarter campaign that raised $1.24 million. Websites constantly evolve, and changes for the primary mission will include a new CMS to better support multiple authors and a custom dashboard to display real-time spacecraft sensor data.",

            "abstract": "Creating virtual sources at locations where physical receivers have measured a response is known as seismic interferometry. A much appreciated benefit of interferometry is its independence of the actual source locations. The use of ambient noise as actual source is therefore not uncommon in this field. Ambient noise can be commercial noise, like for example mobile phone signals. For GPR this can be useful in cases where it is not possible to place a source, for instance when it is prohibited by laws and regulations. A mono-static GPR antenna can measure ambient noise. Interferometry by auto-correlation (AC) places a virtual source on this antenna’s position, without actually transmitting anything. This can be used for pavement damage inspection.\nEarlier work showed very promising results with 2D numerical models of damaged pavement. 1D and 2D heterogeneities were compared, both modelled in a 2D pavement world. In a 1D heterogeneous model energy leaks away to the sides, whereas in a 2D heterogeneous model rays can reflect and therefore still add to the signal reconstruction (see illustration). In the first case the amount of stationary points is strictly limited, while in the other case the amount of stationary points is very large. We extend these models to a 3D world and optimise an experimental configuration.\nThe illustration originates from the journal article under submission ‘Non-destructive pavement damage inspection by mono-static GPR without transmitting anything’ by R. Feld, E.C. Slob, and J.W. Thorbecke. (a) 2D heterogeneous pavement model with three irregular-shaped misalignments between the base and subbase layer (marked by arrows). Mono-antenna B-scan positions are shown schematically. (b) Ideal output: a real source at the receiver’s position. The difference w.r.t. the trace found in the middle is shown. (c) AC output: a virtual source at the receiver’s position. There is a clear overlap with the ideal output.",

Compared with classical Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the PMVP model provides predictions of tracer concentration statistics at computing times that are three orders of magnitude smaller. Consequently, the PMVP model is as well significantly faster than accelerated sampling techniques such as multi-level MC or polynomial chaos expansions. In this work, we further evaluate the PMVP model performance by applying the model for tracer dispersion predictions in a setup derived from the well-known MADE field experiment [Boggs et al., WRR, 1992]. We perform detailed model validations against reference MC simulations and conclude that the model provides overall accurate dispersion predictions under realistic conditions.",

Large-scale field experiments present an ideal opportunity to develop methodologies for this scaling, by coupling in situ networks, temporary networks, and aerial mapping of soil moisture. During the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiments in 2015 (SMAPVEX15) in and around the USDA-ARS Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed and LTAR site in southeastern Arizona, USA, a high density network of soil moisture stations was deployed across a sparse, permanent in situ network in coordination with intensive soil moisture sampling and an aircraft campaign. This watershed is also densely instrumented with precipitation gages (one gauge/0.57 km2) to monitor the North American Monsoon System, which dominates the hydrologic cycle during the summer months in this region. Using the precipitation and soil moisture time series values provided, a physically-based model is calibrated that will provide estimates at the 3km, 9km, and 36km scales. The results from this model will be compared with the point-scale gravimetric samples, aircraft-based sensor, and the satellite-based products retrieved from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive mission.",

            "abstract": "It is quite clear that for studying Arctic climate changes, and better understand interacting processes it is essential to follow an integrated approach for observing and modeling the whole Arctic system encompassing the atmosphere, the ocean and sea-ice at once. Due to the difficulties in retrieving key parameters, satellite observations alone are not the right answer. The project we are developing, is an attempt to tackle this challenge by providing and maintaining a new integrated observing network of instrumented buoys over the Arctic Ocean in order to collect simultaneously and in real time information related to the state of the upper Ocean, the lower Atmosphere and the Arctic sea-ice/snow.\nIt is planned to operate several autonomous platforms in a network in the Arctic Ocean for a period of at least 5 years. Each platform is equipped to vertically sense and profile key variables in the ocean, sea-ice and atmosphere using\n- CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) vertical profilers sensors collecting ocean temperature and salinity down to 800m depth,\n- Temperature and heat conductivity in snow and ice from ice-mass-balance systems\n- Cloud and aerosol lidar profiling of the lower atmosphere\n- Diffuse and direct solar flux using wide angle radiometer\n- Meteorological standard parameters at the surface\nPlatforms allow measurements to be transmitted in near real time via Iridium satellites. As they will be drifting, it is planned to replace part of them every year.\nMajor tests were performed deploying progressively fully equipped IAOOS platform at the North Pole in April 2012, 2013 and 2014. These platforms drifted from the North Pole in April to Fram Strait (September, October) providing spring summer and fall field data. Important fieldwork for IAOOS was also taking place within the Norwegian ice camp on board R/V Lance organized by the Norsk Polar Institute from January to June 2015, as part of the Norwegian young ICE (N-ICE 2015) cruise project. These intensive tests were very timely. The first IAOOS array deployment will start in August 2015 from R/V Araon during the Korean cruise organized by the KOPRI in the Canadian Basin and from R/V Polarstern during the German cruise TRANSARC II organized by the Alfred Wegener Institute in the Eurasian Basin. First results obtained in the frame of IAOOS will be presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean’s dominant influence on the global heat balance and nutrient and carbon cycles stems from the fact that it is the primary gateway through which Earth’s cold, centuries old and nutrient rich deep and bottom waters interact with the atmosphere. The westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere drive a strongly divergent surface flow that draws up water from below in a wide ring circling the Antarctic continent.\nIn the first part of the talk, we assess the uptake, transport, and storage of oceanic anthropogenic carbon and heat in the Southern Ocean over the period 1861-2005 in a new set of carbon-climate Earth System Models. Simulations show that the Southern Ocean south of 30°S, covering only 30% of the global surface ocean area, accounts for more than 40% of global anthropogenic carbon uptake. Furthermore, the Southern Ocean takes up three quarters of the total excess heat generated by the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Anthropogenic carbon and heat storage show a common broad-scale pattern of change, but ocean heat storage is more structured than ocean carbon storage suggesting that different mechanisms are important. The Southern Ocean, however, remains the region where models differ the most in the representation of anthropogenic carbon and, in particular, heat uptake.\nWhile the Southern Ocean carbon uptake has increased considerably in recent decades, as expected based on the substantial increase in atmospheric CO2, there is considerable concern that this sink will saturate or even reverse in response to warming, changing ocean circulation and chemistry. In the second part of the talk, novel multi-millennial global warming simulations with a comprehensive Earth System Model under a 1% yr-1 atmospheric CO2 increase to 2xCO2 and constant forcing thereafter scenario will be used to explore future long-term changes in the Southern Ocean carbon uptake. We show that after full equilibration of the model with doubling of atmospheric CO2, the deep Southern Ocean is actually better ventilated and oxygenated than at present day. Such a millennial-scale increase in Southern Ocean deep-water formation under global warming increases the ocean inventory of preformed nutrients and ultimately decreases the carbon uptake capacity of the ocean.",

            "abstract": "Development of large-scale databases (from data collection networks or from a compilation of small datasets) has opened a new window for evaluating biogeochemical patterns on regional to continental scales. Adding a new spatial dimension to traditional relationships between landscape properties and lake chemistry will likely lead to identification of patterns that are often not considered in small-scale biogeochemical studies. Further, studies at a large spatial scale may highlight the importance of interactions between local and regional drivers. We tested these ideas using LAGOS (Lake multi-scaled GeOSpatial and temporal database), a recently compiled database that integrates lake nutrient chemistry data for ~ 5,000 lakes, lake characteristics (e.g., depth, area, watershed area) and geospatially-referenced landscape data (e.g., land use, climate, atmospheric deposition, hydrologic connectivity) over a 17-US state region. Specifically, we explored the spatial structure of different variables and identified which landscape variables were important in explaining variation in lake chemistry and stoichiometry.\nGeostatistical analysis revealed a large range in spatial structure in landscape and lake variables, ranging from continental (temperature, precipitation, atmospheric deposition), to regional (water clarity, lake N and P, land use), to local scales (lake depth, lake area). Variables with similar spatial structure were most strongly related to each other. These spatial patterns were reflected in the relationship between lake chemistry and landscape drivers. Variables at multiple scales, including land-use, lake depth, and atmospheric N deposition, had similar effects on lake nitrogen and phosphorus chemistry. While landscape-scale effects on N and P were similar, local variables and internal nutrient processing influenced N and P differently and had the strongest influence on ratios of nutrients. Hence, N:P ratios were more locally structured than either element alone. These results demonstrate that spatial structure can have a strong influence in the analysis of links between limnological and landscape variables. Use of large, spatially-explicit datasets can lend additional insight into examination of drivers of aquatic nutrient chemistry on a regional to continental scale.",

The present study addresses development of multiple rule sets for GEOBIA-based classification of WV-2 imagery to accurately extract land cover features in the Larsemann Hills, Antarctica. Multi-level segmentation process was applied to WV-2 image to generate different sizes of geographic image objects corresponding to various land cover features w.r.t scale parameter. Several SIRs were applied to geographic objects at different segmentation levels to classify landmass, man-made features, snow/ice, and water bodies. A specific attention was paid to water body class to identify water areas at the image level, considering their uneven appearance on landmass and ice. The results illustrated that synergetic usage of SIRs and GEOBIA can provide accurate means to identify land cover classes with an overall classification accuracy of ≈97%. In conclusion, the results suggest that GEOBIA is a powerful tool for carrying out automatic and semiautomatic analysis for most cryospheric remote-sensing applications, and the synergetic coupling with pixel-based SIRs is found to be a superior method for mining geoinformation.",

Two distinct principal slip zones (PSZ) were recovered in these cores (one in DFDP1A and two in DFDP1B) enabling investigation of chemical and mineralogical changes throughout the fault’s hangingwall and footwall rocks.\nHere we use geochemical analyses to identify fault rock protoliths, alteration styles, and mass changes in the fault zone to test the control of chemical alteration on fault rock material properties and compare with distal parts of the fault zone sampled in the second phase of DFDP (DFDP2). 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd isotopes, and immobile trace element ratios identify protolith lithology contributions. We show that cataclasites above the upper principal slip zone in holes DFDP1A and DFDP1B contain a mixture of hangingwall Alpine Schist and radiogenic granitic and metasedimentary footwall lithologies indicating physical mixing of material up to ~25 m above the PSZ. In DFDP1B between upper and lower PSZs cataclasites distinctly resemble granitic footwall rocks, and below the lower PSZ radiogenic strontium isotope ratios identify porphyroclastic ultramylonite breccias as Australian plate Palaeozoic metasediments. Lithological mixing is overprinted by alteration of primary minerals to clays and infilling of pore spaces and fractures by calcite and chlorite. As proximity to the upper PSZ increases permeability decreases corresponding to an increase in volatile content (LOI). LOI peaks in the PSZ where permeability is lowest and clay content and carbonate cementation are greatest. Local, meteoric-derived spring waters are saturated in secondary minerals documented in the Alpine Fault zone and fault zone secondary mineral δD compositions indicate formation from meteoric waters. These findings imply that chemical alteration resulting from the circulation of meteoric waters modifies the fault zone’s permeability structure by redistributing mass and changing the material properties of the plate boundary, and therefore plays an important role in the evolution of the fault zone which may prime it for repeated rupture.",

            "abstract": "Recent model intercomparisons in the CMIP5 study showed that carbon-climate feedback is an major source of uncertainty in projections of future greenhouse gas forcing and climate change. Large disagreement between different terrestrial carbon cycle models in the simulation of photosynthesis and respiration is at the root of this problem, and an important cause of this uncertainty is that the modeling is being done without knowing the correct answer. Synoptic scale modeling of the carbon cycle is actually an extrapolation based studies conducted at smaller scales. CO2 observations from OCO-2 and the global networks can provide an important overall constraint at this scale, but the models need information on the gross fluxes associated with photosynthesis and respiration - not just their sum. At least one other independent measurement is needed to constrain this system. Recent advances in two areas 1) remote sensing of Solar Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) from space, and 2) in measurements of the spatial dynamics of atmospheric OCS have the potential to provide this additional constraint. Modeling studies described here are designed to prepare for a test of this approach within the context of the upcoming ACT-America campaign.",

This paper aims to demonstrate that GB-SAR can be very helpful for understanding the mechanisms that control structure deformations and for identifying unexpected events and sensitive areas during construction projects. This could be done in a cost-effective way, which complements the traditional displacement measurements. An experiment was performed in the future railway station of La Sagrera, Barcelona (Spain) to demonstrate the utility of GB-SAR on structure monitoring during construction projects. In this experiment, GB-SAR precisely quantified wall displacements induced by dewatering. Manual data and numerical models have been used to confirm the measurements with a correlation analysis and by comparing measurements and deformation patterns, which have produced similar results. These results validate the use of the GB-SAR technique as a monitoring tool during construction projects.",

            "abstract": "With current remote sensing technologies, it is not possible to directly measure the thermal state of the ground from spaceborne platforms. Here, we demonstrate that such limitations can be overcome by exploiting the combined information content of several remote sensing products in a data fusion approach. For this purpose, time series of remotely sensed land surface temperature, as well as snow cover and snow water equivalent, are employed to force ground thermal models which deliver ground temperatures and thaw depths.\nFirst, we present a semi-empirical model approach based on remotely sensed land surface temperatures and reanalysis products from which mean annual ground temperatures (MAGT) can be estimated at a spatial resolution of 1 km at continental scales. The approach is tested for the unglacierized land areas in the North Atlantic region, an area of more than 5 million km2. The results are compared to in-situ temperature measurements in more than 100 boreholes from which the accuracy of the scheme is estimated to approximately 2.5 °C.\nFurthermore, we explore transient modeling of ground temperatures driven by remotely sensed land surface temperature, snow cover and snow water equivalent. The permafrost model CryoGrid 2 is applied to the Lena River Delta in NE Siberia (~25,000 km2) at 1 km spatial and weekly time resolution for the period 2000-2014. A comparison to in-situ measurements suggests a possible accuracy of around 1 °C for annual average ground temperatures, and around 0.1 m for thaw depths. However, information on subsurface stratigraphies including the distribution of ground ice is required to achieve this accuracy which is currently not available from remote sensing products alone.\nFinally, we discuss the potential and limitations of such schemes and give a feasibility assessment for both mountain and lowland permafrost regions.",

            "abstract": "The behavior of OCS in the atmosphere is very similar to that of CO2 and reminiscent of an isotopologue. It is stable, has a turnover time of a couple of years (similar to that of 18O in CO2). It can be measured with adequate accuracy - despite the fact that its abundance is one millionth that of CO2, but there is one dramatic difference. The seasonal variation in the concentration of OCS relative to its background concentration can be 6-10 fold larger than the corresponding variation in CO2 concentration. Furthermore there are large spatial gradients in atmospheric OCS, with the concentrations being generally lower over the continents than the ocean, and lower in the atmospheric boundary layer over vegetated surfaces than in the free troposphere. These gradients have been clearly resolved by flask sampling from aircraft and recently by satellite measurements. The dynamics of OCS are larger than any other conserved atmospheric gas and certainly dwarf isotopic gradients. There are strong differences in the kinetics of CO2 and OCS exchange with leaves (similar to an isotopic fractionation), but these are not responsible for the large atmospheric signals. The major driver of these gradients is a large spatial separation between the major sources of OCS (the tropical ocean) and the major sink (the terrestrial biosphere). This talk will review the biogeochemical cycle of OCS; the kinetics of its exchange with leaves and soils; the distribution of sources and sinks, and the local and large scale gradients of OCS concentration in the atmosphere.",

The arrival of interplanetary shocks drives magnetosphere and ionosphere currents systems, which then induce electric currents at ground level. The impact of these currents at high latitudes has been extensively researched, but the magnetic equator has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the potential effects of interplanetary shocks on the equatorial region and demonstrate that their magnetic signature is ampli ed by the equatorial electrojet. This local ampli cation substantially increases the region's susceptibility to GICs. Importantly, this result applies to both geomagnetic storms and quiet periods, and thus represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of adverse space weather impacts on technological infrastructure.",

The ESA Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission and the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission both provide Level 1 brightness temperature products and derived Level 2 soil moisture retrieval products. The assimilation of these products into land surface models has potential to improve global estimates of soil moisture and other land surface variables. This presentation investigates the benefits and challenges of assimilating either retrievals or brightness temperature observations from either SMOS or SMAP into the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) land surface model. It will be shown that the seasonal corrections introduced by retrieval assimilation are slightly different from those with brightness temperature assimilation as a result of the technical implementation of the assimilation scheme. Various resulting land surface variables will also be evaluated against the results from the operational SMAP Level 4 Soil Moisture (L4_SM) product, which assimilates SMAP brightness temperature data.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s climate is determined by the exchange of radiant energy between the Sun, Earth and space. The absorbed solar radiation (ASR) fuels the climate system, providing the energy required for atmospheric and oceanic motions, and energy released to space in the form of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) nearly balances ASR, ensuring a relatively stable climate. Owing to human activities, there is currently less emitted thermal radiation than absorbed solar radiation, leading to an accumulation of energy into the Earth's system, which is driving global warming. Achieving an understanding of Earth’s energy flows requires an accurate description of how radiant energy at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA), within the atmosphere, and at the surface is distributed spatially, and how this changes with time.\nA central objective of the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project is the production of a long-term global climate data record of Earth’s radiation budget from the TOA down to the surface along with the associated atmospheric and surface properties that influence this budget. The CERES team relies on a number of data sources, including broadband radiometers that measure incoming and reflected solar radiation and OLR, high-resolution spectral imagers, meteorological, aerosol and ozone assimilation data, and snow/sea-ice maps based on microwave radiometer data. While TOA radiation budget is determined from accurate broadband radiometer measurements, the surface radiation budget is derived indirectly through radiative transfer model calculations initialized using imager-based cloud and aerosol retrievals and meteorological assimilation data. In order to accurately capture changes in Earth’s radiation budget from interannual to decadal timescales, satellite instruments used to produce these data records must be radiometrically stable and the input data stream must be free of artificial discontinuities. Otherwise, distinguishing real climate system changes from artifacts in the data record is exceedingly difficult.\nThis presentation will discuss the process of producing a long-term global climate data record of Earth’s radiation budget by the CERES team. We will highlight the challenges involved and show results from recent validation studies using the latest version of CERES data products.",

SOHO/LASCO has observed all of SC 23 and continues to obtain data through the present. In addition, since 2007 we have had near-Sun observations from the STEREO/SECCHI coronagraphs. In the heliosphere CMEs have been observed with the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI; 2003 - 2011) and SECCHI heliospheric imagers. CME rates have typically been well correlated with sunspot numbers (SSN). However, since the SC 23/24 minimum, there is evidence that the CME and SSN rates are diverging, with similar SC 24 rise and peak CME rates but much lower SSN rates. It has been suggested that this is related to the weak solar polar magnetic fields during the recent extended minimum and the rise of SC 24. The weak fields also have consequences in various CME parameters and associated effects, such as shocks, energetic particles and geo-activity. I will review these CME observations and effects.",

These drivers may encompass biophysical factors such as climate change, socioeconomic drivers, and wild-cards that represent low likelihood but influential events such as major environmental disasters. We outline some of the lessons learned from the North Slope Science Initiative (NSSI) scenarios project that could help in the development of adaptive science-based policies. Three spatially explicit development scenarios were identified corresponding to low, medium and high resource extraction activities on the North Slope and adjacent seas. In the case of the high energy development scenario science needs were focused on new technology, oil spill response, and the effects of offshore activities on marine mammals important for subsistence. Science needs related to community culture, erosion, permafrost degradation and hunting and trapping on land were also identified for all three scenarios. The NSSI science needs will guide recommendations for future observing efforts, and data from these observing activities could subsequently improve policy guidance for emergency response, subsistence management and other issues. Scenarios at pan-Arctic scales may help improve the development of international policies for resilient northern communities and encourage the use of science to reduce uncertainties in plans for adapting to change in the Arctic.",

However, the underlying driver of climate change is the increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), which simultaneously increases temperature globally and modifies the water needs of plants. Although the influence of CO2 on plant stomatal conductance and transpiration is well established, the relative impact of this physiology on different drought metrics has not been rigorously assessed. We find that predictions of increasing drought stress derived using atmospheric demand metrics in many regions (including potential evapotraspiration and Palmer Drought Stress Index) correspond to places where Earth system models show stable or increasing water availability on land when assessed using the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration. Approximately 70% of the increase in global water availability is a direct result of the effect of CO2 reducing plant water needs. Current models predict a decoupling of water flux and carbon flux, which require revisions to how aridity is measured and drought is calculated under changing CO2.",

            "abstract": "Ongoing agricultural expansion in Amazonia and the surrounding areas of Brazil is expected to continue over the next several decades as global food demand increases. The transition of natural forest and savannah ecosystems to pastureland and agricultural crops is predicted to create warmer and drier atmospheric conditions than the native vegetation. Compounding this effect, climate change is likely to lead to reduced transpiration fluxes as plants become more water efficient under higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Here we investigate the expected impacts of predicted future land use on the climate of South America as well as the potential impacts of increasing CO2. We find that the climate response to land use change generally consistent with expectations from previous global modeling simulations with drier conditions resulting from deforestation, however the direct changes in precipitation are relatively small (on order of a few percent). Local drying from land use change is driven primarily by decreases in evapo-transpiration associated with the loss of forest, and concomitant increases in runoff. Significant changes in convectively available potential energy and convective inhibition during the transition to the wet season indicate that the decrease in surface latent heat flux is indeed leading to a drier atmosphere, however these changes occur around a mean climatological state that is already very favorable for convection, and thus lead to relatively small changes in precipitation. The physiological effects of increasing CO2 alone also drive a reduction in precipitation, which is compounded by radiation-driven circulation changes. If these land use changes were to occur under a background state of drier conditions, such as those predicted for the future global climate model experiments, this additional atmospheric drying driven by land use change may be sufficient to decrease precipitation more substantially.",

            "abstract": "Determining the timing, flux and source of water accretion in the early solar system is important for understanding planet formation and habitability, and for constraining models of the movements of the giant planets during terrestrial planet formation. Angrite meteorites are ideal for studying early solar system processes; they sample one of the oldest planetesimals. Angrites are depleted in volatile elements compared to Earth. Plotting condensation temperature vs normalized mantle abundance, Na and K are depleted in the angrite parent body (APB) compared to Earth, yet the APB has an elevated Rb/Na (see Fig). To elucidate this inconsistency, we examined the volatile elements H, C, F, and Cl because these elements have 50% condensation temperatures ranging from 40 to 948 K.\nHere we report measurements of volatile and major element concentrations in olivines from D’Orbigny and Sahara 99555. Our olivine major, minor and volatile data closely matches a forward fractional crystallization model, which means (1) post crystallization diffusion of H is minor and (2) we were able to calculate the H, C, F, and Cl abundances of the APB melt. We are able to reproduce the volatile metal depletion trend of the APB and its relative volatile element enrichment from our H, C, F, and Cl data in combination with published data by adding ~ 0.3 % carbonaceous chondrites to a volatile-poor reservoir.\nThe antiquity of angrites in combination with their volatile contents demonstrates that inner solar system bodies accreted water and volatile elements very early. The kinks in the volatile element depletion diagram (see fig) suggest that both volatile-poor and volatile-rich components were accreted to the APB. One mechanism for large scale mixing in the inner solar system leading to early accretion of volatiles is a giant planet-migration event. The “Grand Tack” is a dynamic early solar system model that predicts that carbonaceous chondrite material entered the initially dry inner solar system at some point during planet formation. It provides one possible mechanism for the transport of volatile-rich material into the inner solar system. Our results constrain the timing of volatile addition and, therefore, provide a time constraint for the Grand Tack – or for alternative models that explain the addition of volatiles to the inner solar system.",

            "abstract": "Recent findings from atmospheric OH measurements by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) instruments have shown that the detected OH signals may contain a significant interference in the presence of biogenic VOCs and ozone. The fractional contribution of the interfering signal to the total measured signal in field campaigns was observed to be largest during nighttime, but was also present during daytime. The exact nature of this interference is not fully clear, but it has been proposed to be related to the short-lived products of the ozonolysis of alkenes (Criegee intermediates). Here, we will show investigations of potential interferences in the OH detection for the Juelich LIF instruments for nighttime conditions in laboratory studies. The inlet of the instrument was overflown by excess synthetic air containing one or more reactants. In order to distinguish between OH produced by reactions upstream of the inlet and artificial signals produced inside the instrument, a chemical titration scheme for OH was applied. Experiments included the investigation of potential interferences related to the nitrate radical and related to the ozonolysis of alkenes, monoterpenes, and isoprene. A small interference signal was found, if nitrate radicals are sampled by the Juelich LIF instrument. Internally produced OH was observed, if exceptionally large, non-atmospheric concentrations of ozone and alkenes were sampled. However, this signal is most likely not related to the presence of Criegee intermediates.",

            "abstract": "Frequent long-term droughts interspersed with intense floods in the southwestern U.S. underscore the need to store more water to manage these climate extremes. Here we show how managed aquifer recharge can enhance drought resilience in the southwestern U.S. with ~ 70% of California under extreme drought and 75% of Arizona under moderate drought. Data on water sources, transportation, and users were compiled for managed aquifer recharge systems in the Central Valley and south-central Arizona. Groundwater depletion of 115 to 145 km3 in the 1900s created large subsurface reservoirs in thick alluvial basins in these regions. Large canals and aqueducts up to several 100 km long allow water to be imported from reservoirs, mostly in more humid regions. Imported water is either used instead of groundwater or is applied in surface spreading basins primarily during wet periods (≤1.3 km3/yr Central Valley, ≤0.7 km3/yr Arizona) and is extracted during droughts. The dominant water users include irrigators and municipalities both within and outside the managed aquifer recharge systems. Groundwater modeling indicates that recharge basins significantly increase groundwater storage in the Central Valley. Managed aquifer recharge systems significantly enhance drought resilience and increase sustainability of water resources in semiarid regions, complementing surface water reservoirs and conjunctive surface water/groundwater use by providing longer term storage.",

            "abstract": "Increasing demand for water in response to growing global population underscores the need to better understand linkages and feedbacks between land surface processes and water resources to manage water resources more sustainably. Here we examine the role of soils on hydrologic response to climate extremes and land use change using field scale and remote sensing data at point to basin scales in the U.S. High Plains and California Central Valley.\nIn the U.S. High Plains, soil-textural variations make the difference between sustainable water resources related to coarse-grained soils in the northern High Plains and groundwater mining associated with fine-grained soils in much of the central and southern High Plains. Field data show dynamic response of water resources to droughts and land use change in the northern High Plains with limited response in much of the central and southern High Plains. Soil profiles provide a key to the past by archiving system response to environmental changes in subsurface soil physics and environmental tracer data. Areas with coarse-grained soils are vulnerable to reduced recharge during droughts and increased recharge with land use change from perennial to annual vegetation whereas fine-grained soils are generally insensitive to these stresses. GRACE satellite monitoring of total water storage variations in response to recent droughts is consistent with these spatial variations in soils across the High Plains and hydrologic response to droughts.\nIn the California Central Valley, coarse grained soils in alluvial basins result in dynamic hydrologic responses to climate extremes. GRACE satellite data show marked depletion in total water storage in response to recent droughts reflecting groundwater and surface reservoir storage declines consistent with regional groundwater modeling and monitoring data. The coarse alluvial soils typical of much of the region facilitate managed aquifer recharge in depleted aquifers to complement surface reservoir storage to improve drought resilience. These examples demonstrate the critical role that soils play in controlling hydrologic response to climate extremes and land use change in large scale basins.",

            "abstract": "The CMIP5 configurations of the GISS Model-E2 GCM simulated a mid- and high-latitude ice IWP that decreased by ~50% relative to that simulated for CMIP3 (Jiang et al. 2012; JGR). Tropical IWP increased by ~15% in CMIP5. While the tropical IWP was still within the published upper-bounds of IWP uncertainty derived using NASA A-Train satellite observations, it was found that the upper troposphere (~200 mb) ice water content (IWC) exceeded the published upper-bound by a factor of ~2. This was largely driven by IWC in deep-convecting regions of the tropics.\nRecent advances in the model-E2 convective parameterization have been found to have a substantial impact on tropical IWC. These advances include the development of both a cold pool parameterization (Del Genio et al. 2015) and new convective ice parameterization. In this presentation, we focus on the new parameterization of convective cloud ice that was developed using data from the NASA TC4 Mission. Ice particle terminal velocity formulations now include information from a number of NASA field campaigns. The new parameterization predicts both an ice water mass weighted-average particle diameter and a particle cross sectional area weighted-average size diameter as a function of temperature and ice water content. By assuming a gamma-distribution functional form for the particle size distribution, these two diameter estimates are all that are needed to explicitly predict the distribution of ice particles as a function of particle diameter.\nGCM simulations with the improved convective parameterization yield a ~50% decrease in upper tropospheric IWC, bringing the tropical and global mean IWP climatologies into even closer agreement with the A-Train satellite observation best estimates.",

Here we consider coherent radio reflections routinely observed in ground-based GPS reflectometry. Their footprint is often conceptualized in terms of the specular point (SP) and the first Fresnel zone (FFZ). Such infinitesimal point and finite zone can be generalized into a spatially continuous sensitivity kernel (SK). The SK represents a diffraction pattern, as the importance of each surface portion depends on its power and phase scattering. We measured the SK of a GPS radio reflection under bi-path reception conditions. The SK exhibited oscillations along the plane of incidence. The envelope of oscillations peaked near the SP and persisted in its decay well beyond the FFZ. Within the FFZ, sensitivity was skewed towards the antenna. This experiment suggests the feasibility of overcoming the diffraction limit and resolving features smaller than the FFZ via GPS diffractive reflectometry. We also report more recent developments in SNR- and carrier-phase-based GPS Multipath Reflectometry.",

However, the cause of this increase is uncertain, with both anthropogenic and natural forcing changes proposed as drivers. Here, we investigate two possible anthropogenic forcings that could influence sea ice extent via changes in the near-surface wind field over the Southern Ocean; (i) ozone depletion and (ii) greenhouse gas increases. We employ an atmosphere-only version of the UK Met Office model, HadGEM3, with prescribed sea surface temperatures and sea ice coupled to the UKCA interactive climate-chemistry model. Starting from a pre-industrial control simulation, two additional simulations were spun off, one investigating the forcing from increased 21st century greenhouse gases and one investigating the forcing from the ozone hole. Based on the work of Holland & Kwok (2012) we analyse the changes in Antarctic circulation, in particular the surface wind properties which have been shown to correlate with sea ice extent. We examine changes in the surface wind field in these two model simulations relative to that in the pre-industrial control simulation, compare them to observed changes during the satellite record, and assess their potential role in driving a response in sea ice extent at both continental and regional scales.",

The moonlets tidally advance outward, and potentially coalesce to form the Moon. In addressing the fundamental problem of the Moon's formation, we consider smaller impactors than previously studied, and investigate the effect of new geometries using a Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics (SPH) code.\nFor impacts within the equatorial plane, we find multiple impactors are effective in draining angular momentum from the target’s initial spin due to the often-neglected angular momentum carried by escaping mass. Our simulations reveal new consequences of non-equatorial inclination of the impactor, also previously neglected. We note relationships with the resulting disks of corresponding equatorial cases, but find that the target’s axis of rotation can now be tilted by a significant amount (10’s of degrees) with sub-Mars size impactors. Importantly for distinguishing among competing Moon formation hypotheses, our results imply that (i) the rotational acceleration of the proto-Earth by successive impacts may be limited by angular momentum drain if the impacting population contains multiple members of medium size, and (ii) impacts onto such a non-rapidly rotation proto-Earth (well below break-up speed) can produce disks compatible with sub-Moon fragments in mass, momentum, and composition.",

On global scale, the direct radiative forcing is estimated to be in the range of -0.9 to -0.1 Wm-2 for aerosols [1]. Yet, these estimates are subject to very large uncertainties because of uncertainties in spatial and temporal variations of aerosols. At local scales, as aerosol properties can vary spatially and temporally, radiative forcing due to aerosols can be also very different and it can exceed the global value by an order of magnitude. Hence, it is very important to investigate aerosol loading, properties, and radiative forcing due to them in detail on local regions of climate significance. Haze and dust events in Hefei, China are explored by Lidar and Skyradiometer. Aerosol optical properties including the AOD, SSA, AAE and size distribution are analysed by using the SKYRAD.PACK [2] and presented in this paper. Furthermore, the radiative forcing due to aerosols and the heating rate in the ATM are also calculated using SBDART model [3]. The results are shown that the vertical heating rate is tightly related to aerosol profile.\n",

            "abstract": "We report on the first evidence for hydrothermal activity along the intermediate-spreading South-East Indian Ridge (SEIR) between Australia and Antarctica (128°E-140°E), discovered during the STORM cruise of R/V L'Atalante. This section of the SEIR is located east of the low-magma Australian-Antarctic Discordance (AAD), where the ridge has the morphology of a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge despite its intermediate spreading rate of 75 mm/yr. The axial depth decreases eastward, reflecting an eastward increase in magma budget.\nUsing in-situ geochemical tracers based on optical backscatter, temperature, redox potential sensor and in situ mass spectrometer (ISMS) anomalies, we establish the existence of several distinct hydrothermal plumes within the water column along the 500 nautical miles ridge section. At one site, the combination of near-bottom temperature anomalies of 0.1°C together with strong dissolved methane and dissolved carbon dioxide anomalies revealed by the ISMS provides the precise location of an active vent in the Deep Southern Indian Ocean off Tasmania.\nHydrothermal venting along the 128°E-140°E section of the SEIR appears to be significant, an observation consistent with the global link between spreading rate and plume occurrence (Baker and German, 2004). Moreover, the plume incidence increases westward and, in the eastern part, hydrothermal venting seems to be less significant, suggesting a possible influence of the high magma budget, as observed in mid-ocean ridge sections affected by hotspots.\nFuture investigation will focus on the direct identification of venting sources and the study of hydrothermal circulation within the specific settings of the AAD. The observation of new venting sites at the frontier between Pacific and Indian Oceans may also provide new insights on the biogeography (diversity and distribution) of hydrothermal fauna.\nBaker, E.

            "abstract": "Due to the ongoing collision of the Yakutat block with the North American plate in southeastern Alaska, a significant amount of deformation is occurring in the northern Canadian Cordillera. The stress transfer associated with the accretion of this terrane is believed to be responsible for the seismicity across this widespread region. Estimates of crustal thickness within the Mackenzie and Richardson Mountains provide constraints on models describing the evolution of crustal roots responsible for supporting such belts that transmit tectonic stresses over long distances (>1000 km); unfortunately, current seismic velocity models used to map crustal thickness have limited resolution due to sparse coverage by seismograph networks. Here we use data from a new regional seismograph network (Yukon-Northwest Seismograph Network – YNSN) as well as permanent stations to map out crustal structure. Crustal thickness variations can be obtained from 3-D seismic velocity models determined from the inversion of surface-wave dispersion data. In this work we present preliminary results of a regional tomography study of northwestern Canada, encompassing the northern Canadian Cordillera, using dispersion curves derived from ambient noise cross-correlations in addition to teleseismic two-station interferometry. We collected all available vertical component seismic data from stations located in the Yukon and surrounding regions from the period between June 2012 and June 2015. Using this data set, we first cross-correlated hour-long segments of the ambient seismic noise between all available stations pairs that share common data availability and obtained virtual Rayleigh waves with energy over periods 10-50 s that are predominantly sensitive to crust and uppermost mantle structure. This data set is complemented by Rayleigh-wave dispersion measurements, spanning the period range 25—175 s, derived by cross-correlating vertical component data from teleseismic earthquakes (M>5) lying along the great circle path between individual station pairs. We then measured group and phase velocities from these Rayleigh wave data sets and produced the first regional, high-resolution, azimuthally anisotropic phase and group velocity maps of northwestern Canada.",

Sometimes\nhowever, there may not be any additional dependency beyond what can be accounted for\nusing covariates and fixed and random effects. Additionally, dependency patterns may not be\nsimilar for different quantities of interest, for example, the dependency properties\nwhile modeling for a mean may not be the same as those obtained while modeling an extreme \nquantile. Thus, there is a need to quantify the degree of dependency, and test for\ndifferent hypotheses including that of a lack of dependency, or structured patterns of dependency.\nWe study a classical Space-Time Index measure suggested for testing spatio-temporal associations and show that it has low\npower in hypothesis tests and is generally unreliable. Newer, computation-driven statistical and machine learning methods for\nquantifying and testing dependency patterns are presented, and some of their statistical\nproperties are studied in detail. We conduct a study of spatio-temporal dependency in Indian\nsummer precipitation data, and particularly the properties of extreme precipitation during\nIndian monsoons. As expected, we find that the nature of extreme precipitations depend on some global and some local climate features. However, the spatio-temporal relationship between extreme precipitation events depends additionally on the threshold used to define an extreme event. This may be leveraged for a more precise modeling of extreme events, and for reducing uncertainty in predicting such events.",

            "abstract": "Modern climate dynamics in the western US are largely determined by a combination of two factors: 1) the strength and position of midlatitude pressure systems, which, in turn, are responsible for the generation and trajectory of winter storms, and 2) the strength of the North America Monsoon (NAM) which brings summer precipitation northward in response to northern hemisphere warming. Paleoclimate records from the Great Basin of the western US suggest some coherence in the timing of major climatic shifts during the Holocene. However, knowledge of the timing and magnitude of these changes at local scales, which can help explain the relative contribution of midlatitude winter storms vs. NAM, is lacking in many places. Here we present new data that constrain the timing and magnitude of late glacial and Holocene climate variability in the northeastern Great Basin, provide insight into past spatial variability of precipitation patterns in the western US, and improve our understanding of regional scale influences on Great Basin climate.\nIn 2011, a 7.65 m sediment core was raised from Swan Lake, a small wetland located in southeastern Idaho that was formed in the spillway channel created by the catastrophic flooding of Lake Bonneville ~18 ka BP. Pollen, charcoal, clumped isotope, diatom, ostracod, and sedimentological data are used to reconstruct vegetation, fire history, and lake level/groundwater flux over the last 13,500 years. Age control is provided by 19 AMS radiocarbon determinations, which are reported as thousands of calibrated years before present (ka BP). This effort builds on earlier work by Bright (1966) who reported on pollen, macrofossils, and sediment type from Swan Lake. Our data suggest cool and wet conditions prevailed until around 12.3 ka BP, after which a drying trend begins. The early Holocene was marked by a warmer, drier climate, which persisted until around 6.2 ka BP. Moister conditions after 6.2 ka BP likely resulted from a combination of enhanced NAM and increased winter storm activity. The period from 4.6-1.1 ka BP is characterized by increased variability, although it appears to have been relatively dry compared to the preceding two millennia. Data suggest that climate in the area was relatively wet from 1.1 ka BP to the present.",

In the Middle Island Sinkhole (MIS), a 23-m deep seep, groundwater seepage establishes low O2 (< 4 mg L-1), high sulfate (6 mM) conditions, in which a purple cyanobacteria-dominated mat thrives. The mat is capable of anoxygenic photosynthesis, oxygenic photosynthesis, and chemosynthesis. Within the top 3 cm of the mat-water interface, hydrogen sulfide concentrations increase to 1-7 mM. Little is known about the structure and function of microbes within organic-rich, high-sulfide sediments beneath the mat. Using pore water and sediment geochemical characterization along with microbial community analysis, we elucidated relationships between microbial community structure and ecosystem function along vertical gradients. In sediment pore waters, biologically reactive solutes (SO42-, NH4+, PO43-, and CH4) displayed steep vertical gradients, reflecting biological and geochemical functioning. In contrast, more conservative ions (Ca+2, Mg+2, Na+, and Cl-), did not change significantly with depth in MIS sediments, indicating groundwater influence in the sediment profile. MIS sediments contained more organic matter than typical Lake Huron sediments, and were generally higher in nutrients, metals, and sulfur (acid volatile sulfide). Using the Illumina MiSeq platform we detected 14,127 unique operational taxonomic units across sediment and surface mat samples. Microbial community composition in the MIS was distinctly different from non-groundwater affected areas at similar depth nearby in Lake Huron (ANOSIM, R= 0.74, p=0.002). MIS sediment communities were more diverse that MIS surface mat communities and changed with depth into sediments. MIS sediment community composition was related to several geochemical variables, including organic matter and multiple indicators of phosphorus availability. Elucidating the structure and function of microbial consortia in MIS, a highly unique and environmentally vulnerable ecosystem, provides a rare opportunity to understand relationships between microbial species and their environment and may provide insights into the evolution of life under ancient low-oxygen, high-sulfur conditions.",

            "abstract": "Sub-Auroral Polarization Streams (SAPS), also known as Sub-Auroral Ion Drifts (SAIDs), are fast westward flows in the ionosphere that occur at latitudes lower than auroral precipitation, and well separated from the high-latitude convection pattern. Although SAPS were first observed in the ionosphere, they can also be seen in the magnetosphere and are believed to be driven by a combination of region-2 currents and low ionospheric conductance. SAPS are thus governed both by magnetosphere and ionosphere processes and require self-consistently coupled models of the outer magnetosphere, the inner magnetosphere and the ring current, and the ionosphere-thermosphere system. Here, we present first results from the OpenGGCM-RCM coupled model, which includes all of the required physical processes and feedbacks. In particular, the ionospheric conductance is computed self-consistently from both magnetosphere electron precipitation, solar ionization, and ionospheric chemistry within the fully dynamical CTIM sub model of OpenGGCM. Furthermore, CTIM includes the recombination feedback of streaming ions. We focus on the GEM-CEDAR storm events of 2013-03-17, 2011-04-27, 2012-05-07, and 2012-09-02. We show that the coupled model produces SAPS that compare well with data in terms of location, extent, and magnitude. By modifying the conductances in the code we evaluate the potential positive feedback process of the ionospheric conductance on SAPS.",

It provides time dependent, global, three-dimensional plasma densities for nine ion species, electron and ion temperatures, and both parallel and perpendicular velocities of the ionosphere and plasmasphere. IPE reproduces not only the climatology of global TEC observations, but the model has also been applied to Space Weather events, such as Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSW) and geomagnetic storms. The model follows the storm time redistribution of the plasma density in the ionosphere and plasmasphere, including the development of the Storm Enhanced Density (SED). While the standalone IPE continues to be improved, IPE has been coupled to Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM), a special configuration of the GFS (Global Forecast System), in order to respond to terrestrial weather. IPE has been included as a component of the NOAA Environmental Modeling System (NEMS) coupled system using the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) and National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC) layer. In this presentation, an overview of the IPE model development and current status is presented. Furthermore, the preliminary results from the coupled WAM-IPE model is shown to demonstrate the impact of meteorological perturbations on the ionosphere. The presentation is summarized by the discussions on the challenges in the coupling effort toward the ultimate goal of transitioning to operations.",

The quantification and prediction of water and solute fluxes through the vadose zone can help to improve management practices in order to limit potential risk on our fresh water resources. Water related solute transport and residence time is strongly affected by preferential flow paths in the soil. Water flow in soils depends on soil properties and site factors (climate or experiment conditions, land use) and are therefore important factors to understand preferential solute transport in the unsaturated zone. However our understanding and knowledge of which on-site properties or conditions define and enhance preferential flow and transport is still poor and mostly limited onto laboratory experimental conditions (small column length and steady state boundary conditions).\nWithin the TERENO SOILCan lysimeter network, which was designed to study the effects of climate change on soil functions, a bromide tracer was applied on 62 lysimeter at eight different test sites between Dec. 2013 and Jan. 2014. The TERENO SOILCan infrastructure offers the unique possibility to study the occurrence of preferential flow and transport of various soil types under different natural transient hydrological conditions and land use (crop, bare and grassland) at eight TERENO SOILCan observatories. Working with lysimeter replicates at each observatory allows defining the spatial variability of preferential transport and flow. Additionally lysimeters in the network were transferred within and between observatories in order to subject them to different rainfall and temperature regimes and enable us to relate the soil type susceptibility of preferential flow and transport not only to site specific physical and land use properties, but also to different transient boundary conditions. Comparison and statistical analysis between preferential flow indicators 5% arrival time and potential key soil properties, site factors and boundary conditions will be presented in order to identify key properties which control the preferential transport in the vadose zone under transient hydrological conditions.",

            "abstract": "Lakes and reservoirs are widely used for water supply and flood control resulting in regulated release of outflows that are nonconcurrent with inflows. In hydrologic modeling applications, accounting for the regulated behavior of reservoirs distributed throughout a river system poses a significant challenge because detailed reservoir operation rules or strategies can be difficult or not possible to obtain. Building on this problem, this study addresses the science questions: Can we model reservoir water storage changes and outlet discharges based on satellite measurements of river water surface elevation and inundated area, and How does repeat cycle, mission duration and measurement uncertainty impact our ability to characterize reservoir behavior? A modeling framework suitable for regional to global applications and based on the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission is presented. Although our framework can be combined with data assimilation techniques for real-time flood forecasting, our goal is to represent reservoir storage patterns in large-scale hydrologic models for simulating: (i) impacts of future climate and/or land cover conditions on water resources, and (ii) synthetic storm events (e.g., 100-yr flood) or event catalogs for flood hazard and risk assessments. In-situ and remotely sensed reservoir dynamics are presented for select locations in the Mississippi River Basin and used in the Hillslope River Routing (HRR) hydrologic model to simulate downstream flow dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Progress in understanding and predicting climate change requires advanced tools to securely store, manage, access, process, analyze, and visualize enormous and distributed data sets. Only then can climate researchers understand the effects of climate change across all scales and use this information to inform policy decisions.\nWith the advent of major international climate modeling intercomparisons, a need emerged within the climate-change research community to develop efficient, community-based tools to obtain relevant meteorological and other observational data, develop custom computational models, and export analysis tools for climate-change simulations. While many nascent efforts to fill these gaps appeared, they were not integrated and therefore did not benefit from collaborative development. Sharing huge data sets was difficult, and the lack of data standards prevented the merger of output data from different modeling groups.\nThus began one of the largest-ever collaborative data efforts in climate science, resulting in the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF), which is now used to disseminate model, observational, and reanalysis data for research assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Today, ESGF is an open-source petabyte-level data storage and dissemination operational code-base that manages secure resources essential for climate change study. It is designed to remain robust even as data volumes grow exponentially.\nThe internationally distributed, peer-to-peer ESGF “data cloud” archive represents the culmination of an effort that began in the late 1990s. ESGF portals are gateways to scientific data collections hosted at sites around the globe that allow the user to register and potentially access the entire ESGF network of data and services. The growing international interest in ESGF development efforts has attracted many others who want to make their data more widely available and easy to use. For example, the World Climate Research Program, which provides governance for CMIP, has now endorsed the ESGF software foundation to be used for ~70 other model intercomparison projects (MIPs), such as obs4MIPs, TAMIP, CFMIP, and GeoMIP. At present, more than 40 projects disseminate their data via ESGF.",

The NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Electrodynamic General Circulation Model (TIMEGCM) is used to investigate thermospheric neutral wind variations during the storm, and the model results are validated through comparison with ground and space based observations. More specifically, we conduct detailed inter-comparison of the winds observed by scanning Doppler imagers (SDI) in Alaska with those derived from the TIMEGCM simulations in order to assess model's ability in reproducing the observed meso-scale wind field. The thermospheric winds obtained from the accelerometers on board the GOCE satellite are also used to validate the simulation results on a global scale. While globally the wind velocity tends to be smaller than ion drift velocity, locally the winds can exceed ion drifts and also blow in the different direction than the ions. We will discuss how the thermospheric winds affect the energetic coupling of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system in terms of Joule heating and field-aligned currents.",

            "abstract": "The data associated with climate research is often generated, accessed, stored, and analyzed on a mix of unique platforms. The volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of this data creates unique challenges as climate research attempts to move beyond stand-alone platforms to a system that truly integrates dispersed resources. Today, sharing data across multiple facilities is often a challenge due to the large variance in supporting infrastructures. This results in data being accessed and downloaded many times, which requires significant amounts of resources, places a heavy analytic development burden on the end users, and mismanaged resources.\nWorking across U.S. federal agencies, international agencies, and multiple worldwide data centers, and spanning seven international network organizations, the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) has begun to solve this problem. Its architecture employs a system of geographically distributed peer nodes that are independently administered yet united by common federation protocols and application programming interfaces. However, significant challenges remain, including workflow provenance, modular and flexible deployment, scalability of a diverse set of computational resources, and more.\nExpanding on the existing ESGF, the Distributed Resources for the Earth System Grid Federation Advanced Management (DREAM) will ensure that the access, storage, movement, and analysis of the large quantities of data that are processed and produced by diverse science projects can be dynamically distributed with proper resource management. This system will enable data from an infinite number of diverse sources to be organized and accessed from anywhere on any device (including mobile platforms). The approach offers a powerful roadmap for the creation and integration of a unified knowledge base of an entire ecosystem, including its many geophysical, geographical, social, political, agricultural, energy, transportation, and cyber aspects. The resulting aggregation of data combined with analytics services has the potential to generate an informational universe and knowledge system of unprecedented size and value to the scientific community, downstream applications, decision makers, and the public.",

            "abstract": "Activity in the Bardarbunga volcanic system in Iceland during 2014-2015 includes a major lava eruption (about 1.5 km3) and gradual caldera collapse (about 66 m), connected by a 50 km long dyke that formed mostly over 2-4 weeks after the onset of activity on 16 August 2014. This episode of dyking along the divergent plate boundary in Iceland is one of the best observed rifting events in the world, with seismic and deformation data showing how dyke barriers were overcome by the build-up of pressure at the dyke tip. Observations from these events can be compared to two other instrumentally recorded rifting episodes at two subaerial spreading centers: the 1975-1984 Krafla rifting episode in Iceland and the 2005-2010 Dabbahu (northern Manda Hararo) rifting episode in Afar, Ethiopia. In these cases, it has been inferred that magma is supplied to the crust in an intermittent manner, and stored at multiple positions and depths. During rifting episodes, magma is laterally intruded in dykes within the brittle upper crust releasing accumulated extensional strain. Cumulative extension of the ground at Krafla and Dabbahu averaged about 5 m, over 60-80 km long segments of the fissure swarms involved. Eruptions resulted in relative small volumes, mainly occurring near the end of the rifting episodes. An outstanding feature of the Bardarbunga events is the slow caldera collapse; not observed either at Krafla or Dabbahu. The erupted volume in the Bardarbunga events is also about an order of magnitude larger than the total erupted volume during the Krafla and Dabbahu rifting episodes. The slow caldera collapse at Bardarbunga is inferred to be responsible for the larger erupted volume in the 2014-2015 events compared to the other events; magma was driven out laterally from beneath Bardarbunga by the collapsing overburden above a magma source. Following such an event, the pressure within a magma source may take a long time to reach a sufficient level capable to creating another rifting event, unless magma inflow from depth proceeds at a fast rate.",

In September 2014, BGR conducted a seismic test cruise in the British North Sea. RV SONNE is a multipurpose research vessel and was also designed for the mobile BGR 3D seismic equipment, which was tested successfully during the cruise. We spend two days for calibration of the following seismic sources of BGR:\nG-gun array (50 l @ 150 bar)\nG-gun array (50 l @ 207 bar)\nsingle GI-gun (3.4 l @ 150 bar)\nFor this experiment two hydrophones (TC4042 from Reson Teledyne) sampling up to 48 kHz were fixed below a drifting buoy at 20 m and 60 m water depth – the sea bottom was at 80 m depth. The vessel with the seismic sources sailed several up to 7 km long profiles around the buoy in order to cover many different azimuths and distances.\nWe aimed to measure sound pressure level (SPL) and sound exposure level (SEL) under the conditions of the shallow North Sea. Total reflections and refracted waves dominate the recorded wave field, enhance the noise level and partly screen the direct wave in contrast to ‘true’ deep water calibration based solely on the direct wave.\nPresented are SPL and RMS power results in time domain, the decay with distance along profiles, and the somehow complicated 2D sound radiation pattern modulated by topography. The shading effect of the vessel’s hull is significant. In frequency domain we consider 1/3 octave levels and estimate the amount of energy in frequency ranges not used for reflection seismic processing. Results are presented in comparison of the three different sources listed above.\nWe compare the measured SPL decay with distance during this experiment with deep water modeling of seismic sources (Gundalf software) and with published results from calibrations with other marine seismic sources under different conditions: E.g. Breitzke et al. (2008, 2010) with RV Polarstern, Tolstoy et al. (2004) with RV Ewing and Tolstoy et al. (2009) with RV Langseth, and Crone et al. (2014) with RV Langseth.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography results have shown two large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the lowermost mantle beneath Africa and Pacific. The LLSVPs have been hypothesized to be caused by large-scale compositional heterogeneity. Two hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of this compositional heterogeneity: (1) primordial material formed during Earth’s early differentiation, and (2) accumulations of subducted oceanic crust on the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Previous geodynamical calculations often show that stable thermochemical piles caused by primordial material have sharp boundaries. So, if the accumulation of subducted oceanic crust has different morphology than that of piles caused by primordial material, we may be able to constrain the origin of compositional heterogeneity from high resolution seismic observations of the boundaries of LLSVPs.\nHere, we performed geodynamic calculations to investigate the morphology of accumulation of subducted oceanic crust on the CMB. We found that the ability of subducted oceanic crust to accumulate on the CMB and the sharpness of the boundaries of the accumulations both strongly depends on the crustal thickness. A thick (e.g., ~30 km) oceanic crust produced from the early hot mantle can form into large-scale accumulations on the CMB, but with fuzzy and diffuse top boundaries. However, as the oceanic crust becomes thinner, it becomes more difficult to accumulate on the CMB, and the top boundaries of the accumulations of subducted oceanic crust also gradually become sharp, more like that of piles caused by primordial material. Thus, a sharp top boundaries of LLSVPs in the present-day Earth does not guarantee that they are caused by piles of primordial material. In addition, as the oceanic crust becomes thinner, more subducted oceanic crust is entrained and recycled to shallow depth, which may have important implications for geochemical observations on Earth’s surface.",

Through studying the changing history of oil-water contact, we can better restore petroleum accumulation process and analyze oil distribution pattern.\nBased on reservoir geochemistry theory and drilling and logging data, grains with oil inclusion was analyzed, and oil-bearing property, organic extracts and biomarkers was used to determine the present and paleo-oil water contact of Shahejie formation in BZ25-1 oilfield. It suggested that the paleo and present oil-water contact in Shahejie formation locates in different depth, and that Shahejie formation has gone through three petroleum charging stages and has also undergone reservoir adjustment. The POWC(paleo-oil-water contact) of E2S2 reservoirs in BZ25-1-5 well and E2S2 reservoirs in BZ25-1-3 well is lower than OWC(present oil-water contact) at least for 9m and at most for 400m, but the POWC of E2S3 reservoirs in BZ25-1-5 well is higher than OWC at least for 20m and at most for 27.5m.\nThe petroleum accumulation process and the reason for oil-water contact adjustment were studied based on burial history, petroleum generation history, fault re-activation rate and petroleum charging history. It suggested that the three petroleum charging stages are Mid-Miocene(11.5Ma), Late Miocene-Pliocene(6.5-3.5Ma) and Quaternary(2.5Ma-present), among which the second~third charging episode is seen as the major petroleum accumulation stage. The re-activeted faults in several different periods not only served as preferential path for petroleum vertical migration, but also caused petroleum leakage through faults. The petroleum leakage mainly occurred in Neo-tectonic movement period(after 3.5Ma), during which petroleum vertically leaked through re-activated faults and migrated to shallow reservoirs or spilled over surface, meanwhile due to constant petroleum charging from active source rock, the present oil-water contact was formed.\nThe re-activeted faults during Neo-tectonic movement period and active source rock are seen as main reason for oil-water contact adjustment in Shahejie formation.",

            "abstract": "At the largest time and space scales, the pace of erosion and chemical weathering is determined by tectonic uplift rates. Deviations from this equilibrium condition arise from the transient response of landscape denudation to climatic and tectonic perturbations, and may be long lived. We posit that the constraint of mass balance, however, makes it unlikely that such disequilibrium persists at the global scale over millions of years, as has been proposed for late Cenozoic erosion. To support this contention, we synthesize existing data for weathering fluxes, global sedimentation rates, sediment yields and tectonic motions. The records show a remarkable constancy in the pace of Earth-surface evolution over the last 10 million years. These findings provide strong support for the null hypothesis; that global rates of landscape change have remained constant over the last ten million years, despite global climate change and massive mountain building events. Two important implications are: (1) global climate change may not change global denudation rates, because the nature and sign of landscape responses are varied; and (2) tectonic and climatic perturbations are accommodated in the long term by changes in landscape form. This work undermines the hypothesis that increased weathering due to late Cenozoic mountain building or climate change was the primary agent for a decrease in global temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the response of the rock mass to mining is of key importance for the planning of mine operations as well as assessing and mitigating the seismic risk. For decades, studies have shown that passive source tomography, also called local earthquake tomography, can provide information on the rock mass response through the estimation of the temporal variation and 3D distribution (spatio-temporal variations) of stress. The spatio-temporal resolution afforded by passive source tomography depends on the seismicity rate and the location of microseismic events. In a mine, seismicity is not stationary, i.e. the locus and rate of seismicity vary with time, thus limiting the spatio-temporal resolution of this technique. Recent developments in the field of ambient noise seismic interferometry (Green’s function retrieval from ambient noise) provide hints that continuous recordings of ambient vibrations collected around mines could be used to obtain information on the evolution and 3D distribution of the stress in the rock mass by providing measures of seismic travel times between pairs of sensors. In contrast to passive source tomography that relies on the distribution of seismic events, the resolution afforded by ambient noise interferometry tomography depends solely on the locations of sensors and the frequency content of the ambient noise. We present preliminary results which focus on the temporal stability of the estimated Green's functions, the effect of mine infrastructure on signal quality and preliminary methods to quantify stress changes in the rock mass. In addition, we present the adopted processing scheme built on the Apache Spark engine and demonstrate its effectiveness in parallelizing the computationally intensive cross-correlation routines.",

            "abstract": "Terraces cut into bedrock (strath) and sediment (fill-cut) offer key constraints on river evolution over millennial timescales, and are often interpreted to form during phases of increased river vertical incision driven by changes in climate or tectonics. Yet all actively meandering channels evolve their shapes through spatial and temporal changes in lateral erosion rates. Therefore, the sparsest requirement for a meandering river to generate terraces is that the intrinsically unsteady lateral erosion rate be coupled with relief generation by vertical incision, which need not be unsteady. In principle, this basic mechanism for terrace formation by meandering rivers should be possible in all fluvial environments, including for valleys with strath or fill-cut terraces, and may overprint signals from external drivers. We have used a numerical model of a vertically incising, meandering river to identify the age and geometric properties of autogenic terraces. Simulations indicate that autogenic terraces form with a recurrence timescale, set by the rate of relief generation, which may overlap with timescales for climate change. The autogenic terraces also have predictable geometries that can include slope proportional to the ratio of vertical incision rate to lateral erosion rate, pairing, and continuous along-valley extent. We compare these simulation results to data for terrace age and geometry from several well studied natural river valleys that span a wide range in terrace sizes and geometries, rock types, tectonic settings, incision rates, and hypothesized formation mechanisms. In cases, terrace age and geometric properties are consistent with formation by meandering with constant vertical incision rates. These similarities suggest that efforts to distinguish terraces that record signals from climatic and tectonic drivers are best focused on environments where terrace ages and geometries are far different than would be predicted by a constant vertical incision model.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying water and heat fluxes in the subsurface is crucial for managing water resources and for understanding the terrestrial ecosystem where hydrological properties drive a variety of biogeochemical processes across a large range of spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present the development of an advanced monitoring strategy where hydro-thermal-geophysical datasets are continuously acquired and further involved in a novel inverse modeling framework to estimate the hydraulic and thermal parameter that control heat and water dynamics in the subsurface and further influence surface processes such as evapotranspiration and vegetation growth. The measured and estimated soil properties are also used to investigate co-interaction between subsurface and surface dynamics by using above-ground aerial imaging. The value of this approach is demonstrated at two different sites, one in the polygonal shaped Arctic tundra where water and heat dynamics have a strong impact on freeze-thaw processes, vegetation and biogeochemical processes, and one in a floodplain along the Colorado River where hydrological fluxes between compartments of the system (surface, vadose zone and groundwater) drive biogeochemical transformations.\nResults show that the developed strategy using geophysical, point-scale and aerial measurements is successful to delineate the spatial distribution of hydrostratigraphic units having distinct physicochemical properties, to monitor and quantify in high resolution water and heat distribution and its linkage with vegetation, geomorphology and weather conditions, and to estimate hydraulic and thermal parameters for enhanced predictions of water and heat fluxes as well as evapotranspiration. Further, in the Colorado floodplain, results document the potential presence of only periodic infiltration pulses as a key hot moment controlling soil hydro and biogeochemical functioning. In the arctic, results show the strong linkage between soil water content, thermal parameters, thaw layer thickness and vegetation distribution. Overall, results of these efforts demonstrate the value of coupling various datasets at high spatial and temporal resolution to improve predictive understanding of subsurface and surface dynamics.",

            "abstract": "First airborne measurement using CHARM-F, the four-wavelengths lidar for simultaneous soundings of atmospheric CO2 and CH4, were performed in Spring 2015 onboard the German research aircraft HALO. The lidar is designed in the IPDA (integrated path differential absorption) configuration using short double pulses, which gives column averaged gas mixing ratios between aircraft and ground. HALO’s maximum flight altitude of 15 km and special features of the lidar, such as a relatively large laser ground spot, enable the CHARM-F system to be an airborne demonstrator for future spaceborne greenhouse gas lidars. Due to a high technological conformity this applies in particular to the French-German satellite mission MERLIN, the spaceborne methane IPDA lidar. The successfully completed flight measurements provide a valuable dataset, which supports the retrieval algorithm development for MERLIN notably. The flights covered different ground cover types, different orography types as well as the sea. Additionally, we captured different cloud conditions, at which the broken cloud case is a matter of particular interest. This dataset allows detailed analyses of measurement sensitivities, general studies on the IPDA principle and on technical details of the system. These activities are supported by another instrument onboard: a cavity ring down spectrometer, providing in-situ data of carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor with high accuracy and precision, which is ideal for validation purposes of the lidar. Additionally the onboard instrumentation of HALO gives information about pressure and temperature for cross-checking the ECMWF data, which are intended to be used for calculating the weighting function, the key quantity for the retrieval of gas column mixing ratios from the measured gas optical depths. In combination with dedicated descents into the boundary layer and subsequent ascents, a self-contained dataset for characterizations of CHARM-F is available.",

            "abstract": "At the interface of rivers and oceans, tidal freshwater zones (TFZs) stretch for tens to hundreds of kilometers but are rarely monitored for nitrogen export due to their complex hydrodynamics. Field observations from the TFZ of White Clay Creek (Delaware, USA) show that river discharge and nitrate export rates decrease during rising tide, while hyporheic storage increases. During falling tide, river discharge and nitrate export rates increase, while stored hyporheic water is released to the river. We estimate that 11% of river water exchanges through the hyporheic zone of this TFZ due to tidal pumping alone. We developed a one-dimensional, coupled fluid flow and solute transport model to quantify the influence of tidal pumping on nitrate removal in the riverbed. Tidal pumping promotes a deep, oscillating zone of aerobic respiration that limits denitrification near the sediment-water interface. As tide rises, groundwater residence times in shallow riverbed sediments increase, which causes a doubling of denitrification rates relative to falling tide. Given a uniform substrate along TFZs, removal rates of groundwater-borne nitrate should decrease as tidal amplitude increases downstream. Denitrification hot spots should occur in less permeable, organic-rich sediment under low tidal ranges. Because TFZs connect lowland nitrogen sources to the ocean, it is imperative that we expand monitoring efforts and elucidate their role in nitrogen export to the coast.",

            "abstract": "The melting of a winter snowpack will often include spatially and temporally variable infiltration across the soil-snow-interface prior to generating streamflow, groundwater recharge, or plant production. During spring snowmelt, moisture distribution is largely driven by hydraulic gradients under variably saturated conditions within the soil and snowpack. In complex mountainous terrain, the variable melt rates across the landscape due to slope, aspect, and landcover add further irregularities to this dynamic system. The aim of this research is gain insight into the distribution of water both within and below a melting snowpack during spring at Dry Lake Study Site near Steamboat Springs, Colorado. This site is a small (0.2 km2) subalpine watershed with a seasonally persistent snowpack each year. Intensive field surveys were conducted to collect snow water equivalent and soil moisture distribution during April and May of 2014 and 2015. Results show the variability in soil moisture consistent with similar studies, suggesting soil moisture distribution follows a similar trend as accumulation of snow depth in relation to topographic and canopy influences. The soil moisture on south facing hillslopes tended to be less than north facing slopes, with flat terrain holding near saturated conditions, particularly in locations with thick layers of organic matter. However, of notable interest is the distribution of snow water equivalent during melt. Early in the melt period at the base of some hillslopes snow water equivalent increased as locations directly upslope decreased suggesting movement of moisture within the snowpack during the transitional period from winter to spring. The hydraulic conductivity of snow has been shown to be greater than that of common soils, suggesting that the timing of water movement from a snowpack to stream will be shortened when considering the flow through the snow layers compared to shallow groundwater on hillslopes. These results have additional implications on the variability of driving hydraulic gradients for groundwater recharge and stream connectivity. This study displays the importance the snowpack as a layered porous medium for purposes of instrumenting, and developing conceptual models of headwater basins",

            "abstract": "Water age distributions can be used to address a number of environmental challenges, such as modeling the dynamics of river water quality, quantifying the interactions between shallow and deep flow systems and understanding nutrient loading persistence. Moreover, as the travel time of a water particle is the time available for biogeochemical reactions, it can be explicitly used to predict the concentration of non-conservative solutes, as e.g. those derived by mineral weathering. In recent years, many studies acknowledged the dynamic nature of streamflow age and linked it to observed variations in stream water quality. In this new framework, water stored within a catchment can be seen as a pool that is selectively “sampled” by streams and vegetation, determining the chemical composition of discharge and evapotranspiration. We present results from a controlled lysimeter experiment and real-world catchments, where the theoretical framework has been used to reproduce water quality datasets including conservative tracers (e.g. chloride and water stable isotopes) and weathering-derived solutes (like silicon and sodium). The approach proves useful to estimate the catchment water storage involved in solute mixing and sheds light on how solutes and water of different ages are selectively removed by vegetation and soil drainage.",

Following the declaration of Icelandic Volcanoes as a Permanent Geohazard Supersite in 2013, a considerable amount of SAR data was made available for both past and future satellite acquisitions, including new X-band images and historic C-band images. InSAR time series have been formed using these data and compared to other geodetic and microseismic measurements to determine the most likely processes responsible for recently observed deformation and/or seismicity. A comprehensive network of seismometers and continuous GPS stations are already deployed at these volcanoes and a series of campaign GPS measurements have been undertaken since 2010. We present an overview of the temporal variation in InSAR observations and these complementary field based measurements at Bárðarbunga and Tungnafellsjökull from 2014-2015 (covering the recent eruption at Holuhraun and contemporaneous slow collapse of the Bárðarbunga caldera), and Eyjafjallajökull and Katla volcanoes from 2010 onwards, after the 2010 explosive eruption of Eyjafjallajökull.\nWe undertake a joint InSAR-GPS inversion using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach. The best-fit source geometries responsible for both the inflation of a 50 km long dyke and simultaneous deflation of the Bárðarbunga central volcano during the 2014-2015 unrest and eruption are found. Using these we calculate the stress changes associated with the Bárðarbunga deformation events and compare our results to the location of earthquake swarms in the vicinity of neighbouring Tungnafellsjökull, where seismic activity increased significantly following the onset of unrest at Bárðarbunga in August 2014. We also determine the optimal source parameters for observed continued inflation at Eyjafjallajökull following the explosive 2010 eruption. During this time Katla volcano has shown small-scale deformation outside the Mýrdalsjökull ice-cap. We discuss this signal in relation to various contributions including glacial isostatic adjustment and magma migration.",

For the last decade, most information becomes digitized at some point. From moment of digitization, information can in principle be transferred losslessly. \nInformation about the physical world is often also stored, sometimes in compressed form, such as physical laws, concepts, or models of specific hydrological systems. It is important to note, however, that all information about a physical system eventually has to originate from observation (although inevitably coloured by some prior assumptions). This colouring makes the compression lossy, but is effectively the only way to make use of similarities in time and space that enable predictions while measuring only a a few macro-states of a complex hydrological system.\nAdding physical process knowledge to a hydrological model can thus be seen as a convenient way to transfer information from observations from a different time or place, to make predictions about another situation, assuming the same dynamics are at work.\nThe key challenge to achieve more certainty in hydrological prediction can therefore be formulated as a challenge to tap and channel information flows from the environment.\nFor tapping more information flows, new measurement techniques, large scale campaigns, historical data sets, and large sample hydrology and regionalization efforts can bring progress. For channelling the information flows with minimum loss, model calibration, and model formulation techniques should be critically investigated. Some experience from research in a Swiss high alpine catchment are used as an illustration.",

            "abstract": "Decades ago seismic tomography revealed peculiar patches known as the ultra-low-velocity zones (ULVZ), located just above the Earth's core-mantle boundary. Typically 5 to 40 km in height, and 100 km in lateral extent, the ULVZs are denser than the surrounding mantle by about 10%, and slower in shear and compressional wave velocities by roughly 30% and 10%, respectively. Elucidating the origin of ULVZs is a key issue in understanding mantle heterogeneity and unraveling the history of chemical differentiation in deep Earth. Existing models invoking partial melting of silicate lithology require specific solidus temperatures to produce isolated melt regions, and they may not be able to account for the large density excess.The scenarios involving iron-rich post-bridgmanite or ferropericlase have been questioned by recent theoretical results showing that iron enrichment in crystalline phases cannot simultaneously explain the observed density and velocity anomalies. Thus the nature of the ULVZs has remained enigmatic.\nHere we show that the eutectic melting curve of the iron-carbon binary system intersects with the present-day geotherm near the base of the Earth's mantle, suggesting the presence of metallic melt in the D\" layer. Using an established model for solid-liquid compositions and approximate values of density and elastic parameters, we found that introducing a suitable fraction of metallic melt could match all the seismic observations, and the fraction depends on the wetting behavior of the melt. We propose a number of alternative hypotheses for the origin of the ultra-low velocity zones, including short-lived ULVZs with metallic melt that are supplied by subducted slabs, long-lasting ULVZs involving both metallic and silicate melts, and ULVZs containing iron-rich solids and residual metallic melt. These hypotheses can be tested by future studies on surface tension, element partitioning, elastic properties, and dynamic modeling.",

            "abstract": "The heating of the solar wind from open-field regions in the corona is the subject of an ongoing body of work in the solar physics community. We present recent progress to understand the role of Alfvén-wave-driven turbulence in flux tubes open to the heliosphere. Our models use three-dimensional, time-dependent forms of the reduced magnetohydrodynamics equations to find the resulting properties of the solar wind. We use the BRAID model (van Ballegooijen et al., 2011) on open flux tubes that epitomize the most common magnetic structures in the corona: a polar coronal hole, an open flux tube on the boundary of an equatorial streamer, and one that neighbors a strong active region. Our results agree with prior work using the time-steady, one-dimensional ZEPHYR model (Cranmer et al., 2007; Woolsey and Cranmer, 2014). In addition, the time dependence in BRAID lets us explore the bursty, nanoflare-like nature of the heating in these flux tubes. We find that the transient heating can be captured into separate events with an average energy of 1022 erg, with a maximum energy of 1025 erg. The bursty heating lead us to pursue a better understanding of the physical processes responsible for the network jets seen in IRIS data (see e.g. Tian et al., 2014). We search for correlations between the supergranular magnetic field properties—using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager aboard SDO—and jet productivity to make better estimates of the mass and energy budget of these small-scale features and to find evidence of the mechanisms responsible for the network jets.",

Palladium is strongly enriched in the metal phases, and sulphide (troilite) is the primary sink for radiogenic silver. Closure of the system hence depends primarily on the transfer of Ag-107 from metal to troilite. Because cation diffusion in troilite is extremely rapid, Ag-107 transfer is likely to be controlled by diffusion through the metal. Sugiura and Hoshino (2003) estimated a closure temperature of ~1100 K for the Pd/Ag system in iron meteorites under the assumption that the diffusion rate of Ag in the metal is similar to that of Ni diffusion in taenite. Here we consider the problem in more detail, utilizing constraints on Ag diffusion in taenite and kamacite from the metallurgical literature to numerically model diffusive exchange between metal and troilite with simultaneous radiogenic ingrowth. The process is complicated by exsolution of the metal into bcc kamacite and fcc taenite phases during cooling. We will discuss approaches to the treatment of this issue and their influence on the derived closure temperatures.\nSugiura N., Hoshino H. (2003) Meteorit. Planet. Sci. 38, 117-143.",

            "abstract": "Gaining an understanding of methane (CH4) emission sources and atmospheric dispersion is an essential part of climate change research. Large-scale and global studies often rely on satellite observations of column CH4 mixing ratio whereas high-spatial resolution estimates rely on ground-based measurements. Extrapolation of ground-based measurements on, for example, rice paddies to broad region scales is highly uncertain because of spatio-temporal variability. We explore the use of ground-based river stage measurements and independent satellite observations of flooded area along with satellite measurements of CH4 mixing ratio to estimate the extent of methane emissions. Bangladesh, which comprises most of the Ganges Brahmaputra Meghna (GBM) delta, is a region of particular interest for studying spatio-temporal variation of methane emissions due to (1) broadscale rice cultivation and (2) seasonal flooding and atmospheric convection during the monsoon. Bangladesh and its deltaic landscape exhibit a broad range of environmental, economic, and social circumstances that are relevant to many nations in South and Southeast Asia. We explore the seasonal enhancement of CH4 in Bangladesh using passive remote sensing spectrometer CH4 products from the SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The seasonal variation of CH4 is compared to independent estimates of seasonal flooding from water gauge stations and space-based passive microwave water-to-land fractions from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TRMM-TMI). Annual cycles in inundation (natural and anthropogenic) and atmospheric CH4 concentrations show highly correlated seasonal signals. NOAA’s HYSPLIT model is used to determine atmospheric residence time of ground CH4 fluxes. Using the satellite observations, we can narrow the large uncertainty in extrapolation of ground-based CH4 emission estimates from rice paddies, allowing for country-wide upscaling of high spatial resolution data. This approach allows for better informed carbon cycling modeling for the GBM delta and is applicable to other regions.",

            "abstract": "Subduction is an essentially multi-scale process with time-scales spanning from geological to earthquake scale with the seismic cycle in-between. Modelling of such process constitutes one of the largest challenges in geodynamic modelling today.\nHere we present a cross-scale thermomechanical model capable of simulating the entire subduction process from rupture (1 min) to geological time (millions of years) that employs elasticity, mineral-physics-constrained non-linear transient viscous rheology and rate-and-state friction plasticity. The model generates spontaneous earthquake sequences. The adaptive time-step algorithm recognizes moment of instability and drops the integration time step to its minimum value of 40 sec during the earthquake. The time step is then gradually increased to its maximal value of 5 yr, following decreasing displacement rates during the postseismic relaxation. Efficient implementation of numerical techniques allows long-term simulations with total time of millions of years. This technique allows to follow in details deformation process during the entire seismic cycle and multiple seismic cycles.\nWe observe various deformation patterns during modelled seismic cycle that are consistent with surface GPS observations and demonstrate that, contrary to the conventional ideas, the postseismic deformation may be controlled by viscoelastic relaxation in the mantle wedge, starting within only a few hours after the great (M>9) earthquakes. Interestingly, in our model an average slip velocity at the fault closely follows hyperbolic decay law. In natural observations, such deformation is interpreted as an afterslip, while in our model it is caused by the viscoelastic relaxation of mantle wedge with viscosity strongly varying with time. We demonstrate that our results are consistent with the postseismic surface displacement after the Great Tohoku Earthquake for the day-to-year time range. We will also present results of the modeling of deformation of the upper plate during multiple earthquake cycles at times of hundred thousand and million years and discuss effect of great earthquakes in changing long-term stress field in the upper plate.

            "abstract": "NASA has identified a major need to develop long-term, consistent products valid across multiple missions, with well-defined uncertainty statistics addressing specific Earth science questions. These types of data sets are termed Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) and are defined as long-term, well calibrated and validated data records for Earth Science research. Land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) data have been identified as an important ESDR by NASA and many other international organizations, e.g. GCOS. LST&E data are essential for a wide variety of surface-atmosphere studies, from calculating the evapotranspiration of plant canopies to retrieving atmospheric water vapor. LST&E products are currently generated from sensors in low Earth orbit (LEO) such as the NASA-EOS MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua satellites as well as from sensors in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) such as GOES. Sensors in LEO orbits provide global coverage at moderate spatial resolutions (~1-km) but more limited temporal coverage (twice-daily), while sensors in GEO orbits provide more frequent measurements (hourly) at lower spatial resolutions (~3-4 km) over a geographically restricted area. LST&E products from these instruments are currently produced using different emissivities, atmospheric correction, and algorithmic approaches, and usually do not include a full set of uncertainty metrics. NASA has recognized this general lack of consistency between science products and has identified the need to develop long-term, consistent, and calibrated data and products that are valid across multiple missions and satellite sensors. We address this problem by generating three self-consistent LST&E ESDRs from 2000-2018 with well defined uncertainties; 1) a unified global LEO LST-ESDR at 1-km spatial resolution and resampled to daily, 8-day and monthly; 2) a unified N. and S. America GEO LST-ESDR at 5-km spatial resolution and resampled to hourly temporal resolution; 3) a unified global Emissivity-ESDR at 5-km spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution.

During the ODEMAR’13 cruise, the fully developed 13º20’N and 13º30’N oceanic core complexes (OCC) along MAR were investigated to constrain the tectonic, hydrothermal and magmatic processes enabling detachment formation. Here we focus on the composition and fluxes of hydrothermal fluids discharging out of these OCCs.\n ROV Victor6000 dives confirmed the occurrence of active discharge near the breakaway side of the 13º30’N OCC (Semenov-2), and observed high-temperature venting on the striated fault surface of the 13º20’N OCC (Irinovskoe). Black smoker fluids and hydrothermal plume waters (2-110ºC) were collected using gas-tight titanium syringes and in-situ pumping fluid samplers mounted on the ROV, respectively. The Semenov-2 fluids (3 vent sites at 317ºC) are characterized by lower chlorinity than seawater (Cl = 525 mmol/l) and extremely low metal concentrations (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn < ~20 μmol/l). By contrast, the Irinovskoe fluids (2 vent sites at 364ºC) exhibit higher chlorinity than seawater at Cl = 605 mmol/l, high Fe and Mn concentrations, and yet low metal concentrations.\nTemperature and concentration of conservative species were also measured along the centerlines of selected plumes within the first ~3 m above the vents. These measurements were inverted to constrain vent heat and mass fluxes using a plume entrainment model, yielding for individual plumes values of ~1-95 MW and 1-60 10-3 m3/s, respectively. We use these to calculate annual filterable iron fluxes at both sites of the 13º20’N OCC of 2.6 – 3.9 106 mol/yr, which are 4 orders of magnitude higher than those calculated for the 13º30’N OCC. We estimate, however, that ~94% of this Fe flux is lost through precipitation when rising hydrothermal fluids mix with entrained seawater.",

            "abstract": "Olivine-hosted melt inclusions (MIs) provide unique insights into physico-chemical conditions of magma at depth. MIs are often rehomogenized in laboratory to bring them back (or close) to the original state. At homogenization temperature (Th), the last bubble disappears and MI becomes a homogeneous liquid phase. However, during 1-atm experiments in heating stages, homogenization is usually achieved at Th higher than expected entrapment T and systematic increase of Th with time is observed. This reveals occurrence of physico-chemical processes that irreversibly lower internal pressure (Pint) (relative to entrapment P) during magma ascent and laboratory treatments.\nWe combined theoretical modeling with experimental observations on H2O-poor and H2O–rich basaltic MIs in order to: a) identify the reversible (olivine elastic deformation and olivine dissolution-crystallization on MI walls) and irreversible (water loss from MIs and olivine plastic deformation) processes responsible for evolution of MI volume, Pint and composition upon heating, and b) examine how these processes affect the results of typical homogenization experiments. Due to Pint drop caused by olivine elastic deformation, performing experiments at 1 atm prevents achievement of homogenization at Th equal to entrapment T. Predicted increase of Th ranges from some to tens of degrees depending on entrapment conditions, melt composition and volatile contents. Presence of a gas bubble must be considered for the correct prediction of P-volume evolution. In H2O-rich MIs, faster increase of Th with time shown by small MIs is consistent with increase of Th mainly driven by water loss. In H2O-poor MIs, occurrence of olivine elastoplastic deformation is mainly responsible for the increase of Th with time. Distance from MI wall to olivine rim is a critical parameter to take into account, as short distances enhance depressurization related with both elastoplastic deformation and water loss and contribute to increase Th.",

            "abstract": "Stable isotopes of water have been used to gain process-level understand of mixing, storage, and transport in all components of the hydrological cycle. Canopy interception processes remain some of the least understood because of the relatively small storage pool, rapid turnover, and variability at short intervals relative to, for example, soils. Stable isotopes provide a look into the ‘black box’ of canopy processes that control interception storage and throughfall generation. Several recent studies have compared throughfall isotopic composition to open rainfall; canopy effects vary in direction and magnitude but are ubiquitous. We present findings from three studies using isotopes of throughfall. In all cases, common patterns and persistence of patterns in variability of throughfall amount (e.g., correlation with canopy characteristics, correlations with precipitation characteristics, and geostatistical relationships) were infrequently apparent for isotopic composition. Data consistently support the so called ‘selection’ effect, that throughfall composition is a product of spatially and temporally varying transmission of rainfall that has temporally varying isotopic composition. There is little evidence of isotopic fractionation by wet-canopy evaporation. Additionally, isotopic composition of storm-total throughfall is generally less variable than is amount or solute content, suggesting two possibilities: (1) high spatial homogeneity in the selection effect, or (2) rapid exchange and equilibration of droplets with vapor in the canopy airspace, lending support to the hypothesized role of splash droplet evaporation. These results suggest a need to re-examine conceptual models of the progression from interception to evaporation and throughfall generation.",

            "abstract": "Climatic change in the 20th century is directly and indirectly observable in multiple aspects of the climate system. Some of these changes, such as global mean surface temperature, are widely studied and understood, while others, such as global mean sea-level change (GMSL), remain uncertain. Until the mid-1990s, with the advent of satellite altimeter observations of a significant percentage of the global ocean, point observations of global sea-level change through tide gauges were the primary means of monitoring the changing height of the sea surface relative to the sea floor. Traditionally, there have been two approaches for estimating GMSL from these temporally and spatially sparse tide gauge records. The first approach uses such records to obtain a global mean value by computing and summing representative regional averages through time (e.g., Jevrejeva et al., GRL, 2008). The second approach uses the dominant spatial patterns of sea surface heights from 20 years of satellite altimetry data to interpolate between tide gauge records to reconstruct global sea level over the century (e.g., Church and White, Surv. Geophys., 2011). However, the GMSL estimates obtained using these two methods differ by ~0.5 mm/yr from the mean global rate achieved by summing the data- and model-derived estimates of the underlying contributions (e.g., thermal expansion, mass flux from land ice, etc.) (IPCC, 2014). Here we describe a third approach that estimates GMSL using two probabilistic approaches based on fingerprinting the underlying source contributions from the spatiotemporal patterns of sea-level change captured by the tide gauge records (Hay et al., Nature, 2015). Our revised GMSL rate estimate of 1.2 ± 0.2 mm/yr over 1901-1990 closes the sea-level budget and maintains a good fit with the tide gauge record over the 20th century.",

Understanding these sources of spatial and temporal variability is critical to estimating past and present sea-level change and projecting future sea-level rise. Using two probabilistic techniques, a multi-model Kalman smoother and Gaussian process regression, we have reanalyzed 20th century tide gauge observations to produce a new estimate of global mean sea level (GMSL). Our methods allow us to extract global information from the sparse tide gauge field by taking advantage of the physics-based and model-derived geometry of the contributing processes. Both methods provide constraints on the sea-level contribution of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). The Kalman smoother tests multiple discrete models of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), probabilistically computing the most likely GIA model given the observations, while the Gaussian process regression characterizes the prior covariance structure of a suite of GIA models and then uses this structure to estimate the posterior distribution of local rates of GIA-induced sea-level change. We present the two methodologies, the model-derived geometries of the underlying processes, and our new probabilistic estimates of GMSL and GIA.",

The interaction is unique in the solar system, in some ways intermediate between the mass loading interactions of comets and ionospheric interactions of massive planets, and in other ways different from both of these more common extremes. Little mass loading was observed until quite close to Pluto and the solar wind was excluded from a region filled with heavy ions from Pluto’s escaping atmosphere that extended well behind it.

            "abstract": "The earliest signals of a climate change are expected to be observed in the polar regions in part because of the high reflectively of snow and ice. Because of general inaccessibility, there is a paucity of in situ data and hence the need to use satellite data to observe the large-scale variability and trends in surface temperature in the two regions. The sensor with the longest satellite record on temperature has been the NOAA/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) that has provided continuous thermal infrared data for more than 33 years. The results of analysis of the data show that there is indeed a strong signal coming from the Arctic with the trend in surface temperature (for the region > 64°N) being 0.6°C per decade which is about 3 times the global trend of 0.2°C per decade for the same period. It appeared surprising when the results from a similar region (> 64 °S) in the Antarctic show a much lower trend and comparable to the global trend. The primary source of error in the temperature data is cloud masking associated with the similar signatures of clouds and snow/ice covered surfaces. However, the derived AVHRR data show good consistency with in situ data with standard deviation less than 1°C. The AVHRR time series has also been compared and showed compatibility with data from the Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) which have been available from 2000 to the present. Some differences in the trends from the two hemispheres are expected because of very different geographical environments in the two regions. The relationships of the trend with the atmospheric global circulation in the north, as defined by the Northern Annular Mode (NAM), and that in the south, as defined by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), have been observed to be generally weak. The occurrences of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW) and ENSO were also studied and not considered a significant factor. It is intriguing that the observed variability in surface temperature in the two hemispheres are highly correlated with the variability of the sea ice cover which also shows a strong climate signal in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is a principle efflux from flooded swamps. However, for many reasons (e.g., difficulties in measuring across small gradients), controls over ET in wetlands, and swamps particularly, remain unclear. We investigate how the interaction of vegetation and hydrology controls ET and energy partitioning in flooded forests in three different hydrologic landscapes of the southeastern USA: mesohaline coastal shrub forest, floodplain hardwood forest, and backswamp baldcypress-tupelo forest. Energy components were measured by eddy covariance, sapflow, Bowen ratio energy balance, and evaporation pan to partition canopy transpiration, understory transpiration, and evaporation from floodwaters. Together, we found the energy balances of forested wetlands often differed from that of terrestrial systems, because of the potentially substantial role of evaporation from the free water surface, and flood / salinity stress inhibiting transpiration. Highest ET rates were observed in the coastal shrub forest in flooded conditions, when saline water levels dropped below the root zone (on hummocks) with concurrent lateral advection of dry air. The other two sites behaved similar to terrestrial systems, with increasing transpiration during periosd of greater water availability, although with radiation transmitted to the understory mostly partitioned to latent heat which partially compensated for the variability in canopy transpiration. Identifying these differential controls over ET is critical to understanding long-term trajectory of these systems. Many wetlands of the southeastern US have been impounded and disconnected, necessitating some degree of balance between ET and precipitation for sustainability. The positive feedbacks between ET and water levels in the coastal system suggest lower ecosystem resilience than the other two systems that showed negative feedbacks between ET and water levels.",

Previously, with seasonal TerraSAR-X satellite measurements of marine-terminating glaciers across the western and southeastern coasts, we identified three dominant and distinct seasonal velocity patterns. Two patterns likely indicate differences in the development of the subglacial hydrologic system, one suggesting development of efficient subglacial drainage during the summer melt season and the other without. Using this framework, we are now taking advantage of a new velocity record we created from Landsat 8 OLI imagery, which allows for better sampling across space and time, to examine local and regional variations in ice sheet surface velocity. Readily measurable, ice velocity holds strong potential as a proxy for understanding changes in subglacial hydrology, which is much more difficult to observe. We investigate seasonal velocity behavior from glacier termini toward the ice sheet interior and among separate glacier systems across the Greenland Ice Sheet as a way to understand changes in ice motion and ice sheet hydrology.",

Undergraduate students, including geoscience majors in upper-level courses, bring a wide range of spatial skill levels to the classroom. Students with weak spatial skills may struggle to understand fundamental concepts and to solve geological problems with a spatial component. However, spatial thinking skills are malleable. Using strategies that have emerged from cognitive science research, we developed a set of curricular materials that improve undergraduate geology majors’ abilities to reason about 3D concepts and to solve spatially complex geological problems.\nCognitive science research on spatial thinking demonstrates that predictive sketching, making visual comparisons, gesturing, and the use of analogy can be used to develop students’ spatial thinking skills. We conducted a three-year study of the efficacy of these strategies in strengthening the spatial skills of students in core geology courses at three universities. Our methodology is a quasi-experimental quantitative design, utilizing pre- and post-tests of spatial thinking skills, assessments of spatial problem-solving skills, and a control group comprised of students not exposed to our new curricular materials. Students taught using the new curricular materials show improvement in spatial thinking skills. Further analysis of our data, to be completed prior to AGU, will answer additional questions about the relationship between spatial skills and academic performance, spatial skills and gender, spatial skills and confidence, and the impact of our curricular materials on students who are struggling academically.\nTeaching spatial thinking in the context of discipline-based exercises has the potential to transform undergraduate education in the geological sciences by removing one significant barrier to success.",

            "abstract": "The routing of water through periglacial landscapes is closely connected to the presence of permafrost, and freezing and thawing processes. To predict responses in the landscape to climate driven changes, we need to better understand the present day hydrology. The present hydrological processes, and the uncertainties in the data used to describe them, must be investigated and understood before we can develop models describing possible future conditions. In this work we have studied the hydrology of a catchment in the Kangerlussuaq region, Greenland. Johansson et al. (2015) presented a hydrological model of the catchment based on a new hydrological and meteorological data set from the catchment area. The present water balance was quantified, and the spatial and seasonal dynamics of the main hydrological fluxes were presented. It was shown that the model was able to reproduce the measured lake level dynamics and the measured components of the water balance. Based on this work we have used the numerical model to investigate the sensitivity in hydrological responses to different meteorological, geological and geometrical model input data. The aim with this study is to investigate the importance of the use of local data, but also to highlight the importance of present day site understanding when developing and applying the model for predicting responses to a changing climate. The results show that the site specific model is highly sensitive to the meteorological input data. Driving the model with precipitation data from a meteorological station only 30 km away from the catchment instead of local data from the studied catchment, or using local precipitation data not corrected for wind and adhesion losses, resulted in large discrepancies between measured and calculated lake levels.

            "abstract": "In the past 20 years, we developed several generations of global mantle shear velocity models based entirely on time domain waveform inversion. This implies computations of synthetics in 3D earth models. Initially, the method of choice relied on normal mode perturbation theory, within which we built the framework of our inversion methodology. The latter includes, among others, windowing of waveforms to bring out contribution of weak amplitude phases, (e,g, Sdiff), and a fast converging quasi-Newton inversion with an approximate Hessian calculated using non-linear asymptotic coupling theory (NACT, Li and Romanowicz, 1995).\nRecently, the Spectral Element Method (SEM) was introduced in global seismology as a powerful numerical method to compute the seismic wavefield accurately in arbitrary 3D models (Komatitsch and Vilotte, 1998; Komatitsch and Tromp, 2002). Implementing the numerical SEM synthetics was straightforward, albeit with significantly increased cost of computation. In order to advance mantle imaging at the global scale, we introduced computational efficiencies, such as (1) substituting a fine layered crustal model by an equivalent, smooth, \"homogeneized\" crust designed to fit a global surface wave dispersion dataset, (2) continuing quasi-Newton inversion using NACT rather than adjoints, which involved the development of an efficient matrix assembly method (French et al., 2015), and (3) stepping progressively from long to short periods. The resulting models (Lekic and Romanowicz, 2011; French et al., 2013; French and Romanowicz, 2014), in particular, confirm the presence of deep mantle plumes beneath many major hotspots (French and Romanowicz, 2015). We discuss the choice of inverse approach, and illustrate the stability of our global models, in view of the use of NACT kernels, with respect to the choice of the starting model.\nGlobal inversion remains a challenge as higher resolution implies reaching higher frequencies to capture more of the scattered wavefield produced by dynamically relevant features. Continuing to develop efficiencies while progressively improving images, recently, we have extended our approach to focus on a particular region of the deep mantle, while minimizing the number of global simulations (Masson et al., 2014). We illustrate applications of this approach.",

            "abstract": "The existence of mantle plumes as a possible origin for hotspots has been the subject of debate for the last 30 years. Many seismic tomographic studies have hinted at the presence of plume-like features in the lower mantle, but resolution of narrow low velocity features is difficult, and ambiguity remains as to the vertical continuity of these features and how distinct they are from other low velocity blobs.\nWe present robust evidence for significant, vertically continuous, low velocity columns in the lower mantle beneath prominent hotspots located within the footprint of the large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs), from a recent global, radially anisotropic whole mantle shear-wave velocity (Vs) model, SEMUCB-WM1 (French and Romanowicz, 2014, 2015). This model was constructed by inversion of a large dataset of long period three-component seismograms down to 32s period. Because it includes surface-wave overtones, S-diffracted waves and multiply reflected waves between the surface and the CMB, this dataset provides considerably better illumination of the whole mantle volume than can be obtained with a standard set of travel times alone. In addition, accurate numerical computation of the forward wavefield using the spectral element method at each iteration of the model construction, allows us to better resolve regions of lower than average Vs.\nThe imaged plumes have several common characteristics: they are rooted in patches of very low Vs near the core mantle boundary, some of which contain documented ULVZs, and extend vertically through the lower mantle up to ~1000 km depth, where some are deflected horizontally, or give rise to somewhat thinner conduits that meander through the upper mantle in the vicinity of the target hotpots. Combined with evidence for slab stagnation at ~1000 km depth, this suggests a change in rheology between 660 and 1000 km depth, very high viscosity throughout the bulk of the lower mantle, and lower viscosity plumes, only mildly deflected by secondary scale flow in the upper mantle. The lower mantle plume conduits must be at least 500-600 km wide: their morphology resembles that of thermo-chemical plumes rooted in a denser than average basal layer. No such fat plumes are found under hotspots located above the ring of fast velocities surrounding the LLSVPs.",

            "abstract": "Recognition of the importance of rhizosphere interactions to ecosystem processes has led to efforts to integrate these dynamics into a conceptual framework that can be tested, refined and applied across spatial scales. A new view suggests that a plant’s mycorrhizal association represents a “trait integrator” for a suite of aboveground and belowground functional traits involved in coupling C-nutrient cycles, since nearly all plants associate with a single type of mycorrhizal fungi. The MANE framework predicts that tree species that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi differ from trees that associate with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi in a suite of functional traits, and that such differences contribute to unique “biogeochemical syndromes” in forests with varying abundances of AM- and ECM-associated trees.\nTo date, we have found that relative to AM trees, the leaf litter of ECM trees decomposes nearly 50% more slowly; as such, the nutrient economy of ECM-dominated stands is driven by organic forms of N and P whereas the nutrient economy of AM-dominated stands in driven by inorganic forms of N and P. Moreover, differences in the nutrient economies between AM- and ECM-dominated stands can affect the carbon (C) cost of nutrient acquisition. For example, while ECM trees allocate 2-3-fold more C to fine roots and mycorrhizal fungi, this greater investment results in the enhanced activity of enzymes that mobilize nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from soil organic matter, and ultimately the greater uptake of nutrients by plants. However, this enhanced uptake by ECM trees comes at a cost to soil organic C, which declines as a function of root-accelerated N mineralization.\nBy incorporating these dynamics into a coupled nutrient acquisition-microbial decomposition model, and scaling these processes following development of a map of mycorrhizal associations, we are now quantifying how belowground processes shape ecosystem sensitivity to global changes (e.g., rising CO2, warming) at regional- and continental-scales.",

            "abstract": "The concept of loss and damage (L&D), the residual adverse impacts of climate change beyond what can be addressed by adaptation, has featured as a central component of recent discussions on international climate policy, most notably in negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. However, it remains unclear what sort of scientific evidence will be required to inform L&D activities, including with respect to issues of responsibility, liability, compensation, and financing. Possible types of scientific evidence include simple observation of the occurrence of weather-related disaster, understanding of causation and the role of anthropogenic emissions, and the comparison of understanding of causation versus observations of long-term trends through detection and attribution (D&A) analysis.\nIn this presentation we will discuss these questions in detail and consider the implications. If L&D policy leans towards a compensation rationale, then it will likely require the most comprehensive form of evidence of the role of anthropogenic emissions in observed L&D, in other words D&A analysis. However, this has restrictive requirements, for instance in the retrospective availability of long-term monitoring, that may be prohibitive in many situations. Unfortunately, conditions that lead to a dearth of sustained long-term monitoring often also lead to greater vulnerability and exposure, and are thus exactly the conditions that L&D activities are intended to address. On the other hand, if L&D activities are motivated as a mechanism for supporting adaptation they may not necessarily require D&A evidence, but can nevertheless benefit from the confirmation and calibration that D&A provides. Thus, even if L&D policy is not focused on compensation, building resources and capacity in long-term monitoring and its analysis remains a priority.",

            "abstract": "The Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite carries five instruments on board including ATMS, CrIS, VIIRS, OMPS and CERES. During the SNPP intensive calval, ATMS was pitched over to observe the cold space radiation. This unique data set was used for diagnostics of the ATMS scan-angle dependent bias and a scan-to-scan variation. A new algorithm is proposed to correct the ATMS scan angle dependent bias related to the reflector emission. ATMS radiometric calibration is also revised in IDPS with the full radiance processing (FRP). CrIS is the first Fourier transform Michelson interferometer and measures three infrared spectral bands from 650 to 1095, 1210 to 1750 and 2155 to 2550 cm-1 with spectral resolutions of 0.625 cm-1, respectively. Its spectral calibration is with an accuracy of better than 2 ppm and its noise is also well characterized with the Allan variance. Since CrIS was switched to the transmission of full spectral resolution (FSR) of RDR data to the ground in January 2015. The CrIS FSR SDR data are also produced offline at NOAA STAR. VIIRS has 22 spectral bands covering the spectrum between 0.412 μm and 12.01 μm, including 16 moderate resolution bands (M-bands) with a spatial resolution of 750 m at nadir, five imaging resolution bands (I-bands) with a spatial resolution of 375 m at nadir, and one day-night band (DNB) with a nearly-constant 750 m spatial resolution throughout the scan. The calibration of VIIRS reflective solar bands (RSB) requires a solar diffuser (SD) and a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM). Using the SNPP yaw maneuver data, SDSM screen transmission function can be updated to better capture the fine structures of the vignetting function. For OMPS nadir mapper (NM) and nadir profiler (NP), the detector signal-to-noise ratio, and sensor signal-to-noise ratio meet the system requirement. Detector gain and bias performance trends are generally stable. System linearity performance is stable and highly consistent with the prelaunch values. The recent updates on OMPS wavelength, solar flux and radiance coefficients have resulted in viewing angle dependent bias in the earth view observations. OMPS dark currents are updated weekly and monitored for further improving the radiometric calibration.",

Unsaturated-zone processes are notoriously difficult to quantify; soils and rocks are visually opaque, spatially variable in the extreme, and easily disturbed by instrument installation. Thus there is great value in noninvasive techniques that produce water-related data of high density in space and time. Methods based on resistivity and electromagnetic waves have already produced significant new understanding of percolation processes, root-zone water retention, influences of evapotranspiration on soil-water, and effects of preferential flow. Further developments are underway for such purposes as noninvasive application to greater depths, increased resolution, adaptation for lab-scale experiments, and calibration in heterogeneous media. Beyond these, however, there is need for a stronger marriage of hydrologic and geophysical knowledge and perspective. Possible means to greater and faster progress include:\nApply the latest hydrologic understanding, both pore-scale and macroscopic, to the detection of preferential flow paths and their degree of activation.\nIn the continuing advancement of hardware and techniques, draw creatively from developments in such fields as high-energy physics, medical imaging, astrogeology, high-tech semiconductors, and bioinstrumentation.\nSidestep the imaging process where possible to measure essential properties and fluxes more directly.\nPose questions that have a strong end-use character, like “how does storm intensity relate to aquifer recharge rate” rather than “what is the shape of the wetting front”. \nThe greatest advances in geophysical investigation of the unsaturated zone will come from methods informed by the latest understanding of unsaturated systems and processes, and aimed as directly as possible at the answers to important hydrologic questions.",

            "abstract": "We present recent developments in time-resolved Raman spectroscopy for in situ planetary surface exploration, aimed at identification of both minerals and organics. Raman is a non-destructive surface technique that requires no sample preparation. Raman spectra are highly material specific and can be used for identification of a wide range of unknown samples. In combination with micro-scale imaging and point mapping, Raman spectroscopy can be used to directly interrogate rocks and regolith materials, while placing compositional analyses within a microtextural context, essential for understanding surface evolutionary pathways. Due to these unique capabilities, Raman spectroscopy is of great interest for the exploration of all rocky and icy bodies, for example Mars, Venus, the Moon, Mars’ moons, asteroids, comets, Europa, and Titan.\nIn this work, we focus on overcoming one of the most difficult challenges faced in Raman spectroscopy: interference from background fluorescence of the very minerals and organics that we wish to characterize. To tackle this problem we use time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, which separates the Raman from background processes in the time domain. This same technique also enables operation in daylight without the need for light shielding. Two key components are essential for the success of this technique: a fast solid-state detector and a short-pulse laser. Our detector is a custom developed Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) array, capable of sub-ns time-gating. Our pulsed lasers are solid-state miniature pulsed microchip lasers. We discuss optimization of laser and detector parameters for our application. We then present Raman spectra of particularly challenging planetary analog samples to demonstrate the unique capabilities of this time-resolved Raman instrument, for example, Mars-analog clays and Titan-analog organics.\nThe research described here was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).",

They hold a critical position in the source-to-sink routing of sediments and are thus particularly sensitive to changes in the erosion-deposition dynamics through tectonic and/or climatic forcing. The Mio-Pliocene Lannemezan megafan (SW France) is the most prominent feature of the Northern Pyrenean foreland and was abandoned and incised at some point in the Quaternary. However, neither the precise age of megafan abandonment nor its driving mechanism within a stable post-orogenic context has been elucidated, and either tectonic, climatic or base-level controls have been proposed. We report new cosmogenic exposure ages for the abandonment of the surface of the megafan as well as for a series of alluvial terraces produced during the incision. We show that the modern morphology of the foreland was acquired only recently, as the abandonment of the megafan happened at 253 ± 28 ky to 288 ± 12 ky, much later than what was previously assumed (Early Pleistocene). The subsequent incision of the megafan appears to have been strongly influenced by glacial/interglacial cycles, as terrace abandonment ages correlate to the MIS7, MIS5 and post-LGM cold-to-warm transitions. Geomorphic analysis of the stream network reveals that the river profile concavity increased through time and shows no indications for systematic knickpoint generation or retreat, as expected if the river network responds to active tectonics or base-level change, respectively. We do evidence river network reorganizations through river captures using chi proxy (χ) analysis.

This study evaluates their structure observationally in all three oceans using new high vertical resolution Argo float conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instrument profiles from 2010--2014 augmented with historical shipboard CTD from 1972--2014 and lower vertical resolution Argo float profiles from 2007--2014. Vertical strain of density is calculated from the profiles and analyzed in a stretched vertical coordinate system determined from the mean vertical density structure. The power spectra of vertical strain in each basin are analyzed using a wavelet decomposition. In the Indian and Pacific oceans, there are two distinct peaks in the power spectra, one Kelvin-wave-like and the other entirely consistent with the dispersion relation of a linear first-meridional-mode equatorial Rossby wave. In the Atlantic Ocean, the first-meridional-mode Rossby wave signature is very strong, and dominates. In all three ocean basins Rossby-wave-like signatures are coherent across the basin width, and appear to have wavelengths the scale of the basin width, with periods of about 5 years in the Indian and Atlantic oceans and about 12 years in the Pacific Ocean. Their observed meridional scales are about 1.5 times the linear theoretical values. Their phase propagation is downward with time, implying upward energy propagation if linear wave dynamics hold.",

            "abstract": "Despite evidence that streams and rivers contribute immensely to the atmospheric methane budget (~26 Tg CH4 yr-1), very little is known regarding the spatial patterns and controls of methane concentrations in river networks. We present a dataset of high-resolution methane concentrations along a nearly complete river flowpath starting with a small headwater stream (8 km), two larger tributaries (50 and 80 km reaches), as well as the complete length of the upper Mississippi River (1300 km). These systems span from 1st to 9th order and range in discharge from 5 cfs to > 400,000 cfs. Continuous measurements were collected from a moving boat using a flow-through sampling system with cavity ring-down spectroscopy of gas equilibrated water. River methane concentrations ranged from near saturation to > 5 uM with all samples being above atmospheric equilibrium. The extent of methane spatial autocorrelation generally increased with increasing river size (semivariance range = 800, 4000 and 12,000 m), although the largest tributary reach did not exhibit clear spatial autocorrelation structure. Further, all river sections exhibited significant spatial clustering of methane concentrations (Global Moran’s I) and significant hotspots and coldspots of methane (local Moran’s I) associated with changes in benthic geomorphology. Hotspot examples included high methane clusters in organic-rich stream sediments and productive backwaters in the mainstem of the Mississippi River. Incubated anoxic stream sediments illustrated similar patterns, where organic-rich sediments produced substantially greater methane over 24 hours relative to organic-poor substrates. Quantitative PCR analysis of the methanogen gene mcrA also supports the contention that methane is produced at greatest rates in organic-rich stream sediments. Together, our high resolution spatial data and ancillary ecosystem data suggest that river methane is mostly controlled by local sediment processes which become more spatially homogeneous with increasing stream order.",

            "abstract": "Geoscience Architecture for Research (GEAR) is approaching EarthCube design as a complex and evolving socio-technical federation of systems. EarthCube is intended to support the science research enterprise, for which there is no centralized command and control, requirements are a moving target, the function and behavior of the system must evolve and adapt as new scientific paradigms emerge, and system participants are conducting research that inherently implies seeking new ways of doing things. EarthCube must address evolving user requirements and enable domain and project systems developed under different management and for different purposes to work together. The EC architecture must focus on creating a technical environment that enables new capabilities by combining existing and newly developed resources in various ways, and encourages development of new resource designs intended for re-use and interoperability. In a sense, instead of a single architecture design, GEAR provides a way to accommodate multiple designs tuned to different tasks. This agile, adaptive, evolutionary software development style is based on a continuously updated portfolio of compatible components that enable new sub-system architecture. System users make decisions about which components to use in this marketplace based on performance, satisfaction, and impact metrics collected continuously to evaluate components, determine priorities, and guide resource allocation decisions by the system governance agency. EC is designed as a federation of independent systems, and although the coordinator of the EC system may be named an enterprise architect, the focus of the role needs to be organizing resources, assessing their readiness for interoperability with the existing EC component inventory, managing dependencies between transient subsystems, mechanisms of stakeholder engagement and inclusion, and negotiation of standard interfaces, rather than actual specification of components. Composition of components will be developed by projects that involve both domain scientists and CI experts for specific research problems. We believe an agile, marketplace type approach is an essential architectural strategy for EarthCube.",

But while mitigation policy today may slow global warming at the end of the century, it will not keep global warming within these limits. This failure arises in large part from the climate accounting system used to inform this policy, which does not factor in several scientific findings from the last two decades, including:\nThe urgent need to slow global warming before 2035. This can postpone the time the +1.5°C limit is passed, and is the only way to avoid the most serious long-term climate disruptions.\nThat while it may mitigate warming by the end of the century, reducing emissions of CO2 alone, according to UNEP/WMO\n[1]\n, will do “little to mitigate warming over the next 20-30 years,” and “may temporarily enhance near-term warming as sulfate [cooling] is reduced.”\nThat the only emissions reductions that can slow warming before 2035 are focused on short-lived climate pollutants. A small increase in current mitigation funding could fund these projects, the most promising of which target emissions in regional climate “hot spots” like the Arctic and India.\n[2]\nTo ensure policies can effectively slow global warming before 2035, a new climate accounting system is needed. Such an updated system is being standardized in the USA,[3] and has been proposed for use in ISO standards. The key features of this updated system are: consideration of all climate pollutants and their multi-faceted climate effects; use of time horizons which prioritize mitigation of near-term warming; a consistent and accurate accounting for “biogenic” CO2; protocols ensuring that new scientific findings are incorporated; and a distinct accounting for emissions affecting regional “hot spots”. This accounting system also considers environmental impacts outside of climate change, a feature necessary to identify “win-win” projects with climate benefits but without environmental trade-offs.\n[1] UNEP/WMO.

            "abstract": "The uptake of water from the surface of the leaves, called foliar uptake, is common when rainfall is scarce and non-meteoric water (dew or fog) is the only source of water. However, many species have very water repellent leaves. Past studies have not differentiated between the uptake of water and the impact of the droplets on the energy balance of the leaf, which we call ‘foliar shielding’.\nLeaves of the hydrophobic Colocasia esculenta were misted with isotopically enriched water in order to mimic non-meteoric water deposition. The leaf water potential and water isotopes were monitored for different water-stress conditions. A new protocol was developed for the fast analysis of leaf water isotopes using the Picarro induction module coupled to a laser spectrometer.\nComparing the isotopic composition of the bulk leaf water at the end of the experiment, the misted leaves exhibit a d-excess higher by c. 63‰ than the control ones (P < 0.001). Low d-excess values are commonly associated with a high transpiration rate. Linking isotopic enrichment with leaf transpiration rate, we find a c. 30% decrease in transpiration rate for the treated leaves compared to the control (P < 0.001). Water-stressed leaves that were misted regularly exhibit a c. 64% smaller decline in water potential than water-stressed leaves that did not get misted (P < 0.05).\nThree possible mechanisms are proposed for the interaction of water droplets with the leaf energy and water balance. Comparing three previous foliar uptake studies to our results, we conclude that foliar shielding has a comparable yet opposite effect to foliar uptake on leaf water isotopes and that it is necessary to consider both processes when estimating foliar uptake of fog water.",

            "abstract": "The eruption temperature of Io’s silicate lavas constrains Io’s interior state and composition [1] but reliably measuring this temperature remotely is a challenge that has not yet been met. Previously, we established that eruption processes that expose large areas at the highest temperatures, such as roiling lava lakes or lava fountains, are suitable targets for this task [2]. In this study we investigate the thermal emission from lava tube skylights for basaltic and ultramafic composition lavas. Tube-fed lava flows are known on Io so skylights could be common. Unlike the surfaces of lava flows, lava lakes, and lava fountains which all cool very rapidly, skylights have steady thermal emission on a scale of days to months. The thermal emission from such a target, measured at multiple visible and NIR wavelengths, can provide a highly accurate diagnostic of eruption temperature. However, the small size of skylights means that close flybys of Io are necessary, requiring a dedicated Io mission [3]. We have modelled the thermal emission spectrum for different skylight sizes, lava flow stream velocities, end-member lava compositions, and skylight radiation shape factors, determining the flow surface cooling rates. We calculate the resulting thermal emission spectrum as a function of viewing angle. From the resulting 0.7:0.9 μm ratios, we see a clear distinction between basaltic and ultramafic compositions for skylights smaller than 20 m across, even if sub-pixel. If the skylight is not resolved, observations distributed over weeks that show a stationary and steady hot spot allow the presence of a skylight to be confidently inferred. This inference allows subsequent refining of observation design to improve viewing geometry of the target. Our analysis will be further refined as accurate high-temperature short-wavelength emissivity values become available [4].

            "abstract": "Conventional frameworks for assessing the impacts of climate change on water resource systems use cascades of climate and hydrological models to provide ‘top-down’ projections of future water availability, but these are subject to high uncertainty and are model and scenario-specific. Hence there has been recent interest in ‘bottom-up’ frameworks, which aim to evaluate system vulnerability to change in the context of possible future climate and/or hydrological conditions. Such vulnerability assessments are generic, and can be combined with updated information from top-down assessments as they become available. While some vulnerability methods use hydrological models to estimate water availability, fully bottom-up schemes have recently been proposed that directly map system vulnerability as a function of feasible changes in water supply characteristics. These use stochastic algorithms, based on reconstruction or reshuffling methods, by which multiple water supply realizations can be generated under feasible ranges of change in water supply conditions. The paper reports recent successes, and points to areas of future improvement. Advances in stochastic modeling and optimization can address some technical limitations in flow reconstruction, while various data mining and system identification techniques can provide possibilities to better condition realizations for consistency with top-down scenarios. Finally, we show that probabilistic and Bayesian frameworks together can provide a potential basis to combine information obtained from fully bottom-up analyses with projections available from climate and/or hydrological models in a fully integrated risk assessment framework for deep uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "During periods of northward IMF the site for anti-parallel merging on the dayside magnetopause is known to shift tailward of the cusp and to drive ‘reverse connection’, i.e., sunward plasma flows, deep in the polar cap ionosphere. These flows reach to auroral latitudes on the dayside and then rotate to return along the dawn and dusk flanks, forming relatively small reverse convection cells. The manner in which the flows in the polar cap respond to northward turnings of the IMF and to variations under predominantly northward IMF is not known. For example, how quickly does plasma convection respond to northward turnings and to their reversals, how closely coupled is the convection response to variations in IMF magnitude, and do the flow velocities saturate if the driving conditions become extreme? The first direct images of a reverse convection cell were generated in the mid-1990s using the Kapuskasing and Saskatoon SuperDARN radar pair. SuperDARN radars have since been built at higher latitudes in both hemispheres to provide deep coverage within the polar cap, namely, three PolarDARN radars in the northern hemisphere and a radar at McMurdo in the southern hemisphere. A solar coronal mass ejection (CME) in late September 2014 brought initially large (> 20 nT) and variable northward IMF to Earth that was followed by days of more moderate but sustained northward IMF. The polar cap was observed during this time by a suite of instruments including the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR), PolarDARN, and DMSP satellites. Dramatic effects were observed in the polar cap flow which indicate, that, at times, the coupling between solar wind IMF and polar cap flow is very direct, even quasi-linear. In this talk we describe the dynamics of the polar cap flow observed under both time-varying and steady northward IMF and examine the connections to solar wind drivers and to the physics of dayside reconnection.",

            "abstract": "Determining the mechanisms that heat the solar corona and accelerate the solar wind has been a goal of the heliophysics community since Parker's proposal of the existence of the solar wind. The upcoming Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter missions will help to address this goal through in-situ measurements of the near-Sun environment. In preparation for these missions, we model one proposed mechanism, stochastic ion heating, through numerical evaluation of the gyroaveraged kinetic equation with an added stochastic diffusion term. In particular, we focus on constructing radial profiles of temperature and heating rates as well as the evolution of the proton velocity distribution. Using a fast solar wind model for magnetic and velocity magnitudes, we find that stochastic heating is able to produce temperatures comparable to previous observations, implying that it may be a mechanism that indeed heats the corona and near-Sun solar wind. The proton velocity distributions are shown to significantly deviate from a Maxwellian equilibrium. The core is flattened, while the tails are steepened when compared to a Maxwellian fit to the distribution. To test for stochastic heating in the solar wind, the model distributions are compared to Helios observations from 60 Solar radii, and should be compared to observations from Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter once they become available.",

            "abstract": "Rossby wave activity propagating into low latitudes and associated wave-breaking events frequently lead to the onset of convection within the deep tropics through dynamical processes that are still incompletely understood. The orientation of these wave-breaking events also results in poleward transport of moisture from the tropics and subtropics on synoptic time scales. The time mean manifestation of this transport in the Southern Hemisphere results in “diagonal convergence zones” such as the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) and South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). In the Northern Hemisphere, such geographically anchored convergence zones are much less evident, which presumably reflects a less zonally asymmetry in the distribution of the location of extratropical wave activity interacting with low latitudes. The relationship between extratropical Rossby wave activity, Rossby wave breaking events and poleward moisture transport is quantified on synoptic through interannual time scales in this study. While there are certainly preferred paths for moisture transport within both hemispheres, the lack of diagonal convergence zones within the Northern Hemisphere is shown to be a result of larger intraseasonal variability in the path of Rossby wave propagation. Nevertheless, the preferred path of this wave activity does lead to a local precipitation maximum in the eastern North Pacific ITCZ during northern winter.",

            "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly recognized that processes affecting the planform configuration of marshes may be just as important as, if not more important than, vertical accretion and degradation processes. Sea-level rise may erode marshes laterally through wave action or expansion of the tidal channel network just as it may cause vertical inundation. Understanding the feedbacks contingent on the spatial configuration of vegetation patches and microtopography and their interactions with flow is critical to understanding the processes driving marsh persistence and predicting how marshes will respond to changes in environmental drivers. Based on case studies in the Florida Everglades and on generic modeled landscapes, we demonstrate approaches for quantifying spatial configuration and show how they may be used to distinguish between landscapes subject to different driving factors. These approaches include quantifying the connectivity of waterways using the directional connectivity index, quantifying characteristic patch length scales using autocorrelation functions, and state-space reconstruction based on cumulative width of vegetation patches in subsequent downstream cross-sections. Directional connectivity is particularly useful as an indicator of driving mechanisms governing the evolution of marsh landscapes, because connectivity engages directly in feedbacks with landscape-scale flow. We quantified the sensitivity of discharge through a modeled landscape subject to constant-head boundary conditions to different aspects of patch configuration, finding that directional connectivity and landscape fractal dimension were secondary only to patch area. Hence, changes in waterway connectivity caused by inundation (e.g., tidal marshes) or infilling (inland marshes) promote a positive feedback that amplifies the initial change and may contribute substantially to marsh degradation.",

Compound-specific hydrogen isotopes of plant waxes and soil tetraethers provide a novel means of constraining changes in elevation through time for a diverse range of paleoenvironments. Recent stable isotopic data from paleosol and lacustrine carbonate from basins along the SE margin of the Tibetan plateau indicate carbonates formed from isotopically depleted waters. These are interpreted to reflect longstanding high topography with regional uplift contemporaneous with Paleogene faulting along the Alio Shan – Red River shear zone. Here, hydrogen isotopes of modern plant waxes and soil tetraether temperatures from modern soils in China’s Yunnan province are used to calibrate a multiproxy temperature and isotopic approach to evaluate the paleoelevation and paleoclimatic history of the SE margin of the Tibetan plateau. Modern organic molecular data are paired with plant wax hydrogen isotopes and tetraether temperatures from sediments along the SE plateau margin that date from Eocene to Pliocene to evaluate temperature and isotopic change that may be related to uplift. Organic molecular data show large temperature and isotopic gradients from the late Eocene to Pliocene. These data suggest longstanding high topography and minimal post-Miocene uplift due to lower crustal flow. However, stable isotopic and paleotemperature data must be reconciled with geomorphic evidence for post-Miocene changes in incision rates and model predictions of changing climate and isotopic lapse rates.",

            "abstract": "The classic signal of self-organization in nature is pattern formation. However, the interactions and feedbacks that organize depositional landscapes do not always result in regular or fractal patterns. How might we detect their existence and effects in these “irregular” landscapes? Emergent landscapes such as newly forming deltaic marshes or some restoration sites provide opportunities to study the autogenic processes that organize landscapes and their physical signatures. Here we describe a quest to understand autogenic vs. allogenic controls on landscape evolution in Big Spring Run, PA, a landscape undergoing restoration from bare-soil conditions to a target wet meadow landscape. The contemporary motivation for asking questions about autogenic vs. allogenic controls is to evaluate how important initial conditions or environmental controls may be for the attainment of management objectives. However, these questions can also inform interpretation of the sedimentary record by enabling researchers to separate signals that may have arisen through self-organization processes from those resulting from environmental perturbations.\nOver three years at Big Spring Run, we mapped the dynamic evolution of floodplain vegetation communities and distributions of abiotic variables and topography. We used principal component analysis and transition probability analysis to detect associative interactions between vegetation and geomorphic variables and convergent cross-mapping on lidar data to detect causal interactions between biomass and topography. Exploratory statistics revealed that plant communities with distinct morphologies exerted control on landscape evolution through stress divergence (i.e., channel initiation) and promoting the accumulation of fine sediment in channels. Together, these communities participated in a negative feedback that maintains low energy and multiple channels. Because of the spatially explicit nature of this feedback, causal interactions could not be uncovered from convergent cross-mapping with this limited dataset, serving as a reminder that spatially explicit approaches for revealing causality are needed to reconstruct self-organizing mechanisms from data.",

            "abstract": "Knowles et al. (J. Climate, 2006) documented long-term (1949-2004) trends in precipitation form, with a smaller fraction of precipitation falling, in recent decades, on days with reported snow compared to days when no snow was reported (and when precipitation was presumably rain). This precipitation-amount-corrected trend was found at three-quarters of 261 cooperative weather stations across the region. The trends correlated with corresponding trends towards warmer winter air temperatures at the weather stations involved.\nAn update of those analyses through the more recent period indicates that the overall swing towards less precipitation fraction occurring on snowy days has continued through the intervening years, with 21st Century rain/snow fractions remaining significantly higher than historical norms at most stations. The same data have also been used to develop site-specific statistical relations between precipitation form (snowy-day precipitation vs purely rainy day) and air temperatures by logistical regressions at over 200 stations across the West, to determine whether the general temperature trends mentioned above have, in fact, been large enough to explain the trending precipitation forms. That is, were the warming trends detected across the West large enough to actually raise temperatures above the local snow-rain thresholds at most stations? The regression relations show that the temperature at which half of the wet days have been snowy historically varies, from station to station, across a range from -2ºC to +4ºC. Thus at some stations winter storm temperatures would have to rise above about -2ºC to markedly impact precipitation forms, while at other stations, temperature had to rise above +4ºC. Nonetheless, observed temperature trends since 1950 have been sufficient to explain the observed regional precipitation-form trends. The fitted precipitation form-temperature relations also provide a basis for estimating precipitation forms in hydrological models and in climate-change projections across the region, allowing—for example—more geographically informed projections of precipitation-form changes under future climates. On the whole, though, the expected relations between warming trends and precipitation-form trends found by Knowles et al. (2006) continue to hold.",

Recent studies have revealed significant warming of inland waters throughout the world. The observed rate of warming is – in many cases – greater than that of the ambient air temperature. These rapid, unprecedented changes in inland water temperatures have profound implications for lake hydrodynamics, productivity, and biotic communities. Scientists are just beginning to understand the global extent, regional patterns, physical mechanisms, and ecological consequences of lake warming.\nAs part of our earlier studies we have collected thermal infrared satellite data from those satellite sensors that provide long-term and frequent spaceborne thermal infrared measurements of inland waters including ATSR, AVHRR, and MODIS and used these to examine trends in water surface temperature for approximately 169 of the largest inland water bodies in the world. We are now extending this work to generate temperature time-series of all North American inland water bodies that are sufficiently large to be studied using 1km resolution satellite data for the last 3 decades, approximately 268 lakes. These data are then being related to changes in the surface air temperature and compared with regional trends in water surface temperature derived from CMIP5/IPCC model simulations/projections to better predict future temperature changes.\nWe will discuss the available datasets and processing methodologies together with the patterns they reveal based on recent changes in the global warming, with a particular focus on the inland waters of the southwestern USA.",

            "abstract": "Forest disturbances strongly regulate ecosystem structure and function, including vegetation composition, nutrient cycling, and energy flow. In ecosystems where disturbance is historically prevalent, vegetation and biogeochemical properties typically return to pre-disturbance conditions on time scales of years to decades. The biogeochemical impacts of changing disturbance regimes, however, are less well understood. Changing disturbance regimes may potentially impact ecosystem processes for centuries to millennia and alter global C and N balance. We combine a paleoecological record of fire and biogeochemical change with ecosystem modeling to test the hypothesis that variability in the timing and severity of wildfires has long-lasting impacts on biogeochemical processes in a subalpine forest in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. We used an existing 4000-yr, high-resolution record of fire history (Fig. 1A) to drive the DayCent ecosystem model under two scenarios: (a) standard initialization where fire is repeated according to literature-estimated mean fire return intervals, and (b) paleo-informed scenario to dictate the timing of high-severity and non-high-severity fires. We compare the results to a suite of biogeochemical proxies from the same paleo record and draw inferences based on the two model scenarios.\nWhen driven by the standard initialization, ecosystem properties of soil carbon, nitrogen, and net primary productivity (NPP) are relatively stable over the 4000-year period. In contrast, when driven with the paleo-informed disturbance history, soil C and N stocks and NPP undergo millennial-scale directional changes, similar in timing to some biogeochemical proxies from the paleo record (Fig. 1). In the model, these changes are due to a reduced frequency of high-severity fires after c. 2500 yr BP. Adding climate variability to this simulation is the next step for inferring potential mechanisms responsible for the millennial-scale trends observed in the paleo record. Our study demonstrates the relevance of centennial and millennial timescales for understanding modern biogeochemical states, which may prove critical for more accurately projecting future regional and global biogeochemical states through the use of ecosystem models.",

            "abstract": "A key challenge for resource and land managers is predicting the consequences of climate warming on streamflow and water resources. During the last century in the western United States, significant reductions in snowpack and earlier snowmelt have led to an increase in the fraction of annual streamflow during winter and a decline in the summer. However, this increase and decrease in streamflow is mediated by the climate and landscape. Here we explore key landscape and climate metrics for interpreting hydrologic sensitivity to climate using observed flow from a range of watersheds across the western United States. Our results indicate that the recession constant and fraction of precipitation falling as snow are the two primary controls on hydrologic sensitivity to climate in this region. Dry season flows in watersheds that drain slowly from deep groundwater and receive precipitation as snow are most sensitive to climate warming. In terms of peak flow, watersheds are most sensitivity to the consistency (i.e. signal-to-noise ratio) in fraction of precipitation falling as snow. Our results also indicate that not all trends in western United States are associated with changes in snowpack dynamics; we observe declining flow in late fall and winter in rain-dominated watersheds as well. These empirical findings support both theory and hydrologic modeling and have implications for how hydrologic sensitivity to climate change is evaluated and interpreted across broad regions.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the Earth's and ocean's response to past changes in global ice extent and ocean volume, collectively termed glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), is necessary for interpreting observations of present-day sea level change. GIA has the largest effect on sea-level observations nearest the locations of the former ice sheets. Under the former loading centers, crustal uplift contributes to a local relative sea-level fall while the collapsing forebulge surrounding these centers accentuates a local sea-level rise. Some of the longest tide gauge records are in these regions. However, GIA also causes global deformation and geoid changes that introduce systematic differences between global averages of tide gauge and altimetry observations.\nClearly accounting for the GIA contribution to sea-level change while identifying other present-day contributors is greatly assisted by additional geodetic measurements. Time-variable satellite gravity observations highlight the regional GIA signal, on length scales of hundreds of kilometers, while also locating water mass changes on the continents and the oceans. As the spatial density of GNSS observations has increased, it has become easier to discern the regional characteristics of crustal deformation (e.g. Blewitt et al. abstract in U009). Combined, these two observations allow for greater separation of GIA and water mass changes. More importantly for society, though, the regional crustal estimates could be combined with coastal altimetry products to create regional estimates of relative sea-level change, the observation most relevant for coastal planning.\nIn this presentation we discuss how the various geodetic measurements complement each other and allow us to identify various components of sea level change, including GIA. We illustrate how the weakness of any individual observation component can be overcome by comparison with the other components. A sustained and global geodetic observing system is essential for understanding the causes of sea-level rise.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric total electron content (TEC) fluctuations following large-magnitude earthquakes and resulting tsunamis, e.g. Tohoku in 2011, have been noted in many recent investigations [e.g., Galvan et al., Radio Science, 47(4), 2012]. Earthquakes impact the atmosphere through vertical displacements of the Earth’s crust or ocean surfaces producing, as one effect, low-frequency acoustic waves. These waves can achieve significant amplitudes during propagation through the rarefied upper atmosphere, and are capable of driving sizable ionospheric electron density (TEC) fluctuations and electrical currents. Earthquake-generated acoustic waves are readily identifiable in GPS observations as 0.1-2 TECU, 3-5 mHz, oscillations, which are delayed from the quake occurrence by roughly the sound travel time between the ground and ionosphere. In some extreme cases, the onset of acoustic oscillations is concurrent with a persistent, sharp decrease in TEC (~5 TECU) above the epicenter [e.g., Kakinami et al., GRL, 39(13), 2012].\nIonospheric responses to large amplitude acoustic waves are investigated using a coupled atmosphere-ionosphere model [Zettergren and Snively, GRL, 40(20), 2013]. Of particular interest are effects of acoustic wave amplitude and nonlinearity on ionospheric responses, including production of detectable TEC oscillations and longer-lived responses like TEC depletions. The atmospheric dynamics model solves a Navier-Stokes’ system of equations and incorporates generation of acoustic waves through acceleration source terms at ground-level. The ionospheric model solves a fluid system of equations for each of the major ionospheric species, and includes an electrostatic description of dynamo currents. The coupled model enables direct computation of observable quantities, such as vertical TEC and magnetic field fluctuations. Here we construct simulation case studies for realistic earthquake events and compare results against published TEC and magnetic field data. This analysis provides estimates of source accelerations consistent with observed ionospheric responses. It also further highlights how the character of the ionospheric TEC response, including its amplitude, detectability, and the presence of any long-lived features, depends on source characteristics.",

Calving generated tsunami waves were recorded and used to construct a calving event catalog and to characterize the post-calving ocean state. Calving on Helheim is highly seasonal: it onsets after months of inactivity in early spring, immediately following the rise of daily average temperatures above freezing point, which indicates the potentially dominant role of meltwater in the calving mechanism. Tidal phase and amplitude, ocean temperature variations or surges did not seem to be significant calving factors. In the ocean spectra, we observe discrete peaks between 0.4 to 6 mHz associated with calving events. These peak frequencies are consistent among all the events and they travel as propagating modes up and down the fjord for several hours while being slowly radiated away to the open ocean, an observation which we support with a model. Large part of the spectrum is trapped in evanescent modes or is quickly dissipated. These observations are relevant for our understanding of the time scale and rate of mixing in glacier fjords, and eventually for improving boundary conditions for ocean models.",

In contrast, DZ LASS-DP-ICP-MS petrochronology allows for the simultaneous recovery of multiple U-Pb ages and corresponding geochemical data, and thus dramatically increases our ability to resolve the petrogenetic history of individual DZ grains. The technique shows the immense power of determining the growth history of single DZ grains (rim to core relationships) and identifying/resolving the presence and age of thin magmatic/metamorphic overgrowths.\nRupelian turbidites in the Apenninic foredeep exhibit a DZ population with consistent <5 mm Cretaceous metamorphic overgrowths that would likely not be resolved as a coherent population in polished sections. LASS-DP ICP-MS analysis of Caledonian and Variscan detrital zircon populations from the Molasse Basin show a distinct shift in rim-core age pairs in individual zircons that point to the erosion of different source during progressive Alpine unroofing. The geochemical data confirm a crustally derived magmatic source for the majority of the detrital zircon grains within the basin. While this technique, in comparison to traditional polished mounts, might underrepresent older core ages, this slight bias is clearly offset by the better definition and resolution of overgrowth populations. DZ LASS-DP-ICPMS petrochronology is a powerful novel tool in better leveraging the growth history of single zircons and thus determining source-to-sink relationships in sedimentary basins.",

According to the theory of ideal MHD, it should be a tangential discontinuity, but magnetic reconnection or instability can make it more complicated. Voyager 1 crossed the HP in August 2012 at a radial distance of 122 AU from the Sun. The behaviors of Galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and anomalous cosmic rays (ACR) at the HP crossing are very complex. The intensity of GCR experiences step-like increases to reach a nearly steady interstellar level in the outer heliosheath. Its angular distribution changes from isotropic inside the HP to bidirectional anisotropy that appear on and off for several periods of time in the outer heliosheath. The ACR intensity experiences several episodes of decreases near the HP before it eventually disappears. The anisotropy of ACR in the partial depression regions is pancake-like, indicating there is some temporary trapping of particles of near-90\n∘\npitch angles. The information has provided us clues for understanding the properties of particle transport in the turbulence of the interstellar magnetic field. In this paper, we review results of model calculations of GCR and ACR transport across the HP. With the observations and modeling results, we can now establish constraints on the properties of particle scattering, diffusion, and interstellar magnetic field turbulence level.",

            "abstract": "Disturbance plays a major role in shaping ecosystems, but their occurrence is stochastic and their representation in ecosystem models is widely considered to be inadequate. Both these factors place significant limits on our ability to forecast ecosystems in a changing world. Herein we address three major challenges in disturbance modeling, focusing on recent advances and emerging opportunities. First, we assess the ability of models to capture emergent observational patterns and experimental manipulations using a range of data types and across a wide range of time scales, from sub-annual (eddy flux) to interannual (inventory, tree rings) to centennial (fossil pollen and charcoal, settlement era surveys). Second, we present advances in how models can represent specific disturbance processes (insects and pathogens, non-harvest forest management) and the scaling of disturbance processes in regional- to global-scale models. Third, we address the question of how to assimilate multiple sources of disturbance data across multiple spatial and temporal scales to constrain the pools and fluxes within models. In particular, because disturbances are stochastic we want to update model projections based on field and remotely-sensed data. However, rather than driving models with a particular external data that is taken as ‘truth’, we explore examples of how to update models using multiple data sources while accounting for uncertainties in both the model and data. Finally, we discuss the implications of these advances and the opportunities they present for near-term carbon monitoring and long-term carbon cycle projections.",

Understanding and modelling these vegetation-climate feedbacks is key to accurately predicting a future climate. For the past 6 years the PhenoCam network, a network of near-surface remote sensing cameras, has consistently monitored vegetation phenology in a wide range of ecoregions, climate zones, and plant functional types. Here we explore the tight coupling between canopy greenness and rates of photosynthesis using two studies.\nA first study highlights how PhenoCam data can be used to quantify the effect of a late spring frost event on ecosystem productivity, introducing a 7-14% loss in annual gross productivity across 8753 km2 in the northeastern United States. This case study emphasizes the use of the PhenoCam data in estimating productivity loss / the opportunity cost of ecosystem disturbance in areas not covered by ecosystem flux measurement equipment.\nIn a more recent, second, study we developed a PhenoCam data-informed pulse-response model of grassland growth to explore potential responses of grasslands to future climate change across North America. Our findings projected widespread and consistent increase in grassland productivity (for the current range of grassland ecosystems of North American) over the coming century, despite a general increase in aridity projected across most of our study area. Once more PhenoCam data allowed us to inform our modelling efforts with data of a high temporal and spatial resolution.\nIn conclusion, both studies illustrate direct applications of the ever growing PhenoCam network (http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/) in scaling the effects of ecosystem disturbances, predicting future ecosystem productivity and underscore the complementary nature of PhenoCam data with ecosystem exchange measurements.",

            "abstract": "A meta-analysis of sediment bulk density and loss-on-ignition (LOI) data from marshes in thirteen estuaries on the U.S. Pacific, Gulf, and East Coasts consisting of over 2400 samples shows that dry bulk density can be predicted very well as a function of LOI (r2=0.8) using a conservative mixing model. The estimated bulk densities of pure organic and mineral matter were 0.08 and 1.9 g/cm3, respectively, as determined by a best fit of the mixing model. The composite bulk density and LOI of a mixture are best explained as the result of a conservative mix of these two end members. These bulk densities are useful in establishing limits on the vertical accretion in tidal wetlands. For example, if we assume a maximum belowground production of 2.5 kg/m2 and that 10% of this is preserved, then the maximum vertical accretion from this amount of belowground production is 3 mm/yr (0.1 x 2500 g m-2 y-1 × m2/1000 cm2 ÷ 0.08 g/cm3 = 0.3 cm/y). For a sediment-poor estuary with a suspended inorganic sediment concentration in flood water of 20 mg/L, flooding a marsh surface twice daily to an average depth of 12.5 cm, the vertical accretion rate would be no greater than about 1 mm/yr. This assumes that the surface captures 100% of the sediment load. The maximum vertical accretion is the sum of the two components, and in a sediment-poor, microtidal estuary (typical of many on the Gulf Coast) this should be no more than about 4 mm/y.",

Regressions of indices for facular brightening and sunspot darkening with time series of direct TSI observations during the recent 37-year spacecraft TSI measurement era determine the relative contributions from each. Historical TSI reconstructions are enabled by extending these proxy models back in time prior to the start of the measurement record using a variety of solar activity indices including the sunspot number time series alone prior to 1882. Such reconstructions are critical for Earth climate research, which requires knowledge of the incident energy from the Sun to assess climate sensitivity to the natural influence of solar variability.\nTwo prominent TSI reconstructions that utilize the sunspot record starting in 1610 are the NRLTSI and the SATIRE models. We review the indices that each currently uses and estimate the effects the revised sunspot record has on these reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "The detection of highly volatile elements in lunar volcanic glasses and melt inclusions has provided the first definitive evidence for the accretion and retention of these elements in the Moon’s interior1,2. Measurement of H in lunar apatite, at levels similar to terrestrial apatite, has added weight to this discovery3,4. These results are at odds with the longest-standing observations that the abundances of highly- and moderately-volatile elements in lunar basalts are as much as 1000 times more depleted than in terrestrial basalts5. We will show that most of these apparent contradictions have arisen due to the previously unappreciated importance of a single widespread process, magmatic degassing. Degassing occurs in all eruptions of magma, with the consequent release of volatile elements into an exsolved vapor phase. We use ours and previously published results to evaluate lunar magmatic degassing and to show that A) volatile element contents for the bulk silicate Moon (BSM) are only moderately depleted compared with the bulk silicate Earth (range 0.5-0.1, avg. 0.25 x BSE), B) they essentially overlap the composition of the terrestrial depleted MORB source and C) the volatile depletion pattern for the BSM is largely flat, and so does not correlate with condensation temperature at 10−4 bars, nor with bond energy for likely ligands. Published high-precision Sr and Pb isotope ratios on well-dated lunar rocks6-8 reveal 87Rb/86Sr and 238U/204Pb ratios of the lunar mantle a factor of 0.3-0.5 and 0.28-0.85 depleted compared to those of the BSE, respectively; lending support to our estimates for the abundances of Rb (0.245 x BSE) and Pb (0.187 x BSE) in the BSM. Before the Moon’s extent of volatile depletion can be confidently attributed to the accretion processes, magmatic degassing must be examined and critically evaluated.\n",

            "abstract": "One primary contributor to the uncertainty in climate sensitivity is the response of cloud distributions to the changing large-scale circulation. An evaluation of cloud responses to changes in large-scale dynamics within climate models during the present climate must be made using available observations before the models can be trusted to predict cloud changes in the future. To establish relationships between cloud and large-scale dynamics, we introduce the water budget-related “dynamical phase space”, which summarizes many commonly-used parameters to represent large-scale dynamical conditions, and are simultaneously tied to the atmospheric water budget. Typical circulation systems such as the ITCZ, the subtropical subsidence regions, the tropical trade winds, and the mid-latitude baroclinic systems can be efficiently identified in regimes of the dynamical phase space. Cloud state histograms defined by cloud top pressure and cloud optical depth retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are stratified against different regimes in the dynamical phase space to establish the responses of clouds to large-scale dynamical conditions. Furthermore, as an example, these cloud-dynamics relationships are used to evaluate cloud state histograms calculated from the Cloud Feedback Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulation Package (COSP) MODIS simulator incorporated in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2 (GISS E2). The skills of the model to reproduce cloud responses to the varying large-scale dynamical conditions will be illustrated.",

            "abstract": "In 2005 and 2010 the Amazon basin experienced two strong droughts\n1\n, driven by shifts in the tropical hydrological regime\n2\n possibly associated with global climate change\n3\n, as predicted by some global models\n3\n. Tree mortality increased after the 2005 drought\n4\n, and regional atmospheric inversion modelling showed basin-wide decreases in CO2 uptake in 2010 compared with 2011 (ref. \n5\n). But the response of tropical forest carbon cycling to these droughts is not fully understood and there has been no detailed multi-site investigation in situ. Here we use several years of data from a network of thirteen 1-ha forest plots spread throughout South America, where each component of net primary production (NPP), autotrophic respiration and heterotrophic respiration is measured separately, to develop a better mechanistic understanding of the impact of the 2010 drought on the Amazon forest. We find that total NPP remained constant throughout the drought. However, towards the end of the drought, autotrophic respiration, especially in roots and stems, declined significantly compared with measurements in 2009 made in the absence of drought, with extended decreases in autotrophic respiration in the three driest plots. In the year after the drought, total NPP remained constant but the allocation of carbon shifted towards canopy NPP and away from fine-root NPP. Both leaf-level and plot-level measurements indicate that severe drought suppresses photosynthesis. Scaling these measurements to the entire Amazon basin with rainfall data, we estimate that drought suppressed Amazon-wide photosynthesis in 2010 by 0.38 petagrams of carbon (0.23–0.53 petagrams of carbon). Overall, we find that during this drought, instead of reducing total NPP, trees prioritized growth by reducing autotrophic respiration that was unrelated to growth. This suggests that trees decrease investment in tissue maintenance and defence, in line with eco-evolutionary theories that trees are competitively disadvantaged in the absence of growth\n6\n. We propose that weakened maintenance and defence investment may, in turn, cause the increase in post-drought tree mortality observed at our plots.",

            "abstract": "Leakage to the atmosphere of a significant fraction of injected CO2 would constitute a failure of a geological CO2 storage project from a greenhouse gas mitigation perspective. We present a numerical model that simulates flow and transport of CO2 into heterogeneous subsurface systems. The model, StoTran, is a flexible numerical environment that uses state-of-the-art finite element and finite volume methods and unstructured adaptive mesh refinement scheme implemented using MPI and OpenMP protocols. Multiphase flow equations and the geomechanical equations are implicitly solved and either fully or sequentially coupled. StoTran can address inverse and forward problems under deterministic or stochastic conditions. For the current study, StoTran has been used to simulate several scenarios spanning from a homogeneous single layered reservoir to heterogeneous multi-layered systems, which including cap-rock with embedded fractures, have been simulated under different operations of CO2 injection and CO2 leakages conditions. Results show the impact of the injection and leakage rates on the time evolution of the spread of the CO2 plume, its interception of the fractured cap-rock and the risk associated with the contamination of the overlaying aquifer. Spatial and temporal moments have been calculated for different, deterministic of stochastic, subsurface physical and chemical properties. Spatial moments enable assessing the extent of the region of investigation under conditions of uncertainty. Furthermore, several leakage scenarios show the intermittence behavior and development of the CO2 plume in the subsurface; its first interception with the fractures located further far from the injection well then, at a second stage, its interception with the fracture within the immediate vicinity of the injection well. We will present a remedy to CO2 leakages from the reservoir in order to enhance a long term containment of the injected CO2.\n This work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric dust has been the subject of communications for more than 3000 years, since the ancient Chinese book Chronicles Reported on Bamboo Shoots in 1150 BC. Similar reports of hwangsa  and woo-tou in ancient Korean and kosa in ancient Japanese literature also indicated major Asian dust events in those areas. Western observers noted dust storms in India and Afghanistan in the early 1800s, while in the 1840s Darwin surmised that Sahara dust could be an important component of marine sedimentation in the North Atlantic. More recent interest has focused on the importance of dust as a source of the nutrients iron and phosphorus in the global ocean and the role of iron as a limiting nutrient in many areas of the surface ocean. While significant progress has been made in the past 25 years in identifying important dust/ocean connections, many issues remain. Included are the relative dearth of long-term measurements of atmospheric dust (and iron and phosphorus) over and deposition to the ocean, especially in the southern hemisphere; comparisons between modeled and measured deposition of dust to the ocean; and the solubility of iron and phosphorus (and thus their availability as nutrients) after the mineral matter enters the ocean. Addressing these problems will certainly help to provide more accurate estimates of the input of dust to the ocean and its impacts. However, future changes in dust emissions in a warmer world as well as changes in the acid/base environment that mineral dust experiences during its transport and deposition as a result of emission controls on atmospheric NOx and SO2 are two facors that may change the input of these nutrients to the ocean and their impacts in the coming years. These and other issues will be reviewed in this paper.",

            "abstract": "Fjords link the ocean and outlet glaciers of the Greenland ice sheet. As the ice sheet loses mass – potentially triggered by submarine melting – measurements of ocean heat transport in fjords are increasingly being used to diagnose submarine melting and freshwater fluxes. The full budgets that underlie such methods, however, have been largely neglected. Here, we present complete heat, salt, and mass budgets for glacial fjords and new equations for inferring the freshwater fluxes of submarine melting and runoff. Building on estuarine studies of salt budgets, this method includes a decomposition of the fjord transports (into barotropic, exchange, and fluctuating components) that is crucial for conserving mass in the budgets and appropriately accounting for temporal variability. These methods are applied to moored records from Sermilik Fjord, near the terminus of Helheim Glacier, to evaluate the dominant balances in the fjord budgets and to estimate freshwater fluxes. We find two different regimes seasonally that align with the seasonal variations in fjord drivers: shelf variability from barrier winds and freshwater forcing. Our results highlight many important components of fjord budgets, particularly iceberg melting, heat/salt storage and barotropic fluxes, that have been neglected in previous estimates of submarine melting.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the integrated influence of sea level rise (SLR) and future morphology on tidal hydrodynamics along the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) coast with particular focus in three estuaries: Grand Bay, MS, Weeks Bay, AL, and Apalachicola, FL. A large-domain hydrodynamic model was used to simulate astronomic tides for present (circa 2005) and future conditions (circa 2050 and 2100) to understand how sea level and morphology affect tidal heights and velocities. The model was modified with SLR scenarios and projections of morphology obtained from a Bayesian Network (BN); the BN relates driving forces and geological constraints to produce probabilistic projections of shoreline change and dune heights under SLR. Tidal amplitudes within the bays increased as much as 67% (10.0 cm) under the highest SLR scenario. There was a linear correlation between the change in the inlet cross-sectional area under SLR and the change in the tidal amplitude in each bay. Changes in harmonic constituent phases indicated faster tidal propagation in the future scenario in all of the bays except St. Andrew. Tidal velocities also increased in all of the bays, especially in Grand Bay where current velocities doubled under the highest SLR scenario. In addition, the ratio of the flood to ebb velocity decreased (i.e., currents became more ebb dominant) in all of the future scenarios within Weeks Bay and Apalachicola, by as much as 26% and 39%, respectively. Under the higher SLR scenarios, currents those two estuaries reversed from flood-dominant to ebb-dominant. In Grand Bay, the flood-ebb ratio increased (i.e., currents became more flood dominant) by 25% under the lower SLR scenarios, but decreased by 16% under the higher SLR as a result of the offshore barrier islands being overtopped. Results from this study can be used to inform future storm surge and ecological assessments of SLR, and improve monitoring and management decisions within the NGOM estuaries.",

During the past year, the capabilities and data served by LMMP have been significantly expanded. New interfaces are providing improved ways to access and visualize data. Many of the recent enhancements to LMMP have been specifically in response to the requirements of NASA's proposed Resource Prospector lunar rover, and as such, provide an excellent example of the application of LMMP to mission planning.\nAt the request of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, LMMP’s technology and capabilities are now being extended to additional planetary bodies. New portals for Vesta and Mars are the first of these new products to be released.\nOn March 31, 2015, the LMMP team released Vesta Trek (http://vestatrek.jpl.nasa.gov), a web-based application applying LMMP technology to visualizations of the asteroid Vesta. Data gathered from multiple instruments aboard Dawn have been compiled into Vesta Trek’s user-friendly set of tools, enabling users to study the asteroid’s features.\nWith an initial release on July 1, 2015, Mars Trek replicates the functionality of Vesta Trek for the surface of Mars. While the entire surface of Mars is covered, higher levels of resolution and greater numbers of data products are provided for special areas of interest. Early releases focus on past, current, and future robotic sites of operation. Future releases will add many new data products and analysis tools as Mars Trek has been selected for use in site selection for the Mars 2020 rover and in identifying potential human landing sites on Mars.\nOther destinations will follow soon. The user community is invited to provide suggestions and requests as the development team continues to expand the capabilities of LMMP, its related products, and the range of data and tools that they provide.\nThis presentation will provide an overview of LMMP, Vesta Trek, and Mars Trek, demonstrate their uses and capabilities, highlight new features, and preview coming enhancements.",

            "abstract": "Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) are thought to be accelerated at the Sun by solar flares or by the shocks formed by Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Even more elusive is the origin of the highest energy SEPs in so-called Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs). At these energies, the effects of transport are often minimal, providing an opportunity to investigate the problem of particle acceleration. However, the effects of transport en route to Earth often obscure the acceleration process(es). The Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) instrument provides new data that aid in separating the effects of acceleration and transport. Furthermore, PAMELA bridges a critical gap in energy between the low-energy space-based and highest-energy ground-based measurements. We report on recent PAMELA observations of high-energy SEPs and illustrate some of the governing effects of acceleration and transport with the first GLE of solar cycle 24, i.e., 2012 May 17. The PAMELA data of 2012 May 17 reveal two distinct spectral components, a low-energy SEP component that exhibits significant scattering or redistribution, accompanied by a high-energy component that reaches the Earth relatively unaffected by dispersive transport effects. We postulate that the scattering or redistribution at low energies takes place locally providing one of the first opportunities to witness the effects of SEP transport in the Earth's magnetosheath.",

            "abstract": "With the increasing need to construct long-term climate-quality data records to understand, monitor, and predict climate variability and change, it is vital to continue systematic satellite measurements along with the development of new technology for more quantitative and accurate observations. The Suomi-NPP mission provides continuity in monitoring the Earth’s surface and its atmosphere in a similar fashion as the heritage MODIS instruments onboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites. The reflective properties of the Earth surface, including land surface reflectance (LSR) and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in costal waters, are among the essential climate variables from which higher-level products relevant to biological and biogeochemical activities can be explored. In this study, we aim at quantifying consistency amongst Aqua-MODIS, Terra-MODS, and the Suomi-NPP VIIRS LSRs as well as Rrs in coastal waters (Level-2). To avoid interferences from sources of measurement and/or processing errors other than spatial sampling, including calibration, atmospheric correction, and the effects of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), the MODIS and VIIRS Level-2 products are simulated using the Landsat-8’s Operational Land Imager (OLI) Level-2 products. The simulations are performed using the instruments’ point spread functions on a daily basis for various OLI scenes over a 16-day revisit cycle. Preliminary results over land targets show that the daily mean biases (computed over the entire OLI area) in LSRs due to spatial sampling remain below 0.0015 (1%) in absolute surface reflectance. Overall, the disparity increases when VIIRS viewing zenith angle is larger than that of MODIS. Similar trends were observed for the simulated NDVI products. Depending on the spatial heterogeneity of the OLI scenes, per-grid-cell differences can reach up to . Further spatial analysis of the NDVI and LSR products revealed that depending on the user requirements for product intercomparisons different spatial scales might be used. It was found that if per-grid-cell differences on the order of 10% (in LSR or NDVI) are tolerated, the product intercomparisons are expected to be immune from effects of spatial sampling. The analysis over coastal waters is currently ongoing.",

            "abstract": "Ever since the discovery of the lunar sinuous rilles at the dawn of the Space Age, geologists have speculated about the processes that could form such long, channel-like volcanic conduits. The initial studies of the lunar sinuous rilles and martian lava channels in the 1960s and 1970s coincided with the discovery of terrestrial komatiites and recognition of komatiite-hosted magmatic ore deposits, which are located at the base of channels resulting from thermomechanical erosion of sulfide-rich footwall rocks by low-viscosity, turbulent komatiite lavas. Through the 1970s-1990s, most attention was focused on 1.5D analytical-numerical modeling of thermal erosion by lava to produce these channels in various planetary settings. Part of this focus on modeling thermal erosion was motivated by the inferred composition of these lavas, i.e., ultramafic and emplaced by low-viscosity, likely turbulent flows. This contrasts with active terrestrial basaltic volcanism, in which more viscous basalt lava channels appear to be dominated by constructional mechanisms (although thermal erosion by modern basalt lavas has been documented, but at much smaller scales than observed beneath komatiites or modeled for planetary channels). In recent years new studies have been initiated to more fully investigate the constructional and erosional mechanisms for lava channel formation, taking advantage of new investigative technologies and new planetary data. New 2.5D modeling approaches under development that utilize fully numerical methods should provide greater insights by allowing more realistic parameterizations.",

            "abstract": "Cirrus clouds can be thought of as belonging to one of two categories: those formed through (1) homo- and (2) heterogeneous ice nucleation (henceforth hom and het) due to the very different microphysical and radiative properties associated with these two mechanisms. Hom cirrus will form only when atmospheric ice nuclei (IN) are sufficiently low in concentration, and studies suggest that mineral dust may account for most IN globally. Hence the occurrence of hom and het cirrus is likely to depend on latitude and season as mineral dust does, making satellite remote sensing the preferred method for characterizing this occurrence.\nA new understanding of thermal absorption in two split-window channels renders a reinterpretation of a standard CALIPSO satellite retrieval; the effective absorption optical depth ratio or βeff. Using earlier studies and aircraft measurements in cirrus clouds, βeff is found to be tightly related to the ice particle number concentration/ice water content ratio, or N/IWC, and thresholds for hom cirrus are estimated in terms of N/IWC and βeff. When applied to cold semi-transparent cirrus clouds, we find that (1) polar cirrus (T < -38 C) occur much more often during winter than summer and (2) hom cirrus prevail at high latitudes during winter, and during spring and fall over Antarctica. The figure shows estimates of the fraction of cirrus produced by hom (where βeff > 1.15) during January and August, where green is ~ 50% and red ~ 90-100%. These high N/IWC values associated with hom cirrus occur in regions where mineral dust concentrations are predicted to be minimal. This high N/IWC condition during winter is likely to have a strong greenhouse effect that may increase high latitude temperatures by 2-5°K relative to conditions where het cirrus dominates (Storelvmo et al. 2014, Philos. Trans. A, Royal Soc.). Thus, the lack of mineral dust in the high latitudes during winter may result in a strong warming influence over these regions. Moreover, changes in dust concentrations due to a changing climate may significantly affect surface temperatures in the Polar Regions.\nOther findings are that N/IWC is consistently higher over land than over oceans, and that hom cirrus are associated with steep orography (i.e. high cooling rates) where dust concentrations are expected to be low.",

            "abstract": "Arguably 40Ar/39Ar geochronology is one of the most versatile techniques available to Earth scientists today for the dating of rocks and minerals and determining the rates of geological processes on Earth and in our solar system. Over the last four decades large quantities of high (and lower) quality 40Ar/39Ar data have been produced using many different generations of mass spectrometry instrumentation. This wealth of data is only as useful as its description and availability of metadata allows. Many online data sets or compilations available in the science literature only carry the resulting product, an age and a related uncertainty in millions of years, for example. These data points are far from desirable as these don’t allow recalculation against modern-day age standards, decay constants and other parameters essential in 40Ar/39Ar geochronology. Over time these data will become less useful to the research community and eventually these will be put by the wayside. In this presentation I will emphasize the need for full disclosure of all data and metadata involved in 40Ar/39Ar geochronology. I will give examples of how a complex data flow can be kept transparent from sample preparation to measurement to data reduction and eventually the uploading into online data repositories. Without the full disclosure of our data and a transparent data flow, it is evident that we cannot live up to one of the governing doctrines in the sciences, namely reproducibility of our scientific experiments and findings.",

Ambient noise correlation with these data can be used to extract surface waves and body waves, which in turn allows us to determine the near-surface structure and velocities in the vicinity of these surveys. The results show a surprisingly short scale-length in the lateral variations of velocity, which is important for determining seismic hazard. To extend this analysis beyond the areas covered by the dense surveys themselves, we use the 16 stations of the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) broadband network that are located in the Los Angeles region, and which span the time-periods of the dense surveys to do C2 ambient noise correlations (correlations of correlations). This will extend the area covered to include most of the central Los Angeles Basin.",

            "abstract": "Greenland’s large marine-terminating outlet glaciers have displayed marked retreat, speedup, and thinning in recent decades. Jakobshavn Isbrae, one of Greenland’s largest outlet glaciers, has retreated ~15 km, accelerated ~150%, and thinned ~200 m since the early 1990s. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of high-resolution elevation (~2-5 m/px) and velocity (~100 m/px) time series with dense temporal coverage (daily-monthly).\nThe Jakobshavn DEM time series consists of >70 WorldView-1/2/3 stereo DEMs and >11 TanDEM-X DEMs spanning 2008-2015. Complementary point elevation data from Operation IceBridge (ATM, LVIS), pre-IceBridge ATM flights, and ICESat-1 GLAS extend the surface elevation record to 1999 and provide essential absolute control data, enabling sub-meter horizontal/vertical accuracy for gridded DEMs. Velocity data are primarily derived from TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X image pairs with 11-day interval from 2009-2015.\nThese elevation and velocity data capture outlet glacier evolution with unprecedented detail during the post-ICESat era. The lower trunk of Jakobshavn displays significant seasonal velocity variations, with recent rates of ~8 km/yr during winter and >17 km/yr during summer. DEM data show corresponding seasonal elevation changes of -30 to -45 m in summer and +15 to +20 m in winter, with decreasing magnitude upstream. Seasonal discharge varies from ~30-35 Gt/yr in winter to ~45-55 Gt/yr in summer, and we integrate these measurements for improved long-term mass-balance estimates. Recent interannual trends show increased discharge, velocity, and thinning (-15 to -20 m/yr), which is consistent with long-term altimetry records. The DEM time series also reveal new details about calving front and mélange evolution during the seasonal cycle.\nSimilar time series are available for Kangerdlugssuaq and Helheim Glaciers. These observations are improving our understanding of outlet glacier dynamics, while complementing ongoing efforts to constrain estimates for ice-sheet mass balance and present/future sea level rise contributions.",

            "abstract": "Fire is a key determinant of the structure and function of boreal forest ecosystems. Boreal fire regimes have been climate-limited in recent decades, and future climate warming is predicted to drive a pronounced increase in fire activity, likely resulting in carbon release from the boreal biome and positive feedback to climate change. Fuel limitation could slow fire regime change by reducing the abundance of mature vegetation on the landscape, but this mechanism remains poorly quantified and is thus excluded from forecasts of future boreal burning. We developed a novel statistical model that links regional area burned to mean landscape age, a proxy for fuel limitation due to cumulative past burning. Fit to historical fire observations from interior Alaska, the model detects significant evidence of fire-vegetation feedback and provides the first quantitative estimate of its effects on regional fire regimes. These effects were subtle during the past 60 yr, but they will become increasingly influential as climate warming promotes higher fire activity. By the end of the 21st century, fuel limitation reduces predicted area burned by 40-50% relative to predictions based on climate alone, and diminishes the difference between fire regimes expected under alternate future climate scenarios. Nevertheless, annual area burned will approximately double during the coming century as fire becomes more widespread in spite of regional fuel limitation. Furthermore, changes to the fire regime and mean landscape age by the end of the century could represent a fundamental shift in the Alaskan boreal ecosystem. Our model structure facilitates linking fire regime predictions to ecosystem and Earth system models and could help reduce uncertainty in these models due to poorly constrained initial conditions. We demonstrate this approach using the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, which has been calibrated extensively for applications in simulating boreal carbon dynamics. Results suggest that increased burning has already initiated a transition from sink to source of atmospheric carbon that will persist in interior Alaska throughout the 21st century.",

Key themes are amplifying basic research, engagement in citizen science, outreach, communication.\nQuickly, one begins thinking of success tactics, like launching news on a Monday instead of a Saturday or keeping the conversation going by telling the story from different and evolving perspectives. The experience taught that unconventional funding is harder won than conventional funding. Yet, because the support came from unconventional sources, the public, we began tapping a large resource in citizen science engagement. If having a compelling call to action such a campaign can be a significant source of sustain. What had also proven difficult was doing it with a small team when each of the following skills demands a larger group; running a media campaign; logistics; video recording and editing; social media promotion; conventional media engagement. The issue and brand awareness grows in a snowball effect encouraging us to run successive annual campaigns.\nNow in third year, the project can be more effective if upscaling from a single to a multi-cell organization.",

            "abstract": "The physicist John Archibald Wheeler suggested that “time is nature's way to keep everything from happening at once”. The analog in climate science may be multi-modal analysis, which can be used to identify characteristic space-time patterns associated with major frequency modes (e.g. ENSO, the MJO or the PDO). Under such a paradigm some SST variations, and SST increases, can be meaningfully associated with modes of atmosphere-ocean variability. Here, we build on a recently published work focused on the 'West Pacific Warming Mode' (WPWM) and several new studies examining ‘flavors of ENSO’. In this research, multi-modal analyses are applied to observations and to climate change simulations from coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models to help us explore interactions between these modes. Understanding these interactions and, by extension, their respective and combined influences on droughts may enable us to better identify drought prediction opportunities.\n This talk describes the thermodynamic structure of the WPWM, and suggests that warming in the Indo-Pacific warm pool is intensified by local increases in water vapor content. This observed warming has supported an enhanced west-to-central Pacific sea surface temperature gradient. This tendency appears to interact with ENSO variability, favoring La Niña-like conditions and associated teleconnections with East Africa. We examine potential WPWM contributions to drying in East Africa, and examine specific opportunities for regional drought prediction by comparing these boreal spring teleconnections with long-term (1900-2014) rainfall trends for southern Tanzania during boreal winter. While southern Tanzania has experienced substantial rainfall declines over the past 30 years, we suggest that these are mostly due to ENSO-related cooling in the Niño 3.4 region. In contrast, boreal spring declines appear to be strongly influenced by both the WPWM and Niño 4 SST. These analyses suggest that a multi-modal conception of change and variability may help us recognize and anticipate anomalous climate events and associated droughts.",

They simulate variable response in climate as a function of elevation, including an amplified warming signal at higher elevations, under specific conditions. Moreover, they have been critical in elucidating some of the physical processes that cause elevation dependent warming (EDW). The models have also helped us to quantify sensitivities of those processes and feedbacks, and how these sensitivities vary as a function of elevation and other criteria. This has provided motivation within the scientific community to validate these insights in the selectively available high-elevation observations, as well as informed future needs for new observations and modeling experiments to understand the EDW phenomena.

The program offers support of up to $10,000 for graduate students to collect and interpret geochronology data that contribute to EarthScope science targets through visits to participating geochronology labs (www.earthscope.org/geochronology). The program was launched by a 2-day short course held before the 2014 National GSA meeting in Vancouver, at which 16 geochronology experts introduced 43 participants to the basic theory and applications of geochronology methods. By the first proposal submission deadline in spring 2015, 33 labs representing a broad range of techniques had joined the program by submitting lab plans that were posted on the EarthScope website. The lab plans provide information about preparation, realistic time frames for visits, and analytical costs. In the first year of the program, students submitted 47 proposals from 32 different institutions. Proposals were ranked by an independent panel, 10 were funded, and research associated with these projects is currently underway. The next proposal deadline will be held in spring 2016.\nThe 4D-Earth initiative is an idea for a natural successor to the EarthScope program aimed at expanding the primarily 3D geophysical focus that captured a snapshot of present day North America into the 4th dimension of time (hence the connection to the prototypical AGeS program), and illuminating the crustal component that was below the resolution of much of the USArray image. Like EarthScope, the notion is that this initiative would integrate new infrastructure and usher in a new way of doing science. The overarching scientific motivation is to develop a Community Geologic Model for the 4-D Evolution of the North American continent to firmly answer long-standing questions of how the time-integrated processes of plate tectonics and surface processes produce the mantle and crustal structures we see today. A breakout session on this topic was held at the 2015 EarthScope National Meeting, and efforts are underway to solicit feedback to shape these ideas.",

            "abstract": "Submarine channels are conduits through which turbidity currents and related mass movements transport sediment into the deep sea, thereby playing important roles in the development of continental margins and biogeochemical cycles. To gain a better understanding of submarine channel morphodynamic evolution we explore a variety of channel systems from the western North American continental margin with varying sinuosity and levee geometry, terraces, channel cut-offs, and sediment waves in incipient channels, along thalwegs of well-developed channels, and on levees. Repeat bathymetric surveys of submarine channels in fjords of British Columbia and the Monterey canyon underscore the transience of fine-scale detail in channelized geomorphology, and multi-phase bed reworking, local deposition, and bypass of turbidity currents. Numerical modeling is combined with interpretations of channel geomorphology and strata in the Monterey and San Mateo canyon-channel systems to demonstrate that some of the sediment waves are likely to be cyclic steps. Submarine cyclic steps are long-wave, upstream-migrating bedforms in which each bedform in the series is bounded by a hydraulic jump in an overriding turbidity current, which is Froude-supercritical over the lee side of the bedform and Froude-subcritical over the stoss side. Submarine turbidity currents are susceptible to supercritical flow because of the reduced gravitational acceleration of dilute suspensions. Higher submarine slopes common to the North American continental margin also promote supercritical flow, which might not be as common across lower slopes of large passive margins such as the Amazon, Indus, and Bengal submarine fans. We posit that cyclic steps are a common morphodynamic expression in many continental margins. Continued integration of high-resolution data, such as repeat geophysical surveys, acoustic doppler current profiler measurements, and turbidite outcrops, which provide insights into the longer-term stratigraphic evolution of submarine channels, and approaches, including empirical experimentation and numerical modeling, are aimed at improved understanding of submarine channel morphodynamics.",

            "abstract": "Individual choice in plant selection for household landscaping influences differences in runoff from urban watersheds because the variation in plant canopy architecture results in rainfall interception differences. Understanding the variables that influence rainfall interception and understanding the mechanism of rainfall interception are important concepts for sustainable watershed management. The broad objective of this study was to explore the influence of leaf hydrophobicity, water droplet retention, and leaf angle on the mechanism and process of rainfall interception and raindrop impaction on leaf surfaces of common tree species from the semi-arid regions of the western United States. Leaf hydrophobicity is determined by the cohesive forces of the water molecules among themselves and the adhesive forces that result from the molecular interactions between the water droplet and the leaf surface. Water droplet retention is a measure of how easily a water droplet drains off a leaf surface. The specific hypotheses examined were 1) larger raindrops falling on leaf surfaces will deflect the leaf to an angle greater than the water droplet retention angle; 2) an increased leaf angle, whether from natural position or deflection due to droplet impact and retention, reduces interception from raindrop impaction on hydrophobic and hydrophilic leaf surfaces; and 3) increased droplet size and frequency decrease rainfall interception more significantly in the hydrophilic case. These hypotheses were addressed in a laboratory experiment by 1) measuring leaf hydrophobicity and water droplet retention using a goniometer with a tilting base; 2) measuring leaf traits such as leaf area, leaf surface roughness, trichome density, and specific storage capacity; 3) examining raindrop splash on leaf surfaces with varying leaf hydrophobicity, water droplet retention, and leaf angle with a raindrop generator and high-speed video camera; and 4) modeling the impact of raindrop splash on leaf surfaces. Results presented from this study will provide the context for understanding the ecohydrological significance of individual choices in plant selection in urbanized watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Leaf waxes and their carbon (δ13C) and hydrogen (δD) isotopic compositions are an important tool to understand past changes in paleoclimate and paleovegetation. Important recent advances in our understanding about the isotopic signal preserved in sedimentary leaf waxes have been inferred from studies made on individual modern plants. However, paleoreconstructions are based on sedimentary leaf waxes, which reflect mixing between multiple sources, such as ablated leaf waxes from nearby or from afar, wind blown leaf litter, and riverine transported leaf waxes. Each of these sources integrates leaf waxes from different species and growth forms, likely resulting in source-specific taphonomic biases on sedimentary leaf wax isotopes.\nTo better understand source biases in sedimentary leaf waxes, we investigated n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids and their carbon and hydrogen isotopes in vegetation and lake sediments at Brown’s Lake and Bog, a ‘simple’ forested closed-basin lake in northeastern Ohio. Interestingly, we found that tree n-alkane δD varied substantially during the growing season, broadly tracking changes in source water composition. However, δD values of n-alkanes in the tree leaf litter did not match that of the most recent sedimentary n-alkanes. Instead, surface sediment n-alkane δD more closely matched that of the woody shrubs and grasses growing right around the lake. n-Alkanoic acid data is forthcoming. We are currently exploring lake sediment n-alkane accumulation rates against midwestern flux rates of wind blown leaf waxes from afar. Our preliminary results suggest that although studies made on individual leaves are indeed important, we may need to consider additional leaf wax sources that potentially influence sedimentary archives.",

Assessing ecosystem function and biogeochemical cycling in this environment is hampered by the inherent variability in both temporal and spatial timescales. In recent years the NSF Science and Technology Center for Coastal Margin Observation and Prediction has established a comprehensive in situ observation network that spans the estuarine gradient and captures variability associated with tides, diel cycles, episodic events, and seasonal changes in the river and ocean end-members. Here we describe the major patterns of variability in nitrate, orthophosphate, fluorescent dissolved organic carbon and related variables that demonstrate the dominant physical forcing and the biogeochemical hotspots within the ecosystem. These hotspots include intertidal lateral bays, the tidal freshwater river, and the estuarine turbidity maxima. Improved understanding of the role of these estuarine hotspots has informed ecosystem stewardship activities related to juvenile salmon survival, hypoxia, and food web structure.",

            "abstract": "The February 27, 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule earthquake and tsunami that struck south-central Chile altered the coastal landscape, leaving a depositional record at many locations along the coast. Our research is questioning whether tsunami deposits originally described during post-tsunami surveys in La Trinchera, Constitución and Coliumo soon after the event change significantly over time. The deposits initially described in 2010 were revisited 5 years later to determine if taphonomic changes occurred and to assess the long-term preservation potential of deposits with different initial characteristics and settings. We recently made measurements of deposit thickness, grain size, grading, sedimentary structures, incipient soil development and accumulation of organic material. Results indicate that deposit thickness and the maximum inland extent of recognizable deposits had decreased slightly since 2010, while overlying soil development and accumulation of organic matter increased. Few deposits had been altered by bioturbation. We will use the inland extent of the deposits surveyed in 2015 to model a minimum size of the 2010 earthquake and tsunami in GeoClaw. The results will be compared with independent geophysical models of the rupture characteristics. This can be used as a case study that can be applied to earlier paleo-earthquake and tsunami events in which seismic data is sparse or non-existent and the most reliable record is the inundation distance as determined by tsunami deposits. Studying the change of deposits in the geologic record over time can provide key insights into how tsunami deposits are preserved, which is important when working with paleo-deposits that may have been altered since deposition.",

            "abstract": "The Greenland Ice Sheet speeds up every summer as melt from the surface penetrates km-thick ice through moulins, but observations show that continued meltwater inputs lead to a decay in the speedup and late summer velocities that can be lower than the winter speed. While this decreasing ice dynamic response to meltwater forcing has often been attributed to channelization of the subglacial drainage system, recent observations of water pressure in moulins at one location indicate that the efficiency of the moulin-channel system does not increase during the second half of summer, failing to explain the concurrent drop in ice velocity. Simultaneous observations of lowering water pressure in boreholes sampling poorly-connected regions of the bed suggest that changes in isolated regions of the bed over summer modulate the overall basal traction of the ice sheet.\nWe explore the role of isolated drainage using models of subglacial hydrology and ice dynamics. The subglacial hydrology model includes components for distributed linked-cavity drainage, channelized drainage, and a new component for weakly-connected isolated drainage. Passive cavity opening in the isolated drainage region is capable of reproducing observed diurnal variations in borehole water pressure. Within the model, gradual drainage of water from the isolated cavities leads to a seasonal reduction in water pressure there and an associated decrease in ice speed, similar to the observations.",

Compared to a raw GCM ensemble (direct GCM output), bias-corrected GCM inputs correct for systematic errors and can produce high-resolution projections that are useful for impact analyses. By examining the difference between raw and bias-corrected GCMs for the continental United States, this work highlights how GCM biases can affect projections of aridity (defined as precipitation (P)/potential evapotranspiration (PET)) and drought (using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)). At the annual time scale for spatial averages over the continental United States, the raw GCM ensemble median has a historical positive precipitation bias (+24%) and negative PET bias (-7%) compared to the bias-corrected output. While both GCM ensembles (raw and bias-corrected) result in drier conditions in the future, the bias-corrected GCMs produce enhanced aridity (number of months with PET>P) in the late 21st century (2070-2099) compared to the historical climate (1950-1979). For the western United States, the bias-corrected GCM ensemble estimates much less humid and sub-humid conditions (based on P/PET categorical values) than the raw GCM ensemble. However, using June, July, and August PDSI, the bias-corrected GCM ensemble projects less acute decreases for the southwest United States compared to the raw GCM ensemble (1 to 2 PDSI units higher) as a result of larger decreases in projected precipitation in the raw GCM ensemble. A number of examples and ecological implications of this work for the western United States will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Micro-seismicity in geothermal reservoirs, in particular in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), is a beneficial byproduct of injection and production, as it can indicate the generation of high-permeability pathways on either pre-existing or newly generated faults and fractures. The hazard of inducing an earthquake large enough to be felt at the surface, however, is not easily avoided and has led to termination of some EGS projects. To explore the physical processes leading to permeability creation and maintenance in geothermal systems and the physics of induced earthquakes , we investigated the evolution of seismicity and the factors controlling the migration, moment release rate, and timing of seismicity in the Coso Geothermal Field (CGF). We report on seismicity in the CGF that has been relocated with high precision double-difference relocation techniques and simultaneous velocity inversions to understand hydrologic reservoir compartmentalization and the nature of subsurface boundaries to fluid flow. We find that two distinct compartments are present within the CGF, which are divided by an aseismic gap showing a relatively low Vp/Vs ratio, likely indicating lower temperatures or lower pore pressures within the gap than in the adjacent reservoir compartments. Well-located events with Mw> 3.5 tend to map onto reactivated fault structures that were revealed when imaged by the relocated micro-seismicity. We relate the temporal and spatial migration of moment release rate to the injection and production histories in the reservoir by employing a thermo-poro-elastic finite element model that takes into account the compartment boundaries defined by the seismicity. We find that pore pressure effects alone are not responsible for the migration of seismicity and that poro-elastic and thermo-elastic stress changes are needed in addition to fluid pressure effects to account for the observed moment release rates.",

            "abstract": "Prior to the onset of seasonal surface melt, widespread perennial aquifers are detected at an average depth of 22 m below the snow surface in the firn of the Greenland ice sheet from airborne radar data. With an elevation range of ~1200-2000 m, the aquifers are mainly located within the percolation zone of the southern and southeastern parts of the ice sheet, in high snow accumulation regions. The impact of the aquifer on Greenland ice sheet hydrology and the direct (or indirect) contribution to sea-level rise remain unconstrained and require further attention. Our study is located on the upper portion of Helheim Glacier in SE Greenland, ~50 km west of the glacier calving front. We first used repeated airborne radar data collected by CReSIS to infer the presence of the firn over the last two decades from missing bed echoes. For 1993-2008, the aquifer remained relatively stable, after 2008 it expanded to higher elevations, and after spring 2012, drainage of its lower-elevation portion is suspected. Based on these initial insights, recent fieldwork was carried out along the surveyed radar line, following an elevation gradient. Geophysical investigation includes seismic refraction and magnetic resonance soundings to complement the radar data and to provide constraints on the base of the aquifer, water volume, and the transition from water-saturated firn to ice. In addition, piezometers and data-logging stations were deployed at point locations to measure hydraulic conductivity, water table vertical fluctuations, and firn temperature. We report on the different techniques used, initial observations made, and present some preliminary interpretations. Water appears to flow laterally in a highly-permeable unconfined aquifer, topographically driven by ice-sheet surface undulations until water encounters local sinks like crevasses. The aquifer impacts on the ice sheet are numerous, including firn densification, alteration of the ice thermal state, and water from the aquifer could enter the englacial network system, which would affect ice dynamics and Greenland’s contribution to sea-level rise.",

These data will allow us to estimate emission fluxes of carbon from the thawing permafrosts. To estimate a global source of GHG emissions from thawing permafrosts, we will use MODIS and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor data to “scale up” the data collected at the three sites on the basis of land surface type information. We refer to this effort as a pilot study as we will collect observations near Fairbanks, AK with the intent to expand our observational network in the future to other sites in North America, which will aid in the monitoring of changes in GHG emissions in the Arctic as well as complement and help interpret data collected by space-borne instruments, such as GOSAT, IASI, and AIRS.\nBased on the data collected at the three sites and a variety of existing satellite data sets, we will develop a computationally-efficient parameterization of emissions from thawing permafrosts for use in the NASA GEOS-5 Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM), thus benefiting ongoing efforts in the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) to build an Earth System Model which is used for both retrospective and predictive simulations of important GHGs. We will use the AGCM to interpret the data collected by tracking methane and CO2 plumes from various sources that impact the three sites. In addition, we will use data collected from aircraft missions and surface stations to understand the signature ratios of trace gases that give important clues as to the identification of sources (e.g. urban, biomass burning).",

            "abstract": "The climatic implications of a shift from oil and coal to natural gas depend on the magnitude of fugitive emissions of methane from the natural gas supply chain. Attempts to constrain methane emissions from natural gas production regions can be confounded by other sources of methane. Here we demonstrate the utility of stable isotopes, particularly hydrogen isotopes, for source apportionment of methane emissions. The Denver, Colorado area is home to a large oil and gas field with both conventional oil and gas wells and newer hydraulic fracturing wells. The region also has a large metropolitan area with several landfills and a sizable cattle population. As part of the DISCOVER-AQ and FRAPPE field campaigns in summer 2014, we collected three types of canister samples for analysis of stable isotopic composition of methane: 1), samples from methane sources; 2), samples from two stationary ground sites, one in the Denver foothills, and one in an oil and gas field; and 3), from the NCAR C-130 aircraft in samples upwind and downwind of the region. Our results indicate that hydrogen isotope ratios are excellent tracers of sources of methane in the region, as we have shown previously in California and Texas. Use of carbon isotope ratios is complicated by the similarity of natural gas isotope ratios to that of background methane. Our results indicate that, despite the large amount of natural gas production in the region, biological sources such as cattle feedlots and landfills account for at least 50% of total methane emissions in the Front Range. Future work includes comparison of isotopes and alkane ratios as tracers of methane sources, and calculation of total methane fluxes in the region using continuous measurements of methane concentrations during aircraft flights.",

The high vertical resolution, precision, and accuracy of retrieved atmospheric profiles makes GNSS RO ideal for weather and space weather specification and forecasting, climate change research and detection, and ground-based and satellite instrument validation. With a GNSS receiver on board a low-Earth orbiting (LEO) satellite, the amplitude and phase of the radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted from GNSS satellites can be measured very precisely as the ray tangent point descends from ~100 km altitude to the surface. With proper algorithms and observational modeling, vertical profiles of bending angle are derived. Profiles of refractivity, and subsequently pressure, temperature and humidity can be derived with additional a priori information. This presentation will first provide an overview of GNSS RO data processing algorithms and then present recent research results from challenging regions such as the upper stratosphere and the lower troposphere. Additional research results from science application studies using RO data will also be discussed. Finally, a status update of the COSMIC-2 mission due to launch in Sept 2016 will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The application of rock flour on suitable land (“Enhanced Weathering”) is one proposed strategy to reduce the increase of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. At the same time it is an old and established method to add fertiliser and influence soil properties. Investigations of this method focused on the impact on the carbonate system, as well as on engineering aspects of a large-scale application, but potential side effects were never discussed quantitatively.\nWe analysed about 120,000 geochemically characterised volcanic rock samples from the literature. Applying basic statistics, theoretical release rates of nutrients and potential contaminants by Enhanced Weathering were evaluated for typical rock types.\nApplied rock material can contain significant amounts of essential or beneficial nutrients (potassium, phosphorus, micronutrients). Their release can partly cover the demand of major crops like wheat, rice or corn, thereby increasing crop yield on degraded soils. However, the concentrations of considered elements are variable within a specific rock type, depending on the geological setting. High heavy metal concentrations are found in (ultra-) basic rocks, the class with the highest CO2 drawdown potential. More acidic rocks contain less or no critical amounts, but sequester less CO2.\nFindings show that the rock selection determines the capability to supply significant amounts of nutrients, which could partly substitute industrial mineral fertiliser usage. At the same time, the release of harmful trace element has to be considered. Through careful selection of regionally available rocks, benefits could be maximised and drawbacks reduced. The deployment of Enhanced Weathering to sequester CO2 and to ameliorate soils necessitates an ecosystem management, considering the release and fate of weathered elements in plants, soils and water. Cropland with degraded soils would benefit while having a net negative CO2 effect, while other carbon dioxide removal strategies, like afforestation, biofuel production, and biochar application could benefit from Enhanced Weathering side effects, as organic carbon pools are positively influenced.",

By making maps and collecting location-based data, students can pursue authentic problems using sophisticated tools. The proliferation of web- and cloud-based tools has made these technologies broadly accessible to schools.\nIn addition, strong spatial thinking skills have been shown to be a key factor in supporting students that want to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines (Wai, Lubinski and Benbow) and pursue STEM careers. Geospatial technologies strongly scaffold the development of these spatial thinking skills. For the last ten years, the Geospatial Semester, a unique dual-enrollment partnership between James Madison University and Virginia high schools, has provided students with the opportunity to use GST’s to hone their spatial thinking skills and to do extended projects of local interest, including environmental, geological and ecological studies. Along with strong spatial thinking skills, these students have also shown strong problem solving skills, often beyond those of fellow students in AP classes.\nPrograms like the Geospatial Semester are scalable and within the reach of many college and university departments, allowing strong engagement with K-12 schools. In this presentation, we’ll share details of the Geospatial Semester and research results on the impact of the use of these technologies on students’ spatial thinking skills, and discuss the success and challenges of developing K-12 partnerships centered on geospatial visualization.",

The MODIS Terra instrument has been providing daily global snow-cover maps since February 2000 (Riggs and Hall, 2015). Using the VIIRS instrument, launched in 2011, NASA snow products are being developed based on the heritage MODIS snow-mapping algorithms, and will soon be available to the science community. Continuity of the standard NASA MODIS and VIIRS snow-cover maps is essential to enable environmental-data records (EDR) to be developed for analysis of snow-cover trends using a consistent data record. For this work, we compare daily MODIS and VIIRS snow-cover maps of the Catskill Mountains from 29 February through 14 March 2012. The entire region was snow covered on 29 February and by 14 March the snow had melted; we therefore have a daily time series available to compare normalized difference snow index (NDSI), as an indicator of snow-cover fraction. The MODIS and VIIRS snow-cover maps have different spatial resolutions (500 m for MODIS and 375 m for VIIRS) and different nominal overpass times (10:30 AM for MODIS Terra and 2:30 PM for VIIRS) as well as different cloud masks. The results of this work will provide a quantitative assessment of the continuity of the snow-cover data records for use in development of an EDR of snow cover.\nhttp://modis-snow-ice.gsfc.nasa.gov/\nRiggs, G.A. and D.K.

Here, we report for the first time on the spatial variations of the hydrographic properties of the warm, subsurface subtropical-origin waters penetrating the numerous previously unmapped glacial fjords of Northwest Greenland spanning more than 1000 km of coast between Upernavik Fjord (73°N) and Inglefield Gulf (77.5°N). To interpret the distribution of hydrographic properties of these warm subsurface waters above the inner continental shelf and within glacial fjords, we analyze more than 5500 km of new high-resolution swath bathymetry and 1000 km of single-beam bathymetry data. These new bathymetry data reveal a network of deep troughs within which warm subsurface waters can penetrate from the continental shelf into glacial fjords and numerous shallow sills and ledges that inhibit the warm water contact with glacial termini. While these new hydrographic data are synoptic and therefore cannot reveal information about hydrographic temporal variability, the positive identification of warm waters in some glacial fjords in mid to late summer when subglacial discharge-fueled submarine melting is greatest provides useful information about the vulnerability of certain marine-terminating glaciers to future ocean-forced thinning, retreat, and acceleration.",

Multiple repeated observations are required to observe the effects of changing environmental conditions on vegetation. This study examines the use of optical signals to determine inputs to a light use efficiency (LUE) model describing productivity of a cornfield where repeated observations of carbon flux, spectral reflectance and fluorescence were collected. Data were collected at the Optimizing Production Inputs for Economic and Environmental Enhancement (OPE3) fields (39.03°N, 76.85°W) at USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. Agricultural Research Service researchers measured CO2 fluxes using eddy covariance methods throughout the growing season. Optical measurements were made from the nearby tower supporting the NASA FUSION sensors. The sensor system consists of two dual channel, upward and downward looking, spectrometers used to simultaneously collect high spectral resolution measurements of reflected and fluoresced light from vegetation canopies at multiple view angles. Estimates of chlorophyll fluorescence, combined with measures of vegetation pigment content and the Photosynthetic Reflectance Index (PRI) derived from the spectral reflectance are compared with CO2 fluxes over diurnal periods for multiple days. The relationships among the different optical measurements indicate that they are providing different types of information on the vegetation and that combinations of these measurements provide improved retrievals of CO2 fluxes than any index alone",

Taking guidance from the agile software development model, the GSA is working towards more agile data management and curation. To date, the GSA’s work has been focused primarily on data rescue. By using workflows that maximize clear communication while encouraging simplicity (e.g., maximizing the amount of work not done or that can be automated), the GSA is bringing decades of dark data into the light. Regular checks by the data rescuer with the data provider (or their proxy) provides quality control without adding an overt burden on either party. Moving forward, these workflows will also allow for more efficient and effective data management.",

            "abstract": "The challenges presented by big data are straining data management software architectures of the past. For smaller existing data facilities, the technical refactoring of software layers become costly to scale across the big data landscape. In response to these challenges, data facilities will need partnerships with external entities for improved solutions to perform tasks such as data cataloging, discovery and reuse, and data integration and processing with provenance.\n\nAt its surface, the concept of linked open data suggests an uncalculated altruism. Yet, in his concept of five star open data, Tim Berners-Lee explains the strategic costs and benefits of deploying linked open data from the perspective of its consumer and producer - a data partnership. The Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) addresses some of the emerging needs of its research community by partnering with groups doing complementary work and linking their respective data layers using linked open data principles. Examples will show how these links, explicit manifestations of partnerships, reduce technical debt and provide a swift flexibility for future considerations.",

            "abstract": "PLUMBER, a recent benchmarking study for the performance of land surface models (LSMs), demonstrated that simple data-driven models outperform modern LSMs at FLUXNET stations. Specifically, data-driven models out-performed LSMs in partitioning net radiation into turbulent heat fluxes over a wide range of performance criteria. The question is why. After all, LSMs combine process understanding with site information and might be expected to outperform simple data-driven models that are trained out-of-sample and that do not include an explicit representation of past states such as soil moisture or heat storage. In other words, the data-driven models have no explicit representation of memory, which we know to be important for land surface energy and moisture states.\nHere, we revisit the PLUMBER results with the aim to understand why simple data-driven models outperform LSMs. First, we analyze the PLUMBER results to determine the conditions under which data-driven models outperform LSMs. We then use the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA) to construct LSMs of varying complexity to relate model performance to process representation. SUMMA is a hydrologic modeling approach that enables a controlled and systematic analysis of alternative modeling options. Results are intended to identify development priorities for LSMs.",

This is achieved via the assimilation of AirMOSS Level 2/3 root-zone soil moisture retrievals into continuous three-dimensional hydrologic modeling of AirMOSS study sites using the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic (PIHM) model.\nIn this presentation, we will describe the results of a comparison analysis between: 1) hourly PIHM profile soil moisture predictions, 2) AirMOSS Level 2/3 root-zone soil moisture retrievals, and 3) and profile soil moisture observations obtained via ground-based instrumentation at multiple AirMOSS study sites. Since any reasonably-sophisticated integration of remotely-sensed and modeled root-zone soil moisture estimates requires information regarding the objective accuracy of each, the results of this analysis will be used to parameterize a data assimilation approach for integrating discrete AirMOSS Level 2/3 products into a continuous integration of the PIHM model. Based on this integration approach, preliminary AirMOSS Level 4 root-zone soil moisture products will be presented and evaluated. Results will highlight the relative limitations of both the AirMOSS Level 2/3 retrievals and PIHM-based estimates and therefore justify the integrated use of both soil moisture products to create an optimized Level 4 root-zone soil moisture analysis.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to use the detrital carbonate (DC) records in sediment cores from the Labrador Sea western margin to study the spatial variability of the carbonate events and inferred sources and routing of glacial meltwater originating from Hudson Strait (HS) as well as potential contributions from Northern Baffin Bay (NBB) ice sheet margins. We use DC in sediment cores as a proxy for glacial meltwater and ice berg drift from these areas. More than 15 sediment cores with published DC, stable oxygen isotope, and radiocarbon stratigraphies provide the data for this study. Marine sediment core MD99-2236 from Cartwright Saddle is used as a template for freshwater forcing from HS outlet. Our hypothesis is that the complex interplay of current systems, shelf and slope bathymetry and location of meltwater and ice berg injection points will affect the spatial distribution of the DC events. In addition, differences in local ocean reservoir age for shelf, slope and open ocean sites may also contribute to offsets in the apparent ages of DC events. Identification of DC peaks also is influenced by sedimentation rates and sampling resolution. Quantitative x-ray diffraction is applied to differentiate the carbonate provenance between HS (calcite dominated) and NBB (dolomite dominated). To objectively correlate DC events, we study mostly published core data, removing all earlier assumptions about marine reservoir age and assess all core chronologies with their associated errors. Our results so far show that none of the DC events is found in all sites and no record captures all of the DC events. Despite this, some of the larger events occur in several records and are found along the entire Labrador margin allowing robust temporal and spatial mapping of the meltwater pathways. The end product will be a temporal and spatial reconstruction of meltwater and ice berg routing from HS and NBB outlets to the western N. Atlantic and serve as a contribution to modeling studies of the effects of freshwater forcing on ocean circulation and climate.",

The region relies on winter precipitation, and especially snow, for most of its water supply during the summer. This past winter has been anomalously warm, leading to record low snow in many places, providing what many have called a preview of snow conditions that may become common by the middle of this century.

            "abstract": "The timing and rate of permafrost degradation are two of the major factors in determining the increase of carbon emissions from thawing permafrost. These changes in permafrost vary both temporally and spatially and do not happen everywhere at the same time. A good example of this heterogeneity is provided by our permafrost data collection in Alaska. Most of the permafrost observatories in Alaska show substantial warming of permafrost since the 1980s. The magnitude of warming varies with location, but is typically between 0.5 and 2°C. However, this warming is not linear in time and not spatially uniform. A short warmer period in the early 1980s was followed by a relative cooling in the mid-1980s. From the late-1980s to the late-1990s, the permafrost and active layer temperatures were increasing. During the first half of the 2000s, permafrost temperatures were not changing significantly at almost all sites in Alaska, except for the sites in the Brooks Range and in its southern foothills were temperature was still increasing. Interesting dynamics in permafrost temperatures have been observed in Alaska since the mid-2000s until present. While permafrost warming resumed on the North Slope of Alaska with a rate of increase between 0.2 to 0.5°C per decade, permafrost temperatures in the Alaskan Interior began a slight cooling trend that has continued during the first half of the 2010s. Most of these changes can be explained by changes in air temperature and snow cover during the observational period. These observations confirm that the future changes in permafrost temperature, in natural undisturbed conditions, will closely follow the changes in climate and as such can be successfully predicted using numerical models forced by established climate change scenarios. In our presentation, we will provide the results from application of our permafrost change models and discuss what this means in terms of potential organic carbon release and its conversion to the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane.",

            "abstract": "We introduce asynchronous parallel implementations of the Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) family of algorithms including DDS, discrete DDS, PA-DDS and DDS-AU. These parallel algorithms are unique from most existing parallel optimization algorithms in the water resources field in that parallel DDS is asynchronous and does not require an entire population (set of candidate solutions) to be evaluated before generating and then sending a new candidate solution for evaluation. One key advance in this study is developing the first parallel PA-DDS multi-objective optimization algorithm. The other key advance is enhancing the computational efficiency of solving optimization problems (such as model calibration) by combining a parallel optimization algorithm with the deterministic model pre-emption concept. These two efficiency techniques can only be combined because of the asynchronous nature of parallel DDS. Model pre-emption functions to terminate simulation model runs early, prior to completely simulating the model calibration period for example, when intermediate results indicate the candidate solution is so poor that it will definitely have no influence on the generation of further candidate solutions. The computational savings of deterministic model preemption available in serial implementations of population-based algorithms (e.g., PSO) disappear in synchronous parallel implementations as these algorithms.\nIn addition to the key advances above, we implement the algorithms across a range of computation platforms (Windows and Unix-based operating systems from multi-core desktops to a supercomputer system) and package these for future modellers within a model-independent calibration software package called Ostrich as well as MATLAB versions. Results across multiple platforms and multiple case studies (from 4 to 64 processors) demonstrate the vast improvement over serial DDS-based algorithms and highlight the important role model pre-emption plays in the performance of parallel, pre-emptable DDS algorithms. Case studies include single- and multiple-objective optimization problems in water resources model calibration and in many cases linear or near linear speedups are observed.",

            "abstract": "A general warming trend in permafrost temperatures has triggered permafrost degradation in Alaska, especially at locations influenced by human activities. Various phenomena related to permafrost degradation are already commonly observed, including increased rates of coastal and riverbank erosion, increased occurrences of retrogressive thaw slumps and active layer detachment slides, and the disappearance of tundra lakes. The combination of thawing permafrost and erosion is damaging local community infrastructure such as buildings, roads, airports, pipelines, water and sanitation facilities, and communication systems. The potential scale of direct ecological and economical damage due to degrading permafrost has just begun to be recognized. While the projected changes in permafrost are generally available on global and regional scales, these projections cannot be effectively employed to estimate the societal impacts because of their coarse resolution. Intrinsic problems with the classical “spatial grid” approach in spatially distributed modeling applications preclude the use of this modeling approach to solve the above stated problem. Two types of models can be used to study permafrost dynamics in this case. One approach is a site-specific application of the GIPL2.0 permafrost model and another is a very high (tens to hundred meter) resolution spatially distributed version of the same model. The results of properly organized field measurements are also needed to calibrate and validate these models for specific locations and areas of interest. We are currently developing a “landscape unit” approach that allows practically unlimited spatial resolution of the modeling products. Classification of the study area into particular “landscape units” should be performed in accordance with the main factors controlling the expression of climate on permafrost in the study area, typically things such as vegetation, hydrology, soil properties, topography, etc. In areas with little topographic relief, vegetation is often a good indicator and it typically integrates other important permafrost factors (e.g. hydrology and soil properties) as vegetation has specific requirements for establishment and growth. The principles of this approach and several examples of its application will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The eddy covariance method directly measures carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes for long periods of time and with footprints up to hundreds of meters in size. Any ecosystem process that alters how gases and energy move between the atmosphere and soil/vegetation can affect these fluxes. Eddy covariance is vulnerable to systematic errors and uncertainy, particular through relying on assumptions about surface characteristics. Additionally, spatial variation within a site can cause more uncertainty in these measurements and lack of replication in many eddy covariance studies makes statistical analysis of carbon fluxes challenging. We tested if there are significant differences between co-located and simultaneous CO2 flux measurements over a uniform crop surface, and if the differences increase if we measure different flux footprint areas over the same field. During the summer of 2014, three matched instrumented 2.5-m high towers were co-located and then periodically separated by moving at 50 m intervals along a north-south transect on an alfalfa/trefoil field and a spring wheat field in Southern Manitoba, Canada to compare CO­2 fluxes. Georeferenced leaf area index measurements were taken in 50 m grid of each field to establish uniformity of the source/sink within a footprint. Diurnal differences of similar magnitude in the CO2 ­fluxes were found in both the co-located experiment and the spatially separated intervals. Despite rigorous calibration during the experiment, some differences were caused by the measurement systems rather than by variation within the field. Interpretation of the spatial variation in leaf area index is being used to determine the contribution caused by difference in source/sink contributions to the flux footprint areas when the towers were spatially separated.",

            "abstract": "Post-petascale supercomputers are now available to solve complex scientific problems that were thought unreachable a few decades ago. They also bring a cohort of concerns tied to obtaining optimum performance. Several issues are currently being investigated by the HPC community. These include energy consumption, fault resilience, scalability of the current parallel paradigms, workflow management, I/O performance and feature extraction with large datasets. In this presentation, we focus on the last three issues.\nIn the context of seismic imaging and inversion, in particular for simulations based on adjoint methods, workflows are well defined.\nThey consist of a few collective steps (e.g., mesh generation or model updates) and of a large number of independent steps (e.g., forward and adjoint simulations of each seismic event, pre- and postprocessing of seismic traces). The greater goal is to reduce the time to solution, that is, obtaining a more precise representation of the subsurface as fast as possible. This brings us to consider both the workflow in its entirety and the parts comprising it. The usual approach is to speedup the purely computational parts based on code optimization in order to reach higher FLOPS and better memory management. This still remains an important concern, but larger scale experiments show that the imaging workflow suffers from severe I/O bottlenecks. Such limitations occur both for purely computational data and seismic time series. The latter are dealt with by the introduction of a new Adaptable Seismic Data Format (ASDF). Parallel I/O libraries, namely HDF5 and ADIOS, are used to drastically reduce the cost of disk access. Parallel visualization tools, such as VisIt, are able to take advantage of ADIOS metadata to extract features and display massive datasets. Because large parts of the workflow are embarrassingly parallel, we are investigating the possibility of automating the imaging process with the integration of scientific workflow management tools, specifically Pegasus.",

            "abstract": "The host rock immediately surrounding a nuclear waste repository has the potential to undergo a complex set of physical and chemical processes starting from construction of the facility until many years after completion. Understanding the relevant processes of fracture evolution may be key to supporting the attendant safety arguments for such a facility. In the present phase of the international research project DECOVALEX, the experimental work of Yasuhara et al [1,2] has been examined, wherein artificial fractures in novaculite and granite are subject to a mechanical confining pressure, variable fluid flows and different applied temperatures. Differential pressures across the samples were measured to determine permeability and hence hydraulic aperture evolution, while at the same time the chemical composition of the outflows were continually sampled. For the novaculite experiments, the fracture surfaces’ topography were characterised using a high-resolution laser profilometer (see Figure 1), and post-experimental characterisation of the aperture was performed using a Wood’s metal fracture cast.\nThis paper presents a synthesis of the ongoing work of six separate research teams. A range of approaches are presented including 2D and 3D high resolution coupled THMC models. Homogenised ‘single compartment’ models of the fracture have also been adopted, attempting to upscale the processes so that they could be used in larger network or effective continuum models. Particular attention is given to the competing roles of aqueous geochemistry, pressure solution, stress corrosion and pure mechanics in order to reproduce the experimental observations. The results of the work show that while good, physically plausible representations of the experiment can be obtained, there is considerable uncertainty in the relative importance of the various processes and that the parameterisation of these processes can be closely linked to the physical interpretation of the fracture surface topography.\n",

            "abstract": "The perennial grasses miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) have been proposed as cellulosic feedstocks for U.S. biofuel production because their high productivity and low inputs could reduce net CO2 emissions. Possible biogeochemical feedbacks of widespread production have been extensively studied, but less attention has been given to the two-way biophysical interactions between the land surface and regional climate. Miscanthus uses significantly more water than maize, resulting in large evapotranspiration (ET) increases upon conversion from maize to Miscanthus that could impact regional precipitation, precipitation recycling, and soil moisture. In this study, we simulate perennial grass production in a fully coupled regional climate model with dynamic vegetation, enabling an investigation into the two-way responses between these potential biofuels and the climate over the Mississippi River Basin. We incorporated algorithms of miscanthus and switchgrass growth and management from the Agro-IBIS model into with WRF-CLM4crop, a version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to the Community Land Model with dynamic crop growth and irrigation enabled. Using suggested production regions from the United States Department of Energy, we performed simulations driven with 10 years of NCEP-DOE Reanalysis (NCEP2) data, with 25%, 50%, and 75% of current croplands replaced by perennial grass feedstocks. Our results provide spatially explicit maps of how simulated ET increased with conversion and the resulting regional cooling, greater precipitation, and precipitation recycling over the region.",

            "abstract": "There have been vast changes in how net primary production (NPP) is consumed by humans and animals during the Holocene beginning with a potential increase in availability following the Pleistocene megafauna extinctions. This was followed by the development of agriculture which began to gradually restrict availability of NPP for wild animals. Finally, humans entered the industrial era using non-plant based energies to power societies. Here I ask the following questions about these three energy transitions: 1. How much NPP energy may have become available following the megafauna extinctions? 2. When did humans, through agriculture and domestic animals, consume more NPP than wild mammals in each country? 3. When did humans and wild mammals use more energy than was available in total NPP in each country? To answer this last question I calculate NPP consumed by wild animals, crops, livestock, and energy use (all converted to units of MJ) and compare this with the total potential NPP (also in MJ) for each country. We develop the term “ecological bankruptcy” to refer to the level of consumption where not all energy needs can be met by the country’s NPP. Currently, 82 countries and a net population of 5.4 billion are in the state of ecologically bankruptcy, crossing this threshold at various times over the past 40 years. By contrast, only 52 countries with a net population of 1.2 billion remain ecologically solvent. Overall, the Holocene has seen remarkable changes in consumption patterns of NPP, passing through three distinct phases. Humans began in a world where there was 1.6-4.1% unclaimed NPP to consume. From 1700-1850, humans began to consume more than wild animals (globally averaged). At present, >82% of people live in countries where not even all available plant matter could satisfy our energy demands.",

            "abstract": "The long-term stability of ITRF is critical to the most challenging scientific applications such as the slow variation of sea level, and of ice sheet loading in Greenland and Antarctica. In 2010, the National Research Council recommended aiming for stability at the level of 1 mm/decade in the ITRF origin and scale. This requires that the ITRF include many globally-distributed sites with motions that are predictable to within a few mm/decade, with a significant number of sites having collocated stations of multiple techniques. Quantifying the stability of ITRF stations can be useful to understand stability of ITRF parameters, and to help the selection and weighting of ITRF stations.\nHere we apply a new suite of techniques for an independent assessment of ITRF site velocities. Our “GPS Imaging” suite is founded on the principle that, for the case of large numbers of data, the trend can be estimated objectively, automatically, robustly, and accurately by applying non-parametric techniques, which use quantile statistics (e.g., the median). At the foundation of GPS Imaging is the estimator “MIDAS” (Median Interannual Difference Adjusted for Skewness). MIDAS estimates the velocity with a realistic error bar based on sub-sampling the coordinate time series. MIDAS is robust to step discontinuities, outliers, seasonality, and heteroscedasticity. Common-mode noise filters enhance regional- to continental-scale precision in MIDAS estimates, just as they do for standard estimation techniques. Secondly, in regions where there is sufficient spatial sampling, GPS Imaging uses MIDAS velocity estimates to generate a regionally-representative velocity map. For this we apply a median spatial filter to despeckle the maps.\nWe use GPS Imaging to address two questions: (1) How well do the ITRF site velocities derived by parametric estimation agree with non-parametric techniques? (2) Are ITRF site velocities regionally representative? These questions aim to get a handle on (1) the accuracy of ITRF site velocities as a function of characteristics of contributing station data, such as number of step parameters and total time span; and (2) evidence of local processes affecting site velocity, which may impact site stability. Such quantification can be used to rank stations in terms the risk that they may pose to the stability of ITRF.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we examine precipitation and temperature forecasts during El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in six models in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), including the CFSv2, CanCM3, CanCM4, FLOR, GEOS5, and CCSM4 models, by comparing the model-based ENSO composites to the observed. The composite analysis is conducted using the 1982-2010 hindcasts for each of the six models with selected ENSO episodes based on the seasonal Ocean Nino Index (ONI) just prior to the date the forecasts were initiated. Two sets of composites are constructed over the North American continent: one based on precipitation and temperature anomalies, the other based on their probability of occurrence in a tercile-based system. The composites apply to monthly mean conditions in November, December, January, February, and March, respectively, as well as to the five-month aggregates representing the winter conditions. For the anomaly composites, we use the anomaly correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error against the observed composites for evaluation. For the probability composites, unlike conventional probabilistic forecast verification assuming binary outcomes to the observations, both model and observed composites are expressed in probability terms. Performance metrics for such validation are limited. Therefore, we develop a probability anomaly correlation measure and a probability score for assessment, so the results are comparable to the anomaly composite evaluation. We found that all NMME models predict ENSO precipitation patterns well during wintertime; however, some models have large discrepancies between the model temperature composites and the observed. The skill is higher for the multi-model ensemble, as well as the five-month aggregates. Comparing to the anomaly composites, the probability composites have superior skill in predicting ENSO temperature patterns and are less sensitive to the sample used to construct the composites, suggesting that probability composites are a better tool for predicting ENSO impacts over the North American continent.",

            "abstract": "Snow cover often exhibits large spatial variability over mountainous regions where variations in elevation, aspect, vegetation, winds, and orographic precipitation all modulate snow cover. Under climate change, reductions in mountain snow cover are likely to substantially amplify regional warming via the snow-albedo feedback. To capture this important feedback it is crucial that regional climate models (RCMs) adequately simulate spatial and temporal variations in snow cover.\nSnow cover simulated by high-resolution RCMs over the central Rocky Mountains of the United States is evaluated. RCM simulations were conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model on a 4 km horizontal grid forced by reanalysis boundary conditions over a seven-year time period. A pair of simulations is considered that differ in the domain size (regional vs. continental) and the land surface model (Noah vs. Noah-MP) employed. RCM output is compared with high-resolution gridded satellite analyses of surface albedo and fractional snow cover derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).\nResults reveal that both RCMs are generally successful at reproducing the observed seasonal cycle and interannual variability of snow extent over the high terrain of the Rockies. However, in simulations using the Noah land surface model (LSM), sub-grid scale fractional snow covered area of grid cells containing snow is systematically too high compared to observations, often exceeding observations by more than 0.2. This bias in fractional snow cover leads to a substantial positive bias in regional surface albedo. Simulations using the Noah-MP LSM produce more realistic variations in fractional snow cover and surface albedo, likely due to its more-realistic treatment of canopy effects.\nWe quantify how differences in simulated snow cover affect the strength of the snow-albedo feedback under climate change. Both RCMs were used to conduct representative 7-year simulations of a warmed climate using the pseudo global warming framework. These simulations show markedly different spatial and seasonal patterns of warming that are linked to differences in snow-albedo feedback strength and the treatment of fractional snow cover.",

            "abstract": "Strombolian activity is characterized by quasi-periodic, short-lived explosions, which vary greatly in magnitude. The explosions are understood to be driven by the bursting of large, overpressured ‘slugs’ of magmatic gas, which have ascended the conduit. We use scaled laboratory analogue experiments and numerical modelling to investigate the impact of varying the boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the volcanic conduit, and find that they strongly influence the character and explosivity of strombolian explosions.\nThe presence of a viscous plug at the top of the conduit has been inferred from recent studies of strombolian pyroclasts, which indicate that degassed, crystal-rich magma, and gas-rich, crystal-poor magma co-exist and mingle in the shallow part of the volcanic conduit. We investigate the impact of the plug on eruptive behaviour experimentally, and find that the presence of a viscous plug enhances explosivity by increasing the overpressure within the ascending gas slug. We also find that the plug is prone to fluid-dynamic instability as the gas slug passes through it, causing the low and high viscosity magma analogues to intermingle, explaining the origin of the mingled pyroclasts observed in nature. The instabilities can also cause the slug to break into smaller pockets of gas, providing an explanation for pulsations in strombolian explosions, recently revealed by high-speed videography.\nSeparate analogue experiments, and numerical modelling, are used to investigate slug ascent under contrasting lower boundary conditions: zero-flux; and constant-pressure. Analogue conduit experiments typically use a zero-flux lower boundary (i.e. the base of the pipe is sealed). We show that a more-realistic constant-pressure boundary condition dramatically changes slug ascent velocity and the development of overpressure. Together these two studies constitute a new framework for understanding the role of the boundary conditions in shaping strombolian explosive activity.",

            "abstract": "Slow, large-scale magnetostrophic wave modes are expected to develop in rapidly-rotating magnetohydrodynamic systems. These slow modes arise due to a leading order balance between Coriolis and Lorentz forces, with negligible effects of fluid inertia. Such slow modes have long been argued to be the primary cause of the long period (e.g., century-scale) variations in observations of the geomagnetic field. Yet, to date, such slow modes have yet to develop in global-scale numerical models of planetary dynamo action.\nHere we present the results of closely coupled laboratory-numerical simulations of rapidly rotating magnetoconvection in liquid gallium, in which we find strong evidence for slow modes developing near, as well as beyond, the onset of convection. Preliminary results from an associated survey of numerical simulations are allowing us to determine under what range of conditions slow convective modes exist. Thus far, it appears they develop only in low Prandtl number fluids, in which the thermal diffusivity significantly exceeds the viscous diffusivity, as occurs in liquid metals. Our findings suggest more metal-like fluid properties are necessary for the development of slow modes in convection-driven global-scale dynamo models.",

In this paper a spectral data analysis method is\nused to quantitatively assess the spatial and temporal scales on which each\nof these aspects of long-wave dynamics is observed in reanalysis data. Three\ndifferent perspectives are used in this assessment: primitive variables, characteristic\nvariables, and wave variables. To define each wave variable, the\neigenvectors and theoretical wave structures of the equatorial shallow water\nequations are used. Evidence is presented that the range of spatial and temporal\nscales on which long-wave dynamics holds depends on which aspect\nof the dynamics is considered. For example, while meridional winds are an\norder of magnitude smaller than zonal winds over only a very narrow range\nof spatiotemporal scales (planetary wavenumber |k| < 2), an examination of\nmeridional geostrophic balance and inertio-gravity waves indicates long-wave\ndynamics for a broader range of scales (|k| < 5).

            "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate feedbacks between groundwater dynamics, overland flow, land surface and vegetation processes, and atmospheric boundary layer development that significantly affect local and regional climate across a range of climatic conditions. Furthermore, the type and distribution of vegetation cover alters land–atmosphere water and energy fluxes, as well as runoff generation and overland flow processes. These interactions can result in significant feedbacks on local and regional climate. In mountainous regions, recent research has shown that spatial and temporal variability in annual evapotranspiration, and thus water budgets, is strongly dependent on lateral groundwater flow; however, the full effects of these feedbacks across varied terrain (e.g. from plains to mountains) are not well understood. Here, we present a high-resolution, integrated hydrology model that covers much of continental North America and encompasses the Mississippi and Colorado watersheds. The model is run in a fully-transient manner at hourly temporal resolution incorporating fully-coupled land energy states and fluxes with integrated surface and subsurface hydrology. Connections are seen between hydrologic variables (such as water table depth) and land energy fluxes (such as latent heat) and spatial and temporal scaling is shown to span many orders of magnitude. Using these transient simulations as a proof of concept, we present a vision for future integrated simulation capabilities.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the causes of declining water quality and aquatic communities in urban streams requires a clear picture of the spatiotemporal dynamics of human infrastructure systems as a watershed undergoes urbanization. Urban watershed studies typically employ one of two approaches, 1) long-term watershed studies that examine changes over time in one watershed or 2) an urbanization gradient that examines changes during a snapshot in time among watersheds spanning rural to urban land use. We used both approaches to investigate hydrologic changes associated with urbanization in nine U.S. cities. We asked do development trajectories and hydrologic responses due to urbanization vary among cities and how does the approach used influence the interpretation of results. Daily mean streamflow records from USGS flow gages were used to calculate a range of ecologically relevant hydrologic metrics from 2000 to 2012 for the gradient approach and since the 1930’s and 1940’s in six long-term watersheds. Results from the urbanization gradient approach indicated similar, linear development trajectories among the nine cities but heterogeneity in the magnitude of hydrologic changes. In contrast, the long-term approach indicated development trajectories could be characterized by three stages that varied in development intensity, timing, and length. Results from the long-term watersheds indicated linear and rapid, non-linear increases in flow metrics across the time series. Regression analysis indicated that the intensity of urbanization during the peak growth period was the strongest driver of the magnitude of observed stream flow changes. Overall, the long-term approach provided a much clearer window into not only the type of hydrologic changes during watershed urbanization, but also the timing of and potential triggers driving flow changes.",

            "abstract": "The Yellowstone hotspot is the product of plume-plate interaction that has produced a large and active silicic volcanic field within the N. American Plate. Our newest research on Yellowstone includes: 1) A recent discovery by seismic imaging that the Yellowstone volcanic system extends as a connected magmatic system from at least 1000 km deep in the mantle with melt ascending upward in a WNW tilted plume to a newly discovered lower-crustal magma body at 20-45 km depth and 4x larger than the shallow crustal reservoir 5-15 km deep. Moreover the shallow 70 km NE-SW crustal magma body unexpectedly extends 15 km NE well beyond Yellowstone’s volcanic field a distance that N. American Plate would advance in 640,000 years, i.e., the time of the last Yellowstone super eruption and hence reflecting plate motion over the Yellowstone mantle plume; 2) Yellowstone’s giant mantle-crust connected magma system represents ~48,000 km3 with ~1800 km3 of melt that fuels Yellowstone’s extraordinarily high heat flux of up to ~ 3 Watts/meter2 that in turn drives Yellowstone’s world renown hydrothermal system; and 3) How migration of magma vertically into and laterally out of the crustal magma reservoir, measured by GPS and earthquake correlation, reveals the mechanics of Yellowstone’s “natural volcano pressure relief valve” that retards volcanic eruptions for thousands of years, but that occasionally breach the brittle-ductile transition in volcanic eruptions. We will also discuss the most recent and largest earthquake in Yellowstone in over 30 years, a magnitude 4.8 event, on March 30, 2014 near Norris Geyser Basin. This earthquake was part of a larger sequence of swarm activity in the Norris area that began in September 2013 and continued into June 2014. GPS derived deformation at Norris revealed unusually high uplift rates at ~15 cm/yr. attaining 60 mm of uplift at the time of the MW4.8 event and that dramatically reversed to subsidence at rates of ~17 cm/yr. Notably, however the much larger Yellowstone volcanic caldera began a new episode of pronounced uplift in late 2013 a few months prior to the Norris event suggesting caldera-wide magmatic migration at the NE caldera area that drove the Norris event. These data indeed confirm that the Yellowstone hotspot is a “living, breathing, shaking, baking” feature of global significance.",

            "abstract": "In our current era of intensive earth observation the time is ripe to shift away from studies relying on single sensors or single products to the synergistic use of multiple sensors and products at complementary spatial, temporal, and spectral scales. The use of multiple time series can not only reveal hotspots of change in land surface dynamics, but can indicate plausible proximate causes of the changes and suggest their possible consequences. Here we explore recent trends in the land surface dynamics of exemplary semi-arid grasslands in the western hemisphere, including the shortgrass prairie of eastern Colorado and New Mexico, the sandhills prairie of Nebraska, the “savana gramineo-lenhosa” variety of cerrado in central Brazil, and the pampas of Argentina. Observational datasets include (1) NBAR-based vegetation indices, land surface temperature, and evapotranspiration from MODIS, (2) air temperature, water vapor, and vegetation optical depth from AMSR-E and AMSR2, (3) surface air temperature, water vapor, and relative humidity from AIRS, and (4) surface shortwave, longwave, and total net flux from CERES. The spatial resolutions of these nested data include 500 m, 1000 m, 0.05 degree, 25 km, and 1 degree. We apply the nonparametric Seasonal Kendall trend test to each time series independently to identify areas of significant change. We then examine polygons of co-occurrence of significant change in two or more types of products using the surface radiation and energy budgets as guides to interpret the multiple changes. Changes occurring across broad areas are more likely to be of climatic origin; whereas, changes that are abrupt in space and time and of limited area are more likely anthropogenic. Results illustrate the utility of considering multiple remote sensing products as complementary views of land surface dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Recirculating in-stream regions in river flows play a significant role in many physical and biogeochemical processes that control the water quality and fate of contaminants, producing surface storage zones with lower velocities and stresses in the stream. Understanding the behavior of contaminants in these regions of recirculation can provide insight on the impact of lateral cavities on transport in the entire stream. In this investigation, we develop an upscaled, effective model to describe the emptying rate of a contaminant inside a lateral cavity in a channel flow and apply it to data from 3D numerical simulations, based on a DES approach, coupled with an advection-diffusion model to simulate the transport of a passive scalar. Current models of contaminants exiting recirculation zones usually consist of an equation with a first-order mass exchange process between the open channel and the lateral cavity, where the contaminant transfer is modeled as proportional to the mean concentration difference between the cavity and the main channel. Our three-dimensional simulations show that such a model does not work, as the cavity does not appear to be well mixed at all times, but rather is made up of two distinct regions – a central recirculating core and an outer flow. We improve upon the first-order model, by including both storage zones and accounting for exchanges between them. By including these additional exchange processes we are able to successfully reproduce numerical observations over the full range of observed timescales.\nThis research has been supported by Fondecyt grant 1130940 and the Notre Dame Department of Engineering.",

            "abstract": "Changes in field-aligned currents are mediated by the propagation of shear Alfvén waves along geomagnetic field lines. These waves are largely generated by magnetospheric convection on both large and small spatial scales. The interaction of Alfvén waves with the ionosphere results in the reflection and/or absorption of these waves, depending on the ionospheric conductance. Shear Alfvén waves can also be excited by mode conversion from compressional waves, both due to inhomogeneity of the Alfvén speed in the magnetosphere and to the Hall conductivity in the ionosphere. Such mode conversion can lead to the development of field line resonances, which can lead to the formation of small-scale field-aligned currents. Multi-satellite observations from missions such as Cluster and Swarm can lead to a better understanding of the fine-scale structure of these field-aligned currents. These interactions will be illustrated by means of a three-dimensional model for the propagation of MHD waves in the dipolar regions of the magnetosphere that includes conductivity differences between day and night sides.",

            "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) is the most widespread and important mosquito-borne pathogen in North America. Since its emergence in the western hemisphere in 1999, human WNV disease has continued to exhibit recurrent outbreaks. Perplexingly, the incidence of this tropical disease has been highest in the cold-temperate climates of the Northern Great Plains (NGP). The spatial and temporal distributions of the vector mosquitoes and bird hosts, and consequently the risk of disease in humans, are strongly influenced by temperature, precipitation, vegetation, soils, and land use. We have utilized satellite remote sensing to map these environmental factors through time and develop models of disease risk. Outbreak years in South Dakota were preceded by warm winters, and WNV cases were most likely to occur during the hottest weeks of summer. Hot spots of persistent WNV transmission within the state were associated with rural land cover as well as patterns of physiography and climate. These models are currently being integrated into the South Dakota Mosquito Early Warning system (SDMIS), an automated WNV outbreak detection system that integrates remotely-sensed environmental indicators with vector abundance and infection data from a statewide mosquito surveillance network. The major goal of this effort is to leverage global environmental monitoring datasets to provide up-to-date, locally relevant information that can improve the effectiveness of mosquito control and disease prevention activities. This system was implemented for the first time during the summer of 2015. We will review the outcomes of this implementation, including the underlying influences of temperature on WNV risk, a preliminary statewide WNV risk map, and dynamic risk predictions made during the 2015 WNV season. Lessons learned as well as plans for future years will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The goal of tsunami warning, as a system for prediction of potential tsunami impact at coastlines, requires rapid detection, assessment and model assimilation of available tsunami real-time data.\nHistorically, the earthquake magnitude has been used as a proxy of tsunami impact estimates. Real-time seismic data has been available for real-time processing for decades and ample amount of seismic data is available for an elaborate post event analysis. This measure of tsunami impact carries significant uncertainties for quantitative tsunami impact estimates, since the ratio between the energy of an earthquake and resultant tsunami (averaging at around 0.1%) varies significantly from one event to another. The other historical stream of data for tsunami warnings have been tide-gage real-time data that are difficult to interpret and have limited forecast value, since tide gages record tsunami impacting the coastlines already.\nNew real-time data streams that have become available to tsunami warning system include real-time deep-ocean tsunami detection (DART system) and GNSS real-time data streams. The data provide new opportunity for real-time tsunami forecast systems. Assimilation of these new data into tsunami forecast capability has potential of increasing the accuracy of the tsunami forecast, thus reducing false alarm rates, providing quick practical tsunami forecast products and, ultimately saving more lives during the tsunami warning event.\nImplication of including new real-time data on tsunami forecast accuracy will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Emerging work on the southern San Andreas Fault reveals a complex pattern of deformation as the fault splays into the Mission Creek, Banning, and Garnet Hill strands where the fault system bounds the Indio Hills and Edom Hill. Work at several sites along the Mission Creek strand show that Quaternary through Holocene slip rates are high (14-21mm/yr; Behr et al., 2010; Blisniuk et al., 2014). Holocene slip rates are low and fairly constant, both at a site 8 km from the SW end of the Banning (2-6 mm/yr, this study) and at another site 30 km to the NW (4-5 mm/yr, Gold et al., in press), suggesting slip is efficiently and completely transferred onto the Banning strand. No slip rates exist for the Garnet Hill strand. We compare the horizontal slip rates with structural and geomorphic indices of uplift and deformation in the Indio Hills and Edom Hill using (1) long-term Tertiary bedrock exhumation rates, (2) short-term 10Be-derived, catchment-averaged erosion rates, (3) catchment relief and area and (4) channel steepness, normalized for drainage area. Each metric suggests progressive increase in uplift to the NW along the southwestern 15 km of the Indio Hills; at the NW end of the hills, the abrupt tapering of elevation suggests a termination of uplift. This is consistent with geophysical studies that confirm no resolvable bedrock in the area (Catchings et al., 2009; Fuis et al., 2012). Long-term exhumation and geomorphic indices indicate uplift of Edom Hill is relatively high (10Be rates are pending), so we hypothesize that the location of Edom Hill just W of the peak in uplift of the Indio Hills reflects complete transfer of vertical slip off the Banning strand onto the Garnet Hill strand which dips below Edom Hill. Overall, the fault geometry and uplift patterns are consistent with the more western orientation of each successive splay; the orientation produces a geographically restricted pulse in bedrock uplift concentrated within the intersection of the fault strands.",

            "abstract": "SAR interferometry has proven to be a reliable method for detecting small displacements due to ground subsidence. Here, we relate ground motion around the lake Mead (Nevada, USA) and lake Siling Co (Tibet, China) measured by InSAR to water loading in order to constrain the rheology of the lithosphere.\nLake Mead, an artificial reservoir, has been filled with water in 1935. We analyzed ~500 interferograms based on 62 ERS images and on 40 ENVISAT images acquired between 1992 and 2010. Interferograms are inverted to solve for the time series of ground motion in the lake Mead area. Temporal smoothing allows to reduce the turbulent atmospheric delays. Spatio-temporal series of the deformation from 1992 to 2010 show a broad subsidence pattern correlated with lake level from 1992 to 2010. We model the deformation, taking into account the water and sediment loading history of the lake since 1935. The two-layer visco-elastic model proposed by Kaufmann and Amelung (2000), with a mantle viscosity of 1018 Pa s, adjusts well the data up to 2001, but overpredicts the deformation after 2001. We will discuss the models that could explain the deformation evolution.\nThe Siling Co lake is the largest endorheic lake in Central Tibet. In 1972-1999 its water level remained stable, while it increased by about 1.0~m/yr in the period 2000-2006. The increased rate gradually stepped down to 0.2~m/yr in 2007-2011. We analysed 107 ERS and Envisat SAR images during the period 1992-2011. The deformation amplitude closely follows the lake level temporal evolution, except that subsidence continues in 2008-2011, while the lake level stagnated. This temporal evolution suggests a non elastic relaxation process taking place at a decade time-scale. Phase delay maps are used to constrain possible layered visco-elastic rheological models. An elastic model could partly explain the observed subsidence rate if elastic moduli are about twice lower than those extracted from Vp/Vs profiles. The surface deformation pattern is also extracted by projecting the phase delay maps against\nthe best-fit model temporal behavior. It shows that deep relaxation in the asthenosphere is negligible at the decade time-scale and\nfavors the existence of a ductile (1-3x1018Pa.s) channel in the deep crust above a more rigid mantle.",

            "abstract": "Recent precipitation observations in mountainous regions do not exhibit the classical orographic enhancement with elevation, especially where fog and multi-layer clouds are persistent. The role of landform in modulating moisture convergence patterns and constraining the thermodynamic environment that supports the development of complex vertical structures of clouds and precipitation is discussed first using observations and model results from the IPHEx (Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment) field campaign in the Southern Appalachian Mountains (SAM). Analysis of the complex spatial heterogeneity of precipitation microphysics in the SAM suggests that seeder-feeder interactions (SFI) among stratiform precipitation, low level clouds (LLC), and fog play a governing role on the diurnal and seasonal cycles of observed precipitation regimes. Further, in the absence of synoptic-scale forcing, results suggest that evapotranspiration makes a significant contribution to the moisture budget in the lower atmosphere, creating super-saturation conditions favorable to CCN activation, LLC formation, and light rainfall. To investigate the role of evapotranspiration on the diurnal cycle of mountain precipitation further, range-scale modeling studies were conducted in the Central Andes. Specifically, high resolution WRF simulations for realistic and quasi-idealized ET withdrawal case-studies show that evapotranspiration fluxes modulated by landform govern convective activity in the lower troposphere, including cloud formation and precipitation processes that account for daily precipitation amounts as high as 50-70% depending on synoptic conditions and season. These studies suggest multiscale vegetation controls of orographic precipitation processes via atmospheric instability on the one hand, and low level super-saturation and local microphysics on the other. A conceptual model of multiscale interactions among vegetation, landform and moist processes over complex topography is presented.",

            "abstract": "Many of the terrestrial models included in Earth system models simulate changes to the land surface from human activities. In the Community Land Model (CLM), for example, irrigation, nitrogen fertilization, soil tillage, wood harvesting, and numerous crop types are represented in addition to anthropogenic land-cover change (e.g., deforestation, reforestation, and afforestation). These land uses are included in the models because they have a strong influence on the hydrological cycle (irrigation), crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions (nitrogen fertilization, crop type), and carbon storage (wood harvesting, tillage). However, the representation of these processes in Earth system models is uncertain, as is the specification of transient changes from 1850 through the historical era and into the future. A more fundamental aspect of land surface models is the coupling of land and atmosphere through exchanges of energy, mass, and momentum. Here, too, anthropogenic activities can affect climate through land-cover change and land management. Eddy covariance flux tower analyses suggest that the land management effects are as significant as the land-cover change effects. These analyses pose a challenge to land surface models - How well do the models simulate the effects of land management (e.g., changes in leaf area index or community composition) on surface flux exchange with the atmosphere? Here I use the CLM and a new, advanced multilayer canopy flux model to illustrate challenges in model surface fluxes and the influence of land management on surface fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Earth system model simulations of the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle show large multi-model spread in the carbon-concentration and carbon-climate feedback parameters. Large differences among models are also seen in their simulation of global vegetation and soil C stocks and other aspects of the C cycle, prompting concern about model uncertainty and our ability to faithfully represent fundamental aspects of the terrestrial C cycle in Earth system models. Benchmarking analyses that compare model simulations with common datasets have been proposed as a means to assess model fidelity with observations, and various model-data fusion techniques have been used to reduce model biases. While such efforts will reduce multi-model spread, they may not help reduce uncertainty (and increase confidence) in projections of the C cycle over the twenty-first century. Many ecological and biogeochemical processes represented in Earth system models are poorly understood at both the site scale and across large regions, where biotic and edaphic heterogeneity are important. Our experience with the Community Land Model (CLM) suggests that large uncertainty in the terrestrial C cycle and its feedback with climate change is an inherent property of biological systems. The challenge of representing life in Earth system models, with the rich diversity of lifeforms and complexity of biological systems, may necessitate a multitude of modeling approaches to capture the range of possible outcomes. Such models should encompass a range of plausible model structures. We distinguish between model parameter uncertainty and model structural uncertainty. Focusing on improved parameter estimates may, in fact, limit progress in assessing model structural uncertainty associated with realistically representing biological processes. Moreover, higher confidence may be achieved through better process representation, but this does not necessarily reduce uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Managing groundwater during California’s drought and satisfying the requirements of the 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act will require multiple approaches to quantifying rates of change in groundwater storage in the heavily exploited basins around the state. Mean groundwater residence times are useful for developing sustainability goals in that the mean residence time is a measure of the aquifer turnover, or renewal time. The California Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment program is unique among groundwater monitoring programs in that multiple analyses allow estimation of groundwater residence time. For example, over 4,000 tritium and noble gas analyses have been carried out in wells across California, allowing calculation of tritium-helium groundwater age, spatial analysis of groundwater residence times, and identification of the depth of the transition from modern to pre-modern groundwater. Areas of rapid turnover identified by young ages can be compared with areas that have been identified as being hydrogeologically vulnerable based on physical measures such as mapped permeability, confining conditions, or recharge/discharge rates.\nApplication of groundwater residence time as a tool for sustainable groundwater management has advantages and potential pitfalls. The uncertainty associated with calculated ages and the complexity of broad age distributions in long-screened wells are some of the associated challenges. However, geospatial analysis of isotopic age data prove useful for highlighting areas where isotopic ages are not in agreement with other measures of groundwater renewal time, and where ages may therefore be helpful in setting sustainability goals. Initial comparisons suggest that isotopic ages delineate the extent of influence of artificial recharge more precisely than numerical models and that some areas in the Sierra foothills and Coast Range, identified as active recharge areas, host pre-modern groundwater, suggesting the need for a cautious assessment of sustainability.",

At a riparian aquifer near Rifle, CO, we tracked over six months the biogeochemical response within the aquifer to an annual pulse of dissolved oxygen (DO) that results from snowmelt-driven changes in Colorado River stage. In reduced portions of the aquifer (naturally reduced zones; NRZs) the re-oxidation of abundant iron sulfide minerals was the dominant oxygen-consuming process, and resulted in little DO intrusion into the deeper aquifer. In less reduced areas, DO intruded through the entire vertical profile of the aquifer. Across both regions, these perturbations resulted in changes to the microbial community structure, and aqueous metal pools. Two potentially different mechanisms of uranium mobilization were observed; (1) re-oxidation of reduced U(IV) phases in response to DO intrusion, and (2) mobilization of U(VI) from the vadose zone during water table rise. This high-resolution, long-term monitoring of aquifer biogeochemistry at the Rifle site has revealed dynamic microbial and geochemical responses to predictable, annual hydrologic perturbations, and offers an opportunity to further refine modeling approaches for such regions.",

Potential consequences of submarine landslides include damage to seabed infrastructure, offshore facilities, as well as generation or enhancement of tsunamis. MTDs are common on the modern seafloor and within the stratigraphic record.  Slides, slumps and debris flows can be constituents of MTDs and can co-occur in the same event or depositional unit. Recent research indicates that relationships exist between MTD geological setting, causal mechanisms, and geometries. Quantitative data analysis suggests that MTD morphometric parameters can be used to link these three parameters. Despite many advances in this field, it still remains unclear how to definitively identify pre-conditioning factors and triggers of submarine landslides in modern slopes, and how submarine landslides evolve after initiation. In addition, new questions regarding the interaction between submarine landslides and active marine processes, such as bottom currents and fluid flow, have emerged.\nOne of the mandates of the S4SLIDE (IGCP-640) project, a joint endeavor of UNESCO and IGCP that represents the broad field of submarine landslide research, is to facilitate interactions at an international level among scientists, industry and government representatives to advance our knowledge on a number of outstanding science questions: (i) What is the nature of the interaction between current-controlled sedimentation and submarine landslides? (ii) What role do transient turbulent-laminar flows play in the formation of submarine landslides? (iii) Do climatic variations control the occurrence of submarine landslides? (iv) What is the economic significance of submarine landslides? (v) Do we understand the hazards that submarine landslides pose to the environment and to humans? This presentation will cover aspects associated with our current state of knowledge regarding submarine landslides and it will provide a view of future challenges and main research directions.",

            "abstract": "Our knowledge of changes in Southern Hemisphere (SH) circulation during the last millennium is extremely limited in comparison to the Northern Hemisphere (NH) because of the low density of proxy records in the SH. This period provides a good opportunity for placing the recent and twentieth-century SH circulation change into a longer term context and examining the effect of both the anthropogenic and natural external forces on SH circulation. The instrumental data in the SH can provide only at most 100 years of climate information back to the early twentieth century. Thus, we have to rely on various paleoclimate proxy data to evaluate the model’s millennial simulation. Several scientific works have pointed out the existence of climate changes in Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, and South America and their relationships to the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA). There is an advantage to directly comparing model-generated δ18O and observed δ18O in the ice core. However, the models used to produce the millennial simulations in the AR5 and most model comparison projects do not have the ability to produce water isotopes. So a direct comparison between ice-core data and the millennial simulations is impossible. To fill this gap, we take a new approach to generate an Antarctica-wide δ18O field associate with each millennial run. Using the 100 to 200 year climatology of SSTs and sea-ice conditions during three key periods—MWP (1000-1200), LIA (1500-1700), and PWP (1850-present)—generated by existing millennial run to force our isotope GCM model. To better include the meteorological information in our new experiment, corresponding atmospheric states (U, V and T) for each period could also be retrieved from these existing runs, and the atmospheric field of our isotope-enable GCM can be nudged onto this meteorological pattern. Through this method, we can roughly produce a virtual δ18O pattern in Antarctica for each millennial run, which allows us to directly compare it with ice-core data in Antarctica. Thus, a qualitative evaluation of millennial run is feasible for three key periods (WMP, LIA, PWP) by comparing the model simulations and δ18O of ice-core data in Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "Saturn’s largest moon, Titan has been in the spotlight of planetary research for seven decades now. This unique satellite is the only other planetary body besides the Earth to possess a substantial N2 dominated atmosphere, and stable bodies of liquids on its surface. The atmosphere and the surface are strongly coupled, and the liquids on the surface are a consequence of chemistry in the atmosphere. Titan’s dense atmosphere is the site of rich organic chemistry, which begins with the photolytic destruction of the two most abundant atmospheric constituents: N2 and CH4. Photochemical modeling is an important tool in understanding the details of higher-order hydrocarbon and nitrile formation and loss at various altitudes in Titan’s atmosphere, which also affect the rate of deposition onto Titan’s surface. However, significant discrepancies exist among modeled (and measured) atmospheric densities of minor species, which warrant the evaluation of influencing factors in photochemical modeling. Here, we address the role of the choice of N2 photoabsorption cross-section resolution and variations in solar flux with solar cycle on the vertical profiles of various minor species in Titan’s thermosphere. Special attention is placed on the changes in production and loss rates of C2H6 and HCN in response to the varying model parameters. C2H6 is the most important sink for CH4, and is a major component of the surface hydrocarbon lakes. HCN production is the first step in the incorporation of nitrogen into tholins, and is relevant to potential amino acid formation. Furthermore, HCN is the main coolant in Titan’s upper atmosphere. Thus, these two minor species are particularly important in the grand scheme of Titan’s coupled surface-atmosphere system.",

            "abstract": "The interactions between mobile and less mobile hydrologic compartments affect the quality and quantity of water in streams and aquifers, and the cycling of dissolved carbon and nutrients. As new laboratory and field techniques become available, new questions and challenges emerge, including: What do we measure, where, and for how long to fully characterize a system? and, What is the ideal cost-maintenance-benefit relationship that we should strive for to maximize knowledge gained in different field settings? We recently performed a series of field experiments to measure aquatic metabolism and nutrient dynamics in two highly contrasting hydrologic systems, i.e., 1) a wetland-stream alpine, tropical system in Colombia (South America) and 2) a dryland river continuum (1st – 5th stream orders) in New Mexico. In this presentation we discuss how multiple lines of evidence can support the analysis of key aquatic processes and how co-interpretation provides a more complete picture of stream complexity. For this analysis, we deployed YSI EXO2 and 6920 sondes, Turner Designs C-sense and C6 sensors, and Onset HOBO water quality data loggers. Parameters measured by these instruments include conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, pCO2, chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, fluorescein, CDOM, brighteners and water depth. We also injected conservative tracers (i.e., NaCl and NaBr) and the bioreactive tracer resazurin in both experimental sites, and NO3 in the dryland river continuum. NO3 was measured in-situ with Satlantic Submersible Ultraviolet Nitrate Analyzers (SUNA) sensors and in the laboratory using Ion Chromatograph techniques using stream grab samples. Our results highlight the role of both residence times and chemical fluxes in regulating the effective processing of carbon and nutrients. Our results also demonstrate that stream stimuli from controlled experiments are ideal for maximizing the information content derived from short (hours to days) and mid-term (weeks) sensor deployment campaigns.",

Results are based on daily streamflow records from 774 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stations with a record of at least 50 years and ending no earlier than 2011. Five climate indices related to both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are used in this study: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA). A peak-over-threshold approach is used to identify flood peaks, and the relationship between the frequency of flood events and climate drivers is investigated using Poisson regression. The results of this work indicate that changes in the climate system play a significant role in explaining the year-to-year variations in the frequency of flooding over the central United States. Different climate indices are related to the frequency of flood events over different parts of the domain and for different seasons. Analyses related to flood events are extended to examine climate controls on heavy rainfall over this area. The results indicate that the variability of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans can influence the frequency of heavy rainfall days in a manner similar to what was found for flooding, both in terms of geographic regions and seasonality. Therefore, these results suggest that the recent observed changes in the frequency of flood events over the central United States can be largely attributed to changes in the climate system.",

We used isotope tracers to directly measure N2O reduction rates in the eastern tropical North Pacific. Because of incomplete denitrification, N2O cycling rates are an order of magnitude higher than predicted by current models in suboxic regions, and the spatial distribution suggests strong dependence on both organic carbon and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Furthermore, N2O turnover is 20 times higher than the net atmospheric efflux. The rapid rate of this cycling coupled to an expected expansion of suboxic ocean waters implies future increases in N2O emissions.",

            "abstract": "The Global Water and Energy Exchanges project (GEWEX) as part of the World Climate Research Programme has developed in 2013 a new set of science questions and imperatives with one set focusing in particular on the human component in the global water cycle and water resources management. In the past GEWEX primarily focused solely on the geophysical aspects of the water cycle and ignored to a great extent the human influences on it. The increased human interactions with the environment as well as the water cycle at both a local and global scale cannot be ignored any longer, in particular to analyse and interpret observations, improve models and process descriptions and to make more accurate predictions with less uncertainty. The model development has currently progressed to a stage where human interactions and processes can be better described and incorporated though much still remains to be done. One of the biggest challenges in incorporating human interactions into hydrological models and tools is to obtain the required observations, data and information. Water resource management decisions are based upon both geophysical conditions as well as socio-economic circumstances and in many cases also the individual decision makers state of being. To observe and model such processes requires expertise from a multitude of disciplines that are only now are beginning to collaborate more intensely. Another example of where obtaining the required information is tedious and often suspect is in transboundary water systems where this type of information can have direct geopolitical and socio-economical consequences. Earth observation in particular new or more advanced systems can help alleviate some of these issues. For GEWEX the challenge comes with an upside in that the models that incorporate the human component will also have more and better applicability. In this presentation several examples of application of new earth observing systems will be explored with an emphasis on the human interaction as well as in what way these can lead to applications beyond the scientific field.",

            "abstract": "Turbidity currents are the principal agents that transfer clastic sediment from continental margins to the deep ocean. The extensive sedimentary deposits that result can record influences from fluvial transport, ocean currents, and seafloor bathymetry; decoding these controls is key to understanding long-term continental denudation and the formation of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Experimental turbidity currents often use pre-formed, single-thread channels, but more recent experiments and seafloor observations suggest that braided channels also develop in submarine environments. Yet controls on the formation of submarine braided channels and relationships between these channels and stratigraphic evolution remain largely untested. We have conducted a series of experiments to determine the conditions conducive to forming braided submarine channels, and to relate channel geometry and kinematics to deposit architecture. Dissolved salt supplies the excess density of the experimental turbidity currents, which transport plastic, sand-sized sediment as bedload across a test section two meters long and one meter wide. Our experiments indicate that braided channels can form as constructional features without prior erosion for a range of input water and sediment fluxes. Channel migration, avulsion, and aggradation construct sedimentary deposits with bars at a variety of scales. Bar geometry and channel kinematics are qualitatively similar under subaerial and subaqueous experiments with other parameters fixed. We will present quantitative analyses of the relationships between channel geometry and mobility and deposit architecture, at scales from individual bars to the entire deposit, and compare these results to control experiments with subaerial braiding. These experimental results suggest parallels between subaerial and subaqueous braiding, and help to constrain forward models for stratigraphic evolution and inverse methods for estimating flow conditions from turbidites.",

Such early data can extend our climate record and provide important context in longer-term climate changes.\nUnfortunately, the Nimbus data nearly disappeared before its value was recognized and attempts to recover the data were undertaken. While the Nimbus data was never truly lost, it was in a form that could not be read and was not organized in a way that could be accessed with modern computer systems. The rescue and recovery of the Nimbus data began in 2007 with an initiative by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Without the Goddard efforts, the early Nimbus data might be forever dark. The Nimbus Rescue Project has just completed processing and archival of the Nimbus 4 visible and infrared observations from 1970 and 1971. This adds to our rescue efforts from Nimbus 1, 2 and 3 for 1964, 1966 and 1969. The procedures to recover the Nimbus data, from both film and tape, could be used by other data rescue projects, however the algorithms presented will tend to be Nimbus specific. The compositing of the mapped minimum brightness over weekly intervals resulted in never before seen views of the Polar Regions, such as a visible light view of the Antarctic ice extent from October 1970 (Figure 1).\nThe Nimbus data recovery and reprocessing into modern formats was important, however it was the utility of the data as a part of the satellite climate record that made it valuable. Data rescue projects are often both difficult and time consuming but the data they bring back to the science community makes these efforts worthwhile.",

We determine the tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs), near surface concentrations and vertical profiles of aerosols, NO2, SO2, HCHO from the MAX-DOAS observations using the optimal estimation profile retrieval algorithm (refered to as “PriAM”). We verified the results by comparing them with results from independent techniques, such as sun photometer (AERONET), a visibility meter and a long-path DOAS instrument. We acquire the cloud and aerosol conditions using a cloud classification scheme based on the MAX-DOAS observations (Wang et al., AMTD, 2015). Based on the obtained results, we characterize the effect of the clouds on the trace gas and aerosol profiles retrieved from MAX-DOAS. Then we characterize the diurnal, annual and weekly variations of the trace gases and aerosols and validate the tropospheric trace gas VCDs derived from the Ozone Monitoring instrument (OMI) on the Aura satellite platform as well as the model results from the IMAGES, CHIMERE and Lotos-Euros models and analyse the agreement depending on the cloud and aerosol conditions. Besides the direct comparison with the satellite data, we also use the trace gas and aerosol profiles derived from MAX-DOAS to recalculate the air mass factor (AMF) for the satellite observations and to evaluate the corresponding improvement of the satellite VCDs. In some periods with strong aerosol pollution, we evaluate the effect of the aerosols on the satellite cloud retrievals and the corresponding errors of the tropospheric AMF of the trace gases. Here should be noted that aerosol effects on the AMF is not yet considered in the published satellite products, which can cause appreciable errors of the tropospheric VCD of satellite products around polluted regions.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations keep on increasing in the atmosphere since industrial revolution. Methane (CH4) is the second most important anthropogenic GHG after carbon dioxide (CO2). Its sources and sinks are nowadays well identified however their relative contributions remain uncertain. The industries and the waste treatment emit an important part of the anthropogenic methane that is difficult to quantify because the sources are fugitive and discontinuous. A better estimation of methane emissions could help industries to adapt their mitigation’s politic and encourage them to install methane recovery systems in order to reduce their emissions while saving money.\nDifferent methods exist to quantify methane emissions. Among them is the tracer release method consisting in releasing a tracer gas near the methane source at a well-known rate and measuring both their concentrations in the emission plume. The methane rate is calculated using the ratio of methane and tracer concentrations and the emission rate of the tracer.\nA good estimation of the methane emissions requires a good differentiation between the methane actually emitted by the site and the methane from the background concentration level, but also a good knowledge of the sources distribution over the site. For this purpose, a Gaussian plume model is used in addition to the tracer release method to assess the emission rates calculated. In a first step, the data obtained for the tracer during a field campaign are used to tune the model. Different model’s parameterizations have been tested to find the best representation of the atmospheric dispersion conditions. Once these parameters are set, methane emissions are estimated thanks to the methane concentrations measured and a Bayesian inversion. This enables to adjust the position and the emission rate of the different methane sources of the site and remove the methane background concentration.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing data and climate model output are multi-dimensional arrays of massive sizes locked away in heterogeneous file formats (HDF5/4, NetCDF 3/4) and metadata models (HDF-EOS, CF) making it difficult to perform multi-stage, iterative science processing since each stage requires writing and reading data to and from disk. We are developing a lightning fast Big Data technology called SciSpark based on ApacheTM Spark under a NASA AIST grant (PI Mattmann). Spark implements the map-reduce paradigm for parallel computing on a cluster, but emphasizes in-memory computation, “spilling” to disk only as needed, and so outperforms the disk-based ApacheTM Hadoop by 100x in memory and by 10x on disk.\nSciSpark will enable scalable model evaluation by executing large-scale comparisons of A-Train satellite observations to model grids on a cluster of 10 to 1000 compute nodes. This 2nd generation capability for NASA’s Regional Climate Model Evaluation System (RCMES) will compute simple climate metrics at interactive speeds, and extend to quite sophisticated iterative algorithms such as machine-learning based clustering of temperature PDFs, and even graph-based algorithms for searching for Mesocale Convective Complexes.\nWe have implemented a parallel data ingest capability in which the user specifies desired variables (arrays) as several time-sorted lists of URL’s (i.e. using OPeNDAP model.nc?varname, or local files). The specified variables are partitioned by time/space and then each Spark node pulls its bundle of arrays into memory to begin a computation pipeline. We also investigated the performance of several N-dim. array libraries (scala breeze, java jblas & netlib-java, and ND4J). We are currently developing science codes using ND4J and studying memory behavior on the JVM. On the pyspark side, many of our science codes already use the numpy and SciPy ecosystems.\nThe talk will cover: the architecture of SciSpark, the design of the scientific RDD (sRDD) data structure, our efforts to integrate climate science algorithms in Python and Scala, parallel ingest and partitioning of A-Train satellite observations from HDF files and model grids from netCDF files, first parallel runs to compute comparison statistics and PDF’s, and first metrics quantifying parallel speedups and memory & disk usage.",

In 1990 Yahtse completed the retreat phase of the tidewater glacier cycle and began its re-advance, advancing two kilometers thus far. The three-year study of the dynamics of Yahtse began in June 2009 with the initial deployment of five GPS rovers on tetrahedrons, two permanent GPS rovers that were drilled into the ice and two GPS base stations as well as several seismometers and time lapse cameras. We have acquired a three year long time-series of high-resolution GPS data on several stations deployed along the centerline of Yahtse Glacier and in a central strain diamond formation located several meters from the icefall from 2009 - 2011. The GPS motion record revealed multiple short-duration (on the order of days) speed-up events throughout the spring and summer months superimposed on the seasonal acceleration and deceleration of Yahtse Glacier on all three years of observations. Through an analysis of the GPS motion record along with simultaneously collected weather data we found a relationship between the timing of large water input events and the observed speed-up events. This data enables us to understand how the englacial drainage network is developing seasonally and annually. Only through understanding the drainage system numerically will we be able to develop accurate predictions of the glaciers future rate of advance with respect to the changing climate conditions in south central Alaska.",

            "abstract": "For many environmental systems model runtimes have remained very long as more capable computers have been used to add more processes and more time and space discretization. Scientists have also added more parameters and kinds of observations, and many model runs are needed to explore the models. Computational demand equals run time multiplied by number of model runs divided by parallelization opportunities. Model exploration is conducted using sensitivity analysis, optimization, and uncertainty quantification. Sensitivity analysis is used to reveal consequences of what may be very complex simulated relations, optimization is used to identify parameter values that fit the data best, or at least better, and uncertainty quantification is used to evaluate the precision of simulated results. The long execution times make such analyses a challenge. Methods for addressing this challenges include computationally frugal analysis of the demanding original model and a number of ingenious surrogate modeling methods. Both commonly use about 50-100 runs of the demanding original model.\nIn this talk we consider the tradeoffs between (1) original model development decisions, (2) computationally frugal analysis of the original model, and (3) using many model runs of the fast surrogate model. Some questions of interest are as follows. If the added processes and discretization invested in (1) are compared with the restrictions and approximations in model analysis produced by long model execution times, is there a net benefit related of the goals of the model? Are there changes to the numerical methods that could reduce the computational demands while giving up less fidelity than is compromised by using computationally frugal methods or surrogate models for model analysis? Both the computationally frugal methods and surrogate models require that the solution of interest be a smooth function of the parameters or interest. How does the information obtained from the local methods typical of (2) and the global averaged methods typical of (3) compare for typical systems? The discussion will use examples of response of the Greenland glacier to global warming and surface and groundwater modeling.",

            "abstract": "Accurate forecasts of broken cloud fields and their associated impact on the downwelling solar irradiance has remained a challenge to the renewable energy industry. Likewise, shallow cumulus play an important role in the Earth’s radiation budget and hydrologic cycle and are of interest to the weather forecasting and climate science communities. The main challenge associated with predicting these clouds are their relatively small size (on the order of a kilometer or less) relative to the model grid spacing. Recently, however, there have been significant efforts put into improving forecasts of shallow clouds and the associated temporal and spatial variability of the solar irradiance that they induce. As an example of these efforts, we will describe recent modifications to the standard Kain-Fritsch parameterization as applied within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model that are designed to improve predictions of the macroscale and microscale structure of shallow cumulus. These modifications are shown to lead to a realistic increase in the simulated cloud fraction and associated decrease in the solar irradiance. We will evaluate our results using data collected at the Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains site, which is located in north-central Oklahoma. Our team has analyzed over 5 years of data collected at this site to document the macroscale structure of the clouds (including cloud fraction, cloud-base and cloud-top height) as well as their impact on the downwelling shortwave and longwave irradiance. One particularly interesting impact of shallow cumuli is the enhancement of the diffuse radiation, such that during periods in which the sun is not blocked, the observed irradiance can be significantly larger than the corresponding clear sky case. To date, this feature is not accurately represented by models that apply the plane-parallel assumption applied in the standard radiation parameterizations.",

            "abstract": "Since the 1890s it’s been known that the wet tropics harbour plants with exceptionally large leaves. Yet the observed latitudinal gradient of leaf size has never been fully explained: it is still unclear which aspects of climate are most important for understanding geographic trends in leaf size, a trait that varies many thousand-fold among species. The key is the leaf-to-air temperature difference, which depends on the balance of energy inputs (irradiance) and outputs (transpirational cooling, losses to the night sky). Smaller leaves track air temperatures more closely than larger leaves. Widely cited optimality-based theories predict an advantage for smaller leaves in dry environments, where transpiration is restricted, but are silent on the latitudinal gradient. We aimed to characterize and explain the worldwide pattern of leaf size. Across 7900 species from 651 sites, here we show that: large-leaved species predominate in wet, hot, sunny environments; smaller-leaved species typify hot, sunny environments only when arid; small leaves are required to avoid freezing in high latitudes and at high elevation, and to avoid overheating in dry environments. This simple pattern was unclear in earlier, more limited analyses. We present a simple but robust, fresh approach to energy-balance modelling for both day-time and night-time leaf-to-air temperature differences, and thus risk of overheating and of frost damage. Our analysis shows night-chilling is important as well as day-heating, and simplifies leaf temperature modelling. It provides both a framework for modelling leaf size constraints, and a solution to one of the oldest conundrums in ecology. Although the path forward is not yet fully clear, because of its role in controlling leaf temperatures we suggest that climate-related leaf size constraints could usefully feature in the next generation of land ecosystem models.",

            "abstract": "The interactions between dust and other physical processes have been found to play an important role in the dust-induced climate change. However, there are large uncertainties regarding whether, where, and how the dust enhances or suppresses precipitation. The climatic effects of dust aerosols in North Africa and South/East Asia have been investigated using an atmospheric general circulation model, NCEP/GCM/SSiB (Simplified Simple Biosphere Model) and the three-dimensional aerosol data simulated by the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model. GCM simulations show that due to the scattering and absorption of solar radiation by dust particles, surface temperature decreases over both regions, accompanied by a reduced sensible heat flux. However, precipitation responses are different in these two regions. Due to differences in dust location and the associated heating with respect to the rainfall band and circulation, the effect of dust could either enhance or suppress precipitation. Over the North Africa region where dust particles are mainly located to the north of rainfall band, heating of the air column by dust particles forces a stronger ascent motion over dust layers, which induces an anomalous subsidence (or a weakened upward motion) and suppressed cyclonic circulation to its south where precipitation reduces. In South/East Asia, dust particles are located in the upper troposphere over the major rainfall band during the monsoon season, especially Southwest India and the coastal area of Bay of Bengal. Heating of the air column increases upward motion and strengthens cyclonic circulation. Therefore, cloud and precipitation increase over South/East Asia associated with dust effect. During the pre-monsoon season, when dust particles are located to the north of the monsoon rainfall band, the heating effect results in shifting precipitation northward. The anomalous upward motion over dust regions will induce a subsidence to its south and subsequently reduce precipitation over that region. Therefore, the responses of circulation and precipitation to aerosol forcing depend on the relative location of dust aerosols with respect to rainfall band, which may explain the fact that contradictory results exist regarding whether the aerosol effect would enhance or suppress precipitation.",

But there are challenges in linking powerful visualization technologies to people in ways that they trust, support and can use. Technology adoption depends on a host of social and psychological factors—for example, how have past experiences shaped perceptions? Where do people currently turn for information? Who do they trust? Who do they see as responsible for implementing response and resilience measures? What do people think about climate change and sea level rise? What are the values that will motivate them to act? The answers vary from place to place and group to group. Visualization technologies that are responsive to this type of information may be most effective.

Adverse conditions in the space environment can cause disruption of satellite operations, communications, navigation, and electric power distribution grids, leading to a variety of socio-economic losses and impacts on our security. Future space exploration and most modern human endeavors will require major advances in physical understanding and improved transition of space research to operations. At present, only a small fraction of the latest research and development results from NASA, NOAA, NSF and DoD investments are being used to improve space weather forecasting and to develop operational tools. The power of modern research and space weather model development needs to be better utilized to enable comprehensive, timely, and accurate operational space weather tools. The mere production of space weather information is not sufficient to address the needs of those who are affected by space weather. A coordinated effort is required to support research-to-applications transition efforts and to develop the tools required those who rely on this information. In this presentation we will review the space weather system developed for the Van Allen Probes mission, together with other datasets, tools and models that have resulted from research by scientists at JHU/APL. We will look at how these, and results from future missions such as Solar Probe Plus, could be applied to support space weather applications in coordination with other community assets and capabilities.",

            "abstract": "Basal tractions on plates contribute to the force balance that determines plate motions, and arise from the shearing deformation beneath the plates. Because basal-traction amplitudes depend on the anisotropic olivine fabrics that form within asthenospheric rocks, the tectonic force may change with time as asthenospheric fabrics evolve. To explore this interaction, we first developed a stochastic model of olivine fabric development in which grain rotations are controlled by available slip systems and the rate of rotation slows as ideal orientations are approached. We constrain this process by quantitatively comparing calculated fabrics to those developed in recent laboratory experiments on olivine aggregates. We then constrain the anisotropy in viscosity of the aggregates using laboratory observations of strain-rates that result from stresses applied to aggregates with known crystallographic fabrics. This effort allows us to constrain both the rate of anisotropic fabric development and the magnitude of anisotropic viscosity that should result from these fabrics. We applied this understanding to a model of a simple plate tectonic system to test its response to asthenospheric fabric development. Starting from an initially random orientation of olivine crystals, we find that increasing olivine fabric alignment causes asthenospheric viscosity to drop approximately an order of magnitude after the asthenosphere accumulates a shear strain of 100–500%. For reasonable asthenospheric parameters, this occurs after a few 10s of millions of years. Once this asthenospheric fabric forms, anisotropic viscosity exerts significant resistance to motion perpendicular to the orientation of the crystallographic fabric, which impedes changes in plate motion even if plate driving forces change direction. Thus, asthenospheric fabrics may permit only gradual changes in plate motions, in agreement with the overall stability of plate motions. More abrupt changes in plate motions, which are occasionally observed in the plate tectonic record, may require a disruption to the anisotropic fabric across large regions of the asthenosphere. Such disruptions may result from small-scale convection or widespread plume arrival from below.",

Baekdu. We assumed that the most realistic way for the simulation of a sustained volcanic column is to modify the topography with a cone above the crater to follow expert advice from Dr. Karim Kelfoun, the developer of VolcFlow. Then we set the radius and height of the cone, the volume of pyroclastic flow, and the duration and simulation time accoding to the volcanic explosivity index (VEI). Also we set the yield stress as 5,000 Pa, 10,000 Pa, 15,000 Pa, the basal friction angle as 3°, 5°, 10°, respectively. As the simulation results, the longest runout range was 2.3 km, 9.1 km, 14.4 km, 18.6 km, 23.4 km from VEI 3 to VEI 7, respectively. It can be used as a very important material to predict the impact range of pyroclastic density currents and to minimize human and material damages caused by pyroclastic density currents derived from the future explosive eruption of Mt.

            "abstract": "When a crop model is used to predict crop yields early in the growing season, two sources of uncertainties prevail those coming from climate and model uncertainties. Climate uncertainty is greatest early in the growing season and tends to decrease as weather data become available in the growing season. Model uncertainty due to errors in model structure, modeling assumptions and other ancillary data, generally remains constant through the growing season. Skillful climate forecasts can reduce climate uncertainty especially at the earlier stages of the growing season, while assimilating remote sensing (RS) data within the growing season can reduced model uncertainty. In this talk, we focus on the development, application and verification of a crop modeling-data assimilation framework capable of ingesting RS soil moisture and vegetation parameters, in this case, leaf area index for predicting aggregated crop yields. We discuss the lessons learned from our case studies in Iowa, with more homogenous rainfed agricultural system, and Georgia, more heterogeneous mixed rainfed/irrigated agricultural system. One of our goals is to show the utility of better soil moisture products, e.g. from SMAP, for improving the prediction of agricultural/hydrological variables with actionable lead-times.",

Concurrently, a ground team was re-directed to collect mobile surface validation data by the AMOG (AutoMObile gas) Surveyor in the new area. On all platforms, realtime analysis were used to adapt the survey patterns such as making tactical decisions to repeat certain swaths or flight lines by AVIRIS NG and by MAMAP and to adapt surface survey patterns.\nThe AVIRIS-NG realtime algorithms were developed for methane; however, oil exhibits spectral features that are similar, enabling their testing on AVIRIS-NG data acquired during the Santa Barbara Oil Spill. The effort determined that realtime oil mapping currently is feasible.

            "abstract": "GPS station velocities inferred from position time series have become vital for many subfields of geophysics. However there is still no consensus on how large GPS velocity errors truly are. This is especially true for long-duration time series. The reason is that long-period, time-dependent noise in GPS time series is difficult to detect. Random-walk noise process is especially difficult to estimate, but has a large effect on velocity uncertainty.\nPreviously we developed a Network Noise Estimator that provides more precise estimates of time-dependent noise than traditional, methods of noise estimation for single time series. The method uses Kalman filtering to determine maximum likelihood estimates of noise parameters for networks of stations. Simulations show that this method allows us to estimate more precise velocity uncertainty in GPS position data within networks of stations.\nIn this study we present estimates of GPS velocity uncertainties from many dozens of stations and compare them to the traditionally estimated values. We largely focus on the central region of the North American continent. Our preliminary estimates of velocity uncertainty are 0.5-0.6 mm/yr for 10 years of data, which is twice the level found with traditional methods. We show that small unmodeled linear trends do not affect the noise estimates, so that some minor tectonic signal should not affect our results. We provide confidence intervals on the noise parameters and explore correlations between flicker-noise and random-walk estimates. Additionally, we determine typical noise estimates for groups of stations with similar monumentation. These estimates could be used to determine velocity uncertainty for any future use of the data from stations with similar monument types.",

            "abstract": "Hydrology has implicitly assumed that catchments are infinitely resilient to droughts and floods. No matter the magnitude of the climatic disturbance, almost all hydrological models simulate full recovery and hence assume infinite resilience. Recent research shows that catchments can undergo fundamental change during major droughts and this change in behavior is not captured by rainfall-runoff models. To date, the field of hydrological resilience has relied on theoretical deterministic models or vague resilience concepts, with the identification of catchments with multiple steady states (henceforth, attractors) remaining elusive. This is primarily due to the challenges stochastic forcing introduces into quantifying disturbance and recovery, and because resilience theory does not adequately address stochastic forcing.\nDrawing from recent hydrological resilience theory on catchment disturbance and recovery, a data-driven hidden Markov model is proposed for identifying recovery to a different hydrological state following major climatic disturbances. Application to selected unregulated catchments within Victoria, Australia, shows that after the Millennium Drought (~1995-2010) some catchments are yet to recover and have persisted within a functionally different hydrological state compared to that prior to the drought. Conversely, some catchments fully recovered at the cessation of the drought. This provides the first known field evidence that some catchments may have multiple attractors. Additionally, catchments are shown to differ in their resistance to the drought, with some catchments switching to a drought state at the commencement of the meteorological drought while other catchments taking ~10 years to switch to a hydrological drought state. In addition to separating hydrological droughts from meteorological droughts, this research provides a pathway for quantifying catchment resilience and resistance to climatic disturbances.",

            "abstract": "The processes responsible for the onset of La Niña events have not received the same attention as those responsible for the onset of El Niño events, for which Westerly Wind Events (WWEs) in the tropical Pacific have been identified as important contributors. We have previously shown that equatorial Pacific WWE wind stress composites in the years following the large El Niño event of 1997/98 are very like their pre-97-98 counterparts except that they also include an easterly anomaly element over the cold tongue. We have argued that this easterly component modifies the oceanic response so that warming is concentrated in the central equatorial Pacific. This significant change in forced SST anomaly results from the fact that a relatively small increase in easterly wind speed, acting on top of the background easterly trade winds, is sufficient to produce a stress anomaly comparable in magnitude to that of the westerly wind event and thereby produce current anomalies to balance out most of the cold tongue warming that would otherwise be driven by the WWE wind stresses. Motivated by the large effect of these “Easterly Wind Surges” (EWSs) we have examined their occurrence statistics and effects on ENSO-related sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the period over which the TAO/TRITON buoy wind observations are available for verification. We find that EWSs are a prominent component of equatorial Pacific wind stress variability and play an important role in the onset and development of La Niña events akin to the role that Westerly Wind Events play in El Niño events. EWSs also help shape amplitude and pattern development of El Niño SSTAs. We examine how well recent ENSO-related sea surface temperature development can be accounted for by paying attention to the occurrence of each year’s westerly and easterly wind events.",

The overall objectives of this initiative are to understand the relative timing of chasma formation and sedimentation, to investigate the depositional settings of these sediments, and to characterize the styles of syn- and post-depositional deformation. Mapping is done at spatial resolutions that are at least an order of magnitude finer than has been achieved by previous studies in this part of Valles Marineris. Mapping focuses on the north and the southeast slopes of Nia Mensa and on the south slope of Juventae Mensa. Work on the north Nia Mensa map is underway this year and is the focus of this presentation.\nThe north Nia Mensa map encompasses the contact between the massive sedimentary rocks that comprise most of Nia Mensa and the stratified sedimentary and mass-wasting deposits exposed between Nia Mensa and the north wall of east Candor Chasma. The area also contains a stratified fan-like deposit that appears to be sourced from, and post-date the sediments that constitute, Nia Mensa. This area is mapped using a DEM comprising data from two adjacent HiRISE stereo pairs and orthorectified HiRISE and Context camera images. Work is focused on measuring the orientations of bedding, fractures and unconformities using the Layer Tools plug-in for ArcGIS and the HiRISE-derived topography. Measurements of bedding orientation reveal that the strata within the fan-like deposit dip outward at < ~10°, away from its morphologic apex. Thus the structure of this feature is consistent with a fan deposit. Work is ongoing to further test this interpretation as a fan deposit and to assess possible depositional settings for this feature and associated sediments.",

            "abstract": "Climate warming in high-latitude regions has resulted in thawing of carbon-rich permafrost soils. Permafrost thaw can result in the decomposition of previously frozen soil organic matter, releasing CO2 and CH4, which can enhance climate warming. In permafrost peatlands, soil organic matter has been accumulating for several thousand years. The decomposability of the peat varies depending on the peatland history, vegetation type, level of previous decomposition, and timing of permafrost aggradation. Therefore, predicting the future climate feedbacks from permafrost thaw in peatlands is not straightforward. We use a coupled model of peatland and permafrost dynamics (Holocene Peat Model + GIPL-2) to examine the role of site history on the potential loss of soil carbon in permafrost with future climate warming in permafrost peatlands. We select sites with differing climates and permafrost histories from North America, Europe, and Asia and simulate peatland development from 12 kya to present. We then compare the magnitude of carbon loss at 2100 from thawed permafrost peats at these sites under future climate scenarios. While there are uncertainties associated with the climate drivers, we find that site history is an important determinant of the magnitude of carbon losses in the coming decades to centuries.",

            "abstract": "It is important to quantitatively evaluate how magmatic activities at depth are reflected in geodetically (GPS and/or InSAR) observed surface deformation in order to distinguish magma-induced crustal deformation. This study employs 3-D finite element model to examine response of the linear Maxwell visco-elastic crust and mantle to a development of sill. Models with instantaneous and/or time-dependent inflation/deflation of sill at various depths in the crust have predicted geodetically detectable surface deformation, providing important constraints on spatio-temporal-scale of magmatic activities. Instantaneous inflation of sill in the crust causes the surface uplift. The amplitude and wavelength of the uplift are amplified for shallower and deeper inflations, respectively. The inflation occurred over a greater horizontal extent intensify both the amplitude and wavelength. The inflation-induced surface uplift would however abate with time by visco-elastic relaxation. Any signature of sill would disappear in ~ 50 - 100 times Maxwell relaxation time of the crust unless the inflation occurred within the uppermost layer that effectively acts as elastic layer. Time-dependent inflation accompanies with visco-elastic relaxation, and the inflation having occurred over the time-scale of ~ 50 - 100 times crustal relaxation time would provide insignificant signature at the surface, which in turn tells us that crustal deformation would reflect the development of magma chamber only if it has occurred in that time-scale. This study also has found that an ascent of magma into shallower depth may be recognised by an observation such that a horizontal extent over which the surface uplift is progressively intensified focusses into a narrower region.",

However, land use change modifies the biosphere-atmosphere interactions in such a way that key processes that maintain the functioning of Amazonia are substantially altered. In order to monitor this process, six years of continuous aerosols and trace gases measurements in Central Amazonia were performed at the TT34 site North of Manaus. Additionally, observations were also done at a heavily biomass burning impacted site in southwestern Amazonia (PVH-Porto Velho). Amazonian aerosols were characterized in detail, including aerosol size distributions, aerosol light absorption and scattering, optical depth and aerosol inorganic and organic composition, among others properties. Trace gases measurements include CO, CO2, O3, VOCs and others.\nThe central Amazonia site (TT34) showed very low aerosol concentrations (PM2.5 of 1.3 µg m-3 and 3.4 µg m-3 in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. At the impacted site (PVH), aerosol loadings were one order of magnitude higher (PM2.5 of 10.2 µg m-3 and 33.0 µg m-3 in the wet and dry seasons, respectively). The aerosol number concentration at the impacted site ranged from 680 cm-3 in the wet season up to 20,000 cm‑3 in the dry season. Organic aerosol dominates the composition with 81% to the PM1 aerosol loading at TT34, while biomass-burning aerosols at PVH shows a 93% organic particles content. Aerosol optical properties changed dramatically due to land use change.\nLong term remote sensing observations from several AERONET sites and from MODIS since 1999, provides a regional and temporal overview of atmospheric aerosol loading. These changes in aerosol loading and in the radiation balance caused a significant increase of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) of 18-29%. There clear observations that the hydrological cycle is being enhanced, while the extent of the dry season is increasing. From this analysis, it is clear that land use change in Amazonia shows alterations of many atmospheric properties, and these changes are affecting the functioning of the Amazonian ecosystem in significant ways. Climate change may also play a role and is important to monitor these changes in a critically important tropical region.",

            "abstract": "The intensive land use and agricultural production systems in the Chippewa River Watershed (CRW) in Minnesota, USA, contribute to inherent environmental problems and have major direct impact on soil conservation, and on several competing agro-ecosystem services (AESs); and may have indirect impact on AESs in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). Field-scale indicators of AESs are largely absent in the highly diverse soils of the CRW. Therefore, proxy indicators were developed to assess these services under current (A0) and predicted (A2; 100 years) global climate change (GCC) scenarios. Individual indices were developed for biomass, grain yield, NO3- and NH4-N, soil carbon, runoff, and soil erosion for 132 soil series classified into three land capability classes (LCCs). The indices and a weighted index (Iw) were subjected to multivariate analyses procedures, including distance-weighted least squares, and variance components estimation. Three-D maps delineated contiguous areas of increasing or decreasing AESs in response to projected GCC. Largest significant variance portions in Iw were attributed to GCC scenarios; followed by the interaction of crop rotations and LCCs within conventional and organic cropping systems. The AES were predicted with larger certainty under A2 in organically-managed LCC-1 compared to conventional management. Significantly more runoff and soil erosion are predicted in conventionally-managed LCC-2 and LCC-3 under the same GCC scenario, regardless of soil heterogeneity. The modeling framework and the mapped AES indicators are designed to achieve multiple goals and will be used to support farmers in designing specific crop rotations that are suitable for each of the three LCCs and for major and vulnerable soil series in the watershed. Also, the modeling framework will address sustained delivery of multiple AESs, while enhancing soil conservation, water quality, and environmental protection aspects of farming in the CRW and the UMRB.",

            "abstract": "Problems of water sustainability to meet the increasing needs of a growing world population, further exacerbated by climate change, will continually challenge hydrologists and other earth and environmental scientists. Significant theoretical, modeling, and computational advances, and technology developments for improved observations, monitoring, and characterization that have taken place during the last several decades have helped to meet some of these challenges. In parallel, field and laboratory studies for conceptualization, hypothesis testing, and model improvements have continued to advance hydrologic sciences. However, the data to study some of the problems in hydrology cannot always be obtained from field studies where many factors contribute to the uncertainty of measurements and parameter estimates. The primary thesis of this talk is that laboratory experiments conducted at multiple test scales will play an important role by providing new insights into complex processes and accurate data for model improvement, leading to increased accuracy and reliability of predictions. However, performing such controlled experiments poses many challenges such as acquiring data at different observational scales, capturing relevant features of geologic heterogeneity, mimicking field specific pressure and temperature dependent phase interactions in the laboratory, and simulating climate drivers, among others. Focusing on the subsurface and using examples from multiphase systems, coastal aquifer salinization, and land/atmospheric interactions, I will show how to design and implement theory-driven experiments to address some of these challenges. I will make the case that addressing problems in hydrology requires continuous interaction among laboratory and field studies and modeling. It is imperative that hydrologists work at the disciplinary interfaces related to earth, water, energy, and the environment to address current and emerging problems that are of global importance.",

Studies of climatic impact on water and environment primarily focus on large scale atmospheric conditions under anthropogenic emission scenarios, but ignore the local human component. Here we outline a methodological framework for assessing water availability in a changing climate, considering anthropogenic water demand and man-made infrastructure, designed to cope with climatic extremes. The framework is used to assess future water stress in southeastern Australia considering projected human demand scenarios, storage reservoirs, desalination infrastructure, and climatic change. Results show that in some combinations of the climatic change and water demand scenarios, the region would experience water stress that has not been observed in the baseline which includes the epic Millennium Drought. A question that is often ignored in the climate community is that to what extend uncontrolled growth with concomitant increase in water demand will exacerbate the future water stress. We argue that anthropogenic water demand should be an integral component of water stress assessment in the future climate, and the presented methodology offers a unique avenue for linking climatic and hydrologic processes to human interactions.",

These migrations are\nassociated with the occurrence of opposite rainfall variations between the two\nhemispheres. However, the pattern of rainfalls around the marine-continental tropical\nwestern Pacific region over the last millennium remains unclear. Several recent studies\nsuggest a southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone during the Little Ice\nAge (~AD 1400-1850). Concomitantly, dry Little Ice Age conditions should have occurred in\nthe northern extent of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and wet conditions around the\nsouthern limit. However, our synthesis of proxy hydrology records from the Asian-\nAustralian monsoon area documents a distinctly different rainfall pattern that violates this\nexpectation, suggesting instead the occurrence of synchronous retreat of the East Asian\nSummer Monsoon and the Australian Summer Monsoon during the Little Ice Age. Thus we\npropose an alternative dynamic scenario: rather than strict north-south migration, the\napparent mode of multi-decadal to centennial change for the western Pacific Intertropical\nConvergence Zone is contraction/expansion in response to external forcings such as solar\nirradiance variation and large volcanic eruptions.",

Much of this cloud optical depth increase has been hypothesized to be due to transitions from ice-dominated to liquid-dominated mixed-phase cloud. In this study, the importance of liquid-ice partitioning for the optical depth feedback is quantified for several CMIP5 models. All models show a monotonic partitioning of ice and liquid as a function of temperature, but the temperature at which ice and liquid are equally mixed (the glaciation temperature) varies by as much as 40K across models. Models that have a higher glaciation temperature are found to have a smaller climatological liquid water path (LWP) and condensed water path, and experience a larger increase in LWP as the climate warms. The ice-liquid partitioning curve of each model may be used to calculate the response of LWP to warming. It is found that the re-partitioning between ice and liquid in a warming climate contributes at least 20% to 80% of the increase in LWP as the climate warms, depending on model. Inter-model differences in the climatological partitioning between ice and liquid are estimated to contribute at least 20% to the inter-model spread in the high-latitude LWP response in the mixed-phase region poleward of 45°S. It is hypothesized that a more thorough evaluation and constraint of GCM mixed-phase cloud parameterizations, and validation of the total condensate and ice-liquid apportionment against observations will yield a substantial reduction in model uncertainty in the high-latitude cloud response to warming.",

            "abstract": "Microfossil-based estimates of subsidence during the AD 1700 Cascadia earthquake suggest that slip on the megathrust varied along strike. Here, we use microfossil foraminiferal assemblages to reconstruct coastal subsidence during predecessors of the AD 1700 earthquake to test if slip varied in successive earthquakes. Subsidence estimates come from two salt marshes that show stratigraphic evidence of sudden submergence 6 times in the past ~3 ka at Siletz Bay, Oregon (44.9°N, -124.0°W). Evidence for subsidence during earthquakes includes: sharp contacts of salt marsh peat buried by overlying intertidal mud that extend >2 km across the estuary; shifts in fossil foram assemblages across the contacts that indicate rapid submergence; and the thickness of overlying mud that suggests lasting submergence. On 4 of 6 contacts, sand—probably spread by tsunamis—sharply overlies peat along the bay margin of Salishan Spit. Median calibrated 14C ages on fossil plants from above and below 6 contacts give the times of submergence: 140, 780, 1225, 1550, 2510, and 3040 cal yr BP. The times correlate well with regional earthquake chronologies; the youngest contact probably marks subsidence in AD 1700. To reconstruct subsidence using fossil foram assemblages, we apply a foraminiferal transfer function developed from measured elevations of modern assemblages. Changes in fossil forams across the AD 1700 contact at Salishan Spit indicate 0.69±0.28 m of subsidence; subsidence during prior earthquakes varied from as little as 0.18±0.28 m at 780 cal yr BP to as much as 0.83±0.28 m at 1225 cal yr BP and 1.01±0.28 m at 1550 cal yr BP. Fault dislocation models show that variations in subsidence at Siletz Bay from one earthquake to the next can be explained by nearby variations in megathrust slip. Seismic hazard assessments should use a suite of rupture models that vary slip along strike and down dip to account for the variable subsidence over time that we find in central Oregon.",

            "abstract": "Methane emissions from northern peatlands depend strongly on environmental conditions, wetland plant species assemblages (via root zone oxidation and plant-aided transport), and soil microbial behavior (via metabolic pathways). Potential future changes in high-latitude climate are expected to include permafrost thaw and thermokarst formation, which may change the distribution of microlandscapes such as hummocks and hollows (and plant species therein) within peatlands. While the responses of wetland methane emissions to potential future climate change have been extensively explored, the effects of future changes in plant species and soil microbial metabolism are not as well studied. We ran the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface model over the West Siberian Lowland (WSL), with methane emissions parameters that vary spatially as a function of microlandscape and the dominant plant species therein, and forced with outputs from 32 CMIP5 models for the RCP4.5 scenario. Here we compare the effects of changes in climate, microlandscapes, and vegetation on predicted wetland CH4 emissions for the period 2071-2100, relative to the period 1981-2010, in terms of both total annual emissions and the spatial distribution of emissions. We also explore possible acclimatization of soil microbial communities to these changes. Our work indicates the importance of better constraining the responses of wetland plants and soil microbial communities to changes in climate as they are critical determinants of the region’s future methane emissions.",

Basic findings to be presented include verification of the importance of the auroral electrojets as features of auroral PF deposition and identification of the cusp as a third important feature. The cusp makes an important contribution to the overall energy budget when the IMF is north of ˙90 degrees. The statistical distribution of the PF about the model is heavy tailed, suggesting that there are important and complex dynamical processes not directly controlled by the IMF. For illustration, certain individual PF events from the Polar cap and elsewhere will be presented and compared with the statistical model prediction.",

            "abstract": "The quantification of ammonia (NH3) emissions is essential to the more accurate quantification of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, improved air quality and the assessment of ammonia-related agricultural policy and climate mitigation strategies. Chinese agricultural fertilizer (CAF), which is widely used in China, is the nation’s largest source of NH3 emissions. The quantity, geographic distribution and historical trends of these emissions remain largely uncertain. In this paper, a new CAF NH3 (CAF_NH3) emissions inventory has been compiled that exhibits the following improvements: (1) a 1 ´1 km gridded map on the county level was developed for 2008; (2) a combined bottom-up and top-down method was used for the local correction of emission factors (EFs) and parameters; (3) time trends were derived for 1978-2008 in which the spatial and temporal patterns and the uncertainties associated with the inventory were quantified; and (4) a sensitivity test was performed in which a province-level disaggregated map was compared with CAF_NH3 emissions for 2008. The total CAF_NH3 emissions for 2008 were 8.4 TgNH3·yr-1 (a 6.6-9.8 Tg interquartile range). From 1978 to 2008, annual NH3 emissions fluctuated with three peaks (1987, 1996 and 2005), and total emissions increased from 3.2 to 8.4 Tg at an annual rate of 3.0%. During the study period, the contribution of livestock manure spreading increased from 37.0% to 45.5% because of changing fertilization practices and the rapid increase in egg, milk and meat consumption. The average contribution of synthetic fertilizer, which has a positive effect on crop yields, was approximately 38.3% (minimum: 33.4%; maximum: 42.7%). With rapid urbanization causing a decline in the rural population, the contribution of the rural excrement sector varied widely between 20.3% and 8.5%. The average contributions of cake fertilizer and straw returning were approximately 3.8% and 4.5%, respectively, thus small and stable. Collectively, the CAF NH3 emissions reflect the nation’s agricultural policy to a certain extent. An effective approach to decreasing PM2.5 concentrations in China would be to simultaneously decrease NOx, SO2 and NH3 emissions.",

            "abstract": "One of the biggest and severest natural disasters that society faces is floods. An important component that can help in reducing the impact of floods is satellite remote sensing as it allows for consistent monitoring and obtaining catchment information in absence of physical contact. Nowadays, passive microwave remote sensing observations are available in near real time (NRT) with a couple of hours delay from the actual sensing. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) is a multi-frequency passive microwave sensor onboard the Global Change Observation Mission 1 – Water that was launched in May 2012. Several of these frequencies have a high sensitivity to the land surface and they also have the capacity to penetrate clouds. These advantages come at the cost of the relatively coarse spatial resolution (footprints range from ~5 to ~50 km) which in turn allows for global monitoring. A relatively simple methodology to monitor the fraction of open water from AMSR2 observations is presented here.\nLow frequency passive microwave observations have sensitivity to the land surface but are modulated by overlying signals from physical temperature and vegetation cover. We developed a completely microwave based artificial neural network supported by physically based components to monitor the fraction of open water. Three different areas, located in China, Southeast Asia and Australia, were selected for testing purposes and several different characteristics were examined. First, the overall performance of the methodology was evaluated against the NASA NRT Global Flood Mapping system. Second, the skills of the various different AMSR2 frequencies were tested and revealed that artificial contamination is a factor to consider. The different skills of the tested frequencies are of interest to apply the methodology to alternative passive microwave sensors. This will be of benefit in using the numerous multi-frequency passive microwaves sensors currently observing our Earth. Finally, the fraction of open water products were compared against precipitation data over a 2-year analysis period and revealed strong seasonal agreement. Future research will focus on the integration of optical systems that allow observations at higher spatial resolutions and on the study of actual flood inundation events.",

            "abstract": "Because the economic and society were developing fast in the middle of last century, Los Angeles and London both were polluted by photochemical smog, which massacred thousands of people. Now, many regions are often covered by heavy haze in those large developing countries, especially in China and India. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) was held in Beijing during 5-11 November 2014. Beijing, Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia reduced air pollution emissions for the APEC 2014 meeting held in Beijing. Only in Hebei province, there were 1028 factories stopped or restricted and 881 construction sites stopped. Half of the cars were prohibited driving even in the Zibo city which is 400 km far from Beijing. For scientific aims, these control measures were indeed a huge and uncommon atmospheric experiment led by the government. During the experiment, what did the “APEC Blue” mean? We analyzed aerosol properties with the data of an AERONET site in Beijing which is located 500m far from the main reception hall of APEC 2014.\nThe Cimel solar photometers can give a series parameters of aerosol and water vapor. In this paper, we used CE318 solar photometer which is the main instrument of NASA AERONET. The CE318 of RADI belongs to the Chinese SONET (Sun-sky radiometer Observation NETwork) too. We analyzed the total, coarse and fine Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Fine-Mode Fraction (FMF) and Ångström exponent, Size Distribution and Real Refractive Index.\nIn conclusion, the aerosol properties were analysed with the measurements of a sun photometer. During the APEC 2014, AOD decreased obviously with a 0.27 mean value compared with the annual mean 0.7. Around Beijing, the southern is polluted emission area including the cross part of Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan four provinces, and the northern is clean for less fine mode particles emission in the large Inner Mongolia province. In fact, during the APEC 2014, the weather condition was not good for the pollutant diffusion, and the surrounding areas were all controlled. So the pollutant aerosol was mainly from local emissions. The humidity may have impact on particle’s hygroscopic growth which contributed to the air pollution.",

            "abstract": "The development of shale oil and gas reservoirs has increased dramatically due to the application of hydraulic fracturing techniques. Fracture fluids contain dissolved oxygen and numerous chemical additives [1] that are out of equilibrium with the reducing conditions in shale reservoirs and could react extensively with shale minerals and alter porosity. Yet, the complex dissolution-precipitation reactions in shales along with the poorly constrained characteristics of many fracture fluid additives hinder predictive modeling based on established reaction kinetics and thermodynamic constants [2]. Here, we are developing a reaction framework to better predict reaction progress and porosity evolution upon exposure of shales to hydraulic fracturing fluids. To this end, the reactive transport model CrunchFlow [3] was applied to the results of batch reactor experiments containing shales of different mineralogical and organic compositions exposed to simulated fracturing fluid. Despite relatively good agreement between modeled and experimental data for pH and aqueous Ca concentrations, which are strongly governed by carbonate dissolution, the model is presently unable to reproduce observed trends in aqueous Fe concentration. This is largely attributable to the dearth of thermodynamic data for certain fracture fluid components and the complex interactions between multiple Fe-bearing mineral phases. Experimental results revealed that the presence of organic fracture fluid components strongly influenced the precipitation of Fe-bearing phases, which are speculated to coat fracture fluid polymers that formed in the reactors. The incorporation of these effects in our reactive transport model will permit improved prediction of reservoir permeability evolution and metal release during hydraulic fracturing operations.\n[1] Stringfellow et al.

Focusing on the H1-BA transition, some model simulations capture the North Pacific shift from ventilated to stratified conditions and from cooling to warming conditions via oceanic and atmospheric connections between Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. To test the impact of these physical scenarios (variations in ocean stratification and temperature during the H1-BA transition) on calcite production or preservation, we conduct a series of idealized experiments using the Earth System Model Intermediate Complexity LOVECLIM. The variations in North Pacific Ocean stratification by anomalous freshwater forcing show low calcite productivity in associated with the subsurface nutrient decline. On the other hand, the rapid H1-BA warming of the North Pacific Ocean induced by anomalous heat forcing in turn increases calcite productivity due to the temperature-dependent growth rate of phytoplankton. These results suggest the possibility that the millennial-scale calcium carbonate peaks are the result of surface biogeochemical responses to the climate transition, not by the deep circulation response.",

            "abstract": "Time-dependent inconsistency of crustal movement is suggested in the Sanriku coast, northeast Japan. In northern Sanriku, coseismic subsidence up to 0.4 m of the 2011 M=9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake and a century-long subsidence apparently contradict to long-term uplift estimated from Pleistocene marine terraces. To explain the inconsistency, the following hypotheses have been proposed: 1) the 2011 event was typical, contributing long-term (104 yr) subsidence, 2) a significant interseismic contribution to long-term uplift, or 3) unknown huge events may have occurred to uplift the coastal region. However, in the southern Sanriku, closer to the 2011 source, poorly distributed marine terraces do not allow us to confirm the long-term uplift. We instead focus on the coastal plains that preserve sediments recording the tectonic history with better age constraints.\nWe extracted 40 m-long samples of the Holocene sediments in the Rikuzen-takata and Kesennuma-Okawa plains, along the southern Sanriku. The two plains share sedimentary facies of river, estuary, and delta. At both sites, relative sea-level (RSL) from 10 to 9.0 ka estimated from altitude of intertidal deposits is significantly lower than the theoretical none-tectonic RSL. We interpret that this discrepancy is attributed to Holocene tectonic subsidence.\nObserved Holocene subsidence is consistent with 2011 coseismic and a century-long subsidence. This long-term subsidence possibly suggests that the southern Sanriku has been submerged by both the 2011 type coseismic and interseismic deformation on the 104 yr time-scale. A significant difference is their rates: long-term subsidence rate of ~1 mm/yr is slower than a century-long rate of 1–10 mm/yr. However, it may be accommodated with the recovery from the ongoing postseismic and continuous potential interseismic uplift. We thus argue that there is no reason to include tectonic contribution from unknown, different type megathrust earthquakes to form the southern Sanriku.",

However, the range of amplitudes and periodicities of RSL cycles stored in stratigraphy remains unknown. Here we use a suite of physical experiments to show that RSL cycles with magnitudes and periodicities less than the spatial and temporal scales of deltaic internal (autogenic) dynamics cannot confidently be extracted from the physical stratigraphic record. Additional analysis of deltaic morphodynamics also suggest no significant differences between an experiment with constant boundary conditions (control experiment) and an experiment with small magnitude and short periodicity RSL cycles, relative to the autogenic dynamics. Significant differences in the aspect ratio of channel bodies and deposit sand fractions do exists between our control experiment and those experiments with either large magnitudes or long periodicities RSL cycles. Using a compilation of data from major river delta systems, we show that our predicted thresholds for RSL signal storage often overlap with the magnitudes and periodicities of commonly discussed drivers of global sea level. This theory defines quantitative limits on the range of paleo-RSL information that can be extracted from the stratigraphic record, which could aid stratigraphic prediction and the inversion of stratigraphy for paleo- deltaic response to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Large magnitude induced earthquakes associated with fluid injection occur on basement faults. The faults communicate both hydraulically and mechanically with the target reservoir. In this two-dimensional plane strain numerical study, we examine the full poroelastic response of basement faults to fluid injection, considering two factors: (1) permeability of the fault zone, and (2) hydraulic connectivity of the faults to the target formation. Given the formation properties, we obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of the Coulomb stress change Δτ(x,t). We separate Δτ into two parts: (1) the poroelastic stress change Δτs+fΔσn, where Δτs and Δσn are changes in shear and normal stress (+Δτs favors slip in the direction of the fault and +Δσn weakens the fault by extension), and (2) the pore pressure change fΔp. Our result shows that direct diffusion of pore pressure into high permeability faults plays the dominant role in determining their mechanical stability. However, for hydraulically isolated faults, poroelastic stresses are transferred to deeper basement rocks and can trigger earthquakes, even without direct impact of elevated pore pressure. We predict the seismicity rate on basement faults using the seismcity rate model of Dieterich [1994]. High seismicity rate is observed in the hydraulically connected faults due to direct pore-pressure diffusion. The seismicity rate is lower in the isolated faults, caused by poroelastic stressing on the deeper fault zone.",

            "abstract": "Changes in ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps (GIC) and land water mass cause regional sea level variations that differ significantly from a uniform sea level, with a decrease in sea level near the sources of mass added to the ocean and an increase up to 30% larger than the global mean sea level in the far field. The corresponding sea level fingerprints (SLF) are difficult to separate from ocean dynamics on short time and spatial scales but as ice continues to melt, the SLF signal will become increasingly significant. Here, we employ observations of time variable gravity from GRACE over land, including the mass change of ice sheets, GIC, and land water storage to precisely calculate the SLF for the time period 2002-2014. We compare the results with sea level change from satellite radar altimetry (AVISO) corrected for the steric signal of the ocean from Argo measurements. We find an excellent agreement at the global scale in trend for the entire period between GRACE-derived SLF and AVISO minus Argo estimates. The agreement extends at the spatial scale of oceanic regions. Locally, the GRACE-derived SLF also agrees with observations of ocean bottom pressure. The agreement demonstrates for the first time that SLF are reliable in terms of amplitude (intensity of mass loss), phase (spatial distribution of sources), and trends (increase in mass loss with time) using GRACE. During our observation period, we find that changes in land water mass dominate the seasonal variability of SLF. Greenland controls 42% of the total trend and 39% along the western and eastern US. Antarctica contributes 16% of the total trend and 21% in the western and eastern US.

This isotopic approach, however, is still facing some uncertainties in quantifying ET and its constituents according to assumptions and empirical formula involved. In this study, we combined high-time resolution measurement with laser absorption spectrometers and eddy covariance techniques to quantify ET and its two components, namely soil water Evaporation (E) and plant transpiration (T) for a sub-humid grassland in southern US. Direct chamber measurement on these two end-members was compared with revised Craig-Gordon model for the quantification consistency assessment. Our results indicate the daily ratio of T/ET and its sub-daily dynamics for different soil moisture and micro-climate conditions. We investigated the controlling factors for ET and its partitioning dynamics for this grassland ecosystem. The uncertainties involved in the quantification were also assessed by comparison between direct chamber and empirical approaches.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of the Internet gave rise to the expectation that the internet would lead to greater accessibility, transparency and reproducibility of research results. New communication technologies enabled far easier and faster collaboration in larger, geographically more distributed networks. However, the distributed and disorganised nature of the internet not only allowed new technologies to emerge, it also made it difficult to maintain a persistent record of science.\nPersistent identifiers were invented to allow unambiguous identification of resources on the net. At first, these resources referred to scholarly literature and related resources. The concept of using persistent identifiers has since been expanded to other, non-textual resources, like datasets and geological specimens, and more recently to authors and contributors of scholarly works, and to software and instruments.\nSetting up identifier systems is technically trivial. The real challenge lies in creating a governance system for the respective identifiers. While Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) were originally invented by the publishing industry, they quickly became an established way for the identification of research resources. Other identifier systems, some of them using DOI as an example, were developed as grass-roots efforts by the scientific community.\nTogether with semantic technologies and linked data, unambiguous identification allows us to harness information at large scales beyond human comprehension. The technical possibilities offered by technology challenge some of the norms of scholarly cooperation, such as using and sharing resources beyond the emulation of paper-based publications.\nThis presentation will discuss the development of persistent identification of research resources as a community effort, using the technical and governance patterns developed for DOI and for IGSN for data as an example.",

The 13C results also suggest that aqueous-phase oxidation of glyoxal and methylglyoxal is major formation process of oxalic acid production via the major intermediates glyoxylic acid and pyruvic acid.

            "abstract": "Although recognized that terrestrial hydrological processes drive a variety of biogeochemical processes, quantifying interactions that occur across a range of scales and compartments is challenging. We describe recently developed approaches to quantify these interactions, and demonstrate the value of developed approaches in two different terrestrial systems. The first is a relatively flat Arctic tundra polygonal ground system, where snowmelt-dominated, surface water distribution significantly influences soil microbial activity and resulting production of greenhouse gasses. The second is a Colorado River floodplain-catchment, where a transient snowmelt pulse leads to hydrological and biogeochemical interactions between different compartents of the system.\nThree capabilties were developed to improve understanding of hydrology influences on biogeochemistry at these sites. The first is a networked sensing system that coincidently measures below-, at- and above-ground critical properties (such as soil moisture, soil temperature, canopy greenness, surface water inundation, active layer depth, and snow thickness). The approach takes advantage of autonomous data acquisition using unmanned aerial vehicles, tram-based sensors, and surface geophysical approaches. The dense datasets enable ‘visualization’ of interactions that occur across compartments in response to freeze-thaw and runoff processes. The second advance is the development of a coupled hydro-thermal-geophysical inversion scheme that takes advantage of spatially extensive geophysical data as well as direct but sparse measurements in the quantitative estimation of terrestrial responses to hydrological perturbations. The third is the development of stochastic ‘zonation’ approaches, which use multi-type, multi-scale datasets to identify regions in the landscape that have unique distributions of properties that influence biogeochemical cycling. Together, the sensing, modeling, and integrative functional zonation approaches hold value for documenting how both press and pulse hydrological perturbations drive biogeochemical transformations - from local scales where native processes occur to landscape scales needed to improve climate model predictions.",

            "abstract": "The detailed and stable seismic source model of large earthquake is important to estimate strong ground motion and to calculate accurate tsunami waveforms as well as to understand the nature of earthquake. Slip-rate distributions of large earthquakes can be estimated by waveform inversions, which provide the broad features of the seismic source process. Since rapid acceleration and deceleration of a dynamic rupture generate high-frequency seismic waves, to comprehend fully the evolution of the rupture process during a large earthquake, it is necessary to construct a spatiotemporal slip-rate distribution that can explain the high-frequency components. However, it is difficult to estimate the slip-rate distribution including the high-frequency components by waveform inversion because of the uncertainty of the Green’s functions.\nRecently, the back-projection (BP) method has been widely used to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of the high-frequency radiation source. The clear advantage of BP is that it makes possible to obtain the high-frequency radiation without the theoretical Green’s functions. However, the timing of the sub-events estimated by the BP methods can be distorted by the effects of reflected phases (e.g., pP and sP phases), As a result, it is quite difficult to reliably compare the distribution of sub-events obtained by BP and the spatiotemporal slip-rate distributions inferred by waveform inversion. The Hybrid BP (HBP) method was developed to avoid the distortion effects of reflected phases. The HBP method uses the Green’s functions to mitigate the effect of reflected phases, and the HBP result can thus be compared to the slip-rate distribution obtained by the waveform inversion.\n In this study, we used the newly developed inversion and HBP methods to estimate the slip-rate distribution and high-frequency radiation (around 1 Hz) related to rapid acceleration and deceleration of a dynamic rupture, respectively, of recent large earthquake from teleseismic P-wave data. We compared the high-frequency radiation event and the slip-rate distribution, and then constructed an integrated source model that we are able to use to infer the detailed dynamic rupture process during large earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown strong linkages between hemispheric asymmetries in atmospheric and oceanic energy budgets, tropical precipitation and the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The energetics framework has been used to explain why the mean position of the ITCZ is in the Northern Hemisphere and to study large-scale circulation and precipitation responses to changes in the hemispheric distribution of heating. Here, we expand upon these earlier studies by also considering estimates of hemispheric asymmetry in surface and atmospheric radiation budget derived from satellite observations, which enables a decomposition of cross-equatorial heat transport in terms of radiative and non-radiative (i.e., combined latent and sensible heat) components.\nSatellite observations of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiation budget from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiation Budget (CERES) are combined with mass corrected vertically integrated atmospheric energy divergence from reanalysis to infer the regional distribution of the TOA, atmospheric and surface energy budget terms over the globe. Observed radiative and combined sensible and latent heat contributions to atmospheric and oceanic cross-equatorial heat transports are compared with simulations from 30 models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5).\nResults show that most CMIP5 models that overestimate tropical precipitation in the SH have too much net downward surface radiation and combined latent and sensible heat flux in the SH relative to the NH. In addition, many of the models also underestimate atmospheric radiative cooling in the SH compared to the NH. Consequently, the models have excessive heating of the SH atmosphere and anomalous SH to NH cross-equatorial heat transport. The anomalous northward heat transport occurs via the upper branch of the northern Hadley Cell, while anomalous NH to SH moisture transport occurs in the lower branch of the northern Hadley cell, which supplies moisture to a SH ITCZ. The hemispheric bias in net surface radiative flux is due to too much longwave surface radiative cooling in the NH tropics in both clear and all-sky conditions and excessive shortwave surface radiation in the SH subtropics and extratropics due to an underestimation in reflection by clouds.",

Sound velocity and density are important observational constraints on the chemical composition of the Earth’s core. While properties of solid iron alloying with possible lighter elements have been extensively examined by laboratory studies to core pressures, little is known for liquid alloys because of experimental difficulties. The core is predominantly molten, and therefore the longitudinal wave (P-wave) velocity of liquid alloy is the key to constrain its composition. We have performed inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) measurements combined with laser-heated and external-heated diamond-anvil cells at the SPring-8 synchrotron facility, in order to investigate the sound velocities of liquid Fe–light-element alloys under high pressure and high temperature. We measured longitudinal acoustic phonon excitations of liquid iron alloying with possible components in the core such as Ni, C, Si, or S, and then determined their P-wave velocities to 70 GPa and 3000 K. The elastic parameters and equations of state for liquid iron alloys were also examined using the velocity data-set together with available thermodynamic parameters in literature, which enables us to estimate densities of liquid alloys as well as sound velocities under the core pressure and temperature conditions. Based on the comparison of sound velocity and density based on the present IXS measurements with seismological observations, we will discuss the role of lighter elements in the Earth’s outer core.",

Continental crust may have accumulated via horizontal accretion in modern-style subduction zones or via vertical accretion above upper mantle upwelling zones. However, the characteristics of the continental crust changes at the transition between the Archean and Proterozoic eons, suggesting that continental crust did not form in subduction zones until at least the late Archean. Here I use seismic receiver function data to analyse the bulk properties of continental crust in Western Australia, which formed and stabilized over a billion years in the Archean. I find that the bulk seismic properties of the crust cluster spatially, with similar clusters confined within the boundaries of tectonic terranes. I use local Archean crustal growth models to show that both plume and subduction processes may have had a role in creating crust throughout the Archean. A correlation between crustal age and the bulk seismic properties of the crust reveals a trend: from about 3.5 Ga to the end of the Archean, the crust gradually thickened and simultaneously became more evolved in composition. I propose that this trend reflects the transition between crust dominantly formed above mantle plumes, to crust formed in subduction zones - a transition that may reflect secular cooling of Earth's mantle.",

            "abstract": "The robustness of stratigraphic- and geomorphic-based inferences of Quaternary peak interglacial sea levels — and equivalent minimum continental ice volumes — depends on the accuracy with which highstand markers can be corrected for vertical tectonic displacement. For sites that preserve a Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e sea-level highstand marker, the customary method for estimating tectonic uplift/subsidence rate computes the difference between the local elevation of the highstand marker and a reference eustatic (i.e., global mean) MIS 5e sea-level height, typically assumed to be +6 m, and then divides this height difference by the age of the highstand marker. This rate is then applied to correct the elevation of other observed sea-level markers at that site for tectonic displacement. Subtracting a reference eustatic value from a local MIS 5e highstand marker elevation introduces two potentially significant errors. First, the commonly adopted peak eustatic MIS 5e sea-level value (i.e., +6 m) is likely too low; recent studies concluded that MIS 5e peak eustatic sea level was ~6–9 m. Second, local peak MIS 5e sea level was not globally uniform, but instead characterized by significant departures from eustasy due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) in response to successive glacial–interglacial cycles and excess polar ice-sheet melt relative to present day. We present numerical models of GIA that incorporate both of these effects in order to quantify the plausible range in error of previous tectonic corrections. We demonstrate that, even far from melting ice sheets, local peak MIS 5e sea level may have departed from eustasy by 2–4 m, or more. Thus, adopting an assumed reference eustatic value to estimate tectonic displacement, rather than a site-specific GIA signal, can introduce significant error in estimates of peak eustatic sea level (and minimum ice volumes) during Quaternary highstands (e.g., MIS 11, MIS 5c and MIS 5a).",

The storm is identified as due to the Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) which erupted on March 15 from Region 2297 of solar surface. During this event, the geomagnetic storm index Dst reached -223 nT and the geomagnetic aurora electrojet (AE) index increased and reached as high as >2200 nT with large amplitude fluctuations. Aurora occurred in both hemispheres. Ground auroral sightings were reported from Michigan to Alaska and as far south as southern Colorado. The Day Night Band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard Suomi-NPP represents a major advancement in night time imaging capabilities. The DNB senses radiance that can span 7 orders of magnitude in one panchromatic (0.5-0.9 μm) reflective solar band and provides imagery of clouds and other Earth features over illumination levels ranging from full sunlight to quarter moon. In this paper, DNB observations of aurora activities during the St. Patrick’s Day geomagnetic storm are analyzed. Aurora are observed to evolve with salient features by DNB for orbital pass on the night side (~local time 1:30am) in both hemispheres.  The radiance data from DNB observation are collected at the night sides of southern and northern hemispheres and geo-located onto geomagnetic local time (MLT) coordinates. Regions of aurora during each orbital pass are identified through image processing by contouring radiance values and excluding regions with stray light near day-night terminator. The evolution of aurora are characterized with time series of the poleward and low latitude boundary of aurora, their latitude-span and area, peak radiance and total light emission of the aurora region in DNB observation. These characteristic parameters are correlated with solar wind and geomagnetic index parameters.",

            "abstract": "Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is the precursor of sulphate aerosols and has crucial impacts on atmospheric chemistry, cloud physics, air quality, ecological environment and global climate change. The vertical distribution of SO2 can directly influence atmospheric chemistry and cloud processes. Information on the SO2 vertical profile, however, scarcely exist. Indirect evidence for the frequent occurrence of elevated SO2 layers in the North China Plain (NCP) was found in the case study of three consecutive fog cases and in the detailed analysis of long-term SO2 surface concentration measurements at four different sites. During fog episodes, high concentrations of SO2 over the fog layer was believed responsible for the rapid increases of surface SO2 after the dissipation of the fog. Different from the more common SO2 diurnal patterns with high nighttime concentrations, a frequent SO2 noon-time peak phenomenon was found in the NCP with an occurrence frequency of 50 to 72% at four stations, amongst which 30-52% of the cases were attributed to down-mixing of elevated SO2 layers. The formation of the elevated SO2 layer was attributed to emissions of high stacks accompanied with shallow temperature inversion layers. Elevated SO2 layers will promote the oxidative transformation of SO2 in cloud water. The SO2 noontime peaks caused partly by the elevated SO2 layer will lead to a 13 to 35% increase in sulphur dry deposition, 9 to 23% increase in gas phase oxidation and 8 to 33% increase in aqueous phase conversions, which will increase the hygroscopicity and the light scattering of aerosols, thus having important impacts on atmospheric chemistry, cloud physics and climate.",

            "abstract": "Integrating different data types into inverse modeling and uncertainty quantification is important in all types of environmental systems. One integration method is to use a single objective function with weighting to accommodate quantities with different units, which would otherwise not be validly additive. Another is multi-objective functions. This talk uses a saltwater intrusion example to examine the use of three data types in model development with a weighted single objective function. The data types involved are water age, salinity, and hydraulic heads. Water age is simulated with MODPATH, salinity and heads are simulated with the transport and flow equations in SEAWAT. Initial efforts to weight the data were intended to diminish the effect of the age dates because they were thought to be less accurate. However, the sensitivity analysis measure leverage showed that the age dates dominated the head and concentration observations. Stacked CSS graphs showed that nearly all parameters considered in the optimization were dominated by the age dates. How could this be? The age dates were assigned weights of 0.00449, while the concentrations were assigned weights of 3.80. To compare the imposed weights, error-based weighting theory was used. Error-based weighting is the only weighting that can be shown theoretically to produce unbiased parameter estimates. Results showed that the imposed weighting actually overemphasized the age dates relative to the concentration and head data. The age dates ranged from 2,932 to 11,837 days. The weighting was consistent with coefficients of variation on the age dates that were all less than 10%, and most were less than 1%. This was a much greater level of accuracy than intended by the modelers. In contrast, the concentrations ranged from 0.0 to 35 g/l. The weights on the non-zero chloride concentrations were consistent with coefficients of variation that were between 1% and 15%. The 15% was consistent with expected data errors. Smaller coefficients of variation produce larger weights for a given observation. Thus, while the intent was to deemphasize the age dates, the result of the weighting was the opposite. This example illustrates the insight provided by evaluating weights from an error-based perspective. Implications for multi-objective function methods are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Detailed sediment budgets for many agricultural watersheds are revealing a surprising story – that sediment is no longer primarily sourced from upland fields, but instead from near-channel sources. This is the case for the Minnesota River Basin (MRB) where an intensification and expansion of agricultural drainage combined with increased precipitation has (1) reduced surface runoff and erosion, (2) amplified streamflows, and (3) accelerated both near-channel sediment generation and sediment transport. Bluffs and streambanks in the MRB are now the dominant sources of sediment, but these features are not easily incorporated into traditional watershed-scale, sediment-transport models. Instead, we are advancing a network-based modeling framework that explicitly considers sediment sources, transport, and storage along a river network. We apply this framework to bed-material sediment transport in the Greater Blue Earth River Basin, the major sediment-generating subbasin of the MRB, where a recent sediment budget has quantified the locations and rates of erosion and deposition of major sediment sources and sinks (i.e., bluffs, streambanks/floodplains, agricultural fields, and ravines) over millennial and decadal timescales. With the river network as the basis of a simple model, inputs of sediment to the network are informed by the sediment budget and these inputs are tracked through the network using process-based time delays that incorporate uniform-flow hydraulics and at-capacity sediment transport. We explore how this sediment might move through the network and affect the variability of bed elevations under cases where the mechanisms of in-channel and floodplain storage are turned on and off. We will discuss timescales of movement of sediment through the system to better inform legacy effects and hysteresis, and also discuss targeted management actions that will most effectively reduce the detrimental effects of excess sediment.",

            "abstract": "River networks form the arteries of a landscape, efficiently conveying water, sediment, and nutrients through a small fraction of a watershed. Yet this small fraction, which comprises the river network, dictates the watershed-scale response. Thus, by incorporating the dominant transport, storage, and transformation processes of a given flux into a river-network context, one can reveal the large-scale system functioning and the emergence of vulnerabilities and “hotspots” of change. We apply such a network-modeling framework by (1) decomposing the landscape into a connected network of elements including river channels, lakes, wetlands, etc., (2) spatially and temporally distributing inputs of water, sediment, and nutrients, and (3) tracking these inputs through individual landscape elements using process-based time delays and transformations. We suggest that landscapes are too complex to be modeled with fully distributed deterministic models that consider all the small-scale physics and interactions, due to large and unavoidable uncertainties. Besides, changes in climate, land use, and water management impose non-stationary conditions, and also nonlinearities in the system make it sensitive to small perturbations. Instead, the aim of this framework is to combine the system connectivity and most important processes in an effort to guide watershed-management decisions in a simple, physically-based way. We will describe the application of this framework to bed-material sediment, nitrogen, and streamflow. Specifically, we will use the framework to identify channel-migration and nitrate hotspots, and explore various management strategies for hotspot reduction. Also, we will show, through the network perspective offered by this framework, how simple questions about where to manage for peak-flow reduction can be answered. This framework offers a simple approach for gaining systems-level understanding that can be applied in route to more complex watershed modeling.",

            "abstract": "Antarctic sea ice concentration fields show a strong seasonal and interannual variation closely tied to changes in climate patterns. The Ross, Amundsen, Bellingshausen, and Weddell Seas during Summer-Autumn and the Southern Ocean regions north of these areas during Winter-Spring have the greatest sea ice variability. Principal components analysis in T- mode, Varimax-rotated applied on Antarctic monthly sea ice concentration anomaly (SICA) fields for 1979-2015 (NASA Team algorithm data sets available at nsidc.org) revealed the main spatial characteristics of Antarctic sea ice patterns and their relationship with atmospheric circulation. This analysis yielded five patterns of sea ice for winter-spring and three patterns for summer-autumn, each of which has a positive and negative phase. To understand the links between the SICA patterns and climate, we extracted the mean pressure and temperature fields for the months with high loadings (positive or negative) of the sea ice patterns. The first pattern of winter-spring sea ice concentration is a dipole structure between the Drake Passage and northern regions of the Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas and, the South Atlantic Ocean. The negative phase shows a strong negative SICA over the Atlantic basin. This pattern can be associated with to the atmospheric structures related to a positive SAM index and a wave-3 arrangement around the continent. That is, a strong negative pressure anomaly centered over the Bellingshausen Sea accompanied by three positive pressure anomalies in middle-latitudes. For summer-autumn, the first pattern shows two strong positive SICA areas, in the eastern Weddell Sea and the northwestern Ross Sea. A negative SICA covers the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas and northwest of the Antarctic Peninsula. This pattern, frequently seen in summers since 2008, is associated with cool conditions over the Weddell Sea but warmer temperatures and high surface air pressure west, north and northwest of the Peninsula.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution direct tomographic imaging of subsurface Earth structures is generally limited by the distribution of seismic sources necessary for such studies. However, seismic interferometry has the potential to signiﬁcantly overcome this issue through the use of ambient seismic noise recordings. Whereas the recovery of virtual surface waves via seismic interferometry techniques are the most abundant results produced by such studies, it has recently been shown that virtual body waves can also be recovered under appropriate conditions. Of particular interest to us is the scattering of body waves produced by velocity discontinuities in the subsurface, which dramatically improves our ability to characterize seismic velocity structures. In this work, using ambient seismic noise recordings across a network of stations near Parkﬁeld, California, we observe both virtual P waves traversing the San Andreas Fault as well as non-fault-traversing P waves on either side. From observed fault-traversing P waves we propose a P wave velocity model of the San Andreas Fault. We further investigate the possibility of recovering body-wave scattering from interactions with velocity discontinuities associated with the fault. From such body-wave scattering interactions we test whether mode-conversions (P to S waves) can be observed using these virtual Green’s functions. Additionally, using non-fault-traversing P waves we explore differences in velocity structure on either side of the San Andreas Fault in the Parkﬁeld region. Finally, we examine the potential of seismic interferometry to produce time-lapse body-wave characterizations of the San Andreas Fault, in which properties of the fault can be seen to change in time",

            "abstract": "The present-day upper crustal stress regime near the central Alpine Fault represents the superposition of topographic and tectonic stresses late in the fault’s typical earthquake cycle. Previous estimates based on focal mechanism analysis of the principal stress orientations at seismogenic depths reveal a regional axis of maximum horizontal compressive stress trending approximately 115°. However seismicity adjacent to the Alpine Fault is sparse and does not constrain the stress field close to the fault or with sufficient spatial resolution to distinguish variations. The analysis of fractures revealed in borehole televiewer (BHTV) logs collected during DFDP-2B drilling provides an opportunity to examine stresses in the hanging-wall of the Alpine Fault. Here we present the results of stress analysis utilizing a dataset consisting of 418 fractures. On average, many of the fractures dip at 50-60° towards the southeast, consistent with the regional attitude of the Alpine Fault. We compute stress parameters using the Hough transform method, which enables us to analyze incomplete fault slip measurements that do not contain slip directions. For this analysis, we assumed that all fractures represent reverse-faulting components in response to a single homogeneous stress tensor, and that fractures with similar geometries to the Alpine Fault involve similar top to the west shear. Our preliminary analysis of the dataset as a whole yields orientations (trends/plunge) for the maximum and minimum compressive stress axes σ1 and σ3 of 129/26 and 27/23 (±30°), respectively and a stress ratio of (σ2–σ3)/(σ1–σ3)=~0.3. These parameters yield an axis of maximum horizontal compressive stress of 136±30°, implying that the trend of σHmax is rotated clockwise from the regional azimuth into a direction more perpendicular to the strike of the Alpine Fault near the fault. The orientations are compatible with previously determined horizontal shortening from analysis of small scale fractures.\n.",

For Syria, a country marked by poor governance and unsustainable agricultural and environmental policies, the drought had a catalytic effect contributing to political unrest. We show that the recent decrease in Syrian precipitation is a combination of natural variability and a long-term drying trend, and the unusual severity of the observed drought is here shown to be highly unlikely without this trend. Precipitation changes in Syria are linked to rising mean sea-level pressure in the Eastern Mediterranean, which also shows a long-term trend. There has been also a long-term warming trend in the Eastern Mediterranean, adding to the drawdown of soil moisture. No natural cause is apparent for these trends, whereas the observed drying and warming are consistent with model studies of the response to increases in greenhouse gases. Furthermore, model studies show an increasingly drier and hotter future mean climate for the Eastern Mediterranean. Analyses of observations and model simulations indicate that a drought of the severity and duration of the recent Syrian drought, which is implicated in the current conflict, has become more than twice as likely as a consequence of human interference in the climate system.",

However, the total abundance of fungal spores in the atmosphere is rather uncertain and likely underestimated to a large extent by traditional Colony Forming Units (CFU) assays. Flow cytometry (FCM) was utilized in combination with fluorescent stains for the rapid counting of ambient fungal spores in this study. And, the sugar alcohols, mannitol and arabitol, proposed as molecular tracers for fungal aerosol were measured in PM2.5 and PM10 at an urban site in Beijing, China. The annual average concentrations of arabitol in PM2.5 and PM10 at the urban site were 7.4±9.4 ng m-3 and 21.0±20.4 ng m-3, and the respective mannitol concentrations were 10.3±9.5 ng m-3 and 31.9±26.9 ng m-3. Compared to PM2.5, the seasonal average concentrations of arabitol and mannitol in PM10 were varied more significantly. During summer and autumn higher arabitol and mannitol levels than during spring and winter were observed in coarse particles. Statistics analysis was further grouped into typical dry season (December 2010 to March 2011) and typical wet season (July 2011 to September 2011), revealed the different variation of fungal spores in different seasons. Moreover, the FCM results had significant positive correlation with the concentrations of the fungal tracers (R2 was 0.75 and 0.70 for arabitol and mannitol, respectively), supporting the utility of these sugar alcohols as effective fungal tracers.",

            "abstract": "The exhumation of deeply buried rocks typically involves dynamic feedbacks between deformation and metamorphic reactions (+ fluid and/or melt) that influence rheology and facilitate or drive large-magnitude exhumation. The evolution of grain-scale to terrane-scale processes during decompression can be seen in rocks exhumed from oceanic and continental subduction and from orogenic crust. In the Sivrihisar (Turkey) high-P/low-T (oceanic subduction) complex, microstructures record deformation and syn-kinematic reactions during decompression from eclogite to blueschist facies conditions; this transformation resulted in dramatic strength reduction that promoted strain localization along the subduction interface. In quartz-rich rocks, qz was deformed in the dislocation creep regime and records transitions in microstructure and slip systems during near-isothermal decompression from 2.5 to 1.5 GPa; these transitions may be related to decreasing water fugacity over tens of km of decompression. High-to ultrahigh-P eclogite in exhumed continental subduction zones such as the Western Gneiss Region (Norway) record decompression from >2.5 GPa to <1 GPa. Eclogite shows dramatic textural evidence for decompression, including partial melting and decomposition into hbl-gneiss, resulting in weakening and strain localization. In collisional orogens that are underlain by partially molten crust, upper crustal extension/transtension drives rapid ascent of the deep crust to form migmatite-cored domes. The exhuming deep crust entrains HP relics such as eclogite (e.g. Montagne Noire dome, France) as it traverses much of the orogenic crust, from >1.2 GPa to (in some cases) <0.1 GPa in a single, geologically rapid event during which the partially molten crust reaches the near-surface. In summary, decompression of subducted or deeply buried crust systematically leads to rheologic transitions and feedbacks between deformation and metamorphism in the presence of aqueous fluid and/or melt.",

            "abstract": "Hudson Bay overlies some of the thickest Precambrian lithosphere on Earth, whose internal structures contain important clues to the earliest workings of plate formation. The terminal collision, the Trans-Hudson Orogen, brought together the Western Churchill craton to the northwest and the Superior craton to the southeast. These two Archean cratons along with the Paleo-Proterozoic Trans-Hudson internides, form the core of the North American craton. We use S to P converted wave imaging and absolute shear velocity information from a joint inversion of P to S receiver functions, new ambient noise derived phase velocities, and teleseismic phase velocities to investigate this region and determine both the thickness of the lithosphere and the presence of internal discontinuities. The lithosphere under central Hudson Bay approaches 􏰂350 km thick but is thinner (􏰂200–250 km) around the periphery of the Bay. Furthermore, the amplitude of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) conversion from the S receiver functions is unusually large for a craton, suggesting a large thermal contrast across the LAB, which we interpret as direct evidence of the thermal insulation effect of continents on the asthenosphere. Within the lithosphere, midlithospheric discontinuities, significantly shallower than the base of the lithosphere, are often imaged, suggesting the mechanisms that form these layers are common. Lacking time-history information, we infer that these discontinuities reflect reactivation of formation structures during deformation of the craton.",

So far, ICL has deployed over 5500 EEW sensors in China, which is 5 times the number of EEW sensors in Japan, covering more than 2.1 million square kilometers. Since June, 2011, over 5000 earthquakes, with 28 of them are destructive quakes, have triggered the EEWS with no false alert. The root mean square (RMS) error of the magnitude for the 28 destructive quakes is 0.32. In addition, innovative work is done to suppress false alarm and miss alarm, which pushes forward the application of EEW in China. The technology is also being applied in Nepal now.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic climate is strongly influenced by the inflow of warm Atlantic water conveyed by the Norwegian Atlantic Slope Current (NwASC); the main heat conveyor into the Arctic Ocean. Based on sea surface height (SSH) data from altimetry, we develop a dynamical measure of the NwASC transport to diagnose its spatio-temporal variability. This supports a dynamical division of the NwASC into two flow regimes; the Svinøy Branch (SvB) in the Norwegian Sea, and the Fram Strait Branch (FSB) west of Spitsbergen. The SvB transport is well correlated with the SSH and atmospheric variability within the Nordic Seas, factors that also affect the inflow to the Barents Sea. In contrast, the FSB is regulated by regional atmospheric patterns around Svalbard and northern Barents Sea. We further relate anomalous flow events to temperature fluctuations of Atlantic water. A warm anomaly is found to propagate northwards, with a tendency to amplify enroute, after events of strong flow in the Norwegian Sea. A roughly 12-months delayed temperature signal is identified in the FSB. This suggests that hydrographic anomalies both upstream from the North Atlantic, and locally generated in the Norwegian Sea, are important for the oceanic heat and salt transport that eventually enters into the Arctic. We believe that the combination of the flow from altimetry and temperature fluctuations in the Nordic Seas can be used to qualitatively predict warm anomalies towards the Arctic Ocean, which could be a valuable addition to the forecast skill of the statistical Arctic sea-ice models.

This sector is very much susceptible to climate change. This study is emphasized on Terai region (situated at an altitude of 60m to 300m) of Nepal which investigates the impacts of climate variability on various stages of cropping (paddy) periods such as transplant, maturity and harvest. The climate variables namely temperature and rainfall are used to explore the relationship between climate and paddy yields based on 30 years of historical observed data. Observed monthly rainfall and temperature data are collected from the department of hydrology and meteorology, and paddy yield data are collected from the Ministry of Agricultural Development. A correlation analysis will be carried out between the backward difference filtered climate parameters and the backward difference filtered rice yield. This study will also analyze average monthly and annual rainfall, and, min, max and mean temperature during the period of 1981-2010 based on 15 synoptic stations of Nepal. This study will visualize rainfall and temperature distribution over Nepal, and also evaluate the effect of change in rainfall and temperature in the paddy yield. While evaluating the impacts of climate on crop yield, this study will not consider the impact of irrigation in crop yield. The major results, climate distribution and its local/regional impacts on agriculture, could be utilized by planners, decision makers, and climate and agricultural scientists as a basis in formulating/implementing future plans, policies and projects.",

            "abstract": "Earth system models describe the physical, chemical, and biological processes that govern our global climate. While it is difficult to single out one component as being more important than another in these sophisticated models, terrestrial vegetation is a critical player in the biogeochemical and biophysical dynamics of the Earth system. There is much debate, however, as to how plant diversity and function should be represented in these models. Plant functional types (PFTs) have been adopted by modelers to represent broad groupings of plant species that share similar characteristics (e.g. growth form) and roles (e.g. photosynthetic pathway) in ecosystem function. In this review the PFT concept is traced from its origin in the early 1800s to its current use in regional and global dynamic vegetation models (DVMs). Special attention is given to the representation and parameterization of PFTs and to validation and benchmarking of predicted patterns of vegetation distribution in high-latitude ecosystems. These ecosystems are sensitive to changing climate and thus provide a useful test case for model-based simulations of past, current, and future distribution of vegetation. Models that incorporate the PFT concept predict many of the emerging patterns of vegetation change in tundra and boreal forests, given known processes of tree mortality, treeline migration, and shrub expansion. However, representation of above- and especially belowground traits for specific PFTs continues to be problematic. Potential solutions include developing trait databases and replacing fixed parameters for PFTs with formulations based on trait co-variance and empirical trait-environment relationships. Surprisingly, despite being important to land-atmosphere interactions of carbon, water, and energy, PFTs such as moss and lichen are largely absent from DVMs. Close collaboration among those involved in modelling with the disciplines of taxonomy, biogeography, ecology, and remote sensing will be required if we are to overcome these and other shortcomings.",

            "abstract": "A decade ago there was a clear gap in our operational environmental prediction capabilities, and associated decision support guidance, at lead times beyond ten days and less than one month. Recognizing the need for making advances in the scientific understanding, model fidelity and prediction capabilities that could fill this gap, US CLIVAR formed the Madden-Julian Oscillation Working Group (MJOWG; 2006-09), as the MJO represented an obvious, unexploited source of predictability at these time scales. The MJOWG focused on advancements on two fronts, experimental to operational prediction of the MJO and weather/climate model experimentation, diagnostics and performance metrics. The former led to a multi-national operational MJO prediction capability hosted at NCEP/NOAA. The successful efforts of the MJOWG, and remaining work to do to further these objectives, led to the subsequent formation of the WCRP–WWRP MJO Task Force (MJOTF; 2010-present). Expanding the MJOWG efforts, the MJOTF advanced experimental to operational predictions of the boreal summer Intraseasonal Oscillation (BSISO). The multi-national operational BSISO predictions have been available since 2013 and are hosted by the APEC Climate Center (APCC), providing guidance on BSISO-driven onsets and breaks of the Asian summer monsoon. The success of these initial R2O MJO/BSISO prediction efforts led, in part, to the formation of the WCRP-WWRP Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) Prediction Project and North America Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) designed to improve the skill of S2S forecasts and advance their utilization by the applications community. The above developments, projects and capabilities, including key multi-model research experimentation, will be discussed, highlighting the role of US CLIVAR, and concluding with a summary of the outcomes and recommendations of the 2015 National Academy of Science report on Developing a U.S. Research Agenda to Advance Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasting.",

            "abstract": "Nojima fault gouge has recorded physical processes during seismic slip, and one can find billow-like wavy folds along slip planes in the gouge. The fold patterns are similar to the ones of Kelvin Helmholtz (KH)–instability which occurs in fluid. Therefore, the presence of such folds suggests the fluidization of gouge materials. This instability occurs at the interface between two fluids of different densities shearing at different velocities (Thorpe, 2005), and in low viscous fluid (Woods, 1969). If a temperature range for the generation of such billow-like folds could be determined, we can constrain the weakening mechanism of frictional strength of faults. Here we show rock magnetic studies to prove the temperature rise in the generation of the billow-like folds, using a scanning magneto-impedance magnetic microscope. Its results showed the folds and the slip zones have been magnetized by the production of magnetite through thermal decomposition of siderite in the gouge. The thermal decomposition of siderite generally occurs at over about 350℃. This heating implies that thermal pressurization or melting were the driving mechanism of faulting. In order to clarify which mechanism mainly drove in the fault gouge, we constrained the temperature and viscosity condition of each melting model and thermal pressurization model from the perspective of the existence of the KH-instability. The melting model generates no such instability because of high viscosity (10 Pa·s), even if we postulate relatively high temperature melting (1300℃). On the other hands, we found that the thermal pressurization model can forced the fault slip zone very low viscosity (1.0×10-3 Pa·s) enough to generate KH-instability, which requires a shear stress of at most 0.25 Pa during faulting. It is supposed that the existence of the low viscosity fluid and the frictional heating decreased the frictional strength of the Nojima fault at an ancient large seismic activity, accelerating the fault motion.",

We estimated ToEs for the magnitude, duration and frequency of global extreme climate represented by 24 extreme climate indices (16 for temperature and 8 for precipitation) with different thresholds of the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio based on projections of CMIP5 global climate models under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 for the 21st century. The uncertainty of ToE is assessed by using 3 different methods to calculate S/N for each extreme index. Results show that ToEs of the projected extreme climate indices based on the RCP4.5 climate scenarios are generally projected to happen about 20 years later than that for the RCP8.5 climate scenarios. Under RCP8.5, the projected magnitude, duration and frequency of extreme temperature on Earth will all exceed 2 standard deviations by 2100, and the empirical 50th percentile of the global ToE for the frequency and magnitude of hot (cold) extreme are about 2040 and 2054 (2064 and 2054) for S/N > 2, respectively. The 50th percentile of global ToE for the intensity of extreme precipitation is about 2030 and 2058 for S/N >0.5 and S/N >1, respectively. We further evaluated the exposure of ecosystems and human societies to the pace of extreme climate change by determining the year of ToE for various extreme climate indices projected to occur over terrestrial biomes, marine realms and major urban areas with large populations. This was done by overlaying terrestrial, ecoregions and population maps with maps of ToE derived, to extract ToEs for these regions. Possible relationships between GDP per person and ToE are also investigated by relating the mean ToE for each country and its average value of GDP per person.",

Whereas, policy makers with the support of the public must implement solutions to these problems, it is scientists and engineers who are best equipped to evaluate technically sound, optimal, and efficient solutions. Yet, a disconnect exists between information provided by scientists and engineers and policies implemented. Part of the reason is that scientific information provided to policy makers and the public is swamped out by information provided by lobbyists and another part is the difficulty in providing information to the hundreds of millions of people who need it rather than to just a few thousand.

We established experimental watersheds both in deciduous and evergreen forests containing meteorological observation towers in Cambodia and collected various observational data since 2003 (O’Krieng, deciduous forest watershed including a 30-m-high observation tower, 2,245 km2; Stung Chinit, evergreen forest watershed including a 60-m-high observation tower, 3,700 km2 including three small watersheds). The basic data from these sites included various kinds of information related to the composition of vegetation, soil characteristics, etc. Hydrologic data was collected and linked to the above data; the main hydrologic research results follow. The water budget for each watershed was determined using an observational rainfall and runoff dataset. The evapotranspiration rate in an evergreen forest was obtained using various observational methods including the Bowen energy-balance ratio and the bandpass eddy covariance method. The annual evapotranspiration of evergreen forests, estimated using the Bowen energy-balance ratio method and water balance, was about 1100–1200 mm, corresponding to 70–80% of annual rainfall. While considering the importance of the presence of evergreen forest, we conducted sap flow measurements to analyze the transpiration process that maintains water uptake through root systems that reach to depths exceeding 8 m. Characteristics of the evaporation from the forest floor that form an important element of the evaporation system were estimated in both evergreen and deciduous forests.",

            "abstract": "An accurate representation of the land surface temperature (LST) climatology of the coupled land-atmosphere system in global climate models (GCMs) has strong implications for the reliability of projected LST and temperature variability inferred by these models. We have identified a substantial underestimation of the total ice water path (TIWP) and biases of surface radiation budget commonly seen in the CMIP models which are highly correlated to the bias of LST over land. One of the potential causes of the CMIP model biases is the missing representation of large frozen precipitating hydrometeors (i.e., snow) in all CMIP3 and most CMIP5 models.\nWe examine the impacts of snow on the radiation, LST, air-land heat fluxes to explore the implications to the common biases in CMIP models using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)-coupled Community Earth System Model (CESM) to perform sensitivity experiments with and without snow radiation effects. It is found that an inclusion of the snow-radiative effects in CESM notably reduces the LST biases (up to 2-3 K) in the mid- and high-latitude, in particular, in boreal winter seasons. It is found that without the snow-radiation effects in the CESM, the model simulates too cold LST associated with underestimated downward surface LW radiation for all seasons but too warm LST associated with excessive SW surface radiative fluxes in summer seasons, consistent with those in CMIP models. The changes of the LST, however, cannot be explained by the differences in surface sensible and evaporative heat fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Modeling future glacier changes on a global scale is challenging due to scarcity of data for model initialization and calibration and biases in climate data in complex mountainous terrain. Hence, only few global-scale models have been published during the last ten years. Approaches to project global-scale mass balances broadly fall into three categories: (1) models based on simple extrapolation, (2) models based on mass balance sensitivities to temperature and precipitation changes, and (3) direct modeling of transient surface mass balance driven by climate data. Results from 8 to 15 Global Circulation Models indicate multi-model mean net mass losses of all glaciers on Earth (outside the ice sheets) between 66 mm and 242 mm sea-level equivalent by the end of this century. Amounts vary greatly depending on the choice of the forcing climate and emission scenario. Insufficiently constrained model parameters likely are an important reason for large differences found among previous studies even when forced by the same emission scenario, especially on regional scales. A new “Targeted Activity” under the Climate and Cryosphere (CliC) program, seeks to understand these differences, and for the first time provides a framework for a coordinated intercomparison of global-scale glacier mass change models with the ultimate goal to foster model improvements and reduce uncertainties in global glacier projections and associated contributions to sea-level rise.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that stream-groundwater interactions (gaining or losing flow conditions) have a major impact on hyporheic exchange fluxes. However, the physical complexity of natural streams has limited our ability to study these types of interactions systematically in the field, and to evaluate their importance to biogeochemical processes and nutrient cycling. In this work we were able to quantify the effect of losing and gaining fluxes on hyporheic exchange in heterogeneous streambeds by combining experiments in a laboratory flume and modeling. Tracer experiments were conducted for measuring hyporheic exchange with using a dye and NaCl under various combinations of overlying water velocities and losing or gaining fluxes. The goal of the modeling was to extent and to supplement the hydraulic conditions covered by the flume experiments with a wide range of scenarios. In the model, the surface water domain was represented by a CFD model which generates the head distribution. Subsurface flow and transport is simulated in 3D using MIN3P.\nThe flume experiments revealed that hyporheic exchange fluxes under losing and gaining flow conditions were similar, and became smaller in a comparable manner when the losing or gaining flux increases. Heterogeneity had little effect on hyporheic exchange under gaining flow conditions due to the compaction of the hyporheic zone. However, local hydraulic conductivity led to preferential flow paths of stream water under neutral conditions (strong horizontal flow component) and losing conditions (strong vertical flow component). Preferential flow paths were also evident under gaining conditions but affected mainly the upwelling groundwater.\nThe model was set up to resemble the conditions in the flume, and reproduced the flume data very well. The propagation of dye fronts as observed in the flume is currently implemented into the model. The combination of experimental and modeling results enable us to systematically study the coupling between flow conditions and flow patterns in a representative heterogeneous streambed. We are currently extending these findings to evaluate the implications of flow patterns in heterogeneous streambed for biogeochemical processes.",

However, accurate measurements of their gravitational fields provide information on their bulk compositions and their depth dependence. In particular, interior models are used to determine Jupiter and Saturn's core masses and heavy element enrichment. The inferred compositions depend not only on the equations of state of hydrogen and helium but also on some structure model assumptions such as the heat transport mechanism, number of layers, rotation profile, etc. New measurements of the physical and chemical properties of Jupiter and Saturn are expected from the Juno and Cassini Proximal missions, and we therefore expect great improvement in our understanding of the internal structures of these planets and for this reason it is crucial to identify the model uncertainties. Once the internal structures of the planets are determined they can be linked to formation and evolution theories. I will present recent developments in interior modeling, discuss the relation between the primordial internal structure of giant planets and their formation mechanism, and show how formation and evolution can be linked to the present time internal structure. Since Jupiter and Saturn are often used as calibrators for giant exoplanets, a more complete understanding of Jupiter and Saturn provides great leverage for modeling gas giant planets around other stars.",

Underestimation of the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) MWR has been mitigated by an orographic/nonorographic rainfall classification scheme (Shige et al. 2013, 2015; Taniguchi et al. 2013; Yamamoto and Shige 2015). The orographic/nonorographic rainfall classification scheme is developed on the basis of orographically forced upward vertical motion and the convergence of surface moisture flux estimated from ancillary data. Lookup tables derived from orographic precipitation profiles are used to estimate rainfall for an orographic rainfall pixel, whereas those derived from original precipitation profiles are used to estimate rainfall for a nonorographic rainfall pixel.\nThe orographic/nonorographic rainfall classification scheme has been used by the version of GSMaP products, which are available in near real time (about 4 h after observation) via the Internet (http://sharaku.eorc.jaxa.jp/GSMaP/index.htm). The current version of GSMaP MWR algorithm with the orographic/nonorographic rainfall classification scheme improves rainfall estimation over the entire tropical region, but there is still room for improvement.

Velocities were measured in a 10cm grid spacing using Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry and fish locations were observed using underwater videogrammetry.\nResults indicate that scale of observation matters. As predicted, the mean and variance of velocity decreases with coarsening resolution of the flow field observations, illustrating how observed velocities are compressed into a narrower and lower range at coarser scales relative to finer scales. This trend of compressed variability also occurs for the locations where fish were observed, indicating that coarser-resolution observations underestimate the magnitude and range of velocities that fish select. Regarding energy expenditure, in comparing estimates direct and indirect estimates, we find that energy expenditure from the indirect estimates is always lower than the direct estimates, though the degree depend on the scale of velocity measurements. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that coarser resolution observations underestimate the amount of energy that fish expend in resting and foraging, but also indicate that velocity-based measurements generally underestimate energy expenditure by fish. Spatial and temporal variability of velocities do not fully explain the discrepancies between direct and indirect estimates in energy expenditure. Results lay groundwork for important advancements on the theory and application of fluid mechanics, large wood, and fish bioenergetics and habitat selection.",

Typically, structure models assume that Jupiter is fully convective with the heavy elements being uniformly distributed. However, in the case of layered-convection there is a gradient in the distribution of heavy elements which affects the temperature profile of the planet, and as a result also its derived composition. We simulate the formation of Jupiter and investigate whether mean molecular weight gradients that can lead to layered-convection are created. We show that planetesimal accretion naturally leads to compositional gradients in the region above the core. It is shown that after about 10^5 years the core of Jupiter is hot and is surrounded by layers that consist mostly heavy-elements but also some hydrogen and helium. As a result, Jupiter’s core mass is expected to be 2-5 M_Earth with no sharp transition between the core and the envelope. These findings are important for the interpretation of Juno data and for linking giant planet internal structure with origins.",

A saturated heterogeneous medium contaminated by nitrobenzene was selected as case study. A new kind of surrogate-based SEAR optimization employing an ensemble surrogate (ES) model together with a genetic algorithm (GA) is presented. Four methods, namely radial basis function artificial neural network (RBFANN), kriging (KRG), support vector regression (SVR), and kernel extreme learning machines (KELM), were used to create four individual surrogate models, which were then compared. The comparison enabled us to select the two most accurate models (KELM and KRG) to establish an ES model of the SEAR simulation model, and the developed ES model as well as these four stand-alone surrogate models was compared. The results showed that the average relative error of the average nitrobenzene removal rates between the ES model and the simulation model for 20 test samples was 0.8%, which is a high approximation accuracy, and which indicates that the ES model provides more accurate predictions than the stand-alone surrogate models. Then, a nonlinear optimization model was formulated for the minimum cost, and the developed ES model was embedded into this optimization model as a constrained condition. Besides, GA was used to solve the optimization model to provide the optimal SEAR strategy. The developed ensemble surrogate-optimization approach was effective in seeking a cost-effective SEAR strategy for heterogeneous DNAPL-contaminated sites. This research is expected to enrich and develop the theoretical and technical implications for the analysis of remediation strategy optimization of DNAPL-contaminated aquifers.",

Using animal waste to produce green energy would allow low cost energy sources and give independence from fossil fuels. But which animal produces the most methane and how hard is it to harvest? Before starting this experiment I knew that some cow farms in the northern part of the Central California basin were using some of the methane from the waste to power their machinery as a safer, cheaper and greener source through the harnessed methane gas in a digester. The fermentation process would occur in the digester producing methane gasses as a side product. Methane that is collected can later be burned for energy. I have done a lot of research on this experiment and found that many different farm and ranch animals produce methane, but it was unclear which produced the most. I decided to focus my study on the waste from cows, horses, pig and dogs to try to find the most efficient and strongest source of methane from animal waste. I produced an affordable methane digester from plastic containers with a valve to attach a hose. By putting in the waste product and letting it ferment with water, I was able to produce and capture methane, then measure the amount with a Gaslab meter. By showing that it is possible to create energy with this simple digester, it could reduce pollution and make green energy easily available to communities all over the world. Eventually this could result into our sewer systems converting waste to energy, producing an energy source right in your home.",

This simple model can reproduce most injection signatures at multiple locations simultaneously, reaffirming earlier findings that an earthward-traveling DFB can both transport and accelerate electrons to suprathermal energies, and can thus be considered as the primary driver of short-lived (~<10 min) injections. We find that energetic electron drift paths are greatly influenced by the sharp magnetic field gradients around the localized DFB. If the gradients are weak the energetic electrons initiating at reconnection will drift out of the flow channel such that the observed injection is comprised mostly of plasma sheet electrons. However, if the duskward magnetic field gradients on the DFB’s dawn flank are strong they can cause electrons to drift further earthward from the reconnection site than due to E x B alone. Similarly, strong dawnward magnetic field gradients on the DFB’s dusk flank can extract energetic electrons from the inner magnetosphere out to the plasma sheet, where they can either be recirculated earthward or remain at higher L-shells. Therefore, the source of electrons observed during injection depends sensitively on the spacecraft location relative to the DFB and on the DFB’s properties.",

            "abstract": "In recent years a number of approaches have been developed to provide alternatives to the use of plant functional types (PFTs) with constant vegetation characteristics for simulating vegetation responses to climate changes. In this presentation, an overview of those approaches and their challenges is given. Some new approaches aim at removing PFTs altogether by determining the combination of vegetation characteristics that would fit local conditions best. Others describe the variation in traits within PFTs as a function of environmental drivers, based on community assembly principles. In the first approach, after an equilibrium has been established, vegetation composition and its functional attributes can change by allowing the emergence of a new type that is more fit. In the latter case, changes in vegetation attributes in space and time as assumed to be the result intraspecific variation, genetic adaptation and species turnover, without quantifying their respective importance. Hence, it is assumed that -by whatever mechanism- the community as a whole responds without major time lags to changes in environmental drivers. Recently, we showed that intraspecific variation is highly species- and trait-specific and that none of the current hypotheses on drivers of this variation seems to hold. Also genetic adaptation varies considerably among species and it is uncertain whether it will be fast enough to cope with climate change. Species turnover within a community is especially fast in herbaceous communities, but much slower in forest communities. Hence, it seems that assumptions made may not hold for forested ecosystems, but solutions to deal with this do not yet exist. Even despite the fact that responsiveness of vegetation to environmental change may be overestimated, we showed that -upon implementation of trait-environment relationships- major changes in global vegetation distribution are projected, to similar extents as to those without such responsiveness.

            "abstract": "Drilling in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) fore-arc during IODP Expedition 352 and DSDP Leg 60 recovered consistent stratigraphic sequences of volcanic rocks reminiscent of those found in many ophiolites. The oldest lavas in these sections are “fore-arc basalts” (FAB) with ~51.5 Ma ages. Boninites began eruption approximately 2-3 m.y. later (Ishizuka et al., 2011, EPSL; Reagan et al., 2013, EPSL) and further from the trench. First results from IODP Expedition 352 and preliminary post-cruise data suggest that FAB at Sites U1440 and U1441 were generated by decompression melting during near-trench sea-floor spreading, and that fluids from the subducting slab were not involved in their genesis. Temperatures appear to have been unusually high and pressures of melting appear to have been unusually low compared to mid-ocean ridges. Spreading rates at this time appear to have been robust enough to maintain a stable melt lens. Incompatible trace element abundances are low in FAB compared to even depleted MORB. Nd and Hf Isotopic compositions published before the expedition suggest that FAB were derived from typical MORB source mantle. Thus, their extreme deletion resulted from unusually high degrees of melting immediately after subduction initiation. The oldest boninites from DSDP Site 458 and IODP Sites U1439 and U1442 have relatively high concentrations of fluid-soluble elements, low concentrations of REE, and light depleted REE patterns. Younger boninites, have even lower REE concentrations, but have U-shaped REE patterns. Our first major and trace element compositions for the FAB through boninite sequence suggests that melting pressures and temperatures decreased through time, mantle became more depleted though time, and spreading rates waned during boninite genesis. Subduction zone fluids involved in boninite genesis appear to have been derived from progressively higher temperatures and pressures over time as the subducting slab thermally matured.",

            "abstract": "Most global vegetation models used to evaluate climate change impacts rely on plant functional types to describe vegetation responses to environmental stresses. In a traditional set-up in which vegetation characteristics are considered constant within a vegetation type, the possibility to implement and infer feedback mechanisms are limited as feedback mechanisms will likely involve a changing expression of community trait values. Based on community assembly concepts, we implemented functional trait-environment relationships into a global dynamic vegetation model to quantitatively assess this feature. For the current climate, a different global vegetation distribution was calculated with and without the inclusion of trait variation, emphasizing the importance of feedbacks –in interaction with competitive processes- for the prevailing global patterns. These trait-environmental responses do, however, not necessarily imply adaptive responses of vegetation to changing conditions and may locally lead to a faster turnover in vegetation upon climate change. Indeed, when running climate projections, simulations with trait variation did not yield a more stable or resilient vegetation than those without. Through the different feedback expressions, global and regional carbon and water fluxes were -however- strongly altered. At a global scale, model projections suggest an increased productivity and hence an increased carbon sink in the next decades to come, when including trait variation. However, by the end of the century, a reduced carbon sink is projected. This effect is due to a downregulation of photosynthesis rates, particularly in the tropical regions, even when accounting for CO2-fertilization effects. Altogether, the various global model simulations suggest the critical importance of including vegetation functional responses to changing environmental conditions to grasp terrestrial feedback mechanisms at global scales in the light of climate change.",

            "abstract": "In India, most of the human population lives in rural areas. People depends on agriculture products to meet the demand of food supply. In order to get higher yield of agriculture and food product, increased practice of fertilizer application has added extra burden of nutrients especially, the reactive nitrogen (Nr) species viz NH3 and NOx. Growing energy demands has resulted in increased emissions of NOx from coal combustion in thermal power plant and the petroleum combustion in transport sector. In addition, biomass burning in traditional cooking and heating has become significant source of NH3 and NOx in Indian region.\nSignificance of the study lies in the fact that increasing Nr emissions have adverse impact on human health, plant, soil and water bodies directly and to see the effect, knowledge of emission and deposition for Nr at different sites. Hence, the selection of the sites for present study was done very carefully. Delhi city and Mai village were selected to represent typical characteristics of high and low socioeconomic region respectively. Delhi is the capital of India, known for higher income group urban cluster where rural site having agricultural dominance has its importance in Indian scenario because still in India our primary source of income is agriculture.\nAtmospheric abundance of two major gaseous inorganic (Nr) species i.e NH3 and NO2 has been measured for one year, on monthly basis. Average concentrations of NH3 at urban and rural site have been recorded as 40.4 ±16.8 and 51.57 ±22.8 µg/m3 respectively. The average concentrations of NO2 have been recorded as 24.4 ±13.5 and 18.8 ± 12.6 µg/m3 at urban & rural site respectively. Study, also presents seasonal and diurnal variations of gaseous reactive nitrogen species at urban & rural sites to observe the contribution of different the sources of atmospheric Nr. Dynamics of Nr at both sites will be discussed in details at the conference.",

            "abstract": "Small changes in atmospheric conditions lead to major changes in the types or amount of near-0°C precipitation. For example, if near-surface temperatures are slightly above (below) 0°C, rain or wet snow (snow) occurs; if a slightly above-freezing inversion occurs (or not) aloft, freezing rain (snow) can reach the surface. It also needs to be recognized that solid precipitation amounts near 0°C (such as wet snow) can be the highest in a winter storm. With global climate change in the extratropics, the 0°C isotherm will not disappear and associated precipitation events will continue to occur. The near-0°C temperatures should generally move poleward and arrive at many locations earlier in spring or later in autumn. This could potentially affect the seasonal cycle of near-0°C precipitation. Alterations in temperatures, storm intensity and track will alter the likelihood and occurrence of near-0°C precipitation including freezing rain. Weakening of the atmospheric circulation in the extratropical regions may lead to more polar jet stream meandering that can lead to more persistent near 0°C events. The overall warming, together with a larger influx of the water vapor in the winter atmosphere from the oceans (including ice-free portions of the Arctic Ocean) can also affect the amount of near-0°C precipitation. The overall issue of near 0°C precipitation is linked with several hazardous phenomena including heavy snowfall/rainfall transition around °C; strong blizzards; rain-on-snow events causing floods; freezing rain and freezing drizzle; and ice load on infrastructure. In our presentation, we present the empirical evidence about changes in occurrence and intensity of these phenomena over Northern Eurasia.",

In this study, we investigate the impact of SST between high/low resolution on atmospheric response in East Asia. We run the two experiments with prescribing different SSTs which have high or low resolution in East Asian region using a WRF model. The result with low-resolution SST run simulates lower SST in most regions near the land than the high-resolution SST run because the SST with high resolution has a characteristic with more transportation of heat energy from the Kuroshio current. The SST difference makes the difference of temperature gradient between land and sea, and then it influence to the other atmospheric components, such as surface pressure, wind pattern, and ascending motion. It is found that the relatively stronger northerly wind in Yellow sea in the high-resolution SST run. And its surface pressure simulates larger value in land than seas around Korea peninsula. It is also found that the different resolution of SST in the WRF model results in different amount of land precipitation. For a reliable interpretation on atmospheric variability in response to SST forcing, it is necessary to prescribe the higher resolution SST in the atmosphere model.",

Food prices have become consistently higher and increasingly volatile with dramatic spikes in 2007-08 and 2010-11. The confluence of these factors has heightened demand for land and brought a wave of land investment to the developing world: some of the more affluent countries are trying to secure land rights in areas suitable for agriculture. According to some estimates, to date, roughly 38 million hectares have been acquired worldwide by large scale investors, 16 million of which in Africa. More than 85% of large scale land acquisitions in Africa are by foreign investors. Many land deals are motivated not only by the need for fertile land but for the water resources required for crop production. Despite some recent assessments of the water appropriation associated with large scale land investments, their impact on the water resources of the target countries under present conditions and climate change scenarios remains poorly understood. Here we investigate irrigation water requirements by various crops planted in the acquired land as an indicator of the pressure likely placed by land investors on (“blue”) water resources of target regions in Africa and evaluate the sensitivity to climate changes scenarios.",

Furthermore, the modeling of seismic waves in fractured porous media finds application not only in geophysical exploration but also reservoir management. Fractures exhibit high-aspect-ratio geometries, i.e. they constitute thin and long hydraulic conduits. Motivated by this peculiar geometry, the investigation of the hydro-mechanically coupled processes is performed by means of a hybrid-dimensional modeling approach. The effective material behavior of domains including complex fracture patterns in a porous rock is assessed by investigating the fluid pressure and the solid displacement of the skeleton saturated by compressible fluids. Classical balance equations are combined with a Poiseuille-type flow in the dimensionally reduced fracture. In the porous surrounding rock, the classical Biot-theory is applied. For simple geometries, our findings show that two main fluid-flow processes occur, leak-off from fractures to the surrounding rock and fracture flow within and between the connected fractures. The separation of critical frequencies of the two flow processes is not straightforward, in particular for systems containing a large number of fractures. Our aim is to model three dimensional hydro-mechanically coupled processes within complex fracture patterns and in particular determine the frequency-dependent attenuation characteristics. Furthermore, the effect of asperities of the fracture surfaces on the fracture stiffness and on the hydraulic conductivity will be added to the approach.",

            "abstract": "The timing and regional distribution of surface properties of Antarctic sea ice is crucial for the atmosphere-ocean interaction and characterizes the mass and energy budgets of sea ice. Therefore, it is important to map and analyze changes and trends of the related processes and parameters. Since Antarctic sea ice is covered with snow during most of the year, inter-annual and regional variations in summer surface melt can be described through the timing of snowmelt onset. So far, the melt onset was described through the amplitude of diurnal freeze-thaw cycles detected by microwave brightness temperatures using a fixed threshold. However, other studies reveal that the strength of the diurnal variations is differing between the perennial snowpack characterized by strong snow metamorphism and the thinner and less complex seasonal snow cover.\nTherefore, we present two complementary approaches to improve the existing melt onset algorithms: (1) We consider regional differences of the diurnal variations in the brightness temperature. (2) We combine brightness temperature measured at different polarizations and frequencies in order to describe also subsurface melt processes. Our analysis includes a comparison with autonomous measurements from snow buoys and previous studies on snow melt onset detection of Antarctic sea ice.\nIn doing so, we derive a distinct latitudinal dependence of the surface and subsurface snow melt onset. The major part of the East-Antarctic sea ice is dominated by lateral and bottom melt with negligible diurnal surface variations. Although a positive trend in sea-ice extent and concentration of Antarctic sea ice is observed, our melt onset time series do not indicate a significant trend from 1988/89 to 2014/15. Instead its inter-annual variability is not changing over time. From the assumed dynamically induced sea-ice growth in the Southern Ocean we expect an increasing importance of surface freeze-thaw cycles.",

Taking Zhenjiang City, Fujian Province as example, based on CMA Best Track Dataset of the Northwest Pacific, 131 historical typhoons that affected Zhenjiang City are extracted, and the corresponding windfield, precipitation field, storm surge tide and wave height are reconstructed. By building regional characterized hazard indicators for the above four hazards, the relationship between historical typhoon losses and the indicators are explored. The development of the integrated typhoon hazard scale model for coastal regions can be helpful to local disaster mitigation departments to more accurately assess the risk of typhoon disasters and ensure the rational use of relief supplies.",

            "abstract": "The Vatnajökull region of central-east Iceland lies above the head of the Iceland mantle plume where the crust is thickest due to enhanced melt supply. As a result the region contains a high density of volcanic rift systems, with six large subglacial central volcanoes. Due to the ice cover, the geological structure of the area and the location of past eruptions are poorly known. Imaging of the crustal velocity heterogeneities beneath the ice sheet aims to reveal much in terms of the structure of these volcanic plumbing systems. Mapping of significant velocity changes through time may also be indicative of movement of melt around the central volcanoes; one of which (Bárðarbunga) experienced a major rifting event in August 2014 (Sigmundsson et al. Nature 2015, Green et al. Nature Geosci. 2015).\nWe present results from tomographic imaging of the volcanic systems in the region, using continuous data from a local broadband seismic network in central-east Iceland which provides excellent ray path coverage of the volcanic systems. This is supplemented by data from the HOTSPOT and ICEMELT experiments and the permanent monitoring stations of the Icelandic Meteorological Office. We process the continuous data following Benson et al. 2007 and automatic frequency-time analysis (FTAN) routines are used to extract more than 9000 dispersion measurements. We then generate Rayleigh wave group velocity maps which we present here. We find low velocity regions beneath the Vatnajökull icecap which are bounded by the surface expression of the volcanic rift systems. The lower velocities also extend north-west to the volcanic system under the Hofsjökull ice cap, and northwards towards Askja and the volcanic systems of the northern volcanic zone. We also produce locations and focal mechanisms of earthquakes caused by magmatic and hydrothermal activity to correlate structure with the activity of the volcanic systems.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally applied to rural environments, the concept of ES is gaining traction in urban areas, overlapping with a number of existing management frameworks in engineering, policy science, political ecology, or urban planning. Given this overlap, it is legitimate to question the value added by the ES concept, either as a theoretical or practical framework. This is particularly the case for urban water management, where new paradigms in engineering and socio-hydrology are increasingly bringing a social dimension to problem solving.\nIn this talk, I will illustrate key opportunities and limitations of the ES framework with a focus on the service of stormwater retention. Drawing from examples in the Global North and South (including Melbourne, Australia, and Cape Town, South Africa), I will show that the ES lens allows: i) an explicit linkage between beneficiaries and grey and green infrastructure, which improves visibility and credibility of techniques valuing urban nature; ii) an improved understanding of tradeoffs and synergies between services, even in regions with limited environmental or socio-economic data; and iii) the development of powerful visualization techniques, enhancing communication with a broad range of stakeholders.\nThese strengths make ES assessments a powerful tool to raise awareness or assist urban planners in realizing their vision of green cities. However, in cities like Melbourne with high capacity and innovative governance, I will argue that the instrumental use of ES is limited and may even be detrimental; limitations of the ES framework, which include a perceived partiality and vagueness, may be used by detractors to undermine the work of urban planners envisioning a greener city.\nTo conclude the talk, I will present the work that the Natural Capital Project is conducting on the application of the ES concept for global indicators of sustainable development, thereby supporting the monitoring and implementation of urban Sustainable Development Goals.",

With the growing abundance of data being collected and created by industry (i.e. outage data), government agencies (i.e. land cover), and academia (i.e. weather forecasts), we can begin to tackle problems that previously seemed too complex to solve. In this session, we will present newly developed tools to aid decision-support challenges at electric distribution utilities that must mitigate, prepare for, respond to and recover from severe weather. We will show a performance evaluation of outage predictive models built for Eversource Energy (formerly Connecticut Light & Power) for storms of all types (i.e. blizzards, thunderstorms and hurricanes) and magnitudes (from 20 to >15,000 outages). High resolution weather simulations (simulated with the Weather and Research Forecast Model) were joined with utility outage data to calibrate four types of models: a decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), boosted gradient tree (BT) and an ensemble (ENS) decision tree regression that combined predictions from DT, RF and BT. The study shows that the ENS model forced with weather, infrastructure and land cover data was superior to the other models we evaluated, especially in terms of predicting the spatial distribution of outages. This research has the potential to be used for other critical infrastructure systems (such as telecommunications, drinking water and gas distribution networks), and can be readily expanded to the entire New England region to facilitate better planning and coordination among decision-makers when severe weather strikes.",

            "abstract": "Explosive volcanic eruptions may release vast quantities of ash. Because of its size, it has the greatest dispersal potential and can be distributed globally. Ash may pose severe risks for 1) air traffic, 2) human and animal health, 3) agriculture and 4) infrastructure. Such ash particles can however cluster and form ash aggregates that range in size from millimeters to centimeters. During their growth, weight and aerodynamic properties change. This leads to significantly changed transport and settling behavior. The physico-chemical processes involved in aggregation are quantitatively poorly constrained. We have performed laboratory ash aggregation experiments using the ProCell Lab System® of Glatt Ingenieurtechnik GmbH. Solid particles are set into motion in a fluidized bed over a range of well-controlled boundary conditions (e.g., air flow rate, gas temperature, humidity, liquid composition). In this manner we simulate the variable gas-particle flow conditions expected in eruption plumes and pyroclastic density currents. We have used 1) soda-lime glass beads as an analogue material and 2) natural volcanic ash from Laacher See Volcano (Germany). In order to influence form, size, stability and the production rate of aggregates, a range of experimental conditions (e.g., particle concentration, degree of turbulence, temperature and moisture in the process chamber and the composition of the liquid phase) have been employed. We have successfully reproduced several features of natural ash aggregates, including round, internally structured ash pellets up to 3 mm in diameter. These experimental results help to constrain the boundary conditions required for the generation of spherical, internally-structured ash aggregates that survive deposition and are preserved in the volcanological record. These results should also serve as input parameters for models of ash transport and ash mass distribution.",

            "abstract": "Himalayan glaciers are experiencing retreat due to changes in the temperature and precipitation pattern. Retreating glaciers depending upon the underlying bed topography can cause lake formation near terminus. Therefore formation and draining of lakes in the glaciated terrain of Himalaya is commonly observed. However, few lakes became stable under suitable geomorphologic conditions and grow sufficiently large to threaten population and infrastructure in downstream. In this investigation changes in glacial lakes in Tista basin were studied using satellite images for a period between 1989 and 2010. The Tista basin in Sikkim covers approximately 7096 sq km area and the total glaciated area is 501± 29 sq km. During the period of investigation the lake area is increased from 6.6 ± 0.8 km2 to 9.6 ± 1.1 km2 due to formation of new lakes and also due to expansion of existing lake. Out of 23 lakes, 16 showed variable increase in area. We have also observed formation of stable proglacial lake due to coalescence of small supra glacial lakes on Changsang and South Lhonak Glacier. The size of lake near South Lhonak Glacier was increased from 18 to 126 ha from 1978 to 2014 (Figure). Therefore detail field investigations were carried out to understand volume and extent of ice in end moraine. The water volume was estimated as 53 million m3 using bathymetric survey and ice at the core of terminal moraines was mapped using resistivity survey. These investigations suggests a possibility of catastrophic outburst flood, if moraine dam breached under extreme weather conditions. Therefore, mitigation strategy is needed to improve safety of people living in the region. In addition, numerous remote sensing based investigations have mapped more than 300 lakes in the glaciated terrain in India, therefore, a national program to monitor glacier lakes and strategy to mitigate possible disaster is needed.\nFigure: Expansion of the lake near South Lhonak glacier from year 1990 to 2014.",

            "abstract": "Titan’s deep crust is thought to be made of water ice in its solid form or as clathrate hydrates. However, its actual expression on the surface has proven ambiguous. Only regions possibly enriched in water ice have been identified by the Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) on board Cassini. Overall, the surface of Titan seems to be covered by a sedimentary layer of solid organics, likely originating from methane photolysis in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, the thickness of this layer may vary across Titan and the best chance for detecting water ice is in the microwave region where greater depths into the surface are probed. Considering both the active and passive data collected by the RADAR on board Cassini, we will show that the presence of water ice in the near subsurface is strongly indicated by the high degree of volume scattering observed in radar-bright/low-emissive regions (mountain-like terrains) comprising ~ 10% of Titan’s surface. The rims of several craters also demonstrate unique characteristics in the microwave that suggest the presence of water ice. The impacts that caused these features can be expected to expose material from the deep subsurface, certainly bringing large quantities of ice to the surface. We will discuss the implications of these findings.",

            "abstract": "In this work, using the fully coupled NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM1.0.4), we investigate the relative importance of CO2-fertilization, climate warming, anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, and land use and land cover change (LULCC) for terrestrial carbon uptake during the historical period (1850-2005). In our simulations, between the beginning and end of this period, we find an increase in global net primary productivity (NPP) on land of about 4 PgCyr-1 (8.1%) with a contribution of 2.3 PgCyr-1 from CO2-fertilization and 2.0 PgCyr-1 from nitrogen deposition. Climate warming also causes NPP to increase by 0.35 PgCyr-1 but LULCC causes a decline of 0.7 PgCyr-1. These results indicate that the recent increase in vegetation productivity is most likely driven by CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition. Further, we find that this configuration of CESM projects that the global terrestrial ecosystem has been a net source of carbon during 1850-2005 (release of 45.1±2.4 PgC), largely driven by historical LULCC related CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere. During the recent three decades (early 1970s to early 2000s), however, our model simulations project that the terrestrial ecosystem acts as a sink, taking up about 10 PgC mainly due to CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with recent studies that indicate an increase in vegetation production and water use efficiency in the satellite era and that the terrestrial ecosystem has been a net sink for carbon in recent decades.",

            "abstract": "Ice streams are corridors of fast flowing ice within an ice sheet. In some cases, their position is not constrained by bed topography, which suggests that patterning in the ice sheet velocity field can emerge spontaneously, in the form of a fingering instability. Previous research in this area has shown that subglacial hydrology and a feedback between strain heating, viscosity and flow rate can provide a recipe for the instability. Here, we pursue a slightly different angle and investigate whether an instability in the position of the cold-temperate transition at the bed can generate ice streams. Observations suggest that the marked contrast in velocity between ice streams and surrounding ice is due to a transition from cold, sticky bed underneath slow flowing regions, to temperate, well lubricated bed under ice streams. We treat this transition as a free boundary, whose position is constrained by basal thermal conditions. As in other models of ice stream formation, a positive feedback results from the fact that faster flowing ice dissipates more heat and therefore favours the formation of basal conditions that permit sliding. To understand how this positive feedback interacts with the evolution of the cold-temperate bed transition location, we develop a boundary layer model for dissipation and heat transport around the transition, which allows the transition migration rate to be computed. This enables us to include the contact line dynamics in a shallow ice model and to investigate the onset of streaming. Our results show that the background thermal structure of the ice sheet is key to the formation of ice streams: when the interior of the ice sheet is cold-based and the edges are warm-based, our model predicts the formation of regularly spaced though somewhat unrealistically wide ice streams. The reverse case of a warm interior and a cold edge results in an instability at wavelengths comparable to ice thickness, which is not resolved in most continental-scale ice sheet models.",

            "abstract": "At 45 stations worldwide, we estimate the atmospheric solar absorption through combining ground-based measurements of surface solar radiation (SSR) with collocated satellite-derived surface albedo and top-of-atmosphere net irradiance under both, all-sky and clear-sky conditions. To derive continuous clear-sky SSR from Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) in-situ measurements of global and diffuse SSR, we make use of the Long and Ackerman (2000) algorithm that identifies clear-sky measurements and empirically fits diurnal clear-sky irradiance functions using the cosine of the solar zenith angle as the independent variable. The 11-year average (2000-2010) cloud radiative effect (all-sky minus clear-sky) on atmospheric absorption at these sites is overall positive at around +10 Wm⁻² using the ground-based data, and at 3 Wm⁻² in the CERES EBAF product. This discrepancy arises from a potential overestimate in clear-sky absorption by the satellite product, while the all-sky absorption agrees reasonably well. We estimate the multi-model mean cloud effect from 40 CMIP5 historical simulations at 3 Wm⁻², which is in agreement with the CERES EBAF estimates at the surface sites.\nUnder all-sky conditions, we found the atmospheric solar absorption, derived from CERES EBAF data, to be largely unaffected by variations in latitude (-60deg - 60deg N), remaining nearly constant at its regional mean of 23±2 %, relative to the respective top-of-atmosphere incident radiation. The zonal means follow the imprint of spatial variations in water vapor path, surface albedo, and aerosols. While the clear-sky atmospheric absorption is generally lower over the oceans as compared to the land, the positive effect of clouds is more pronounced. As the cloud radiative effect due to low-level clouds acts stronger in the extra-tropics than in equatorial regions, where predominantly high clouds prevail, the zonal mean distribution of atmospheric solar absorption appears smoother and more constant under all-sky than under clear-sky conditions.",

            "abstract": "The presence of a mantle plume beneath Iceland has long been hypothesised to explain its high volumes of crustal volcanism. Practical constraints in seismic tomography mean that thin slow velocity anomalies representative of a plume signature are difficult to image. However it is possible to infer the presence of temperature anomalies at depth from the effect they have on phase transitions in surrounding mantle material. Here, we use P to S seismic wave conversions at mantle discontinuities to search for the signal of a mantle plume beneath Iceland. We employ a large data set from a wide range of seismic stations across the North Atlantic region and a dense network in Iceland, including more than 100 University of Cambridge run stations. Data are used to create over 6000 receiver functions which are converted from time to depth including 3D corrections for variations in crustal thickness and upper mantle velocity heterogeneities. The global transition zone discontinuities at depths of 410 and 660km are thought to be caused by phase changes in the olivine component of mantle rocks. We find that both the 410 and 660 discontinuities are depressed under Iceland compared to normal depths in the surrounding region. The opposite signs of the Clapeyron slopes describing the olivine phase transitions predict anti-correlation of discontinuity topography, thus observations of correlated discontinuities are generally dismissed as an artefact due to under corrected upper mantle velocity variations. We suggest instead that the correlated topography we observe is caused by a garnet (as opposed to olivine) phase transition at 660 described by a positive Clapeyron slope, such that depression of the 660 is representative of a hot anomaly at depth. Observations of additional discontinuities in the upper mantle as well as observations of a deep ~1000km discontinuity also have the potential to shed light on the presence of a mantle plume at depth.",

The PROMICE data can be used directly as indicators of climate change - becoming more and more valuable as the monitoring period increases. Furthermore the programme contributes through observations to process-oriented studies to understand the mass loss as well as validation efforts to improve ice sheet models and future predictions.\nPROMICE is committed to maintain an accessible, safe and thoroughly documented database for storing and disseminating the data free of charge to the climate research community at www.promice.org.\nHere we present an update on observations and results from the 2014-2015 season.",

            "abstract": "The carbon isotope composition of pedogenic carbonates (δ13Ccarb) from paleosols has been extensively used as a proxy to estimate atmospheric pCO2 over the Phanerozoic. However, a number of other factors – including the concentration of plant-respired CO2 and the isotopic composition of both atmospheric and plant-respired carbon – influence the δ13C of pedogenic carbonates. For example, δ13Ccarb records from the mid-latitudes in central Asia and western North America show increasing trends in δ13Ccarb despite decreasing pCO2 during the late Cenozoic, which suggests that other factors play an important role in determining the isotopic composition of pedogenic carbonates. Instead, we suggest that these records are primarily recording changes in primary productivity rather than changes in atmospheric pCO2 and therefore propose a novel use of paleosol carbonate records to understand paleo-ecosystem dynamics.\nHere, we compile existing paleosol carbonate records, and present three new records from Wyoming, to estimate soil respiration and primary productivity in western North America during the Paleogene and early Neogene. We observe both an overall increase in δ13Ccarb after the early Eocene, and spatially heterogeneous δ13Ccarb values across western US basins. We combine this δ13Ccarb data with compilations of atmospheric pCO2 to estimate soil respiration and plant productivity. The long-term increase in δ13Ccarb indicates a decrease in plant productivity as conditions became more arid across much of the western US, congruent with both records of regional uplift and of global cooling. Furthermore, significant spatial heterogeneity in δ13Ccarb indicates that regional factors, such as the presence of paleolakes and/or local paleotopography may have provided a second-order control on local and regional productivity. Thus, our results provide a first-order estimate linking changes in primary productivity with regional tectonics and global climatic change.",

            "abstract": "New insights into the magma storage and evolution at oceanic island volcanoes are now being achieved using remotely sensed space geodetic techniques, namely satellite radar interferometry. Differential radar interferometry is a technique tracking, at high spatial resolution, changes in the travel-time (distance) from the satellites to the ground surface, having wide applications in Earth sciences. Volcanic activity usually is accompanied by surface ground deformation. In many instances, modelling of surface deformation has the great advantage to estimate the magma volume change, a particularly interesting parameter prior to eruptions. Jointly interpreted with petrology, degassing and seismicity, it helps to understand the crustal magmatic systems as a whole. Current (and near-future) radar satellite missions will reduce the revisit time over global sub-aerial volcanoes to a sub-weekly basis, which will increase the potential for its operational use. Time series and filtering processing techniques of such streaming data would allow to track subsurface magma migration with high precision, and frequently update over vast areas (volcanic arcs, large caldera systems, etc.). As an example for the future potential monitoring scenario, we analyze multiple satellite radar data over El Hierro Island (Canary Islands, Spain) to measure and model surface ground deformation. El Hierro has been active for more than 3 years (2011 to 2014). Initial phases of the unrest culminated in a submarine eruption (late 2011 - early 2012). However, after the submarine eruption ended, its magmatic system still active and affected by pseudo-regular energetic seismic swarms, accompanied by surface deformation without resumed eruptions. Such example is a great opportunity to understand the crustal magmatic systems in low magma supply-rate oceanic island volcanoes. This new approach to measure surface deformation processes is yielding an ever richer level of information from volcanology to engineering and meteorological monitoring problems.",

Seismic sources of this series have been studied in order to understand the physical process of magma migration. Different methodologies were used to obtain focal mechanisms of largest shocks. Firstly, we have estimated the joint fault plane solutions for 727 shocks using first motion P polarities to infer the stress pattern of the sequence and to determine the time evolution of principle axes orientation. Results show almost vertical T-axes during the first two months of the series and horizontal P-axes on N-S direction coinciding with the migration. Secondly, a point source MT inversion was performed with data of the largest 21 earthquakes of the series (M>3.5). Amplitude spectra was fitted at local distances (<20km). Reliability and stability of the results were evaluated with synthetic data. Results show a change in the focal mechanism pattern within the first days of October, varying from complex sources of higher non-double-couple components before that date to a simpler strike-slip mechanism with horizontal tension axes on E-W direction the week prior to the eruption onset. A detailed study was carried out for the 8 October 2011 earthquake (Mw=4.0). Focal mechanism was retrieved using a MT inversion at regional and local distances. Results indicate an important component of strike-slip fault and null isotropic component. The stress pattern obtained corresponds to horizontal compression in a NNW-SSE direction, parallel to the southern ridge of the island, and a quasi-horizontal extension in an EW direction. Finally, a simple source time function of 0.3s has been estimated for this shock using the Empirical Green function methodology.",

Data of Solar Irradiance (SI) is required by the investigations of the solar driving mechanism, including Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and Spectral Solar Irradiance (SSI). SI observations with short term accuracy and long term precision are essential to separate solar forcing from human-induced factors.\nTSI and SSI have been measured on Chinese FY-3 satellites, including FY-3A, FY-3B and FY-3C. FY-3A satellite launched in May, 2008 is the first satellite. FY-3B satellite launched in November, 2010 is the second satellite and FY-3C satellite launched in September, 2013 is the third satellite.\nSSI has been measured by SBUS (Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Sounder) in the ultraviolet spectrum in the FY-3 mission. When a solar diffuser plate is deployed to reflect the incoming sunlight, SI is measured at 12 discrete, 1.1 nm wide wavelength bands between 250 nm and 340 nm. The SSI measurements are performed using a double monochromator operated in a stepped wavelength scan mode. SBUS collects SSI weekly at 12 discrete wave-lengths near polar area. Moreover, SSI is measured by SBUS every month covering 160-400 nm continuous spectral region. SSI has been recorded in SBUS missions since the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 24. Approximately the same variation tendencies of SSI were detected by SBUS in specific spectrum compared with data from SOLSTICE/SORCE.\nTSI have been recorded by Total Solar Irradiance Monitors (TSIM) in FY-3 missions. The sun was measured by TSIM/FY-3A and TSIM/FY-3B in a scanning manner. TSI data quality is improved by TSIM/FY-3C which has a pointing system. TSIM/FY-3C measures the sun with nearly zero solar pointing errors. TSI variations detected by TSIM/FY-3C are nearly the same with VIRGO/SOHO and TIM/SORCE. The TSIM experiments have observed the sun for about 7 years. A slowly increasing TSI trend has been detected by TSIMs in the Solar Cycle 24.\nWe present the instrument system overview and observation results of space experiments in this abstract.",

The main conclusions are as follows. All active volcanic areas (Solfatara, Vesuvius, Ischia Isle, Mt Etna, Aeolian Islands and Pantelleria Isle) have i) high 3He/4He rations coupled with ii) high CO2 emissions and iii) geo-thermometric (isotopic) signatures that suggest the presence of active geothermal systems in all places at shallow depth. In spite of this, no one of these areas, is exploited for geothermal power generation. There are three further Quaternary volcanic areas at: Iblei Mts in Sicily, Vulture volcano in Basilicata region and Logudoro area in Sardinia Island that also have CO2-rich gas emissions, high in 3He/4He ratio, but they are not associated to any relevant thermal emission nearby.\nIn terms of regional patterns, apart from the Calabria subduction arc area (Calabria region), the stable flat cratonic areas of Apulia in SE Italy, the Iblean Platform in SE Sicily, and most of Sardinia, the latter not involved in the Apennine Orogeny, the remaining southern Italy along the Tyrrhenian sector has huge emission of hydrothermally generated CO2 crossed, in counterflow, by descending topographically driven N2 solubilized in recharge meteoric water from the main Apennine belt.\nIso-distribution maps of several of the parameters investigated even more clearly show the sectors of southern Italy affected by the intrusion of mantle magma and therefore the areas where the geothermal heat-flow is maximized by active tectonics.",

Experiments have been carried out at the HF Heating facility at Tromsø with an effective radiated power of 450 – 650 MW at high heater frequencies of 6.2 – 8.0 MHz. Multi-instriment diagnostics included the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar at 931 MHz at Tromsø, the Finland CUTLASS (Co-operative UK Twin Located Auroral Sounding System) radar, the stimulated electromagnetic emission (SEE) equipment at Tromsø, and the HF receiver near St. Petersburg for the observations of narrow band SEE features. The key parameter considered is the ratio between the heater frequency and critical frequency of the F2 layer (fH/foF2). We have analyzed the behaviors of small-scale artificial field-aligned irregularities (FAIs) and HF-enhanced plasma and ion lines (HFPLs and HFILs) depending on the pump proximity to the critical frequency. It was shown that the HFPLs and HFILs coexisted with FAIs throughout the whole heater pulse when fH/foF2 > 1 as well as fH/foF2 ≤ 1. It is indicative that parametric decay instability was not quenched by fully developed FAIs. The comparison between contrasting O/X mode HF-induced phenomena, when the heater frequency is below or near the critical frequency of F2 layer, is made. It was found that an X-mode HF pumping is able to excite different narrow band spectral components in the SEE spectra (within 1 kHz of pump frequency), such as ion acoustic, electrostatic ion cyclotron, and electrostatic ion cyclotron harmonic waves (otherwise known as neutralized ion Bernstein waves) observed at a long distance from the HF Heating facility. It was suggested that these spectral component can be attributed to the stimulated Brillion scatter (SBS) process. The results obtained show that an X-polarized electromagnetic wave scattered by SBS can propagate more than one thousand km without significant attenuation.",

            "abstract": "Most recent assessments of long-term changes in the vertical distribution of ozone (by e.g. WMO and SI2N) rely on data sets that integrate observations by multiple instruments. Several merged satellite ozone profile records have been developed over the past few years; each considers a particular set of instruments and adopts a particular merging strategy. Their intercomparison by Tummon et al. revealed that the current merging schemes are not sufficiently refined to correct for all major differences between the limb/occultation records. This shortcoming introduces uncertainties that need to be known to obtain a sound interpretation of the different satellite-based trend studies. In practice however, producing realistic uncertainty estimates is an intricate task which depends on a sufficiently detailed understanding of the characteristics of each contributing data record and on the subsequent interplay and propagation of these through the merging scheme. Our presentation discusses these challenges in the context of limb/occultation ozone profile records, but they are equally relevant for other instruments and atmospheric measurements. We start by showing how the NDACC and GAW-affiliated ground-based networks of ozonesonde and lidar instruments allowed us to characterize fourteen limb/occultation ozone profile records, together providing a global view over the last three decades. Our prime focus will be on techniques to estimate long-term drift since our results suggest this is the main driver of the major trend differences between the merged data sets. The single-instrument drift estimates are then used for a tentative estimate of the systematic uncertainty in the profile trends from merged data records. We conclude by reflecting on possible further steps needed to improve the merging algorithms and to obtain a better characterization of the uncertainties involved.",

Data from this ensemble will be incorporated into an ensemble data assimilation (hybrid 4DVAR) scheme to drive a high resolution, 12km, deterministic regional reanalysis. Both the ensemble and the deterministic reanalysis will cover the satellite era (1978-2017), producing a wide range of atmospheric variables from the surface to 80km.\nThe UERRA project will be the first time that an ensemble scheme has been used for regional reanalysis. The ensemble will provide users with a valuable measure of uncertainty in regional reanalysis over Europe. It will also provide hybrid 4DVAR with \"errors of the day\" so that the deterministic assimilation can benefit from flow-dependent background error covariances. To ensure a high quality product, the product must be validated. Validation of reanalyses can be problematic since independent high quality measures of \"truth\" are usually not available. Techniques for validation of ensemble reanalyses will be discussed.\nWork already completed and plans for production will be outlined and the expected quality of the ensemble will be demonstrated, with reference to early results.",

            "abstract": " The spatial and spectral characteristics of the turbulent plasma density and electric fields are modeled in ionospheric E region using a new set of nonlinear plasma fluid equations. The fluid model combines both Farley-Buneman (Type-I) and Gradient-Drift (Type-II) plasma instabilities in the equatorial electrojet region. The unified model of the plasma instabilities includes the ion viscosity in the ion momentum equation and electron inertia in the electron momentum equation. Electron heating from the electrojet currents is included. Nonlinear simulations in 2D and 3D in massively parallel codes for the coupled equations are run on TACC and NERSC computers. Rising plumes and falling spikes of high-density plasma are ubiquitous as in earlier 2D simulations. 3D movies of structures like TIDs are shown. The simulation results show some agreement with a number of features of rocket and radar observations as reported in Hassan et al. JGR 2015.\nAt sunset, the strong electric fields driven both by neutral thermosphere winds and the dynamo electric field the turbulence are severe. The source field aligned currents [FACs] is the solar wind dynamo electric field. During periods of magnetospheric storms and substorms these plasma currents surge to large values producing ionospheric storms. The turbulent fluctuations in the ionosphere are intrinsic part of the dynamics of ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling. The plasma fluctuations are a source of multipath GNSS rays and loss-of-lock. Monitoring of ionosphere irregularities is used as a diagnostic tool for the state of the ionosphere for GNSS disruption and space weather issues. The theoretical/simulation model of ionospheric irregularities is based on advanced nonlinear plasma physics.",

The model domain is centred around JOYCE, an observational supersite in Jülich (Germany). To optimize the realism of the simulation, use is made of heterogeneous surface forcings and non-periodic boundary conditions. A number of prototype cumulus days is simulated, the results of which are evaluated against observations. The focus lies on bulk cloud properties and the vertical structure of the boundary layer.

            "abstract": "Grain size is a fundamental control on both the rheology and permeability of the mantle. These properties, in turn, affect the transport of melt beneath mid-ocean ridges. Previous models of grain size beneath ridges have considered only the single-phase problem of dynamic recrystallisation and the resultant pattern of grain-size variation [1,2]. These models have not coupled the spatially variable grain-size field to two-phase (partially molten) mechanics to investigate the implications of spatially variable grain size on melt transport. Here, we present new results from numerical models that investigate the consequences of this coupling. In our two-dimensional, two-phase model the grain-size is coupled to both the permeability and rheology. The rheology is strain-rate and grain-size dependent. For simplicity, however, the grain-size field is not computed dynamically — rather, it is imposed from a single-phase, steady-state model [1] that is based on the “wattmeter” theory [3]. Our calculations predicts that a spatially variable grain size field can promote focusing of melt towards the ridge axis. This focusing is distinct from the commonly discussed, sub-lithospheric decompaction channel [4]. Furthermore, our model predicts that the shape of the partially molten region is sensitive to rheological parameters associated with grain size. The comparison of this shape with observations [5] may help to constrain the rheology of the upper mantle beneath mid-ocean ridges. ",

The solar wind plasma interacts in a much more direct way with the neutral atmosphere and ionosphere systems of the two planets as compared with typical interactions around strongly magnetized obstacles. In spite of the differences in their size, atmospheric thickness, existence of localized crustal field, EUV strength and solar wind flow conditions, the perturbations that generated in the upstream plasma of Mars and Venus show remarkable similarities due to the common physical processes that dominate. Induced magnetospheres are formed around both planets due to mass loading of the shocked solar wind plasma. In this presentation, we will discuss the common features as well as major differences of the induced magnetospheres around the two planets from the modeling standpoint. We will also compare the response time of the two induced magnetospheres to typical variations in the solar wind at Mars and Venus based on time-dependent model results.",

            "abstract": "The City of Pittsburgh experiences numerous floods every year. Aging and insufficient infrastructure contribute to flash floods and to over 20 billion gallons of combined sewer overflows annually, contaminating Pittsburgh’s streets, basements, and waterways. Climate change is expected to further exacerbate this problem by causing more intense and more frequent extreme precipitation events in Western Pennsylvania. For a stormwater adaptation plan to be implemented effectively, the City will need informed public support. One way to achieve public understanding and support is through effective communication of the risks, benefits, and uncertainties of local flooding hazards and adaptation methods. In order to develop these communications effectively, the city and its partners will need to know what knowledge and attitudes the residents of Pittsburgh already hold about flood risks. Here we seek to (1) identify Pittsburgh residents’ knowledge level, risk perception and attitudes towards flooding and storm water management, and (2) pre-test communications meant to inform and empower Pittsburghers about flood risks and adaptation strategies. We conduct a city-wide survey of 10,000 Pittsburgh renters and homeowners from four life situations: high risk, above poverty; high-risk, below poverty; low risk, above poverty; and low-risk, below poverty. Mixed media recruitment strategies (online and paper-based solicitations guided/organized by community organizations) assist in reaching all subpopulations. Preliminary results suggest participants know what stormwater runoff is, but have a weak understanding of how stormwater interacts with natural and built systems. Furthermore, although participants have a good understanding of the difference between green and gray infrastructure, this does not translate into a change in their willingness to pay for green infrastructure adaptation. This suggests additional communications about flood risks and adaptation strategies.",

            "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed a terrible loss of life and economic disruption caused by large earthquakes and resultant tsunamis impacting coastal communities and infrastructure across the Indo-Pacific region. NASA has funded the early development of a prototype real-time Global Navigation Satellite System (RT-GNSS) based rapid earthquake and tsunami early warning (GNSS-TEW) system that may be used to enhance seismic tsunami early warning systems for large earthquakes. This prototype GNSS-TEW system geodetically estimates fault parameters (earthquake magnitude, location, strike, dip, and slip magnitude/direction on a gridded fault plane both along strike and at depth) and tsunami source parameters (seafloor displacement, tsunami energy scale, and 3D tsunami initials) within minutes after the mainshock based on dynamic numerical inversions/regressions of the real-time measured displacements within a spatially distributed real-time GNSS network(s) spanning the epicentral region. It is also possible to measure fluctuations in the ionosphere’s total electron content (TEC) in the RT-GNSS data caused by the pressure wave from the tsunami. This TEC approach can detect if a tsunami has been triggered by an earthquake, track its waves as they propagate through the oceanic basins, and provide upwards of 45 minutes early warning. These combined real-time geodetic approaches will very quickly address a number of important questions in the immediate minutes following a major earthquake: How big was the earthquake and what are its fault parameters? Could the earthquake have produced a tsunami and was a tsunami generated?",

            "abstract": "Many decades of studies of deposits and seascapes formed by turbidity currents have established a robust observational framework that demonstrates that depositional and morphological patterns are repeated through time and space. The process-modeling community has similarly made progress in the understanding of the distribution of suspended sediment, velocity, and turbulence in turbidity currents, together shaping the “flow structure”. Thus, now is the time to integrate, and investigate in more detail how the process of sediment erosion, transport, and deposition by turbidity currents is related to observed systematics in the physical products preserved in the geological record.\nHere we review recent breakthroughs in theoretical understanding of turbulent suspended sediment transport capacity. These breakthroughs allow us to understand the coupling between the flow field of turbidity currents, the kinematics of which have long been established, and the carrying capacity of sediment. This leads to robust first order estimators of the velocity and suspended sediment distribution within turbidity currents. These estimators can be applied straightforwardly to investigate natural systems. Two types of examples are explored: application to modern seafloor systems results in sediment budget estimations of natural turbidity current channels and canyons. Application to ancient turbidite deposits in the rock record displays how the present state of understanding can be used for quantitative process inversion from the product. This should ultimately lead to predictive capabilities of rock-body characteristics in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "Results from recent field trials suggest that natural gas could be produced from marine gas hydrate reservoirs at compatible yields and rates. It appears, from a current perspective, that gas production would essentially be based on depressurization and, when facing suitable conditions, be assisted by local thermal stimulation or gas hydrate conversion after injection of CO2-rich fluids. Both field trials, onshore in the Alaska permafrost and in the Nankai Trough offshore Japan, were accompanied by different technical issues, the most striking problems resulting from un-predicted geomechanical behaviour, sediment destabilization and catastrophic sand production. So far, there is a lack of experimental data which could help to understand relevant mechanisms and triggers for potential soil failure in gas hydrate production, to guide model development for simulation of soil behaviour in large-scale production, and to identify processes which drive or, further, mitigate sand production.\nWe use high-pressure flow-through systems in combination with different online and in situ monitoring tools (e.g. Raman microscopy, MRI) to simulate relevant gas hydrate production scenarios. Key components for soil mechanical studies are triaxial systems with ERT (Electric resistivity tomography) and high-resolution local strain analysis. Sand production control and management is studied in a novel hollow-cylinder-type triaxial setup with a miniaturized borehole which allows fluid and particle transport at different fluid injection and flow conditions. Further, the development of a large-scale high-pressure flow-through triaxial test system equipped with μ-CT is ongoing. We will present results from high-pressure flow-through experiments on gas production through depressurization and injection of CO2-rich fluids. Experimental data are used to develop and parametrize numerical models which can simulate coupled process dynamics during gas-hydrate formation and gas production.",

            "abstract": "During the cruise “Guaymas14” with RV El Puma (Oct. 14-25, 2014), 15 sediment cores were obtained from the Guaymas Basin Ridge flanks and the Sonora Margin, to contrast the shallow subsurface sediments of the seafloor set at this spreading center and its adjacent continental margin. Here we present biogeochemical profiles of porewater dissolved gases and stable ions, along with high-throughout 16S rRNA gene sequencing of selected samples.\nCores from the NW and SE ends of the Guaymas Basin ridge flanks were not sulfidic, and showed neither sulfate depletion nor methane accumulation. In contrast, samples of compression-impacted Sonora Margin on the NE edge of Guaymas Basin and from the upper Sonora Margin beneath the oxygen minimum zone showed an abundance of sulfide, DIC with sulfate depletion, and accumulation of biogenic methane (δ13C-CH4 ca. -85 to -88 ‰) at supersaturated concentrations below sulfate-replete sediment.\nSamples from an attenuated off-axis seep site on the NW flank of Guaymas Basin differed from both Sonora Margin and Guaymas Basin. The off-axis seep sediments contained 1 to 1.5 mM methane, with distinct δ13C -isotopic content (δ13C-CH4 near -60 ‰); intermediate to the biogenic methane of the Sonora Margin and the hydrothermally produced methane at Guaymas Basin. Unaltered sulfate and low sulfide concentrations indicate insufficiently reduced conditions, suggesting the methane was not produced in situ. Porewater DIC concentrations in the old seep site and the control site were similar to each other (3-5 mM), and lower than in the Sonora Margin sites (ca. 20-40 mM), indicating low bioremineralization in the old seep site and control sediments.\nDiverse seafloor habitats are expected to result in distinct microbiota that range from strictly anaerobic seep specialists and methane-cycling archaea in the Sonora Margin to diversified heterotrophic communities in the off-axis ridge flank sediments of Guaymas Basin; high-throughput sequencing should also address potential hydrothermal microbial signature in the attenuated off-axis seep site.",

We produced products for gross primary production, terrestrial ecosystem respiration, net ecosystem exchange, latent heat, sensible heat, and net radiation for two experimental protocols: 1) at a high spatial and 8-daily temporal resolution (5 arc-minute) using only remote sensing based inputs for the MODIS era; 2) 30 year records of daily, 0.5 degree spatial resolution by incorporating meteorological driver data. Within each set-up, all machine learning methods were trained with the same input data for carbon and energy fluxes respectively. Sets of input driver variables were derived using an extensive formal variable selection exercise. The performance of the extrapolation capacities of the approaches is assessed with a fully internally consistent cross-validation.\nWe perform cross-consistency checks of the gridded flux products with independent data streams from atmospheric inversions (NEE), sun-induced fluorescence (GPP), catchment water balances (LE, H), satellite products (Rn), and process-models. We analyze the uncertainties of the gridded flux products and for example provide a breakdown of the uncertainty of mean annual GPP originating from different machine learning methods, different climate input data sets, and different flux partitioning methods. The FLUXCOM archive will provide an unprecedented source of information for water, energy, and carbon cycle studies.",

            "abstract": "The origin of iron oxides in Archean and Paleoproterozoic Banded Iron Formations is still a matter of debate. We report here low and high temperature magnetic properties, susceptibility and saturation magnetization results coupled with scanning microscope, transmission electron microscopy, Raman observations and microprobe analyses along a 60 meters section, which encompasses the uppermost Archean Boolgeeda Iron Formation and its transition into the lower Paleoproterozoic Kungarra Formation in the Pilbara Craton, Western Australia. With the exception of two volcanoclastic intervals characterized by low susceptibility and magnetization, nearly pure magnetite is identified as the main magnetic carrier in all iron-rich layers including hematite-bearing jasper beds. The relative magnetic contribution of magnetite and hematite throughout the section is evidenced by IRM acquisition curves. We observed a sharp decrease in magnetization at the Archean-Proterozoic transition and a general trend in the Verwey temperature. Two populations of magnetically distinct magnetites are reported from a 2 meter-thick interval lying within the late Archean section of the core. Each population shows a specific Verwey transition temperature: one around 120-124K and the other in the range of 105-110K. The two Verwey transitions are interpreted to reflect two distinct stoichiometry and likely two stages of magnetite crystallization. The 120-124K transition is attributed to nearly pure stoichiometric magnetite, whereas SEM, TEM and microprobe observations suggest that the lower temperature transition is related to chemically impure silician magnetite. Microbial-induced partial substitution of iron by silicon is suggested here. This is supported by an increase in Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in the same interval and Raman spectroscopy data showing a close association of organic carbon with magnetite.",

            "abstract": "In recent years marine research has become increasingly multidisciplinary in its approach with a corresponding rise in the demand for large quantities of high quality interoperable data as a result. This requirement for easily discoverable and readily available marine data is currently being addressed by a number of regional initiatives with projects such as SeaDataNet in Europe, Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) in the USA and the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) in Australia, having implemented local infrastructures to facilitate the exchange of standardised marine datasets. However, each of these systems has been developed to address local requirements and created in isolation from those in other regions.\nMultidisciplinary marine research on a global scale necessitates a common framework for marine data management which is based on existing data systems. The Ocean Data Interoperability Platform project is seeking to address this requirement by bringing together selected regional marine e-infrastructures for the purposes of developing interoperability across them. By identifying the areas of commonality and incompatibility between these data infrastructures, and leveraging the development activities and expertise of these individual systems, three prototype interoperability solutions are being created which demonstrate the effective sharing of marine data and associated metadata across the participating regional data infrastructures as well as with other target international systems such as GEO, COPERNICUS etc.\nThese interoperability solutions combined with agreed best practice and approved standards, form the basis of a common global approach to marine data management which can be adopted by the wider marine research community. To encourage implementation of these interoperability solutions by other regional marine data infrastructures an impact assessment is being conducted to determine both the technical and financial implications of deploying them alongside existing services. The associated best practice and common standards are also being disseminated to the user community through relevant accreditation processes and related initiatives such as the Research Data Alliance and the Belmont Forum.",

Thus, its study entails a high meteorological interest, while its outcome can result in a crucial utility for the (re)insurance industry.\nIn addition to existing cyclone-based studies, here we use an event identification approach based on surface near wind speeds only, to investigate windstorm clustering and compare it to cyclone clustering. Specifically, cyclone and windstorm tracks are identified for winter 1979-2013 (Oct-Mar), to perform two sensitivity analyses on event-clustering in the North Atlantic using ERA-Interim Reanalysis. First, the link between clustering and cyclone intensity is analysed and compared to windstorms. Secondly, the sensitivity of clustering on intra-seasonal time scales is investigated, for both cyclones and windstorms.\nThe wind-based approach reveals additional regions of clustering over Western Europe, which could be related to extreme damages, showing the added value of investigating wind field derived tracks in addition to that of cyclone tracks.\nPrevious studies indicate a higher degree of clustering for stronger cyclones. However, our results show that this assumption is not always met. Although a positive relationship is confirmed for the clustering centre located over Iceland, clustering off the coast of the Iberian Peninsula behaves opposite. Even though this region shows the highest clustering, most of its signal is due to cyclones with intensities below the 70th percentile of the Laplacian of MSLP.\nResults on the sensitivity of clustering to the time of the winter season (Oct-Mar) show a temporal evolution of the clustering patterns, for both windstorms and cyclones. Compared to all cyclones, clustering of windstorms and strongest cyclones culminate around February, while all cyclone clustering peak in December to January.",

            "abstract": "Global mean surface warming has stalled since the end of the twentieth century, but the net radiation imbalance at the top of the atmosphere continues to suggest an increasingly warming planet. This apparent contradiction has been reconciled by an anomalous heat flux into the ocean, induced by a shift towards a La Niña-like state with cold sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific over the past decade or so. A significant portion of the heat missing from the atmosphere is therefore expected to be stored in the Pacific Ocean. However, in situ hydrographic records indicate that Pacific Ocean heat content has been decreasing. We analyze observations along with simulations from a global ocean–sea ice model to track the pathway of heat. We find that the enhanced heat uptake by the Pacific Ocean has been compensated by an increased heat transport from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean, carried by the Indonesian throughflow. As a result, Indian Ocean heat content has increased abruptly, which accounts for more than 70% of the global ocean heat gain in the upper 700 m during the past decade.",

            "abstract": "Flank-instabilities constitute a recurrent process in the long-term evolution of many volcanoes. A very large submarine landslide deposit (~2100 km2, ~300 km3) drilled southwest Martinique island during the IODP Exp. 340 in 2012 is likely associated with one (or more) major volcanic flank collapse of Mount Pelée during the Late Pleistocene. A recent study revealed that this D1/D2 deposit is emergent in its central part, frontally confined, and mainly comprises remobilized seafloor sediments rather than debris avalanche material from the volcanic edifice (Brunet et al., subm).\nHere, we investigate the sedimentary microstructures and timing of deformation from the central (Hole 1400B, ~37 km from the coastline) and distal (Hole 1399A, ~70 km from the coastline) units of the D1/D2 deposit, in order to better understand the emplacement dynamics of such potentially tsunamigenic submarine landslides. High resolution CT-Scan analyses were continuously performed on more than 300 m of sediment cores, in order to characterize and distinguish the internal architecture and the complex deformation features of the sediments at each drilling site. The establishment of the stratigraphy, based on δ18O measurements and AMS 14C dating, is still in progress and may confirm the possible link between the submarine landslide deposits and the flank collapse scars observed on the subaerial part of Martinique. These new insights into the timing and emplacement processes of this large submarine landslide will have important implications for tsunami hazards.\n",

They do not occur often. The maximum frequency of occurrence is only 4%. Heat wave flash drought is temperature driven. High temperatures increase the transpiration and drive down soil moisture and cause drought to occur.\nThe P deficit flash droughts are more common than the heat wave droughts and the maximum frequency of occurrence is about 8- 10 %. They are most likely to occur over the southern United States with a maximum over the Southern Plains. They are P driven. Heat waves are caused by P deficits. P deficits drive down SM and cause ET to decreases and temperature to increase.",

            "abstract": "Geothermal energy resources are considered important contributors to any future energy mix, as they are renewable and can potentially provide a constant (i.e., baseload) and long-term energy output. However, most regions worldwide are lacking natural, convective hydrothermal resources. As a result, when relatively high subsurface temperatures exist in low-permeability rocks (“hot-dry” rocks), it has been suggested to artificially increase permeability to enable deep fluid circulation and associated advective heat transfer to a production well. One technique to enhance permeability, and thus the ability to extract geothermal heat, is hydraulic stimulation, creating (permeability) enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). In the “Deep Underground Geothermal (DUG)“ laboratory in Switzerland, a meso-scale field experiment is planned, where pre-existing fault systems are hydraulically sheared. The aim of this experiment is to better understand the processes occurring during artificial reservoir creation.\nWe present our 3D numerical modeling study evaluating the capability of low-frequency crosswell electromagnetic (EM) tomography using magnetic dipole sources to map stimulation-induced changes in electrical conductivity. This geophysical parameter is affected by several subsurface properties including temperature, interconnected porosity, permeability, and the presence of fluids. Electrical conductivity thus provides important information on the effectiveness of geothermal reservoir creation. Besides numerical modeling studies, we report on the current status of instrumentation and realization of crosswell EM measurements at the DUG laboratory.\nFurthermore, we present preliminary results of a magnetotelluric (MT) survey conducted at a prominent heat flow anomaly in Northern Switzerland. Here, we test methods to improve data quality of MT measurements in regions that exhibit substantial electromagnetic noise. We also discuss how information on the electrical conductivity distribution may be used to constrain temperature fields at depth.",

            "abstract": "Identification of superparamagnetic (SP) particles in natural materials provides information on processes that lead to the new formation or dissolution of iron oxides. SP particles express themselves on first-order reversal curve (FORC) diagrams as a distribution centered near the origin of the diagram. Pike et al. (2001, GJI, 145, 721) demonstrated that thermal relaxation produces an upward shift in the FORC distribution, and attributed this to a pause encountered at each reversal field. In this study we examine the relationship between this upward shift and particles size on two sets of synthetic iron oxide nanoparticles. One set of coated magnetite particles have well-constrained particles size with 9, 16 and 20 nm as their diameter. A second set from the FeraSpin™ Series, consisting of FeraSpinXS, M and XL, were evaluated. Rock magnetic experiments indicate that the first set of samples is exclusively magnetite, whereas the FeraSpin samples contain predominantly magnetite with some degree of oxidation. Samples from both sets show that the upward shift of the FORC distribution at the origin increases with decreasing particle size. The amount of shift in the FeraSpin series is less when compared to the samples from the first set. This is attributed to the effect of interaction that counteracts the effect of thermal relaxation behavior of the SP particles. The FeraSpin series also shows a broader FORC distribution on the vertical axis that appears to be related to non-saturation of the hysteresis curve at maximum applied field. This non-saturation behavior can be due to spins of very fine particles or oxidation to hematite. AC susceptibility at low temperature indicates that particle interaction may affect the effective magnetic particle size. Our results suggest that the FORC distribution in pure SP particle systems provides information on the particle size distribution or oxidation, which can be further evaluated with low temperature techniques.",

            "abstract": "This work based on a pluridisciplinary approach coupling earth sciences and archaeology aims to study the recent tectonics along Iznik Lake, which follows the North Anatolian fault middle strand (NAFMS), south of the Marmara Sea in Turkey. Today this strand records a low seismicity and presents a lower slip rate (<5 mm/yr) than the northern strand . However, historical texts suggest a significant earthquake hazard over the last two millennia in this area. Data are needed to attest for the tectonic origin of the lake and the precise location of the faults. Long-term slip rates and stress accumulation on these faults zone are also unknown, which makes it difficult to estimate seismic hazard. The main goal of this work is to collect new data on the past activity of the NAFMS and to estimate slip rates at different time scales. For this, we observe geomorphic and archeological markers of past deformation.\nThe main fault zones were identified using a high resolution DEM (<2m) derived from Pleiades images, and confirmed on the field. These faults intersect and deform geomorphic features, such as terraces, paleoshorelines, alluvial fans.... Terraces deposited by Iznik Lake during high stands, which were tilted and crossed by several faults, were sampled for dating in order to constrain the normal and strike-slip Quaternary slip rate of the faults and their influence on the lake formation. The valley of Kirandere river east of Iznik presents many deflected and offset rivers and ridges, that will be used to constrain a Holocene strike-slip rate. To document the historical activity of the NAFMS around Iznik, we have identified ancient buildings that underwent successive damages and repairs and characterized them through an archeoseismological approach. We particularly studied the roman aqueduct of Iznik which is cut and deformed by a small fault.",

            "abstract": "Long-standing citizen science projects such as Audubon’s Christmas Bird Count have generated useful data about species range and population numbers for more than 100 years. Recent IPCC reports and the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA) routinely include data about changing ecosystems and enviroments. Today new forms of citizen science are beginning to join such classic examples and broaden the demographics of participants and the kinds of information that can be captured, shared and analyzed. Surfers and scientists are hoping to record near-shore measurements of ocean acidification in Smartfin, through GPS, accelerometers and pH sensors on surfboards. Trout Unlimited is working on “Angler Science”, documenting water temperature and stream quality in a changing climate, and using DNA analysis to track invasive species. The West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project is adding community mobilization in the face of sea level rise to its decade-long work on air pollution, particulates and asthma. The National Phenology Network encourages year-long observations using the \"-Nature's Notebook\" app that extend beyond anything possible using government-funded research alone. Understanding oceans, protecting rivers and identifying long-term patterns can contribute useful data to future NCAs, helping meet the otherwise challenging goal of “continuous assessment.” How can we manage what we can’t measure, for reasons of limited staff or resources? This presentation will offer one answer: by enlisting more and more citizen scientists--sportsmen and women, hobbyists and outdoor enthusiasts who may not even self identify as \"citizen scientists\"--pursuing their passions while also contributing valuable GEC data. The presentation will also touch on what kinds of information infrastructure can help assure data quality when traditional citizen science is expanded in these ways.",

            "abstract": "Modern geodetic measurements reveal that the viscoelastic deformation is prevalent after great subduction zone earthquakes requiring more comprehensive models to explain the transient well-recorded postseismic deformation. Specifically, these models necessitate the testing of various rheological settings different from validated interseismic models for certain geological heterogeneities, e.g. subduction channel. This discrepancy between the models favored for inter- and post-seismic deformation hints at the possibility of a time-depended rheological variation during the phase change of earthquake cycle. Here, we use a set of two-dimensional viscoelastic finite element models to investigate the time evolutions of the effective viscosities in the relaxing bodies and their effects on vertical deformation for the continuous GPS records before and after the 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule and the 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique earthquakes, of South-Central and Northern Chile. Effective viscosities are defined as the best-fitting Maxwell viscosities for the pre-determined time windows. Geological structures of the models are constrained independently by geophysical and geological data. Our results reveal a sudden decrease in effective viscosities of the subduction channel and mantle wedge immediately following the earthquake and the slow recovery of these effective viscosities during the postseismic phase. In comparison to the models without weak subduction channel and mantle wedge, the weakening of these bodies adds a subsidence-uplift deformation waveform close to the trench and shifts an uplift zone into the measurable inland area, i.e., ~100 to 200 km away from the trench. The variations of the viscosity in these bodies may reflect a negative dependence of the viscosity on the strain rate of material, which is suddenly elevated by coseismic-introduced stress perturbation. Therefore, we suggest this geophysical process leads to the first order waveform change of vertical deformation away from the trench before and after a great earthquake. Our proposed vertical deformation mechanism may be common and applicable to broader subduction zone systems due to similar time evolutions of vertical deformation have been observed after other subduction zone earthquakes, such the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Organic nitrate formation in the atmosphere represents a sink of NOx and a termination of the HOx/NOx­ O3-formation cycles, can act as a NOx reservoir transporting reactive nitrogen, and contributes to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. However, particle organic nitrates (pRONO2) are rarely measured and thus poorly understood. We use measurements of pRONO2 and total (gas+particle) organic nitrate (totRONO2), OA, and ammonium nitrate from the DC3 and SEAC4RS aircraft and several ground campaigns to investigate vertical and geographical distributions, gas/particle partitioning, losses, and contributions to total particle nitrate (pTotNO3). Quantification with aerosol mass spectrometry is evaluated. The fraction of pTotNO3 that is pRONO2 shows a steep inverse relationship with pTotNO3, approaching 100% at low pTotNO3, primarily at rural and remote locations. pRONO2 was typically 10-30% of totRONO2 with little vertical gradient in gas/particle partitioning from the boundary layer (BL) to the upper troposphere (UT). However, pRONO2 and totRONO2 concentrations show strong vertical gradients, with a steep decrease from the top of the BL up through the residual layer. pRONO2 contribution to OA shows a moderate increase with lower OA loadings in the BL and free troposphere (~2-3% by mass of nitrate group) with higher contributions at the lowest OA (5-8%), mostly observed in the UT. In the BL, RONO2 gas/particle partitioning shows a trend with temperature, with higher particle fraction at lower temperatures, as expected from partitioning theory. However, the temperature trend is much weaker than for single compound partitioning, which may be due to a broad mixture of species. Little to no dependence of pRONO­2/OA on RH or estimated particle water was observed in the BL, suggesting that losses of pRONO2 species due to hydrolysis are too rapid to observe in this dataset and there may be a substantial fraction of pRONO2 species that are not prone to rapid hydrolysis.",

            "abstract": "The ocean activity produces continuous and ubiquitous seismic energy mostly in the 2-20 s period band, also known as microseismic noise. The secondary microseisms (2-10 s period) are generated by swell reflections close to the shores and/or by opposing swells in the deep ocean. However, unique conditions are required in order for surface waves, generated by deep-ocean microseisms, to be observed on land. Since both type of secondary microseisms (coastal or deep-ocean) can occur simultaneously at different places and are continuously evolving in terms of frequency, it is very difficult to discriminate them usgin seismic stations on land. By comparing short-duration power spectral densities at both Atlantic shoreline and inland seismic stations, we show that ocean tides strongly modulate the seismic energy in a wide period band except between 2.5 and 5 s. This tidal proxy reveals the existence of an ex situ short-period contribution of the secondary microseismic peak. Comparison with swell spectra at surrounding buoys suggests that the largest part of this extra energy comes from deep-ocean-generated microseisms. Focusing on two different storms which occurred in the North Atlantic Ocean, we show that both deep-ocean and coastal microseisms coexist.",

After an initial simulation transient, a collisionless bow shock forms as a result of the interaction of the solar wind and a planet magnetic dipole. The shock ramp has a thickness of approximately one ion skin depth and is followed by a trailing wave train in the shock downstream. At the downstream edge of the bow shock, whistler waves propagate along the magnetic field lines and the presence of electron cyclotron waves has been identified. A small part of the solar wind ion population is specularly reflected by the shock while a larger part is deflected and heated by the shock. Solar wind ions and electrons are heated in the perpendicular directions. Ions are accelerated in the perpendicular direction in the trailing wave train region. This work is an initial effort to study the electron and ion kinetic effects developed near the bow shock in a realistic magnetic field configuration.",

ET_Redux (formerly U-Pb_Redux) is a free open-source software system that provides end-to-end support for the analysis of U-Pb geochronological data. The system reduces raw mass spectrometer (TIMS and LA-ICPMS) data to U-Pb dates, allows users to interpret ages from these data, and then facilitates the seamless federation of the results from one or more labs into a community web-accessible database using standard and open techniques. This EarthChem database – GeoChron.org – depends on keyed references to the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR) database that stores metadata about registered samples. These keys are each a unique International Geo Sample Number (IGSN) assigned to a sample and to its derivatives. ET_Redux provides for interaction with this archive, allowing analysts to store, maintain, retrieve, and share their data and analytical results electronically with whomever they choose. This initiative has created an open standard for the data elements of a complete reduction and analysis of U-Pb data, and is currently working to complete the same for U-series geochronology. We have demonstrated the utility of interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and geoscientists in achieving a working and useful system that provides transparency and supports reproducibility, allowing geochemists to focus on their specialties.

            "abstract": "Urban areas are significant carbon contributors in the global carbon cycle due to intense carbon emissions from traffic and other human activities and lack of vegetation for carbon absorption. A better understanding on urban carbon variations is important to quantify urban contributions to regional and global carbon budgets under the challenge of climate changes. In this study, we applied a coupled urban land-atmospheric model to simulate the diurnal and seasonal variations of carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes in the urban boundary layer (UBL) for the Phoenix Metropolitan area, Arizona. The lower boundary conditions of this model are provided by the CO2 fluxes measured using an eddy covariance tower. By analyzing the tower measurements in the urban canopy layer, the highest concentrations of CO2 in a typical weekday coincide with the busiest traffic. Besides, there are more CO2 emissions in winter than in summer possibly due to additional natural gas consumptions for heating. Based on the coupled model, we simulated the diurnal and seasonal evolutions of the mean CO2 concentration as well as the vertical profiles of CO2 concentration in the UBL. It was found that the anthropogenic CO2 sources in a built terrain effectively altered the carbon dynamics in the overlying atmosphere in contrast to its rural surroundings. We also changed the urban landscape characteristics including vegetation fraction, surface roughness, and building density to study their impacts on the CO2 dynamics in the UBL. Overall, the coupled urban land-atmospheric model provides a useful stand-alone tool for quantifying the urban carbon cycle, and can be extended to more general applications such as urban air quality problems.",

            "abstract": "In light of past, present, and future pressures placed on freshwater resources for both anthropogenic and natural uses, there is growing recognition that there is an urgent need to think of and manage groundwater and surface water as a single resource. Quantifying this resource requires a watershed-scale perspective. The myriad of hydrologic and biogeochemical processes taking place in watersheds occurring at different spatial and temporal scales are integrated and reflected in the quantity and quality of water in streams and rivers. Collection of high-frequency water quality data with sensors has provided new opportunities to disentangle these processes and quantify sources, transport, and retention of water and solutes in the coupled groundwater-surface water system. Here we provide examples of how high-frequency water quality data have been used to quantify spatial variability in the importance of groundwater in sustaining streamflow in the Colorado River Basin and temporal variability in groundwater contributions of nitrate to surface waters, and retention of that nitrate, in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Additionally, we suggest that high-frequency water quality data can be used to inform and improve interpretation of patterns in discrete water quality data.",

            "abstract": "The Earth’s inner core grows by the freezing of liquid iron at its surface. The point in history at which this process initiated marks a step-change in the thermal evolution of the planet. Recent computational and experimental studies have presented radically differing estimates of the thermal conductivity of the Earth’s core with resulting widely ranged dates of inner core nucleation (from less than 0.5 to nearly 2 billion years). Some of these raise serious challenges to explaining how the dynamo responsible for generating the geomagnetic field has been sustained over the whole of observed Earth history. The nucleation of the core leads to a different convective regime, and might be expected to produce different magnetic field structures, producing an observable signal in the palaeomagnetic record and allowing the date of inner-core nucleation to be estimated directly. Previous studies searching for this signature have been hampered by the paucity of palaeomagnetic intensity measurements, by the lack of an effective means of assessing their reliability, and by shorter timescale geomagnetic variations. Here we examine results from an expanded Precambrian database of palaeomagnetic intensity measurements selected using a new set of reliability criteria. Our analysis provides the first intensity-based support for the dominant dipolarity of the time-averaged Precambrian field, a crucial requirement for palaeomagnetic reconstructions of continents. We also present the first firm evidence for the existence of very long-term variations in geomagnetic strength. The most prominent and robust transition in the record is an increase in both average field strength and variability observed to occur between 1 and 1.5 billion years ago. This observation is most readily explained by the nucleation of the inner core occurring during this interval; the timing would tend to favour a modest value of core thermal conductivity and a more conventional thermal evolution of the Earth.",

However, this warming is not spatially uniform, with a large percentage of rapid warming rates found over the high-altitude areas. The Tibetan Plateau (hereafter, TP) experienced a rapid temperature increase during the instrumental era. The effects of TP warming are dramatic and widespread, such as glacial and permafrost melting, sea level rise, water resources depletion, and vegetation change. Among them, the implications on moisture change at regional and global scale is poorly understood, and one critical reason is the lack of extensive, long-term observations in the high-elevation areas. Here we use tree-rings to reveal common moisture change on the southeastern TP for the past five centuries, and show that regional moisture change in late spring and early summer (April-June) has been closely related to large-scale temperature anomaly on the TP, with increased moisture coinciding with higher temperature. This relationship alone implies generally wetter conditions on the southeastern TP under future global warming.",

            "abstract": "The inner heliosphere is bathed in MeV electrons during solar energetic particle (SEP) events. These relativistic electrons can enter the magnetosphere of Mercury via open magnetic field lines, nearly instantaneously filling the magnetospheric lobes and polar cap regions. Because of its thin shielding, the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer on the MErcury, Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft provides highly sensitive measurements of these energetic particles. From data during 11 SEP events that span 33 MESSENGER orbits, we find that sharp changes in observed energetic particle flux coincide precisely with topological boundaries in the magnetosphere such as the magnetopause, polar cap, and central plasma sheet. Precipitating electrons have been measured over the entire polar cap area, demonstrating that electron space weathering of Mercury’s surface is not limited to the dayside cusp region. Although no direct measurement of low energy is made by MESSENGER, the physics elucidated by these observations suggests that suprathermal electrons from the nominal solar wind create a “polar rain” at Mercury, regularly showering the majority planet’s surface with ~107–109 cm-2 s-1 fluxes of ~100 eV electrons. Finally, we observe enhanced MeV electron fluxes within the central plasma sheet that appear ordered by magnetic latitude rather than invariant latitude. Such structure implies that although these particles cannot form a stable ring current around the planet, their non-adiabatic motion nonetheless results in a quasi-trapped population at low latitudes in the magnetotail.",

            "abstract": "Improving geomagnetic field reconstructions clearly poses a high-priority challenge in geomagnetic research today. A better characterization of the geomagnetic field strength in the southern hemisphere is particularly crucial as the limited number of reliable intensity records from this area hamper a meaningful analysis of dipole moment past variations. Here we present the first archeointensity results obtained from several collections of pottery fragments from four agropastoral sites from the Puna of Jujuy (Northwest Argentina), an area never studied before. The ages of the studied sites, dated by radiocarbon analysis, range from the XIII to the XVII centuries. The classical Thellier method with regular partial Thermoremanent magnetization (pTRM) checks and TRM anisotropy and cooling rate corrections has been used for archeointensity determination. From the 82 specimens analysed, 63 gave reliable results. This high success rate indicates that potteries from agropastoral sites of the Puna of Jujuy provide a unique opportunity to further recover past geomagnetic field intensity changes in Northwest Argentina. The new data obtained are the first archeointensity data from this region. The differences observed between the new data, other available archeointensity data from nearby regions, and archeointensity variation curves derived from global models (ARCH3k and SHA.DIF.14), highlights the need for new high-quality data to better constrain the evolution of the Earth magnetic field strength in central South America.",

            "abstract": "Century-old temperate deciduous forests in the US upper Midwest and Northeast power much of North America’s terrestrial carbon sink, but these forests’ carbon uptake capacity is expected to soon decline. But will this really happen? We marshal empirical data and ecological theory to show that declines in carbon uptake are not imminent in regrown temperate deciduous forests during coming decades, despite long-held assumptions and modeling results that predict declining carbon uptake during middle stages of ecosystem development. Age and production data for temperate deciduous forests, synthesized from published literature, do not provide evidence for declining net primary and ecosystem production (NPP and NEP, respectively) within the age-range most regional forests will occupy over the next half-century. Ecological theory suggests a mechanism for sustained carbon uptake in the region’s aging forests in which high-frequency, low-severity disturbances maintain NPP and NEP by increasing ecosystem complexity. This theoretical model is supported by observations from the Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment in Michigan, USA, but such mechanisms sustaining production in old forests are not broadly represented in ecosystem models. Ecosystems experiencing low-frequency, high-severity disturbances that simplify ecosystem complexity do exhibit declining production during middle stages of succession, but we suggest that such scenarios have exerted a disproportionate influence on prevailing modeling and ecological assumptions regarding age-related declines in forest production. We conclude that there is wide ecological space for forests to sustain high rates of carbon uptake during middle stages of ecosystem development, and that advancing mechanistic understanding of long-term forest carbon cycle dynamics is essential to modeling the continent’s future carbon sink strength.",

            "abstract": "Bulk translation of the inner core has been proposed to explain quasi-hemispheric patterns of seismic heterogeneity. Such a translation would result in differential melting and freezing at the inner core boundary (ICB) and hence a heterogeneous pattern of buoyancy flux that could influence convection in the outer core. This heterogeneous flux at the ICB will tend to promote upwelling on the trailing hemisphere, where enhanced inner core growth results in increased latent heat and light element release, and inhibit upwelling on the leading hemisphere, where melting of the inner core occurs. If this difference in convective driving between the two hemispheres propagated across the thickness of the outer core, then flows near the surface of the core could be linked to the ICB heterogeneity and result in a hemispheric imbalance in the geomagnetic field. We have investigated the influence of such ICB boundary conditions on core flows and magnetic field structure in numerical geodynamo models and analysed the resultant hemispheric imbalance relative to the hemispheric structure in models constructed from observations of Earth’s field. Inner core translation at rates consistent with estimates for the Earth produce a strong hemispheric bias in the field, one that should be readily apparent in averages of the field over tens of thousands of years. Current models of the field over the Holocene may be able to rule out the most extreme ICB forcing scenarios, but more information on the dynamic structure of the field over these time scales will be needed to adequately test all cases.",

We re-analyze the dataset used by Calderoni et al. [2013], augmented by additional earthquakes and additional records at closer distance stations. We refine the EGF method used by Calderoni et al. [2013] applying more restrictive criteria in the selection of the EGF events and removing outliers based on statistical criteria. We focus on spatio-temporal variations in the Paganica fault before the mainshock. Using 51 earthquakes (9 foreshocks, the mainshock, and 42 aftershocks), we show that, after the Mw 4.1 largest foreshock of 30 March 2009, the Brune stress drop goes down to the lowest values (0.4 MPa). This largest foreshock was indicated as a marker for the onset of the temporal variations in efficiency of fault-zone guided waves (Calderoni et al., 2015) and other independent seismic parameters such as the b value [Papadopoulos et al., 2010; Sugan et al., 2014], and the P-to-S wave velocity ratio [Di Luccio et al., 2010; Lucente et al., 2010]. The low values of stress drop after the Mw 4.1 foreshock are consistent with the increase of pore pressure invoked by other authors to explain the increase of the Vp/Vs ratio and the decrease of Vs in the damage fault zone. In contrast, immediate foreshocks occurring a few hours before the mainshock very close to its nucleation are characterized by the highest values observed for foreshocks (≈5 MPa). These high stress drop foreshocks are located in the fault patch where a low b value anomaly indicates highly stressed rock before the main shock rupture [Sugan et al., 2014].\nThese results provide further evidence to previous observations before major earthquakes suggesting that stress drop variations can provide insight into the preparatory phase of impending earthquakes.",

Likewise, climate information can expose latent opportunities. Moving from climate science to social and economic decisions raises complex questions about how to communicate the causes and impacts of climate variability and change; how to characterize and quantify vulnerabilities, risks, and opportunities faced by communities and businesses; and how to make and implement “win-win” adaptation plans at local, regional, and national scales. A broad coalition of federal agencies launched the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit (toolkit.climate.gov) in November 2014 to help our nation build resilience to climate-related extreme events. The site’s primary audience is planners and decision makers in business, resource management, and government (at all levels) who seek science-based climate information and tools to help them in their near- and long-term planning. The Executive Office of the President assembled a task force of dozens of subject experts from across the 13 agencies of the U.S. Global Change Research Program to guide the site’s development. The site’s ongoing evolution is driven by feedback from the target audience. For example, based on feedback, climate projections will soon play a more prominent role in the site’s “Climate Explorer” tool and case studies. The site’s five-step adaptation planning process is being improved to better facilitate people getting started and to provide clear benchmarks for evaluating progress along the way. In this session, we will share lessons learned from a series of user engagements around the nation and evidence that the Toolkit couples climate information with actionable decision-making processes in ways that are helping Americans build resilience to climate-related stressors.",

            "abstract": "GNSS-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) is a ground breaking ocean remote sensing technique that exploits reflected signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to retrieve geophysical information about the ocean surface such as near‑surface winds above the ocean. Adopting a bistatic radar configuration, signals emitted by GNSS satellites flying in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) are received by a GNSS-R receiver on a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) observatory utilizing both a zenith antenna to receive the direct signal from the GNSS and a nadir antenna to acquire the earth-reflected signal. The reflected signal originated from a glistening zone on the ocean surface sited around the Specular Point (SP), the geometrical point on the Earth surface where GNSS signals are forward scattered in the specular direction. The two signals are correlated for different shifts in time (delay) and frequency (Doppler) relative to the specular point (SP) to produce a so-called Delay Doppler Map (DDM) of forward‑scattered electromagnetic power over the surface.\nThis paper gives an overview of recent results obtained for wind speed and ocean roughness retrieval with the Low-Earth-Orbiting UK TechDemoSat-1 satellite (TDS-1). Launched in July 2014, TDS-1 provides the first new spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) data since the pioneering UK-Disaster Monitoring Mission experiment in 2003. We present examples of onboard-processed delay Doppler Maps, including excellent DDM data quality for winds up to 27.9 m/s. The relationship between observed GNSS-R signals, wind speed and ocean roughness is explored using global collocated matchup datasets with METOP ASCAT scatterometer winds and WaveWatch3 numerical wave model output. Several Geophysical Model Functions are proposed, that make it possible to retrieve wind speed without bias and with a precision of the order of 2 m/s even without calibration. This work demonstrates the capabilities of low-cost, low-mass, low-power GNSS-R receivers ahead of their launch on the NASA CYGNSS constellation in 2016.",

            "abstract": "We study the ion density and temperature in the predipolarization and postdipolarization plasma sheets in the Earth's magnetotail using 9 years (2001–2009) of Cluster data. For our study we selected cases when Cluster observed dipolarization fronts (DFs) with an earthward plasma flow greater than 150km/s. We perform a statistical study of the temperature and density variations during the DF crossings. Earlier studies concluded that on average, the temperature increases while the density decreases across the DF. Our statistical results show a more diverse picture: While ∼54% of the DFs follow this pattern (category A), for ∼28% the temperature decreases while the density increases across the DF (category B). We found an overall decrease in thermal pressure for category A DFs with a more pronounced decrease at the DF duskside, while DFs of category B showed no clear pattern in the pressure change. Both categories are associated with earthward plasma flows but with some difference: (1) category A flows are faster than category B flows, (2) the observations indicate that category B flows are directed perpendicular to the current in the near-Earth current sheet while category A flows are tilted slightly duskward from this direction, and (3) the background Bz of category B is higher than that of category A. Based on these results, we hypothesize that after reconnection takes place, a bursty bulk flow emerges with category A characteristics, and as it travels earthward, it further evolves into category B characteristics, which is in a more dipolarized region with slower plasma flow (closer to the flow-braking region).",

            "abstract": "Coastal infrastructure, cultural, and archeological sites are increasingly vulnerable to erosion and flooding along permafrost coasts. Amplified warming of the Arctic, sea level rise, lengthening of the open water period, and a predicted increase in frequency of major storms compound these threats. Mitigation necessitates decision-making tools at an appropriate scale. We present a study of coastal erosion combining it with a flooding risk assessment for the culturally important historic settlement on Herschel Island, a UNESCO World Heritage candidate site. The resulting map may help local stakeholders devise management strategies to cope with rapidly changing environmental conditions.\nWe analyzed shoreline movement using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) after digitizing shorelines from 1952, 1970, and 2011. Using these data, forecasts of shoreline positions were made for 20 and 50 years into the future. Flooding risk was assessed using a cost-distance map based on a high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset and current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sea level estimates.\nWidespread erosion characterizes the study area. The rate of shoreline movement for different periods of the study ranges from -5.5 to 2.7 m·a-1 (mean -0.6 m·a-1). Mean coastal retreat decreased from -0.6 m·a-1 to -0.5 m·a-1, for 1952-1970 and 1970-2000, respectively, and increased to -1.3 m·a-1 in the period 2000-2011. Ice-rich coastal sections, and coastal sections most exposed to wave attack exhibited the highest rates of coastal retreat. The geohazard map resulting from shoreline projections and flood risk analysis indicates that most of the area occupied by the historic settlement is at extreme or very high risk of flooding, and some buildings are vulnerable to coastal erosion.\nThe results of this study indicate a greater threat by coastal flooding than erosion. Our assessment may be applied in other locations where limited data are available.",

The BAS model is a semi-analytical model which provides a steady distribution function for asymmetric current sheet ions. In this paper, we prove that an ion kinetic equilibria produced by this model remain steady in a fully kinetic Particle-In-Cell simulation even if the electron distribution function is not an equilibrium. We then apply this equilibrium to look at the dependence of magnetic reconnection simulations upon their initial condition. We demonstrate that regardless of macroscopic or microscopic differences between initial current sheets, signatures of magnetic reconnection only depends on the upstream plasma. This demonstration is the first to confirm this widely use assumption and comforts the relevance of comparisons between simulations and observations in the electron decoupling region, such as in the context of the upcoming Magnetospheric Multiscale mission.",

            "abstract": "Based on daily precipitation data of 1181 weather stations and records of flood disaster losses in summer from 1983 to 2011 in southern China, the spatiotemporal variations of precipitation and flood disaster were analyzed and relationship between different rainfall grades and losses was established. According to cluster analysis of precipitation, the southern China is divided into six study regions: (Ⅰ) middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River; (Ⅱ) area between Yangtze River and Yellow River; (Ⅲ) Huanan; (Ⅳ) western Jiangnan; (Ⅴ) upper reaches of Yangtze River; (Ⅵ)southwest China. Station-days(SD) of rainfall grades over the southern China exhibits a distinct three-peak distribution with peaks at 0~5mm, 50~60mm and 100~130mm. The SD of large rainfall grades (>50mm) in 1990s is significantly higher inⅠand Ⅳ. The distributions of rainfall grades are similar inⅡ,Ⅴand Ⅵ, with heavy rain decreased dramatically in 1980s. There are more extreme precipitation events occurred in 1990s and 2000s in Ⅲ. Similar to the distributions of SD of rainfall grades, impact population, impact area, direct economy loss and agricultural economy loss with unimodal distributions inⅠand Ⅳ are more serious in 1990s. In Ⅱ, Ⅴ and Ⅵ, disaster losses are trimodally distributed, with peak values in 1991, 1998, and 2006. The disaster losses exhibited bimodal distribution, reaching peak values in 1994 and 2006 in Ⅲ. In general, four kinds of disaster losses reach the maximum values in Ⅰ in 1990s. Based on the average SD of heavy rain (25~50mm), rainstorm (50~100mm) and heavy rainstorm (100~250mm), the values of different disaster loss indexes could be calculated by twenty established multiple regression equations, with all correlation coefficients larger than 0.4, passing a significance level of 0.001. The increased values of flood disaster losses caused by heavy rainstorm are about one order of magnitude larger than those by heavy rain and rainstorm. The distribution of SD of rainfall grades would reflect the characteristics of flood disaster loss more appropriately than the distributions of rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Assessing the impacts of climate change on water resources is a vital issue for China and the rest of the world. In this study, we analyze the connections between the GRACE-based terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSAs) over China and two climate indices linked to equatorial Pacific and Indian oceans sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during January 2003 and June 2014. Results indicate that the regions of the Yun-Gui Plateau, the Northeast Plain, the Qaidam Basin and a small portion of the North Plain are mainly influenced by Pacific SSTs, especially during the ENSO events. In particular, an extremely wet season over Yun-Gui Plateau and a very dry condition in the north part of the Northeast Plain in 2008-2009 observed by GRACE are clearly connected to the La Niña event. High (low) TWS in the mid-latitude regions of China range from 29-33°N and 99-120°E are correlated with the negative (positive) IOD phases between September 2006 and April 2011. The TWSAs in Sichuan Basin is persistently affected by IOD index and the severe drought in late 2006 is significantly correlated to the strong positive IOD event. After August 2010, results show significant positive correlation between the TWSAs and IOD over the Qaidam Basin and central Tibet Plateau regions. In addition, the relations between TWSAs and ENSO/IOD are mostly impacted by east-west mountain ranges, as strong correlations generally occur on the upwind side of mountain ranges and weak correlations on the leeward side. The Qingling Mountains are the boundary (~33°N) of the impact of IOD on water storage variations between the North and the South of China.",

Using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and applying a statistical test and cross-correlation analysis,\nwe investigate the timescales and the physical mechanisms involved into the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling.\nSummarizing, we obtain the following results:\n1. We note the existence of two different timescales into the four datasets which are related to the short-term dynamics, with a characteristic timescale τ<3 days, and to the longer timescale dynamics, with a timescale between 7 and 80 days. The short-term variations could be related to the fluctuations around a characteristic mean value, while longer timescales dynamics can be associated with solar rotational periodicity and mechanisms regarding the occurrence of high-speed streams and corotating interaction regions but also with stream-stream interactions and synodic solar rotation.\n2. The cross-correlation analysis highlights the relevant role of the dynamical coupling between solar wind and magnetosphere via pressure balance and direct transfer of compressional waves into the magnetosphere. Moreover, it shows that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is not the primary source of geomagnetic ultra-low frequency wave activity. These results are in agreement with previous works [Engebretson et al, 1998].\n3. The cross-correlation coefficient between Pc5 wave power and relativistic electron flux longscale reconstructions shows that Pc5 wave activity leads enhancements in magnetospheric electron flux to relativistic energy with a characteristic time delay of about 54 hours, which is in agreement with the lag of about 2 days found by [Mann et al., 2004].",

Recent in situ measurements by satellites passing through the ring-current region (i.e. Van Allen probes) and computations with magnetospheric field models showed that there are many other field contributions on the geomagnetic storming time variations at middle and low latitudes. Appling the Empirical Mode Decomposition [Huang et al., 1998] to magnetospheric and ground observations, we detect the different magnetic field contributions during a GS and introduce the concepts of modulated baseline and fluctuations of the geomagnetic field.

            "abstract": "We report here on neutral wind and ion drift measurements recorded during the November 24, 2014, \"C-REX\" sounding rocket mission into the thermosphere beneath Earth's northern geomagnetic cusp. The rocket released ten tracer clouds, each comprised of a mixture of barium and strontium, at altitudes between 190 and 400 km. The clouds were created by launching rocket-propelled \"grenades\" at high velocity out from the parent payload, and were dispersed across a 3D volume extending over many tens of km around the main trajectory. Cameras located at Longyearbyen, Ny-Alesund, and aboard an aircraft stationed north of Bear Island were used to image the tracer clouds and to triangulate on their position and 3D motion. Sunlight striking the clouds ionized the barium within a few tens of seconds, whereas the strontium remained neutral. We were thus able to independently measure the flow velocity of both neutrals and ions at the release locations. Here we will present high-resolution maps of the tracer cloud motion, along with the resulting estimates of neutral and ion flow velocities. These results show very substantial ion-neutral velocity differences: the ions' drift direction was roughly perpendicular to that of the neutrals, while the magnitude of their velocity difference was of order 500 meters per second. Combining these data with ground-based measurements of temperature and electron density allows us to estimate that the specific power density for Joule heating at heights above 200 km was very substantial during the time of this experiment. If such Joule heating is typical, it is very likely to play a major role in establishing the (currently poorly understood) permanent enhancements in the neutral mass density of Earth's thermosphere in the geomagnetic cusp regions at altitudes of around 400 km.",

            "abstract": "Two of the main techniques currently in use for measuring winds in Earth's middle and upper thermosphere are satellite drag, and optical remote sensing using ground-based Doppler spectrometers viewing thermospheric airglow or auroral emissions. Recent comparisons done by the University College London Fabry-Perot group indicates that, at least in the Northern Hemsphere and for the periods studied, the satellite drag method yielded wind speeds that were 1.5 to 2 times stronger than those measured from optical Doppler shifts. The origin of this discepancy is currently unknown, as indeed are any dependencies that it may have on geophysical drivers such as season, solar or geomagnetic activity, altitude, latitude, etc. Here we will present a similar comparison between optical and satellite data using observations from our all-sky imaging Fabry-Perot spectrometer located at Mawson in Antarctica, to determine whether a similar discrepancy is observed in the southern hemisphere. While the Mawson Fabry-Perot is not identical to those used by the UCL group, there is typically very little uncertainty in the absolute calibration of Doppler shifts measured using Fabry-Perot instruments. This means that ground-based winds measured in the two hemispheres should be directly comparable, and it is likely that the same discrepancy will manifest when comparing the Mawson data to satellite drag winds. If, by contrast, the Mawson data behaves differently to that from the northern hemisphere, it would suggest that some as-yet unidentiifed aspect of the optical remote sensing method can lead to biased wind measurements.",

            "abstract": "Since the 1960s terrestrial ecosystems have acted as a substantial sink for atmospheric CO2, sequestering about one quarter of anthropogenic emissions in an average year. Variations in this land carbon sink are also responsible for most of the large interannual variability in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. While most evidence places the majority of the sink in highly productive forests, the location and the processes governing the interannual variations are still not well characterised. Here we evaluate the hypothesis that the mean, long-term trend and the variability in the land CO2 sink are respectively dominated by geographically distinct regions. Using information from global CO2 records, an ensemble of terrestrial ecosystem models and an empirical observation-based product of gross primary productivity, we show that whereas the mean sink is dominated by tropical forests, the trend and interannual variations of the sink are dominated by semi-arid ecosystems occupying the transition between moist forests and deserts. The contribution of both global land and semi-arid ecosystems to global CO2 interannual variations are driven almost equally by precipitation and temperature, suggestive of drought. ENSO, and especially its positive phase, El Niño, appears as the main control of variations in semi-arid ecosystems, covarying with extreme NBP events across the semi-arid zone, although the sign of the response differs between locations.",

            "abstract": "In supercritical shocks a substantial fraction of ions is reflected at the steep shock ramp and carries a considerable amount of energy. The presence of reflected ions enables streaming instabilities to develop across the foot's magnetic field. These are excited by relative drifts between the populations of incoming ions, reflected ions, and electrons. The instabilities cover wavelengths from the ion inertia length to the electron gyroradius and frequencies from the lower-hybrid to the electron cyclotron. The particle distributions are modelled as three components: a broad electron and two ion populations, viz. a core and a beam representing the reflected ions. Assuming the ion beam is directed along the shock normal at 90o to Bo, we investigate the possible instabilities under various wave propagation angles.\nThree types of waves are shown to be unstable: 1) Oblique whistlers with wavelength about the ion inertia length which propagate toward upstream at angles about 50o to Bo. Frequencies are a few times the lower-hybrid. The waves share many similarities to the oblique whistlers measured in detail by Polar [Hull et al., JGR 117, 2012]. 2) Quasi-perpendicular whistlers with wavelength covering a fraction of the electron inertia length which propagate toward downstream at angles larger than 80o to Bo. Frequencies are close to the lower-hybrid. 3) Bernstein waves with wavelength close to the electron gyroradius which propagate toward upstream at angles within 5o of perpendicular to Bo. Frequencies are close to the electron cyclotron. The waves have similarities to those reported by Wind and Stereo [Breneman et al., JGR 118, 2013; Wilson et al., JGR 115, 2010].\nLinear dispersion properties are analyzed by computing the full electromagnetic dielectric tensor. Then, dispersion results are compared with waveforms and hodograms obtained from electromagnetic pseudo-oblique 1D PIC simulations. One computes the Poynting flux associated to the whistlers. It is directed toward upstream for the oblique whistlers, as expected. We present a synthetic view of wave emissions of two-stream origin and connect our results with the low-frequency whistlers of Hellinger and Mangeney [JGR 102, 1997], the MTSI-1 and 2 of Matsukyio and Scholer [JGR 111, 2006], and the Bernstein waves of Muschietti and Lembege [JGR 118, 2013].",

            "abstract": "The Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has become one of the main contributors to global mean sea level rise, predominantly explained by a decreasing surface mass balance (SMB). Clouds are known to have a strong influence on the surface energy budget, which in consequence impacts the SMB. For example, the potentially important role of thin liquid-bearing clouds over Greenland in enhancing ice sheet melt has recently gained interest. Yet, current research is spatially and temporally limited, focusing on particular events and cloud types, while the large-scale impact of all clouds on the SMB remains unknown. Using a unique cloud product covering the entire GrIS over the period 2007-2010, consisting of active satellite remote sensing data, ground-based observations and climate model data, together with snow model simulations, we investigate the cloud radiative effect over the GrIS and the consequences for the SMB. We show a strong sensitivity of the GrIS to clouds, with a complex interplay between enhanced and reduced mass loss. We further distinguish between ice-only and liquid-bearing clouds, temporal and spatial variations in cloud impacts, and we demonstrate the large spread in simulated clouds by state-of-the-art climate models. Our results therefore urge the need for accurate cloud representations in climate models, to improve future projections of GrIS SMB and global sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "The satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been widely used to investigate the impact of climate factors on vegetation changes. However, a few studies have concentrated on comparing the relationship of climate factors and vegetation in different climatic regions. To enhance the understanding of these relationship, a temporal analysis was carried out on time series of 16-day NDVI from MODIS (2000–2014) during the growing season in ten protected areas of different regions of Iran. The correlation analyses between climate factors and NDVI was classified into two sub-periods. First from February to April and second from May to September. In the first sub-period, NDVI was more correlated to temperature than precipitation, all the areas had positive correlation with temperature. Slope of regression in arid region was less than others. In contrast, precipitation had different impact on NDVI among the locations from February to April. The negative correlation was found between precipitation and woody lands (humid regions), whereas precipitation in Bafgh and Turan in which annual plants are dominant (arid regions), had positive impact on NDVI. In the second sub-period, temperature showed negative significant influence on NDVI; however, the slope of regression was not identical across the locations. Woody lands had more strong correlation with temperature. NDVI sensitivity to temperature had a time lag of 30 days in most of areas, whereas arid regions did not show time lag. Positive correlation was found between precipitation and NDVI during warm period in all the locations. The areas covered by perennial plant had 1-2 months lag to respond to precipitation. Overall, no significant trend in NDVI changes was shown during the study period. We concluded that NDVI sensitivity to climate factors relies on vegetation type and time of year.",

            "abstract": "Synthetic reconstruction tests are widely used in seismic tomography as a means for assessing the robustness of solutions produced by linear or iterative non-linear inversion schemes. The most common test is the so-called checkerboard resolution test, which uses an alternating pattern of high and low wavespeeds (or some other seismic property such as attenuation). However, checkerboard tests have a number of limitations, including that they (1) only provide indirect evidence of quantitative measures of reliability such as resolution and uncertainty; (2) give a potentially misleading impression of the range of scale-lengths that can be resolved; (3) don't give a true picture of the structural distortion or smearing caused by the data coverage; and (4) result in an inverse problem that is biased towards an accurate reconstruction. The widespread use of synthetic reconstruction tests in seismic tomography is likely to continue for some time yet, so it is important to implement best practice where possible. The goal here is to provide a general set of guidelines, derived from the underlying theory and illustrated by a series of numerical experiments, on their implementation in seismic tomography. In particular, we recommend (1) using a sparse distribution of spikes, rather than the more conventional tightly-spaced checkerboard; (2) using the identical data coverage (e.g. geometric rays) for the synthetic model that was computed for the observation-based model; (3) carrying out multiple tests using anomalies of different scale length; (4) exercising caution when analysing synthetic recovery tests that use anomaly patterns that closely mimic the observation-based model; (5) investigating the trade-off between data noise levels and the minimum wavelength of recovered structure; (6) where possible, test the extent to which preconditioning (e.g. identical parameterization for input and output models) influences the recovery of anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is leading to a hydrological intensification (i.e., wet areas and periods are becoming wetter; dry areas and periods are becoming drier). Impacts of climate change across Canada will vary, and Canadians would benefit from insights as to where these impacts will occur and what these impacts will be in order to be in a position to effectively respond to these changes. Resilience is a term that is often used – and occasionally misused. We make the distinction between engineering resilience and ecological resilience. Engineering resilience assumes that a system may exist in only one stable equilibrium state, and measures the system’s resistance to change. In contrast, ecological resilience assumes that a system may exist in multiple equilibrium states and measures the magnitude of change a system can absorb before shifting from one equilibrium state to another. We adopt the concept of engineering resilience and explore the ability of riverscapes (rivers and their watersheds) to maintain or quickly return to an equilibrium state in response to changing climatic conditions. We use the Budyko curve to examine interactions of climate and water yield in riverscapes across Canada. The Budyko curve describes the relationship between a riverscape’s potential evapotranspiration (PET) and its actual evapotranspiration (AET) both normalized by precipitation (P) – i.e., the curve describes AET/P as a function of PET/P. We define elasticity is a measure of a system’s ability to maintain this relationship consistent with the Budyko curve as climate changes (ratio of range of PET/P to range of AET/P between different climate periods). We classify each riverscape as resilient (elasticity > 1) or non-resilient (elasticity ≤ 1) in response to climate change – exploring both past and future climate change scenarios. This Budyko approach enables us to characterize the resilience of riverscapes, predict their vulnerability to climate change, and propose management measures that will enable societies to adapt to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Among the most valuable products produced by forests are the ecosystem services of safe and reliable water supplies. The provision of these ecosystem services on forested landscapes is inherently linked to forest condition. Climate change and associated hydrological intensification may affect forest water use (green water) and runoff generation (blue water) in the temperate forest biome of eastern North America. For the time period from the 1980s to present, a period with significant climate warming, we used a network of long-term catchment study sites nested within the temperate forest biome to explore forest-water feedbacks in response to climate change. Satellite remote sensing was used to track changes in forest phenology and forest productivity, and catchment meteorological and discharge records were used to track changes in the magnitude and timing of forest water yields. Forest responses to climate change varied along a latitudinal gradient. The magnitude of annual water yields declined at all study sites. The timing of peak discharge was measured by the center of mass (i.e., 50th percentile), and the narrowing or widening of discharge periods was measured by the coefficient of dispersion (i.e., 75th – 25th over 50th percentile) of water yield. For the vernal window, we observed subtle and systematic changes with a shift to later peaks in the center of mass of spring discharge and a widening of the spring discharge period (i.e., less peaked flows). For the autumnal window, we observed less subtle, non-systematic changes with a shift to later peaks above 45 degrees latitude but earlier peaks below 45 degrees latitude, and a narrowing of the fall discharge period (i.e., more peaked flows). The time shift and widening of vernal and autumnal windows are likely caused by asymmetric responses of forest water use (green water) and runoff generation (blue water) to climate warming. These disruptions in forest-water coupling are likely to have significant implications for downstream water supplies.",

Major and trace element analyses of mineral inclusions in these diamonds include Ca-Ti-Si perovskite, Ca-rich majoritic-garnet, clinopyroxene, olivine, jeffbenite, minerals with stoichiometries of CAS and K-hollandite phases, SiO2, FeO, native iron, low-Ni sulfides, and Ca–Mg-carbonate. The C isotopic compositions of the diamond hosts range from a δ13C of -25 to -5‰ ( J1 being -15‰). Collier 4 diamonds have been interpreted to crystallize from carbonatitic melts derived from the recycling of oceanic lithosphere at TransitionZone depths (Walter et al. Nature 2008; Bulanova et al. CMP 2010).\nA rare Fe-sulfide inclusion in the core of diamond J1 has been dated with the Re-Os system in order to provide age and compositional constraints on the proposed oceanic slab recycling. The rim of J1 contained inclusions of Ca-Ti-Si perovskite that yielded U-Pb age of 101±7 Ma and eclogitic (low Cr, high Ca) majorite that yielded formation pressures (Si - Al+Cr geobarometry) >8 GPa (Bulanova et al. CMP 2010). The Fe-sulfide analyzed was low Ni pyrrhotite determined to be Fe10S11 of a rare 11T polytype by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The 27 ug interior pyrrhotite had a high Re/Os (187Re/188Os = 854) typical of MORB (Re/Os ~100) and radiogenic Os isotopic composition (187Os/188Os = 8.50±1.38) that yields a 602±16 Ma model age relative to normal mantle. Since the sulfide is in the core of the diamond and the perovskite in the rim, the diamond could have grown at 101 Ma or have two episodes of growth separated by 500 Ma. In any case this sulfide age documents recycling of slab material in to the deep mantle significantly before Mesozoic subduction under Gondwanaland.",

After predictions of El Niño’s emergence in 2014, sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies across the equatorial Pacific were near El Niño thresholds through the winter of 2014-15. However, due to the lack of a clear atmospheric response, it wasn’t until March 2015 that ENSO forecasters declared the onset of El Niño. As of early August 2015, the Niño-3.4 SST index has reached levels that are within the top 5% of its distribution, along with atmospheric features consistent with ocean-atmosphere coupling. Multi-model ensemble mean forecasts are unanimous in predicting a strong event in the second half of 2015 (3-month average value in Niño-3.4 SST at or exceeding 1.5C).",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial carbon and water cycles exhibit large interannual variabilities at scales from local and global. The causes of such variabilities have not been well understood and our current capacity to model them is limited. In this study, we related the observed and modeled interannual variabilities of carbon uptake and evapotranspiration at the Missouri Ozark AmeriFlux site in the central USA to corresponding climate variability. We showed that precipitation regimes and associated water and heat stresses determined seasonal and interannual variations of carbon uptake and water use in this deciduous forest ecosystem and these effects were captured with a few simply constructed climate variability indices. While the interannual fluctuation in carbon uptake was large, a net carbon sink was maintained even during an extreme drought year, suggesting a high degree of resilience of this forest ecosystem to atmospheric stresses. The Community Land Model (CLM) predicted seasonal and interanual variations in evapotranspiration reasonably well. However, its predicted carbon uptake was too small across the observed range of climate variability. Also, the model systematically underestimated the sensitivities of carbon uptake and evapotranspiration to climate variability and overestimated the coupling between carbon and water fluxes. We suggest that future model improvements should focus on better representation and parameterization of process responses to atmospheric stresses and more complete representations of carbon-specific processes such as mesophyll diffusion.",

            "abstract": "The inversion of seismic traveltimes for 2-D or 3-D velocity structure still represents the most common form of seismic tomography in use today. Studies generally focus on a particular class of data, such as teleseismic arrival time residuals, local earthquake arrival times, refraction and wide-angle reflection traveltimes or the traveltimes of regional or global phases. Group or phase traveltimes extracted from dispersion analysis of surface waves can also be inverted for velocity structure. A much smaller number of studies attempt to combine multiple data types in a single inversion; this can be of benefit when the datasets provide overlapping coverage. For instance, local earthquake and teleseismic datasets are often complementary, because while they can both sample the crust and upper mantle, there are many situations in which the teleseisms offer poor constraint on crustal structure, and local earthquakes do not constrain upper mantle structure particularly well. A joint inversion can therefore provide good recovery throughout the crust and mantle lithosphere. In this study, an updated version of the FMTOMO package will be used to jointly invert refraction, wide-angle reflection, teleseismic and local earthquake traveltime datasets for crustal, Moho and upper mantle structure beneath southeast Australia. The main target region is Tasmania, which lies at the southeastern tip of the Australian continent and represents the southern-most expression of the Tasmanides, a large Paleozoic fold belt that abuts the Pre-Cambrian shield region of central and western Australia. Broadside refraction and wide-angle reflection coverage is provided by off-shore airguns recorded by on-shore stations, and several passive seismic arrays supply teleseismic and local earthquake data. The combined dataset is able to resolve the trade-off between velocity and interface structure in the neighbourhood of the Moho, which results in a detailed picture of the Tasmanian lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Previous late Quaternary paleoclimatic interpretations in Amazonia have considered fluctuating dry to wet episodes with changes from savanna to forest, a view that concurs with other proposals of undisturbed rainforest despite global oscillations. Most of this debate is based on pollen data, but such elements are scarce in Amazonian sedimentary records. This work interprets vegetation in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene in a southwestern Amazonia lowland using δ13C, δ15N, C/N integrated with geomorphology, sedimentology and radiocarbon dating. The goal was to reconstruct vegetation changes through time and analyze their relation to climate and sedimentary dynamics. Fluvial channel and floodplain deposits with phytoplankton, as well as C3 and C4 land plants, were recorded. Between 42,033−43,168 cal yr BP and 34,804−35,584 cal yr BP, C4 land plants increased as a result of a climate drier than today´s. However, wet climate prevailed from this time-frame until the onset of the Last Glaciation Maximum. In the Pleistocene/Holocene transition, there was an increased contribution of C4 land plants potentially related to dry episodes. However, the increased contribution of this type of land plant is not synchronous with Holocene dry episodes previously documented for the Amazonian lowland. On the other hand, it is remarkable that the record of this plant type was verified only in sites with modern grassland confined to fluvial paleo-landforms. Thus, rather than due to a dry climatic episode, the recorded grassland expansion and its maintenance up to the present time in the studied sites is more likely associated with the evolution of depositional environments, being coincidental with the progressive abandonment of fluvial systems. An important conclusion derived from the present work is that great care must be placed when reconstructing late Quaternary paleoclimate in Amazonia based on changes in floristic patterns, as they may be also a response to sedimentary dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) contamination in aquatic environments is a concern due to the production of monomethylmercury (MeHg), the highly bioaccumulative form that can impart neurotoxic effects to wildlife and humans. One strategy for remediation is to minimize MeHg production by anaerobic microorganisms that are prevalent in benthic settings. However, the factors that influence MeHg production and, in particular, the bioavailability of inorganic Hg for methylating microorganisms are poorly understood and difficult to quantify. This presentation will discuss the application of a thiol-based selective leaching assay to quantify the bioavailable fraction of Hg in sediments. This leaching assay involves quantification of leachable Hg concentrations in samples that are exposed to anoxic solutions containing glutathione (GSH). This thiol-based approach was chosen because cellular uptake and methylation of Hg by methylating bacteria are known to increase with the addition of GSH to cultures. This assay was applied to sediment-slurry microcosms that were amended with multiple types of inorganic Hg (dissolved Hg2+, Hg-sorbed to FeS, nanoparticulate HgS, microcrystalline HgS) that are known to span a range of bioavailability and methylation potential. The results demonstrated that the GSH-leachable Hg concentration correlated with MeHg production in cultures and microcosms. Methylation potential did not correlate to the concentration of Hg in the filtered aqueous fraction in the microcosm (i.e., passable though 0.2 um filters). These results suggest that a portion of the particle-bound Hg is available for methylation in a way that cannot be assessed by conventional filtration methods. The results of this work will be discussed in the context of management and in-situ remediation of contaminated sediments.",

            "abstract": "Although limited, the contribution of terrestrial water storage (TWS) change to sea-level change is significant enough to be taken into account in sea-level attribution studies. Thus, after being absent in a previous report, TWS was again one of the components taken into account in IPCC assessment report 5. TWS can be effectively observed by analysing gravity anomalies from the GRACE mission or by observing individual components with lidar (surface water level), geodetic surveys (groundwater) and space borne passive and active microwave sensors (soil moisture, snow water equivalent). However, these observation only yield time series of limited length making it difficult to estimate long term trends in TWS as multi-decadal variations. After a short review of recent modelling efforts, we present the results of a century-long (1900-2010) simulation of TWS change with PCR-GLOBWB 2.0 that is fully coupled with a global two-layer groundwater model. In this simulation we include the effects of land cover change, the building of reservoirs and human water use (abstraction from surface and groundwater, water consumption and return flows). The effects of wetland drainage and siltation of reservoirs is corrected for afterwards. We validate TWS estimates for the period 2003-2010 with GRACE estimates. Trends of TWS and its effects on sea-level change are estimated and the main contributions identified. Similarly, we examine multi-year variability in TWS and sea-level change in relation to climate variability.",

These first efforts mostly relied on statistics of water use and observations of meteorological and hydrological variables. Shortly thereafter, the first macroscale hydrological models (MHM) appeared. In these models, blue water (i.e., surface water and renewable groundwater) availability was calculated by proxy by accumulating runoff over a stream network and comparing it with population densities or with estimated water demand. In this talk we review the evolution of human impact modelling in global hydrology, e.g.: confronting yearly water demand with water availability using a water scarcity index; calculating a water scarcity index at monthly time scale; adding groundwater depletion; adding dams and reservoirs; fully integrating water use (abstraction, application, consumption, return flow) in the hydrology; simulating the effects of land use change. A number of challenges are identified that hamper the further development of current water use modelling as well as prohibit realistic modelling of future water use. We also speculate on pathways to overcome these challenges.",

            "abstract": "The rapid climate warming being observed in the Svalbard is leading to an increase in human activities in the coastal zone, leading to an increased need for coastal hazard assessment. Present-day Svalbard coastal landscapes are modified by increased degradation of permafrost accelerated sediment supply from deglaciated catchments, and prolonged periods of open-water conditions and wave activity. Since the second half of 20thcentury there is also an observed increase in the number and intensity of storms entering the Arctic particularly in summer months when coastlines are free of protective ice cover. Despite the potential significance of these coastal hazards on the security of scientific (research bases and devices) and community (ports, airports, roads, buildings) infrastructure on Svalbard, relatively little is known on the present-day rate of Svalbard coastal zone changes and how they might impact the nearshore infrastructure in the future.\nHere we report the results of a project that focused on rates of coastal zone changes in Svalbard and examined the impact of extreme coastal processes on scientific and community infrastructure. The project applied combination of remote sensing and field-based mapping techniques to characterise coastal changes observed in the surroundings of main research stations in Svalbard in Hornsund (PPS), Petuniabukta (AMUPS) and Bellsund (Calypsobyen) as well as a major towns: Longyearbyen, Piramiden, Barentsburg and Svea. Our results document dramatic changes of Svalbard coastal zone under intervals characterised by a warming climate, retreating local ice masses, a shortened winter sea-ice season and melting permafrost. The study confirmed the growing importance of extreme processes in shaping coasts of Svalbard and the impact of these changes on human infrastructure. Our study proposes a risk assessment for a development and protection of infrastructure along the coasts of Svalbard under scenarios of climate change, sea level rise, changes to the frequency of storms entering the region and variations in sea ice extent.\nThe study was funded by the Foundation for Polish Science HOMING PLUS grant no.2013-8/12. Proejct leader is also supported by the National Science Centre Postdoctoral Fellowship (2013/08/S/ST10/00585).",

            "abstract": "Data are the currency of science and assure the integrity of published research. As the ability to collect, analyze, and visualize data has grown beyond what could be included in a publication, and as the value of the data become more clear (or the lack of availability of data was criticized), publishers and the scientific community developed several solutions to enhance access to underlying data. Most leading journals now require authors to agree as a condition of submission that underlying data will be included or made available; indeed, publication is the key leverage point in exposing much scholarly data. Most journals allow PDF or other supplements and links to data sets hosted by authors or labs, or better, data repositories such as Dryad, and some have banned “data not shown” or any reference to unpublished work. Many of these solutions have proven problematic and recent studies have found that large fraction of data are undiscoverable even a few years after publication. The best solution has been dedicated domain repositories collectively supported by publishers, funders, and the scientific community and where deposition is required before or at the time of publication. These provide quality control and curation and facilitate reuse. However, expanding these beyond a few key repositories and developing standardized workflows and functionality among repositories and between them and publishers has been problematic. Addressing these and other data challenges requires collaborative efforts among funders, publishers, repositories, societies, and researchers. One example is the Coalition on Publishing Data in the the Earth and space sciences, where most major publishers and repositories have signed a joint statement of commitment (COPDESS.org), and are starting work to direct and link published data to domain repositories. Much work remains to be done. Major challenges include establishing data curation practices into the workflow of science from data collection through peer-review, developing efficient linking of data among repositories and publishers, and establishing common practices regarding minimal and functional requirements for data, code and sample identification and preservation in disparate disciplines, and sustaining the repositories.",

            "abstract": "Over 200 cities throughout the U.S. are undergoing the painful and expensive transition from Combined Sewer Outflows (CSOs) to modern stormwater systems. The infrastructure of CSOs is frequently a century old, with a design adapted to stormwater conditions of smaller, more pervious cities. Normal rainfall events of less 1 cm per hour can now exceed the CSO capacities in many urban sub-watersheds, leading to streamwater conditions that exceed human health standards for pathogens. Although much focus has been placed on the plumbing aspects of urban stormwater modernization, less has been focused on local, and indeed regional, implications of nutrient and carbon dynamic changes.\nIndianapolis, Indiana, with a metropolitan population of over 1 million, is a case study of CSO modernization. Most CSO systems in the city were built almost 100 years ago, and the city has experienced classic patterns of growth of impervious surface area, population growth, and enhanced use of chemical fertilizers. The result of these changes has been frequent failure of the CSO system, and release of sewage water into suburban and urban streams, rivers and reservoirs. Driven largely by modern environmental regulations, the city is now “footing the bill” for a century of poor planning and growth, with the real costs seen by ratepayers in the form of steeply growing wastewater fees. The mitigation approach to this problem is largely one of subsurface engineering on a mega scale, with less attention (i.e., money) placed on complementary land-use and nutrient management efforts on the surface. Several examples illustrate the relatively straightforward nature of changing plumbing, in contrast to the complex result of these changes on nutrient pathways, and the implications that this has on oxygenation, nutrient cycling, and carbon release/sequestration dynamics in riparian and urban reservoir systems.",

            "abstract": "Cloud radar Doppler spectra offer much information about cloud processes. By analyzing millimeter radar Doppler spectra from cloud-top to -base in mixed-phase clouds in which super-cooled liquid-layers are present we try to tell the microphysical evolution story of particles that are present by disentangling the contributions of the solid and liquid particles to the total radar returns. Instead of considering vertical profiles, dynamical effects are taken into account by following the particle population evolution along slanted paths which are caused by horizontal advection of the cloud. The goal is to identify regions in which different microphysical processes such as new particle formation (nucleation), water vapor deposition, aggregation, riming, or sublimation occurr. Cloud radar measurements are supplemented by Doppler lidar and Raman lidar observations as well as observations with MWR, wind profiler, and radio sondes. The presence of super-cooled liquid layers is identified by positive liquid water paths in MWR measurements, the vertical location of liquid layers (in non-raining systems and below lidar extinction) is derived from regions of high-backscatter and low depolarization in Raman lidar observations. In collocated cloud radar measurements, we try to identify cloud phase in the cloud radar Doppler spectrum via location of the Doppler peak(s), the existence of multi-modalities or the spectral skewness. Additionally, within the super-cooled liquid layers, the radar-identified liquid droplets are used as air motion tracer to correct the radar Doppler spectrum for vertical air motion w. These radar-derived estimates of w are validated by independent estimates of w from collocated Doppler lidar measurements. A 35 GHz vertically pointing cloud Doppler radar (METEK MIRA-35) in linear depolarization (LDR) mode is used. Data is from the deployment of the Leipzig Aerosol and Cloud Remote Observations System (LACROS) during the Analysis of the Composition of Clouds with Extended Polarization Techniques (ACCEPT) field experiment in Cabauw, Netherlands in Fall 2014. There, another MIRA-35 was operated in simultaneous transmission and simultaneous reception (STSR) mode for obtaining measurements of differential reflectivity (ZDR) and correlation coefficient ρhv.",

            "abstract": "The processes of continental collision that built the Appalachian Mountains are at least partially preserved by the suture between Laurentia and the Gondwanan Suwannee terrane, left behind in the southeastern U.S. by Mesozoic rifting. High resolution imaging of this suture provides insight into collisional deformation, important both to local tectonic history and as case study of continental collision that helps us to understand ancient and active orogenies worldwide.\nWe analyze Sp phases recorded by SESAME (Southeastern Suture of the Appalachian Margin Experiment) and other nearby broadband stations. Sp receiver functions were common conversion point stacked using local crust and mantle velocity models.\nIn the crust, we observe a south-dipping positive velocity gradient with depth (PVG) that extends from the surface to the mid-crust. Further north, we observe a positive/negative gradient pair. These phases exist in eastern and western Georgia, indicating along-strike continuity for at least 170 km. Modeling with synthetic waveforms shows they are not artefacts of shallow sediments.\nThe dipping PVG is spatially correlated with COCORP reflectors that were previously interpreted as a steep suture intersecting the Moho. However, the dip and greater horizontal extent of the PVG leads to a different interpretation: the existence of a large-scale detachment with a down-dip continuity of >330 km. This structure implies significant shortening and underthrusting of deep Laurentian or peri-Gondwanan basement beneath Suwannee crust during the final stages of the collision on a scale comparable to India-Eurasia crustal detachments.\nIn the mantle, we observe a sharp lithosphere-asthenosphere velocity gradient in the northwest part of the study region only, consistent with disruption of lithosphere in the southeast by Mesozoic rifting. Ongoing work with wavefield migration (Bostock et al., 2001) should better resolve discontinuity dips and depths.",

            "abstract": "Dipolarization fronts (DFs) are characterized by a rapid increase in the northward magnetic field component (Bz) and play a crucial role in the energy and magnetic flux transport in the magnetotail. Multispacecraft observations of DFs in a large portion of the magnetotail by e.g. Geotail, Cluster and THEMIS have been reported for over three decades.\nDuring the commissioning phase of MMS we are able to observe DFs at radial distances within 8 Re, which is in a more dipolarized region (well within the flow braking region). We present a statistical study of DFs observed during March-May 2015, using only magnetic field data. First results indicate that the amplitude of the found DFs is greater compared to similar events in the distant tail. Timing analysis yields that many of the DFs propagate tailward, which would suggest a rebound (bouncing) of the DF at the magnetic dipole-dominated near-Earth plasma sheet. Since MMS spacecraft are in a “string-of-pearls” configuration, further analysis is ongoing to evaluate the obtained direction from a simple timing analysis. We compare and contrast the found DFs with that from the DF-eventlist introduced in Schmid et al. [J. Geophys. Res., 2, 120 (2015)], which is based on 9 years (2001-2009) of Cluster magnetotail observations.",

However, the potential value and applicability of these predictions is inescapably linked to their forecast quality.\nThe North-American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) is a multi-agency supported forecasting system for intraseasonal to interannual (ISI) climate predictions. Retrospective forecasts and real-time information are provided by each agency free of charge to facilitate collaborative research efforts for predicting future climate conditions as well as extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. Using the PRISM climate mapping system as the reference data, we examine the skill of five General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the NMME project to forecast monthly and seasonal precipitation and temperature over seven sub-regions of the continental United States.\nFor each model, we quantify the seasonal accuracy of the forecast relative to observed precipitation using the mean square error skill score. This score is decomposed to assess the accuracy of the forecast in the absence of biases (potential skill), and in the presence of conditional (slope reliability) and unconditional (standardized mean error) biases. The quantification of these biases allows us to diagnose each model’s skill over a full range temporal and spatial scales.\nFinally, we test each model’s forecasting skill by evaluating its ability to predict extended periods of extreme temperature and precipitation that were conducive to ‘billion-dollar’ historical flood and drought events in different regions of the continental USA. The forecasting skill of the individual climate models is summarized and presented along with a discussion of different multi-model averaging techniques for predicting such events.",

            "abstract": "Data assimilation (DA) holds considerable potential for improving hydrologic predictions. However, advances in hydrologic DA research have not been adequately or timely implemented in operational forecast systems to improve the skill of forecasts for better informed real-world decision making. Several challenges exist (see Liu et al., 2012). The objective of this paper is to highlight several recent studies on basin scale data assimilation using distributed hydrologic models that touch upon these challenges including application of streamflow data assimilation using different algorithms, combined streamflow/snow data assimilation and the development of a generic linkage of OpenDA and the open source hydrologic package Openstreams/Wflow based on the (emerging) standard Basic Model Interface (BMI) as advocated by CSDMS using cross-platform webservices (i.e. Apache Thrift).\nLiu et al., 2012.

Since 1998, the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP), organically organized using a collective impact approach that fostered these interactions primarily around Earth science interoperability problems. Unlike most collaborations, collective impact initiatives named in 2011 by the Stanford Social Innovation Review, involve a backbone infrastructure, a dedicated staff, and a structured process that leads to a common agenda, shared measurement, continuous communication, and mutually reinforcing activities among all participants. Over the last ten years, the Foundation for Earth Science (FES) has a proven track record of providing backbone support to ESIP. This presentation will cover FES’s general approach to providing backbone support that enables communities to define shared agenda and then will show these practices in two case studies: (1) ESIP at-large as a mature network of developed partnerships and (2) a new project, the Local Community Resilience cluster. This new cluster aims to bridge the gap from the established ESIP network to engage local communities in order to equip citizens, professionals, and other decision-makers with the scientific underpinning necessary to make informed decisions (bounce forward) for society by leveraging the strong existing ESIP community, the backbone capabilities of FES and extending Federal Earth Science, Technology and Innovation Investments.",

As of today, both ATMS and CrIS radiances are well calibrated and the SDR data have reached a validated level for user applications. This study will present the assimilation of ATMS and CrIS data in the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecast Model (HWRF) Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system and the impacts from uses of new satellite data on hurricane track and intensity forecasts in the Western Pacific. A new quality control (QC) approach is developed based on CrIS longwave and shortwave CO2 channels to detect the clouds at different altitudes. The double CO2 bands allow for retrieving the optically thin clouds due to their differential absorption and scattering properties. The cloud masks derived from CrIS double CO2 bands are compared with the current GSI baseline QC algorithm in different cloud regimes. Impacts of an improved QC on the prediction of hurricane and typhoon track and intensity are demonstrated with the 2014 Typhoon cases. Since November 2011, NOAA has begun generating the CrIS full resolution data. The improvements in the quality control from using CrIS full spectral resolution data are expected since an increase in CrIS shortwave channel resolution that is consistent with CrIS longwave resolution can lead to more and better matches in the weighting function heights of those paired CO2 bands and thus more detailed vertical structures of detected clouds. The potential impacts from the CrIS full spectral resolution QC on tropical cyclone forecasts are also assessed.",

            "abstract": "Telluric planet formation involved the settling of large amounts of liquid iron coming from impacting planetesimals into an ambient viscous magma ocean. The initial state of planets was mostly determined by exchanges of heat and elements during this iron rain. Up to now, most models of planet formation simply assume that the metal rapidly equilibrated with the whole mantle. Other models account for simplified dynamics of the iron rain, involving the settling of single size drops at the Stokes velocity. But the fluid dynamics of iron sedimentation is much more complex, and influenced by the large viscosity ratio between the metal and the ambient fluid, as shown in studies of rising gas bubbles (e.g. Bonometti and Magnaudet 2006).\nWe aim at developing a global understanding of the iron rain dynamics. Our study relies on a model experiment, consisting in popping a balloon of heated metal liquid at the top of a tank filled with viscous liquid. The experiments reach the relevant turbulent planetary regime, and tackle the whole range of expected viscosity ratios. High-speed videos allow determining the dynamics of drop clouds, as well as the statistics of drop sizes, shapes, and velocities. We also develop an analytical model of turbulent diffusion during settling, validated by measuring the temperature decrease of the metal blob. We finally present consequences for models of planet formation.",

This study evaluates the utility of in-situ soil moisture observations for drought early warning in the Central United States. Soil moisture was used to identify drought events and results were compared with the U.S. Drought Monitor with respect to the identification of drought onset. Soil moisture observations consistently identify rapid-onset (flash) drought events earlier than the U.S. Drought Monitor. Our results show that soil moisture percentiles can provide a two to three week lead-time over the U.S. Drought Monitor based on flash drought events which occurred in Oklahoma between 2000 and 2013. We conclude in-situ soil moisture observations are an important source of information for early warning of flash drought events in the Central United Staets.",

            "abstract": "Tesserae, areas of high radar backscatter with a highly deformed morphology, are hypothesized to be some of the oldest materials on the surface of Venus, while parabolic crater ejecta deposits are some of the youngest geologic features. Recently, Earth-based radar data were used to make the first detailed maps of crater ejecta deposits within tessera terrains, such as Alpha Regio. In this work, we analyze tesserae using Magellan radar image data based on this new understanding of surface properties, with the goal of extending the technique for identifying crater deposits beyond the coverage of the Earth-based data. Our goals are to define stratigraphic relationships, determine whether there is a non-uniform distribution of crater ejecta within the tesserae, and identify uncontaminated tessera regions as possible future landing sites. We first present detections of ejecta in tesserae from Magellan images of craters also observed in the Earth-based data, then show several tessera regions that have only Magellan coverage but apparently similar surface mantling deposits. Tellus Tessera contains a concentration of low radar backscatter surfaces, in its center and southwest, interpreted as fine-grained ejecta deposits from Bernhardt crater. At Sudenitsa Tessera, located on the northern edge of the Beta-Atla-Themis region, several low backscatter tessera areas occur that are not associated with any obvious impact crater. This suggests that the low-backscatter ejecta were sourced from a crater that was resurfaced in the recent (likely less than 50-100 Ma) past. From these analyses it is evident that crater parabola deposits are non-uniformly distributed in tesserae, and future landing site selection will need to account for the presence of these deposits. Fine-grained deposits in the tesserae may also preserve evidence of ejecta after the parent crater is buried by plains-forming lavas.",

            "abstract": "Aerial imaging methods are a well approved source for mapping lava flows during eruptions and can serve as a base to assess the eruption dynamics and to determine the affected area. However, clouds and smoke often hinder optical systems like the Earth Observation Advanced Land Imager (EO-1-ALI, operated by NASA) to map lava flows properly, which hence affects its reliability. Furthermore, the amount of lava that is extruded during an eruption cannot be determined from optical images – however, it can significantly contribute to assess the accompanying hazard and risk. One way to monitor active lava flows is to quantify the topographic changes over time while using up-to-date high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). Whereas photogrammetric methods still fail when clouds and fume obstruct the sight, innovative radar satellite missions have the potential to generate high-resolution DEMs at any time. The innovative bistatic TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X Add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements) satellite mission enables for the first time generating high-resolution DEMs from synthetic aperture radar satellite data repeatedly with reasonable costs and high resolution. The satellite mission consists of the two nearly identical satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X that build a large synthetic aperture radar interferometer with adaptable across- and along-track baselines aiming to generate topographic information globally. In the present study, we apply the TanDEM-X data to study the lava flows that were emplaced during the 2012-13 Tolbachik, Kamchatka fissure eruption. The eruption was composed of very fluid lava flows that effused along a northeast-southwest trending fissure. We used about fifteen bistatic data pairs to generate DEMs prior to, during, and after the eruption. The differencing of the DEMs enables mapping the lava flow field at different times. This allows measuring the extruded volume and to derive the changes in lava extrusion over time.",

            "abstract": "Tropical Latin America has shown the largest acceleration in land use change in recent decades. It is well established that changes in vegetation cover can lead to changes in water demand, evapotranspiration, and eventually soil textural characteristics. Given the projected changes in the intensity and distribution of rainfall in tropical regions in the coming decades, it is critical to characterize how changes in land use change across different climatic zones may fundamentally reshape water availability and storage, soil composition and associated hydraulic properties, and overall watershed hydrologic behavior. This study evaluates the role of anthropogenic disturbance on hydrological processes across different climatic zones in the tropics. We focus specifically on San Cristobal Island, the second most populated island of the iconic Galapagos archipelago, which is currently undergoing severe anthropogenic transformation. The island contains a spectrum of climates, ranging from very humid to arid, and has seen a dramatic increase in tourism and an increase in the permanent population of greater than 1000% in the last 40 years. Over 70% of the landscape of San Cristobal has been altered by land use change and invasive species. Our study identifies the complex interactions among hydrological, geological, economic, and social variables that tropical island systems will face in the years ahead, and the role and effects of a dynamic hydrologic cycle across multiple scales.",

            "abstract": "Airbursts are events in which small (meters to tens-of-meters in diameter) asteroids deposit most of their energy in the atmosphere with a total energy greater than small nuclear explosions (>0.1 kilotons of TNT). The airburst risk is higher than previous assessments for two reasons. First, they are more frequent than previously thought. The Tunguska-class (~40 meters) population estimate has doubled, and Chelyabinsk-class (~20 meters) has increased by a factor of 2.6. Second, asteroid airbursts are significantly more damaging than previously assumed. In most cases, they more efficiently couple energy to the surface than nuclear explosions of the same yield.\nPast Near-Earth Object (NEO) risk assessments concluded that the largest asteroids (> 1 km) dominated the hazard. Large NEOs represent only a tiny fraction of the population but the potential for global catastrophe means that the contribution from low-probability, high-consequence events is large. Nearly 90% of these objects, none of which is on a collision course, have been catalogued. This has reduced their assessed near-term statistical risk by more than an order of magnitude because completion is highest for the largest and most dangerous. The relative risk from small objects would therefore be increasing even if their absolute assessed risk were not.\nUncertainty in the number of small NEOs remains large and can only be reduced by expanded surveys. One strategy would be to count small NEOs making close passes in statistically significant numbers. For example, there are about 25 times as many objects of a given size that pass within the distance of geosynchronous orbit than collide with the earth, and 2000 times as many pass within a lunar distance (accounting for gravitational focusing). An asteroid the size of the Chelyabinsk impactor (~20 m) could potentially be observed within geosynchronous orbit every two years and within lunar orbit nearly once a week. A Tunguska-sized asteroid (~40 m) passes within a lunar distance several times a year. A survey optimized to discover and count these objects would rapidly reduce the uncertainty in their populations. An additional benefit would be early warning of an imminent impact to give authorities time to issue evacuation or take-cover instructions in circumstances for which there would be no time the prevent an impact.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of 3He/4He > 0.1*Ra (where Ra = 3He/4He in Earth's atmosphere) in geothermal fluids are conventionally taken to represent derivation from a mantle source. 3He/4He values < 0.1*Ra are taken to represent only radiogenic helium with no modern mantle input (the canonical 3He/4He ratio for the crust is 0.02*Ra). Upward transport rates are hard to constrain, but transit times of 3He through the crust in a CO2-rich carrier fluid may be as short as a few years, so 3He/4He measurements offer a proxy for mantle temperature on geologically short time-scales. In Tibet, enhanced 3He/4He ratios could in principle represent (1) incipient partial melt of Indian lithospheric mantle; (2) of Asian lithospheric mantle; (3) upwelling asthenosphere north of underthrust India or along tears in the subducting Indian plate; and/or (4) high-T prograde metamorphism releasing previously trapped 3He from older, voluminous mafic/ultramafic rocks in the crust.\nWe present data from our recent field campaigns and our compilations from the western and Chinese literature. Any individual observation of 3He/4He > 0.1*Ra may still be argued to result from mantle-derived 3He previously stored in the crust. However, our growing regional database of widely spaced observations of 3He/4He > 0.1*Ra, from the Karakoram Fault in the west to the Sangri-Cona rift and Yalaxiangbo Dome in the east, and from south of the Yarlung-Zangbo suture (YZS) to north of the Banggong-Nujiang suture, makes such special pleading increasingly implausible. The observation of 3He/4He > 0.1*Ra at the YZS and even within the Tethyan Himalaya south of the YZS cannot represent melting of Indian mantle close to the Moho unless existing thermal models are grossly in error. The source of 3He close to the YZS is likely either asthenosphere accessed by faults and shear zones that cut through subducting Indian lithospheric mantle; or incipient melt of Asian lithospheric mantle at the Moho north of the northern edge of underthrust India (the “mantle suture”) which must therefore lie close to the YZS. Thus far we have barely tapped the rich potential that helium-isotope data offer for understanding transit of mantle volatiles through some of Earth's thickest (and ductilely flowing) crust.",

            "abstract": "Maar-diatreme volcanoes in their simplest form are thought to result primarily from discrete, subsurface phreatomagmatic explosions. Tephra ring deposits around maar craters are commonly interpreted in terms of a framework wherein explosions begin at shallow levels and migrate downward, ejecting progressively deeper-seated lithic clasts that contribute to the tephra rings. Additionally, variations in grain size of the deposits are sometimes inferred to record different degrees of fragmentation, which are in turn related to variations in magma-water ratios at the explosion sites. Recent detailed studies of diatremes and of maar tephra rings suggest a different conceptual model wherein explosions can happen at various vertical and lateral locations within a diatreme during its eruptive lifetime, rather than being limited to simple downward migration. Experiments, numerical modeling, and field data indicate that most explosions deeper than about 200-250 m will not vent to the surface, but instead contribute to mixing within the diatremes. Arrival of deep-seated lithics at the surface is related to this mixing process. Experiments also indicate that explosion phenomena can result in a range of emplacement mechanisms and grain sizes in tephra rings, even in the absence of variations in explosion mechanisms (fragmentation efficiency). Here we document the tephra ring of Stracciacappa maar (central Italy), and interpret its eruption and emplacement history in terms of evolving conceptual models along with a comparison to more traditional interpretations. The Stracciacappa deposits include a range of depositional facies and grain sizes that could be related to different combinations of explosion energy, depth, and crater geometry. Lithic abundances are quite variable, including within individual beds, and are consistent with eruption of debris jet deposits from a diatreme beneath the maar. Because most elements of both conceptual models are viable, the work points to an important need to develop criteria to distinguish between the various inferred mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Surface mining is a common method of accessing coal. In high-elevation environments, vegetation and soils are typically removed prior to the blasting of overburden rock, thereby allowing access to mineable ore. Following this, the removed overburden rock is deposited in adjacent valleys as waste rock spoils. Previous research has identified that areas downstream of surface coal mining have impaired water quality, yet there is limited information about the interaction of hydrology and geochemistry across a range of mining conditions, particularly at the headwater scale. Here, we provide an analysis of an extensive long-term data set of geochemistry and flows across a gradient of coal mining in the Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada. This work is part of a broader R&D program examining the influence of surface coal mining on hydrological and water quality responses in the Elk Valley aimed at informing effective management responses. Results indicate that water from waste rock piles has an ionic profile distinct from unimpacted catchments. While the concentration of geochemicals increased with the degree of mine impact, the control of hydrological transport capacity over geochemical export did not vary with degree of mine impact. Geochemical export in mine-influenced catchments was limited more strongly by transport capacity than supply, implying that more water moving through the waste rock mobilized more geochemicals. Placement of waste rock within the catchment (headwaters or outlet) did not affect chemical concentrations but did alter the timing with which chemically distinct water mixed. This work advances on results reported earlier using empirical models of selenium loading and further highlights the importance of limiting water inputs into waste rock piles.",

            "abstract": "The Cassini RADAR is a versatile instrument capable of operating in imaging, altimetry, scatterometry, radiometry, and, most recently, sounding modes. Despite vastly different material properties and environmental conditions, Titan’s methane-based hydrologic system drives climatic and geologic processes that result in morphologic features with striking similarity to terrestrial counterparts, including vast equatorial dune fields, well-organized channel networks that route material through erosional and depositional landscapes defining source-to-sink sediment transport systems, and, perhaps most astonishingly, lakes and seas filled with liquid hydrocarbons.\nUsing its various operating modes, the Cassini RADAR has provided a wealth of information regarding Titan’s active surface-atmosphere system. In Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode, the RADAR has unveiled Titan’s surface by producing backscatter maps with pixel scales of ~300 m. In altimetry mode, the RADAR has shown the elevation profile of surface features, including the liquid elevation of Titan’s lakes and seas, revealed the roughness characteristics of the surface, and constrained the global shape. Most recently, the altimetry mode has doubled as a radar sounder that has successfully probed the depth and absorptivity of the lakes and seas. Data from the scatterometry and radiometry modes have been used to constrain material properties, including dielectric constants and volume scattering fractions, surface texture, and derive seasonal and diurnal temperature variations. Collectively, these datasets have revealed Titan’s strange yet familiar nature, and demonstrated that it is one of the most compelling targets in our solar system. During our presentation, we will summarize these capabilities and review some of the most specular discoveries made by the Cassini RADAR.",

            "abstract": "Variability in the fraction of biogenic sulfide that is reoxidized back to sulfate has played a role in regulating redox budgets and oxygen levels in the ocean-atmosphere system throughout Earth history. In the modern, well-oxygenated ocean, 75-90% of sulfide produced by microbial sulfate reduction is reoxidized back to sulfate. At present, the areal extent of seafloor overlain by euxinic (i.e., anoxic and sulfidic) water is very low (<0.6%). However, geological evidence suggests that euxinia was much more common in ancient oceans. In theory, the presence of sulfide in the water column could induce higher reoxidation rates, as the delivery of oxidants is less transport limited in solution than when the chemocline is in sediments. In order to better understand these sorts of systematics and place isotopic constraints on this cycling, we present sulfur and oxygen isotope geochemistry in four modern euxinic systems. To interpret these data, we further develop a one-dimensional, depth-dependent geochemical model to estimate sulfide reoxidation rates in euxinic systems and evaluate model results in the context of geochemical and isotopic information. From these results, we determine that the percent of sulfide that is reoxidized back to sulfate is quite low (~11-42%). Given the proximity to overlying, fully oxygenated waters, this suggests that vertical exchange is significantly muted. This is in some sense surprising, but also consistent with the observation that sulfide is indeed allowed to accumulate in the bottom waters. We explore how water column density stratification and lateral transport influence reoxidation rates in these coastal ponds. We further pursue how these results can be extrapolated to the global ocean of times past.",

Where surface water availability is not sufficient or consistent, groundwater is often the resource of choice for agriculture, industry, and municipal and domestic uses. However, unlike lake levels, aquifer levels are unseen and are not easily measured. This can create the illusion of an infinite water source and impede efforts to monitor and conserve groundwater. Moreover, even where depth-to-water measurements do exist, they often are not digitized, centralized, and accessible. The GRACE satellites are a partial solution to this problem, enabling space-based estimates of groundwater variability at regional scales that are not limited by political boundaries. Here we discuss emerging trends in groundwater storage around the world based on GRACE observations and how they can be combined with other information in order attribute these apparent trends and support sub-regional scale analyses of changing groundwater availability.",

            "abstract": "Blueschist samples were experimented on a Griggs, a piston-cylinder (PC) and a D-DIA apparatus. Starting materials were sieved powders (<30 µm) from a natural sample collected on Alpine Corsica which initially contained approx. 60 % glaucophane and 40 % lawsonite. After mineral separation, we produced powders with a high (80 % glaucophane, 20 % lawsonite) and a low (30 % glaucophane, 70 % lawsonite) glaucophane content. Samples of cold-pressed powders of the two compositions were deformed in the Griggs and D-DIA apparatus at low temperatures (<550 °C) at which lawsonite is stable but glaucophane should decompose into jadeite and talc, and at high temperatures (up to 850 °C) at which lawsonite dehydrates. Powders were also isostatically annealed at comparable experimental conditions in the PC-apparatus to provide a microstructural reference.\nThe use of synchrotron X-rays during the D-DIA experiments enables us to follow the strain evolution (radiography) while deforming the sample, but also to monitor phase changes in-situ using X-ray diffraction. We also monitored acoustic emissions (AE). Depending on the sample mineralogy and the applied pressure, AEs were either observed at low temperature around 380-420 °C or in a range from 610-850 °C. In some samples AEs were triggered in both ranges. Microstructural observations (SEM, Raman, Microprobe, X-ray tomography) on retrieved samples reveal that samples deformed under deviatoric stress exhibit faults almost exclusively, whereas those under hydrostatic conditions do not.\nOur preliminary interpretation of stress, strain, microstructural and mineralogical evolution during deformation, is that the two temperature ranges of AE activity correspond to transformational faulting due to the glaucophane breakdown into jadeite and talc and lawsonite dehydration. We interpret these micro-earthquakes as possible laboratory analogs of intermediate depth earthquakes occurring within the upper Wadati-Benioff plane of seismicity observed between 60 and 100 km deep in cold subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "In the inner magnetosphere where the plasmasphere, ring current and radiation belts co-exist, energy and momentum are exchanged between different plasma populations by plasma waves. Resonant interaction with these waves can lead to rapid loss of radiation belt and ring current electrons to the atmosphere. Recent work is rapidly expanding our understanding of energetic (~20 keV - 10 MeV) electron precipitation. In particular, the combination of BARREL multi-point balloon measurements with measurements from equatorial spacecraft (e.g. Van Allen Probes, LANL, THEMIS, GOES), LEO spacecraft (e.g. POES, CSSWE), and ground-based instruments (e.g. riometer, VLF) is providing a unique opportunity to study wave-particle interactions, and to quantify the spatial scale of energetic precipitation. We present a summary of recent results from BARREL combined with in situ measurements to quantitatively test models of wave-particle interactions. We also show combined BARREL and ground-based data that probes the spatial structure and evolution of relativistic precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The July 2015 New Horizons flyby has removed a long-standing obstacle to understanding the cosmogony of the Pluto-Charon system: the uncertain radius of Pluto. Combined with precise astrometric fits to the barycenter of the Pluto-Charon binary from HST observations of the more distant, small satellites (M. Brozović et al., Icarus 246, 317–329, 2015), the densities of both Pluto and Charon are now known. At the 10% level, the densities of Pluto and Charon are rather similar, as opposed to the more divergent density estimates of years past in which Charon was thought to be substantially icier. In the context of a giant impact origin for binaries, a rock-poor Charon corresponds to an iron-poor Moon in the terrestrial case, with differentiated precursors being implied in both cases. A rock-rich Charon, however, implies that the precursor impacting bodies were at most only partially differentiated — possessing relatively thin ice shells (R.M. Canup, Astron. J. 141, 35, 2011). This suggests some combination of relatively slow and/or late accretion in the ancestral Kuiper belt. A more rock-rich Charon also implies a more vigorous geological history, all other things being equal. For Pluto, the evolution to the surface of a substantial mass of supervolatile ices increases the likelihood that internal volatiles such as ammonia and methanol have been sequestered in an internal, aqueous layer (or ocean).",

            "abstract": "As part of the NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) Program, the University of Maryland has produced 1m resolution forest canopy cover and height maps that have been provided to the State of Maryland. The project used existing, wall-to-wall airborne lidar coverage combined with other remote sensing and field datasets to produce countywide maps of carbon stocks and their uncertainties at 30 m resolution as well as the 1m canopy maps. In this paper, we examine what purposes we identified for the data for decision making in climate mitigation, what use it has already seen, and what potential there is in the future for using the data. The State of Maryland has three programs focused on maintaining or increasing forest cover as part of its Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Program (GHGRP) program enacted in 2012, including Woodland Incentive Program (WIP), the Lawn to Woodland Initiative (L2W), and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Forest canopy data from CMS were examined the prospects for both adoption and carbon sequestration of these three initiatives, and their effects on the overall success of the GHGRP. We found that it was difficult it is to pin down “value” that is directly attributable to the data, although we found the data to be important in recognizing the nature and extent of the carbon problem, and in identifying potential solutions to addressing the problem. As in many decision-making contexts, having high quality, accurate data on forest cover is necessary but not sufficient for effective, affordable programs that lead to carbon sequestration in the state.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are of fundamental importance in the dynamics of the atmospheric circulation and the climate system.\nThey are often observed to develop over significant terrain, in ambient shear flows in midlatitudes and embedded within the Madden Julian oscillation (MJO) and convectively coupled equatorial wave (CCEW) envelopes and in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Yet, general circulation models (GCM) fail to resolve these systems and the underlying convective parameterizations are not directed to represent such flows. Shear-parallel MCSs, which are common in the ITCZ, have a three-dimensional structure and as such present a serious modelling challenge. Here, a previously developed multicloud model (MCM) is modified to parameterize MCSs. One of the main modifications is the parameterization of stratiform condensation to capture extended stratiform outflows, which characterize MCSs, due to strong upper level jets. Linear analysis shows that under the influence of a typical double African and equatorial jet shear flow, this modification results in an additional new scale-selective instability peaking at the meso-alpha scale of roughly 400 km. Nonlinear simulations conducted with the modified MCM on a 400 km by 400 km doubly periodic domain, without rotation, resulted in the spontaneous transition from a quasi-two dimensional shear perpendicular convective system, consistent with linear theory, to a fully three dimensional flow structure. The simulation is characterized by shear parallel bands of convection, moving slowly eastward, embedded in stratiform systems that expand perpendicularly and propagate westward with the upper level jet. The mean circulation and the implications for the domain averaged vertical transport of momentum and potential temperature are discussed.",

Previous the plasma density increase in this sector was referred to as the “dusk effect” and more recently the “storm enhanced density”. Certainly in some longitude sectors, if the increase in magnetospheric convection occurs at the appropriate Universal Time, the activity does not need to be particularly strong to produce a significant increase in plasma content, such as during the February 27th 2014 event when Kp reached only 6 but there was substantial loss of the FAA WAAS system. The March 2015 St. Patrick’s Day storm was considerably more intense with respect to Kp and Dst, and different in timing and duration, so the response and longitude sectors affected were quite different. Numerical simulation of the St. Patrick’s Day storm with a coupled thermosphere-ionosphere model (CTIPe) and a stand-alone ionosphere-plasmasphere code (IPE) can be used to understand the physical processes in the plasma and neutral response. In particular the focus is on the vertical distribution of the plasma from the F-region to the topside. The models can be used to assess the impact of electric fields, meridional neutral winds, and solar illumination aiding plasma buildup and storage, neutral composition creating depletions, and magnetospheric convection creating structure.",

            "abstract": "GRACE provides monthly average gravity field solutions in spherical harmonic coefficients, which gives us information about land and ocean mass variations with a spatial resolution of 1 degree and with an accuracy within 2 cm throughout the entire Earth. GRACE-FO is expected to be launched in 2017 to continue the work of GRACE and to test a new laser ranging interferometer (LRI) which measures the range between the two satellites with higher precision than the K-Band ranging system used in GRACE. Moreover, there have been simulation studies that show that an additional pair of satellites in an inclined orbit increases the sampling frequency and reduces temporal aliasing errors. On the other hand, GOCE used an electrostatic gravity gradiometer and a drag-free control system to compensate for the non-gravitational forces which had better performance than the electrostatic accelerometers of GRACE. Given the fact that future missions will likely continue to use the low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking formation with LRI onboard, it is expected that acceleration noise caused by non-gravitational forces will become a limiting factor for the time-varying gravity field solution. This research evaluates the effects of acceleration noise on the estimation of the time-varying gravity field for a single pair and the optimal double pairs of satellites, assuming that the satellites fly in collinear pairs with LRI. Spherical harmonic coefficients are used to represent the solution and a batch computation Kalman filter is used to estimate the solutions. Various levels of residual noise for existing drag-free systems are applied as acceleration noise to find suitable drag-free performance requirements for upcoming geodesy missions.",

The results show a significant increase in basin wide anthropogenic carbon storage in the North Atlantic, which absorbed 4.4± 1.2 Pg C/decade from 2003 – 2014 compared to 1.9 ± 1 Pg C/decade for the 1989 – 2003 period. This decadal variability is attributed to changing ventilation patterns associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and increasing release of anthropogenic carbon into the atmosphere. There are small changes in the uptake rate of CO2 in the South Atlantic for these time periods, but within the uncertainty. Several eddies are identified that transport 20% more anthropogenic carbon than the surrounding waters in the South Atlantic showing the importance of eddies in transporting anthropogenic carbon. The uptake of carbon results in a decrease in pH of ~0.0021 ± 0.0007 yr-1 for surface waters during the last 10 years, in line with the atmospheric increase in CO2.",

            "abstract": "Scientific and end-user collaboration on operational flood risk modelling and forecasting requires an environment where scientists and end-users can physically work together and demonstrate, enhance and learn about new tools, methods and models for forecasting and warning purposes. Therefore, Deltares has built a real-time demonstration, training and research infrastructure (‘operational’ room and ICT backend). This research infrastructure supports various functions like (1) Real time response and disaster management, (2) Training, (3) Collaborative Research, (4) Demonstration. The research infrastructure will be used for a mixture of these functions on a regular basis by Deltares and a multitude of both scientists as well as end users such as universities, research institutes, consultants, governments and aid agencies. This infrastructure facilitates emergency advice and support during international and national disasters caused by rainfall, tropical cyclones or tsunamis. It hosts research flood and storm surge forecasting systems for global/continental/regional scale. It facilitates training for emergency & disaster management (along with hosting forecasting system user trainings in for instance the forecasting platform Delft-FEWS) both internally and externally. The facility is expected to inspire and initiate creative innovations by bringing together different experts from various organizations. The room hosts interactive modelling developments, participatory workshops and stakeholder meetings. State of the art tools, models and software, being applied across the globe are available and on display within the facility. We will present the Id-Lab in detail and we will put particular focus on the global operational forecasting systems GLOFFIS (Global Flood Forecasting Information System) and GLOSSIS (Global Storm Surge Information System).",

            "abstract": "Ice-shelf buttressing is a major control on the rate of ice discharged from fast-flowing ice streams that drain the Antarctic Ice Sheet. The collapse of an ice shelf can lead to dramatic acceleration and thinning of the ice streams and glaciers that flowed into the former shelf. The magnitude of the buttressing force depends on the shelf geometry and confinement. This geometry is determined by the ice-shelf extent, resulting from retreat due to iceberg calving and shelf advance due to flow. In contrast to large-scale ice-sheet models, which require high resolution datasets, we aim to gain insight using simple idealized models, focusing on the transition from lateral confinement to non-confinement. By considering a confined shelf with lateral shear stresses controlling the flow, steady-state analytical solutions can be calculated. These solutions are then compared to a numerical model for a confined flow, which incorporates both shear and extensional stresses. A boundary layer close to the calving front is identified, where both extensional and shear stresses control the dynamics. We test these idealized models against fluid-mechanical laboratory experiments, designed to simulate the flow of an ice shelf in a narrow channel. From these experiments velocity fields and altimetry for the ice-shelf are collected, allowing for comparison with the theoretical models and geophysical data.",

These data are processed by GINA, and the resulting imagery is delivered in near real-time to the National Weather Service (NWS) in Alaska for use in weather analysis and forecasting. The VIIRS’ Day-Night Band (DNB) produces what is functionally visible imagery at night and has been used extensively by operational meteorologists in Alaska, especially during the prolonged darkness of the arctic winter.\nThe DNB has proven to be a powerful tool when combined with other observational and model data sets and has offered NWS meteorologists a more complete picture of weather processes in a region where coverage from surface-based observations is generally poor. Thanks to its high latitude, Alaska benefits from much more frequent coverage in time by polar orbiting satellites such as SNPP and its DNB channel. Also, the sparse population of Alaska and the vast stretches of ocean that surround Alaska on three sides allow meteorological and topographical signatures to be detected by the DNB with minimal interference from anthropogenic sources of light. Examples of how the DNB contributes to the NWS’ forecast process in Alaska will be presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Global climate models (GCMs) are large computer codes based on the discretization of the equations of atmospheric and oceanic motions coupled to various processes of transfer of heat, moisture and other constituents between land, atmosphere, and oceans. Because of computing power limitations, typical GCM grid resolution is on the order of 100 km and the effects of many physical processes, occurring on smaller scales, on the climate system are represented through various closure recipes known as parameterizations. The parameterization of convective motions and many processes associated with cumulus clouds such as the exchange of latent heat and cloud radiative forcing are believed to be behind much of uncertainty in GCMs. Based on a lattice particle interacting system, the stochastic multicloud model (SMCM) provide a novel and efficient representation of the unresolved variability in GCMs due to organized tropical convection and the cloud cover.\nIt is widely recognized that stratiform heating contributes significantly to tropical rainfall and to the dynamics of tropical convective systems by inducing a front-to-rear tilt in the heating profile. Stratiform anvils forming in the wake of deep convection play a central role in the dynamics of tropical mesoscale convective systems. Here, aquaplanet simulations with a warm pool like surface forcing, based on a coarse-resolution GCM , of\n∼\n170 km grid mesh, coupled with SMCM, are used to demonstrate the importance of stratiform heating for the organization of convection on planetary and intraseasonal scales. When some key model parameters are set to produce higher stratiform heating fractions, the model produces low-frequency and planetary-scale Madden Julian oscillation (MJO)-like wave disturbances while lower to moderate stratiform heating fractions yield mainly synoptic-scale convectively coupled Kelvin-like waves. Rooted from the stratiform instability, it is conjectured here that the strength and extent of stratiform downdrafts are key contributors to the scale selection of convective organizations perhaps with mechanisms that are in essence similar to those of mesoscale convective systems.",

These receivers straddle active crustal faults, volcanoes and landslides, the magnitude-9 Cascadia and northeastern Alaskan subduction zones and their attendant tsunamigenic regions along the Pacific coast. Around the circum-Pacific, there are hundreds more and the number is growing steadily as real-time networks proliferate. Despite offering the potential for sub-cm positioning accuracy in real-time useful for a broad array of hazards mitigation, these GPS stations are only now being incorporated into routine seismic, tsunami, volcanic, land-slide, space-weather, or meterologic monitoring.\nWe will discuss NASA’s READI (Real-time Earthquake Analysis for DIsasters) initiative. This effort is focussed on developing all aspects of real-time GPS for hazards mitigation, from establishing international data-sharing agreements to improving basic positioning algorithms. READI’s long-term goal is to expand real-time GPS monitoring throughout the circum-Pacific as overseas data become freely available, so that it may be adopted by NOAA, USGS and other operational agencies responsible for natural hazards monitoring. Currently ~100 stations are being jointly processed by CWU and Scripps Inst. of Oceanography for algorithm comparison and downstream merging purposes. The resultant solution streams include point-position estimates in a global reference frame every second with centimeter accuracy, ionospheric total electron content and tropospheric zenith water content. These solutions are freely available to third-party agencies over several streaming protocols to enable their incorporation and use in hazards monitoring. This number will ramp up to ~400 stations over the next year. We will also discuss technical efforts underway to develop a variety of downstream applications of the real-time position streams, including the ability to broadcast solutions to thousands of users in real time, earthquake finite-fault and tsunami excitation estimations, and several user interfaces, both stand-alone client and browser-based, that allow interaction with both real-time position streams and their derived products.",

Its role is to continue western hemisphere satellite coverage while the existing GOES series winds down its 20-year operation. However, instruments on the next generation GOES-R satellite series will provide major improvements to the current GOES, both in the frequency of images acquired and the spectral and spatial resolution of the images, providing a perfect conduit for STEM education. Most of these improvements will be provided by the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). ABI will provide three times more spectral information, four times the spatial resolution, and more than five times faster temporal coverage than the current GOES. Another exciting addition to the GOES-R satellite series will be the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM). The all new GLM on GOES-R will measure total lightning activity continuously over the Americas and adjacent ocean regions with near uniform spatial resolution of approximately 10 km! Due to ABI, GLM and improved spacecraft calibration and navigation, the next generation GOES-R satellite series will usher in an exciting era of satellite applications and opportunities for STEM education. This session will present and demonstrate exciting next-gen imagery advancements and new HTML5 WebApps that demonstrate STEM connections to these improvements. Participants will also be invited to join the GOES-R Education Proving Ground, a national network of educators who will receive stipends to attend 4 webinars during the spring of 2016, pilot a STEM lesson plan, and organize a school-wide launch awareness event.",

            "abstract": "Air temperature is a key input variable in ecological and hydrological models for simulating the hydrological cycle and water budget. Several global reanalysis products have been developed at different organizations, which provide gridded air temperature datasets at resolutions ranging from 0.25º to 2.5º (or 27.8 – 278.3 km at the equator). However, gridded air temperature products at a high-resolution (≤1 km) are available only for limited areas of the world. To meet the needs for global eco-hydrological modeling, we aim to produce a continuous daily air temperature datasets at 1-km resolution for the global coverage. In this study, we developed a technique that spatially disaggregates the 0.25º Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) daily air temperature data to 30-arcsec (0.928 km at the equator) resolution by integrating the GLDAS data with the 30-arcsec WorldClim 1950 - 2000 monthly normal air temperature data. The method was tested using the GLDAS and Worldclim maximum and minimum air temperature datasets from 2002 and 2010 for the conterminous Unites States and Africa. The 30-arcsec disaggregated GLDAS (GLDASd) air temperature dataset retains the mean values of the original GLDAS data, while adding spatial variabilities inherited from the Worldclim data. A great improvement in GLDAS disaggregation is shown in mountain areas where complex terrain features have strong impact on temperature. We validated the disaggregation method by comparing the GLDASd product with daily meteorological observations archived by the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) datasets. Additionally, the 30-arcsec TopoWX daily air temperature product was used to compare with the GLDASd data for the conterminous United States. The proposed data disaggregation method provides a convenient and efficient tool for generating a global high-resolution air temperature dataset, which will be beneficial to global eco-hydrological modeling and particularly useful for developing countries where high-resolution meteorological data are unavailable.",

Sites include legacy mill sites associated with U extraction now managed by the Department of Energy and thousands of waste dumps associated with U exploration, mining, and processing. Recently (2012), over 400,000 hectares of federally managed land in northern Arizona was withdrawn from consideration of mining for a 20-year period to protect the Grand Canyon watershed from potentially adverse effects of U mineral exploration and development. Ore from active and recently active U mines in the Colorado Plateau, the Henry Mountains Complex, and the Arizona Strip is transported to the only currently (2015) active conventional mill site in the western United States, located in Utah. Previous and ongoing U.S. Geological Survey assessments to examine U mobility at a variety of legacy and active sites associated with ore exploration, extraction, and processing will be presented as field-scale examples. Topics associated with site investigations will include: (1) offsite migration of radionuclides associated with the operation of the White Mesa U mill; (2) long-term contaminant transport from legacy U waste dumps on Bureau of Land Management regulated land in Utah; (3) application of incremental soil sampling techniques to determine pre- and post-mining radionuclide levels associated with planned and operating U mines in northern Arizona; (4) application of fiber optic digital temperature sensing equipment to identify areas where shallow groundwater containing elevated U levels may be discharging to a river adjacent to a reclaimed mill site in central Wyoming; and (5) field-scale manipulation of groundwater chemistry to limit U migration from a legacy upgrader site in southeastern Utah.",

While the technique is powerful, the existing workflow for completing null-space monte carlo is cumbersome, requiring the use of multiple commandline utilities, several sets of intermediate files and even a text editor. pyNSMC is an open-source python module that automates the workflow of null-space monte carlo uncertainty analyses. The module is fully compatible with the PEST and PEST++ software suites and leverages existing functionality of pyEMU, a python framework for linear-based uncertainty analyses. pyNSMC greatly simplifies the existing workflow for null-space monte carlo by taking advantage of object oriented design facilities in python. The core of pyNSMC is the ensemble class, which draws and stores realized random vectors and also provides functionality for exporting and visualizing results. By relieving users of the tedium associated with file handling and command line utility execution, pyNSMC instead focuses the user on the important steps and assumptions of null-space monte carlo analysis. Furthermore, pyNSMC facilitates learning through flow charts and results visualization, which are available at many points in the algorithm. The ease-of-use of the pyNSMC workflow is compared to the existing workflow for null-space monte carlo for a synthetic groundwater model with hundreds of estimable parameters.",

            "abstract": "The depth and distribution of crystallization at mid-ocean ridges controls the overall architecture of the oceanic crust, influences hydrothermal circulation, and determines geothermal gradients in the crust and uppermost mantle. Despite this, there is no overall consensus on how crystallization is distributed within the crust/upper mantle or how this varies with spreading rate. Here, we examine crustal accretion at mid-ocean ridges by combining crystallization pressures calculated from major element barometers on mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glasses with vapor-saturation pressures from melt inclusions to produce a detailed map of crystallization depths and distributions along the global ridge system. We calculate pressures of crystallization from >11,500 MORB glasses from the global ridge system using two established major element barometers (1,2). Additionally, we use vapor-saturation pressures from >400 olivine-hosted melt inclusions from five ridges with variable spreading rates to constrain pressures and distributions of crystallization along the global ridge system. We show that (i) crystallization depths from MORB glasses increase and become less focused with decreasing spreading rate, (ii) maximum glass pressures are greater than the maximum melt inclusion pressure, which indicates that the melt inclusions do not record the deepest crystallization at mid-ocean ridges, and (iii) crystallization occurs in the lower crust/upper mantle at all ridges, indicating accretion is distributed throughout the crust at all spreading rates, including those with a steady-state magma lens. Finally, we suggest that the remarkably similar maximum vapor-saturation pressures (~ 3000 bars) in melt inclusion from all spreading rates reflects the CO2 content of the depleted upper mantle feeding the global mid-ocean ridge system.

            "abstract": "Beginning September 4, 2010, with a Mw 7.1 earthquake, a multi-year earthquake sequence changed life in Canterbury NZ. Information communicated by a core group of university-based earthquake scientists provided accessible information to the general public, the press, and policy makers. Although at the start of this prolonged sequence, no one anticipated its longevity nor its impact, this initial (and largest) event did catalyze a demand from the public and policy makers for information and led to some important lessons in how to communicate science to a broad audience as an event unfolds and when it is personally important to the general public. Earthquakes are neither new nor rare to New Zealand, but the Christchurch area was seen as likely suffering only from the far-field effects of a major earthquake on the Alpine Fault or Marlborough fault system. Policy makers had planned and expected that another city such as Wellington would be where they would need to respond. As a visiting faculty at the University of Canterbury, with expertise in earthquake science, I was entrained and engaged in the response - both the scientific and communication aspects. It soon became clear that formal press releases and statements from government ministries and agencies did little to address the questions and uncertainties that the public, the press, and even the policy makers had. Rather, a series of public lectures, broad ranging discussions with the media (both print and radio/television), and OpEd pieces provided by this small group of earthquake focused faculty at the University of Canterbury provided the background information, best estimates of what could occur in the future, and why Earth was acting as it was. This filled a critical gap in science information going to the public, and helped build a level of trust in the public that became critically needed after the situation escalated with subsequent damaging events through early-mid 2011, and onward.",

            "abstract": "Hydrometeorological data in the rain-to-snow transition zone are often limited, and better observations are needed to improve the understanding of complex hydrological and biological processes in this climatically sensitive region. We present a complete hydrometeorological dataset for water years 2004 through 2014 for a watershed that spans the rain-snow transition zone. The Johnston Draw watershed (1.8 km2), ranging from 1486 – 1869 m in elevation, is a sub-watershed of the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory and is located in southwestern Idaho. The dataset includes continuous hourly hydrometeorological variables across the elevational gradient spanning the rain-to-snow zone on north- and south-facing slopes, including air temperature, relative humidity and snow depth from 11 sites in the watershed. We also present hourly measurements of solar radiation, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and soil moisture and temperature at selected stations. In addition, the dataset includes hourly stream discharge measurements at the watershed outlet. Our quality assurance procedures include applying the World Meteorological Organization’s standards to flag erroneous data points and filling data gaps using multiple linear regression with data from surrounding sites. We are currently using these data to model snow accumulation, melt, and hydrological response in the rain-to-snow transition under current and future climate warming and precipitation scenarios. Our work provides the scientific community with a dataset useful for interdisciplinary modeling applications that require meteorological observations, stream discharge, and other hydrological parameters to run and validate models. This will allow for better representation and understanding of the complex processes that occur in the rain-to-snow transition zone.",

            "abstract": "This study describes a method based on simultaneous absorbance and fluorescence excitation-emission mapping for rapidly and accurately monitoring dissolved organic carbon concentration and disinfection by-product formation potential for surface water sourced drinking water treatment. The method enables real-time monitoring of the Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), absorbance at 254 nm (UVA), the Specific UV Absorbance (SUVA) as well as the Simulated Distribution System Trihalomethane (THM) Formation Potential (SDS-THMFP) for the source and treated water among other component parameters. The method primarily involves Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) decomposition of the high and lower molecular weight humic and fulvic organic component concentrations. The DOC calibration method involves calculating a single slope factor (with the intercept fixed at 0 mg/l) by linear regression for the UVA divided by the ratio of the high and low molecular weight component concentrations. This method thus corrects for the changes in the molecular weight component composition as a function of the source water composition and coagulation treatment effects. The SDS-THMFP calibration involves a multiple linear regression of the DOC, organic component ratio, chlorine residual, pH and alkalinity. Both the DOC and SDS-THMFP correlations over a period of 18 months exhibited adjusted correlation coefficients with r2 > 0.969. The parameters can be reported as a function of compliance rules associated with required % removals of DOC (as a function of alkalinity) and predicted maximum contaminant levels (MCL) of THMs. The single instrument method, which is compatible with continuous flow monitoring or grab sampling, provides a rapid (2-3 minute) and precise indicator of drinking water disinfectant treatability without the need for separate UV photometric and DOC meter measurements or independent THM determinations.",

            "abstract": "Our abilities to observe and image the deformational behavior of the upper plate in subduction zones has dramatically improved, concurrently with a series of great (Mw 8.0+) earthquakes. Inferences from these observations include patterns of apparent lateral variations in locking along subduction zones, which differs from interseismic to coseismic periods; the significant magnitude and longevity of post-earthquake deformation; and incompatibilities between rates of slip deficit accumulation, recurrence intervals, and resulting earthquake co-seismic slip. In sync with these improved observations, modeling capabilities have evolved from fitting simple elastic accumulation/rebound curves to sparse data to having spatially dense continuous time series that allow us to infer details of plate boundary coupling, rheology-driven transient deformation, and partitioning among inter-earthquake and co-seismic displacements. Preliminary results from such modeling lead to the following observations:\n1. Co-seismic stress transfer from the unloading elastic layer (shallow) into a transiently-elastically loaded layer (deeper visco-elastic) - extends inboard of locked zone - affecting both coseismic and post-seismic surface displacements.\n2. Post-seismic response of upper plate involves seaward motion for initial ~ 2 Maxwell times after EQ. This occurs in spite of there being no slip on locked plate boundary - (i.e. not plate boundary after-slip, but a consequence of visco-elastic stress relaxation).\n3 Later in the cycle (~ 8+ Maxwell times) the system generates a simple linear displacement pattern - the expected behavior for a shortening elastic beam..\nThese results indicate that care is needed in interpreting observed surface displacement fields during the post- and inter-seismic period - much of the observed deformation that is inferred to be a consequence of after-slip on the megathrust interface may rather be associated with viscous relaxation, masking a period of significant slip-deficit accumulation on the megathrust.",

            "abstract": "The number of paleoclimate records derived from speleothems has increased significantly in recent years. In addition, speleothems have been used for calibration of the radiocarbon timescale beyond the range of the tree-ring record. One critical issue for reliable speleothem-based radiocarbon calibration and 14C dating of speleothems is constraining the temporal variations in the radioactively dead carbon (i.e. dead carbon fraction (DCF)) that is incorporated into this archive and to determine the potential mechanisms driving such changes. While some studies have shown insignificant variations in DCF through time and highlighted the potential utility of speleothems to extend/improve the radiocarbon calibration curve, others have reported significant temporal variability in speleothem DCF associated with changes in cave recharge.\nTo further assess the potential hydrological control on speleothem radiocarbon variability, we constructed a new high-resolution DCF record from a speleothem from Flores, Indonesia for two different time periods, the Younger Dryas (YD) chronozone and the Last Millennium. A total of thirty-four 14C analyses (twenty for the YD and fourteen for the Last Millennium) were conducted on pieces of calcite extracted from stalagmite LR06-B1, which was well-dated by ~90 U-Th ages. To better characterize the paleoclimate and environmental changes, high-resolution stable-isotope (δ18O, δ13C) and trace-element (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) measurements were also conducted along the same sections of stalagmite.\nBroad comparison of the DCF record with the hydrologically-controlled proxy data suggests that increases in rainfall were matched by DCF increases. In line with a previous interpretation of DCF variability for the same specimen, but during the time interval 2.4-2.8 cal kyr BP and the post-bomb period, we interpret the DCF during the YD and the Last Millennium to have been primarily controlled by limestone dissolution associated with changes in open- versus closed-system conditions, rather than other potential factors such as kinetic fractionation and/or variations in the age-spectrum of soil organic matter above the cave.",

We will present our work on how to use knowledge bases on the Web, such as ontologies and vocabularies, to facilitate entity recognition and linking in geoscience literature. The work deploys an un-supervised collective inference approach [1] to link entity mentions in unstructured texts to a knowledge base, which leverages the meaningful information and structures in ontologies and vocabularies for similarity computation and entity ranking. Our work is still in the initial stage towards the detection of knowledge frameworks in literature, and we have been collecting geoscience ontologies and vocabularies in order to build a comprehensive geoscience knowledge base [2].

However, one of the major limitations of VNIR spectroscopy is how it responds to mixtures of minerals. Based on differences in optical constants, some phases can mask others in mixture, even when the first phase is more abundant. Here, we report on a laboratory study to measure the impact of mixtures on the VNIR spectra of hydrated/hydroxylated iron oxide and sulfate phases that are relevant to Mars geochemistry. Pure endmembers of hydrated/hydroxylated iron oxide and sulfate phases are synthesized in the lab, then mixed in known ratios, and measured via VNIR spectroscopy and XRD to assess the percentages of each mineral needed to mask others. Laboratory mixtures are then compared to natural mixtures from the Río Tinto/Río Odiel system and acid mine drainage (AMD) systems of southeastern Pennsylvania. Finally, both laboratory and natural mixtures are be compared to CRISM VNIR data from key iron-phase regions on Mars, including Aram Chaos, Mawrth Vallis, and Noctis Labyrinthus.",

The comprehensive global coverage and large sample size afforded by the two data sets allow robust statistical analysis of storm-averaged diurnal variations and permit stratification of the data in various ways. There is a clearly detectable diurnal variation of precipitation in tropical cyclones with peak rainfall occurring near 0600 local time. For storms of all intensities the amplitude of the diurnal harmonic, which dominates the diurnal cycle, is approximately 7% of the mean rain rate. This corresponds to a peak-to-peak variation of about 15% over the course of the day. The diurnal cycle is similar in all ocean basins. There is evidence that the amplitude of the diurnal cycle increases with increasing storm intensity, but the results are not statistically significant. The results have implications for hurricane forecasting and for our understanding of the processes that regulate oceanic convection.",

            "abstract": "The Central Anatolian plateau formed in the past 8-6 Myrs, associated to a change in tectonic regime, from contraction to extensional escape tectonics. We have examined the response of the river drainage of Central Anatolia to the rise of the plateau uplift and to the formation of the Anatolian microplate, tracking changes in drainage organization. Anatolia experienced widespread rock uplift and erosion in the Late Oligocene, generating a narrow, steep, and quickly eroding mountain range above the future southern plateau margin. A regionally widespread marine transgression resulted from wholesale foundering of this orogen in Early Miocene time. Widespread planation surfaces overlapped by Miocene marine carbonates bevel this topography, indicating that relief had been reduced to a low elevation pedimented landscape by the end of the Middle Miocene. Plateau uplift initiated around 11 My ago in Eastern Anatolia; it was echoed in Central Anatolia by a short-lived phase of contraction and localized uplifts that predate escape tectonics and mark the beginning of the current topographic differentiation of the southern plateau margin. The through-going drainage network inherited disintegrated, and a vast zone of inward drainage formed at the location of the future plateau interior. Between 8 and 6 My, the southern plateau margin (i.e. the Tauride Mountains) emerged. δ18O analyses on lacustrine and pedogenic carbonates show that the southern plateau margin, if not the plateau interior, had experienced enough uplift by 5 My to generate a substantial rain shadow over the plateau interior. Being disconnected from the regional base level from the start, the plateau interior was able to rise without experiencing substantial dissection. It reconnected to all surrounding sediment sinks (Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and Persian Gulf) over the past 5 My. We discuss the mechanisms that have driven this reconnection. Bottom-up processes of integration such as drainage divide retreat did not produce any major changes. Top-down processes such as lake overflow and avulsion achieved most of the re-integration. They result from more positive precipitation/evaporation balances, either due to elevation change during plateau uplift or due to tectonic fragmentation of depocenters during the development of escape tectonics.",

            "abstract": "High Arctic landscapes are expansive and changing rapidly. However our understanding of their functional responses and potential to mitigate or enhance anthropogenic climate change is limited by few measurements. We collected eddy covariance measurements to quantify the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 with polar semidesert and meadow wetland landscapes at the highest-latitude location measured to date (82°N). We coupled these rare data with ground and satellite vegetation production measurements (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; NDVI) to evaluate the effectiveness of upscaling local to regional NEE. During the growing season, the dry polar semidesert landscape was a near zero sink of atmospheric CO2 (NEE: -0.3±13.5 g C m-2). A nearby meadow wetland accumulated over two magnitudes more carbon (NEE: -79.3±20.0 g C m-2) than the polar semidesert landscape, and was similar to meadow wetland NEE at much more southern latitudes. Polar semidesert NEE was most influenced by moisture, with wetter surface soils resulting in greater soil respiration and CO2 emissions. At the meadow wetland, soil heating enhanced plant growth, which in turn increased CO2 uptake. Our upscaling assessment found that polar semidesert NDVI measured on site was low (mean: 0.120-0.157) and similar to satellite measurements (mean: 0.155-0.163). However, weak plant growth resulted in poor satellite NDVI-NEE relationships and created challenges for remotely-detecting changes in the cycling of carbon on the polar semidesert landscape. The meadow wetland appeared more suitable to assess plant production and NEE via remote-sensing, however high Arctic wetland extent is constrained by topography to small areas that may be difficult to resolve with large satellite pixels. We predict that until summer precipitation and humidity increases substantially, climate-related changes of dry high Arctic landscapes may be restricted by poor soil moisture retention, and therefore have some inertia against short-term changes in NEE.",

            "abstract": "Mining-affected lands are a global issue; in the USA alone there are an estimated 500,000 abandoned mines encompassing hundreds of thousands of hectares. Many of these sites generate acidic mine drainage that causes release of heavy metals, and subsequently degradation in environmental quality. Because of its potential liming characteristics, biochar may play a pivotal role as a soil amendment in future mine land reclamation. However, to date, most studies have focused on the use of biochar to sorb metals from solution. Previous studies suggest that metals are complexed by biochar surface function groups (leading to ion exchange, complexation), coordination with Pi electrons (C=C) of carbon, and precipitation of inorganic mineral phases. Several recent studies have focused on the use of biochar for amending mine land soils, showing that biochar can indeed reduce heavy metal lability, yet the mechanism(s) behind labile metal reduction have yet to be established. In a proof-of-concept study, we added lodgepole pine, tamarisk, and switchgrass biochar (0, 5, 10, 15% by weight; 500 oC) to four different western US mine land soils affected by various heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, Zn). Extraction with 0.01M CaCl2 showed that increasing biochar application rate significantly decreased ‘bioaccessible’ metals in almost all instances. A concomitant increase in solution pH was observed, suggesting that metals may be rendered bio-inaccessible through precipitation as carbonate or (hydr)oxide phases, or sorbed onto mineral surfaces. However, this was only supposition and required further research. Thus, following the 0.01M CaCl2 extraction, biochar-soil mixtures were air-dried and metals were further extracted using the four-step BCR sequential removal procedure. Results from selective extraction suggest that, as compared to the controls, most metals in the biochar-amended mine land soils were associated with exchange sites, carbonate, and oxide phases. Biochar may play a pivotal role as a soil amendment in the future of mine land reclamation, although elevated pH levels should be maintained to prolong sequestration while lessening the possibility of metal resolubilization.",

            "abstract": "Global climatic change has triggered weather patterns which lead to heavy and sudden rainfall in different parts of world. The impact of heavy rainfall is severe especially on urban areas in the form of urban flooding. In order to understand the effect of heavy rainfall induced flooding, it is necessary to model the entire flooding scenario more accurately, which is now becoming possible with the availability of high resolution airborne LiDAR data and other real time observations. However, there is not much understanding on the optimal use of these data and on the effect of other parameters on the performance of the flood model. This study aims at developing understanding on these issues. In view of the above discussion, the aim of this study is to (i) understand that how the use of high resolution LiDAR data improves the performance of urban flood model, and (ii) understand the sensitivity of various hydrological parameters on urban flood modelling. In this study, modelling of flooding in urban areas due to heavy rainfall is carried out considering Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India as the study site. The existing model MIKE FLOOD, which is accepted by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is used along with the high resolution airborne LiDAR data. Once the model is setup it is made to run by changing the parameters such as resolution of Digital Surface Model (DSM), manning’s roughness, initial losses, catchment description, concentration time, runoff reduction factor. In order to realize this, the results obtained from the model are compared with the field observations. The parametric study carried out in this work demonstrates that the selection of catchment description plays a very important role in urban flood modelling. Results also show the significant impact of resolution of DSM, initial losses and concentration time on urban flood model. This study will help in understanding the effect of various parameters that should be part of a flood model for its accurate performance.",

            "abstract": "Understanding Earth’s energy budget is fundamental for studying the climate system, since a change in climate is controlled by (1) the budget of energy fluxes entering and leaving at top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and (2) the distribution of the energy remaining in the system. Global climate models serve as our most sophisticated tools for simulating present-day climate and predicting future changes; a model’s ability to accurately recreate Earth’s energy budget is often used as a benchmark for model quality. Recent high-quality measurements of radiative fluxes using NASA’s Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) satellite instrument provide an excellent 14-year data record for model evaluation. This study focuses on the evaluation of the widely-used Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble of climate models with performance metrics related to the interannual variance of key radiation budget quantities. Variance within the climate system is generated by physical processes—such as clouds and surface conditions—and is therefore a measure of model response to a forcing; variance-related performance metrics are used in this study to evaluate the fundamental physical processes that underpin model projections. It is found that most CMIP5 models reproduce interannual variance and probability distributions of TOA radiation reasonably well compared with CERES observations, and models from the same modeling center tend to behave similarly across the tested performance metrics. However, all models fail at reproducing certain observed conditions, such as the regression between TOA longwave radiation fluxes and surface temperature; this metric represents a fundamental measure of atmospheric column energy processes. We explore the various related radiative processes to identify those which models are least able to recapture, highlighting possible avenues for improvement in the next generation of climate models.",

            "abstract": "We have built an alternating field demagnetizer that can routinely achieve a maximum field of 0.5 Tesla. It uses an amorphous magnetic core with an air-cooled coil. We have started with a 0.5 T design, which satisfies most of our immediate needs, but we can certainly achieve higher fields. In our design, the magnetic field is transverse to the bore and uniform to 1% over a standard (25 mm) paleomagnetic sample. It is powered by a 1 kW power amplifier and is compatible with our existing sample handler for automated demagnetization and measurement (Morris et al., 2009). It’s much higher peak field has enabled us to completely demagnetize many of the samples that previously we could not with commercial equipment. This capability is especially needed for high-coercivity sedimentary and igneous rocks that contain magnetic minerals that alter during thermal demagnetization. It will also enable detailed automated demagnetization of high coercivity phases in extraterrestrial samples, such as native iron, iron-alloy and sulfide minerals that are common in lunar rocks and meteorites. Furthermore, it has opened the door for us to use the rock-magnetic technique of component analysis, using coercivity distributions derived from very detailed AF demagnetization of NRM and remanence produced in the laboratory to characterize the magnetic mineralogy of sedimentary rocks. In addition to the many benefits this instrument has brought to our own research, a much broader potential impact is to replace the transverse coils in automated AF demagnetization systems, which typically are limited to peak fields around 0.1 T.",

            "abstract": "The Nenana Gravel is an up to 1.2 km thick foreland basin deposit that spans the north flank of the Alaska Range. It is uplifted relative to the active foreland basin to the north. It is also deformed to various degree dependent on its location within the northern Alaska Range thrust system. Because this foreland basin sequence records the unroofing and northward propagation of the Alaska Range, direct dating of the Nenana Gravel, especially over wide spatial distribution along the Alaska Range, will substantially advance our understanding of the style and timing of deformation of the Alaska Range. At present though, age estimates for the Nenana Gravel are limited to a single maximum limiting age and uncertain minimum limiting age with no little or no insight as to the spatial variation in Nenana Gravel deposition timing. We present the first direct dates of deposition ages of the Nenana Gravel using cosmogenic nuclide burial dating. Results indicate that deposition of the Nenana Gravel began ca. 6.5 Ma, in stratigraphic agreement with a maximum limiting tephra age from the underlying Usibelli Group. Additional samples from the Nenana Gravel basal contact and higher in the section are presently underway. The resultant burial ages are amongst the oldest 26Al-10Be burial ages ever produced and highlight the potential of the method to directly date sediments in the Pliocene, particularly given recent advancements in the accelerator mass spectrometry measurement of 26Al/27Al isotope ratios.",

            "abstract": "Li isotopes have been demonstrated to be a powerful tool in silicate weathering research from the continental scale to that of catchments and weathering profiles. In this study, we focus on Li isotopic behavior during granite weathering and pedogenic processes. Study profiles are developed on a granite intrusion in Longnan, South China, under a subtropical monsoon climate. Two soil profiles (JLN-S4 on the ridgetop and JLN-S3 on the midslope; both 120cm deep) and one weathering profiles (JLN-S1 on the toe slope; 1100cm deep) along a hill slope were selected to represent the granite weathering process in near surface condition. Bulk samples of these profiles were analyzed for major element and Li content, and δ7Li value. CIA (chemical index of alteration) values were determined.\nThe uppermost soil profile (JLN-S4) samples have CIA values between 97.6 and 98.3, with δ7Li values from -2.50 to -3.90‰; JLN-S3 profile samples have lower CIA values varing from 94.4 to 96.1 and δ7Li values from -0.73‰ to -1.55‰. The weathering profile JLN-S1 at the toe slope has a generally increasing CIA values (in the range of 57.8~92.4) upward in the profile. The δ7Li values variation with CIA in JLN-S1, shows a two staged relationship: δ7Li increasing from -14.92‰ to 0.66‰ when CIA increases from 57.8 to 74.6 as the first stage (from the bottom to 370cm depth), and no obvious relationship between CIA andδ7Li（-4.74~3.62‰） was observed in the second stage (CIA higher than 74.6, 370cm depth above). Li contents in JLN-S4 vary between 3.84 and 15.03 μg/g, in JLN-S3 between 1.43~8.03 μg/g, and in JLN-S1 between 6.95~22.27μg/g. In the first stage defined by δ7Li and CIA relationship, Li contents decrease with increasing CIA. However, in the second stage, Li abundance decreases upward at the beginning and turns into an increacing tendency (at 175cm depth) to the surface. Two granite bedrock samples have δ7Li value of -0.23 and 0.39‰, and Li contents of 38.58 and 34.22μg/g.\nOur study indicates that Li isotope composition of residual material is dominanted by the extent of granite weathering. However complex processes, including adsorption and desorption of clay minerals, fluid flow and interaction, and atmospheric input control the Li isotopic composition of residual materials during deep weathering and pedogenic processes.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the quality of Earth science data has received much attention from several points of view. First, the scientific quality, defined in terms of accuracy, precision, uncertainty, validity and suitability for use (fitness for purpose) in various applications is considered paramount. In addition, the product quality is important as well. Product quality addresses how well the scientific quality is assessed and documented, how complete the metadata and documentation are, etc. Stewardship quality addresses questions such as how well data are being managed and preserved by an archive or repository, how easy it is for users to find, get, understand, trust, and use data, and whether the archive has people who understand the data available to help users. In general, we can refer to all these aspects of quality together as Information Quality. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the context of and ideas for further work on Earth science information quality. Several related prior activities will be discussed such as: QA4EO, ISO Metadata Quality Standards, NOAA CDR Maturity Matrix, NOAA Data Stewardship Maturity Matrix, NCAR Community Contribution Pages, NASA MEaSUREs Product Quality Checklists, and NASA Earth Science Data System Working Groups (ESDSWG) Data Quality Working Group recommendations. The ESIP Information Quality Cluster is proceeding in this context to: identify additional needs for consistently capturing, describing, and conveying quality information through use case studies with broad and diverse applications; establish and provide community-wide guidance on roles and responsibilities of key players and stakeholders including users and management; prototype conveying quality information to users in a consistent and easily understandable manner; establish a baseline of standards and best practices for data quality; and engage data providers, data managers, and data user communities as resources to improve our standards and best practices.",

            "abstract": "Yemen is one of the most food insecure nations in the world. Its agriculture is strongly dependent on soil moisture that is heavily influenced by surface temperature and annual precipitation. We examine observations of rainfall and surface temperature and find that the rainfall, which exhibits strong interannual variability, has seen a moderate downward trend over the last 35 years while surface temperature has seen a very significant rise over the same period. Yemen has high vulnerability and low resilience to these climate changes stemming from many geopolitical and socioeconomic factors. The threshold of resilience has been crossed as Yemen is embroiled in chaos and conflict. We examine the relationship between climate change and agricultural and water insecurity using observed data and the Noah land surface model. We further used atmospheric reanalyses to explore the atmospheric teleconnections that affect the anomalous regional circulation. According to these investigations the robust surface temperature increase over recent decades, expected to continue under climate change, has strongly depleted the soil moisture. This drying of the soil exacerbated the acute hydrologic insecurity in Yemen, stemming predominantly from unsustainable groundwater use, and was likely a contributing factor to the ongoing conflict. We show that during naturally occurring dry years and under climate change this region experiences anomalous dry air advection from the northeast and that these regional circulation changes appear to be linked to tropical sea-surface temperature forcing and to the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude circulation. These results are an important example of the emerging influence of climate change in hydrologically insecure regions.",

            "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) is a key input for physically-based retrieval algorithms of hydrological states and fluxes. Yet, it remains a poorly constrained parameter for global scale studies. The main two observational methods to remotely measure T are based on thermal infrared (TIR) observations and passive microwave observations (MW). TIR is the most commonly used approach and the method of choice to provide standard LST products for various satellite missions. MW-based LST retrievals on the other hand are not as widely adopted for land applications; currently their principle use is in soil moisture retrieval algorithms.\nMW and TIR technologies present two highly complementary and independent means of measuring LST. MW observations have a high tolerance to clouds but a low spatial resolution, and TIR has a high spatial resolution with temporal sampling restricted to clear skies. This paper builds on recent progress in characterizing the main structural differences between TIR LST and MW Ka-band observations, the MW frequency that is most suitable for LST sensing. By accounting for differences in diurnal timing (phase lag with solar noon), amplitude, and emissivity we construct a MW-based LST dataset that matches the diurnal characteristics of the TIR-based LSA SAF LST record. This new global dataset of MW-based LST currently spans the period of 2003-2013. In this paper we will present results of a validation of MW LST with in situ data with special emphasis on the effect of cloudiness on the performance.\nThe ability to remotely sense the temperature of cloud covered land is what sets this MW-LST datasets apart from existing (much higher resolution) TIR-based products. As an example of this we will therefore explore how MW LST can mitigate the effect of clear-sky sampling in the context of trend and anomaly detection. We do this by contrasting monthly means of TIR-LST with its clear-sky and all-sky equivalent from an MW-LST and an NWP model.",

            "abstract": "The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is among the world’s most invasive species. Its spread has been facilitated by rapid global transport of cargo and potentially by the warming of climate, and it is now established on every continent except Antarctica. This species represents a “triple threat” to human health, being a day-biting pest, a competent vector of globally important dengue and chikungunya viruses, and a potential bridge vector of several zoonotic arboviruses.\nAs a result of its importance, the biology of Ae. albopictus is also well-studied, but the fine-scale processes by which it becomes established in a given location are poorly understood. This is because even intensive surveillance systems yield limited information during the early phase of invasions when densities are low, and detection often occurs after populations are relatively widespread. Fine-scale spatial models for mosquito dynamics and movement offer a way forward, marrying our understanding of Ae. albopictus biology with surveillance paradigms and detailed data on the real landscapes where invasions occur.\nThis presentation will consider the impacts of climate on the biology of Ae. albopictus and explore their implications for the ongoing invasion and establishment of Ae. albopictus in Los Angeles since 2011. We have used hierarchical modeling to account for heterogeneities in household-level suitability, then we modeled the stochastic dynamics of Ae. albopictus on this landscape using the suitability surface and a temperature-dependent, dynamical model for reproduction and spread. I will discuss the modeling approach and use the model results to answer policy-relevant questions related to our ability to detect and control these highly invasive mosquitoes.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrated that the Antarctic Ozone Hole has important influences on Antarctic sea ice. While all these have focused on stratospheric ozone-induced dynamic effects on sea ice, here we show results that ozone-induced indirect radiative effects have important influences on Antarctic sea ice. Our simulations demonstrate that the recovery of the Antarctic Ozone Hole causes equatorward shift of clouds over the Southern Ocean. The cloud-band shift leads to reduction of downward infrared radiation, which causes surface cooling. On the other hand, it also causes increasing solar radiation on the surface. However, the increase in solar radiation is offset by surface reflection due to increasing sea ice. As a result solar radiation absorbed by the surface is reduced, which also causes surface cooling. Therefore, the overall ozone-induced cloud radiative effect is to cool the surface and causes expansion of sea ice around the Antarctic. As shown in previous studies, the cloud-band shift is associated with the equatorward shift of the westerly jet stream around the Antarctic. Our simulations also demonstrate increasing snow rate near the sea ice edge, which also contributes to Antarctic sea-ice expansion. The ozone-induced cloud radiative effect would mitigate Antarctic sea-ice melting due to greenhouse warming in the 21st century.",

            "abstract": "I present a mode of isotopic ordering that has purely combinatorial origins. It can be important when identical rare isotopes are paired by coincidence (e.g., they are neighbors on the same molecule), or when extrinsic factors govern the isotopic composition of the two atoms that share a chemical bond. By itself, combinatorial isotope pairing yields products with isotopes either randomly distributed or with a deficit relative to a random distribution of isotopes. These systematics arise because of an unconventional coupling between the formation of singly- and multiply-substituted isotopic moieties. In a random distribution, rare isotopes are symmetrically distributed: Single isotopic substitutions (e.g., H‒D and D‒H in H2) occur with equal probability, and double isotopic substitutions (e.g., D2) occur according to random chance. The absence of symmetry in a bond-making complex can yield unequal numbers of singly-substituted molecules (e.g., more H‒D than D‒H in H2), which is recorded in the product molecule as a deficit in doubly-substituted moieties and an “anticlumped” isotope distribution (i.e., Δn < 0). Enzymatic isotope pairing reactions, which can have site-specific isotopic fractionation factors and atom reservoirs, should express this class of combinatorial isotope effect. Chemical-kinetic isotope effects, which are related to the bond-forming transition state, arise independently and express second-order combinatorial effects.\nIn general, both combinatorial and chemical factors are important for calculating and interpreting clumped-isotope signatures of individual reactions. In many reactions relevant to geochemical oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen cycling, combinatorial isotope pairing likely plays a strong role in the clumped isotope distribution of the products. These isotopic signatures, manifest as either directly bound isotope clumps or as features of a molecule’s isotopic anatomy, could be exploited as tracers of biogeochemistry that can relate molecular mechanisms to signals observable at environmentally relevant spatial scales.",

The plan will comprise i) projections of climate change, ii) surveys of site managers to estimate the effects of climate change on site operations, and iii) a determination of adaptive actions.\nClimate change projections for SRS are obtained from multiple sources, including an online repository of downscaled global climate model (GCM) simulations of future climate and downscaled GCM simulations produced at SRNL. Taken together, we have projected data for temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind – all variables with a strong influence on site operations.\nSRNL is working to engage site facility managers and facilitate a “bottom up” approach to climate change resilience planning, where the needs and priorities of stakeholders are addressed throughout the process. We make use of the Vulnerability Assessment Scoring Tool, an Excel-based program designed to accept as input various climate scenarios (‘exposure’), the susceptibility of assets to climate change (‘sensitivity’), and the ability of these assets to cope with climate change (‘adaptive capacity’). These are combined to produce a series of scores that highlight vulnerabilities. Working with site managers, we have selected the most important assets, estimated their expected response to climate change, and prepared a report highlighting the most endangered facilities. Primary risks include increased energy consumption, decreased water availability, increased forest fire danger, natural resource degradation, and compromised outdoor worker safety in a warmer and more humid climate. Results of this study will aid in driving future management decisions and promoting sustainable practices at SRS.",

            "abstract": "Central Godavari Delta is located in the East coast of Andhra Pradesh along Bay of Bengal. Ample surface water is made available for irrigation and aqua culture through well distributed canals drawn from Godavari River since last 150 years. Groundwater in the area is highly saline though the groundwater levels are very shallow ranging from 1 to 3 m below ground level.\nIntegrated Electrical Resistivity Tomograms (ERT), hydrochemical (pH, TDS, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, F-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, HCO3- and CO3-), isotopic (Br- and δ18O ) and density dependant solute tranport (SEAWAT) modelling studies have been carried out for four years (2006, 2007, 2014 and 2015) to identify the salinity sources and to understand the possible extent of seawater intrusion. The integration of all these data sets revealed that coarse grained sands exhibits resistivity of 4-20 Ωm forming the surface layer, clay layer exhibits < 1 Ωm mostly present as the second layer at many locations. However, similar resistivity values are also associated with soils saturated with sea water. Clay with fine sand occurs as the third layer with a resistivity of 1- 4 Ωm.\nThe different mixing models ((TDS vs. (Na2++ K+) and (Ca2++Mg2+), (Na+-Cl- ) vs. Ca2++Mg2+-HCO3--SO42-)) and ionic ratios ( Na2+/Cl-, SO42-/Cl-, Mg2+/Ca2+, Mg2+/Cl- and Cl-/Br) and δ18O does not reflect any modern seawater signatures. These models indicated that salinity in the shallow wells is due to dissolution of evaporitic minerals and ion exchange processes. In the pumping wells the salinity is due to upconing of entrapped sea water that belongs to Palaeo origin and wells located near the coast and mudflats is due to physical mixing of marine water. The estimated regional groundwater balance using SEAWAT model indicate significant amount of submarine groundwater discharge as outfall to the Bay of Bengal. Assuming observed hydrological conditions, no considerable advance in seawater intrusion would be expected into the delta region.\n ",

            "abstract": "Seismic noise is the continuous oscillation of the Earth recorded worldwide, in response to the interaction amongst the atmosphere, the ocean and the solid Earth. Seismic noise spectrum is typically dominated by two main peaks at about 7 s and 14 s of period, called secondary and primary microseisms, respectively. Secondary microseisms are generated by the non-linear interaction of ocean gravity waves (Longuet-Higgins, 1950; Hasselmann, 1963), whereas primary microseisms are generated by the direct interaction between the ocean gravity waves and the seafloor, in coastal regions (Hasselmann, 1963; Ardhuin et al., 2015).\nNoise source location and amplitude can be derived from a realistic ocean wave model and schematized as a pressure distribution along the ocean surface. We model the amplitude of the three-components of noise spectra using normal mode summation. The fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves is the dominant signal on land-records and allows us to well estimate the amplitude of the vertical component of noise spectrum in various environments. The discrepancy between real and synthetic spectra on the horizontal components enables instead to estimate the amount of noise Love waves, for which a different source mechanism is needed.\nThe ocean plays an important role on the amplification of seismic noise. The effect of the ocean on seismic noise is computed on Rayleigh waves using normal modes and on body waves by defining the wavefield as the superposition of plane waves. The ocean site effect varies strongly with period and ocean depth, although in different ways for body waves and for Rayleigh waves, amplifying different source regions at different periods.",

We show that in recent years, the heat was being trapped in the subsurface waters of the western Pacific and eastern Indian oceans between 100 and 300 m. The movement of warm Pacific water below the surface, also related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation climatic pattern, temporarily affected surface temperatures and accounted for the global cooling trend in surface temperature.

Referred to as the most successful oceanographic experiment of all time, TOPEX and its successors Jason-1 and Jason-2 revolutionized the field of oceanography. Satellite altimeters are now used routinely to chart and predict ocean currents, track global and regional climate phenomena such as El Nino, predict hurricane intensity and even to estimate the shape and depth of the sea floor. But one of the greatest accomplishments of satellite altimetry is the unbroken, 23-year record of global and regional sea level change. No other climate record provides a more direct and far reaching measure of Earth’s changing climate. As satellite altimetry evolves, it will continue to provide key information about the oceans and climate, but it will also provide information on increasingly smaller scales.

            "abstract": "Large silicic volcanic centers produce catastrophic supervolcanic eruptions. As a result it is necessary to understand what’s happening within these centers, and on what timescales, in order to anticipate and prepare for such eruptions. A widely accepted model for many rhyolitic volcanic systems is that of a long-lived mush from which melt is periodically extracted and erupted. However, what remains unclear are 1) the specific processes by which melt is amalgamated and extracted from this mush and 2) the timescales over which these occur. Processes occurring close to eruption likely include amalgamation (and potentially homogenization) of melt, melt extraction, crystallization of major phases, and final magma ascent. Numerical and geochemical models have been used to constrain timescales of mush rejuvenation, and contrast between short timescales for mush reactivation (e.g., <<1000 years, depending on the reservoir) and others demonstrating much longer timescales at super-solidus conditions (e.g., 100s of kyrs). Timescales calculated from intra-crystalline diffusion profiles suggest that many crystals spend very short amounts of time (decades to centuries) at near-solidus temperatures prior to eruption. At the Okataina Volcanic Center (OVC) in New Zealand, geochemical and isotopic data suggest that melts are extracted from a long-lived, heterogeneous mush prior to eruption. Despite this protracted existence, combined U-series ages and diffusion profiles in OVC zircon and plagioclase crystals suggest that crystallization often occurs within the final hundreds to thousands of years prior to eruption, and at most, a few percent of a crystal’s total history is spent at above-solidus conditions. Within these brief amounts of time, diffusion techniques can be linked to specific pre-eruptive processes in order to constrain timescales of melt extraction from a mush (likely decades to centuries), intrusions of new melt and/or magma mixing (likely years to decades), and ascent of melt to the surface (likely minutes). Ongoing work will constrain the extent to which these timescales can be applied to volcanic systems of different compositions and tectonic settings, as well as examining differences in pre-eruptive behavior between supervolcanic eruptions and smaller ones.",

            "abstract": "With increasing evidence of global warming, many cities have focused attention on response plans to address their populations’ vulnerabilities. Despite expected increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, the health impacts of such events in urban areas can be minimized with careful policy and economic investments. We focus on Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and ask two questions. First, what are the top factors contributing to heat vulnerability and how do these characteristics manifest geospatially throughout Pittsburgh? Second, assuming the City wishes to deploy additional cooling centers, what placement will optimally address the vulnerability of the at risk populations? We use national census data, ArcGIS geospatial modeling, and statistical analysis to determine a range of heat vulnerability indices and optimal cooling center placement. We find that while different studies use different data and statistical calculations, all methods tested locate additional cooling centers at the confluence of the three rivers (Downtown), the northeast side of Pittsburgh (Shadyside/ Highland Park), and the southeast side of Pittsburgh (Squirrel Hill). This suggests that for Pittsburgh, a researcher could apply the same factor analysis procedure to compare datasets for different locations and times; factor analyses for heat vulnerability are more robust than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "The increase in the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons, especially natural gas, from shale formations has been facilitated by advents in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies. Shale energy resources are very promising as an abundant energy source, though environmental challenges exist with their development, including potential adverse impacts to water quality. The well drilling and construction process itself has the potential to impact groundwater quality, however if proper protocols are followed and well integrity is established then impacts such as methane migration or drilling fluids releases can be minimized. Once a shale well has been drilled and hydraulically fractured, approximately 10-50% of the volume of injected fluids (flowback fluids) may flow out of the well initially with continued generation of fluids (produced fluids) throughout the well’s productive life. Produced fluid TDS concentrations often exceed 200,000 mg/L, with elevated levels of strontium (Sr), bromide (Br), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), barium (Ba), chloride (Cl), radionuclides originating from the shale formation as well as fracturing additives. Storing, managing and properly disposisng of these fluids is critical to ensure water resources are not impacted by unintended releases. The most recent data in Pennsylvania suggests an estimated 85% of the produced fluids were being recycled for hydraulic fracturing operations, while many other states reuse less than 50% of these fluids and rely moreso on underground injection wells for disposal. Over the last few years there has been a shift to reuse more produced fluids during well fracturing operations in shale plays around the U.S., which has a combination of economic, regulatory, environmental, and technological drivers. The reuse of water is cost-competitive with sourcing of fresh water and disposal of flowback, especially when considering the costs of advanced treatment to or disposal well injection and lessens the use of fresh water and disposal needs thus is a major innovation for the industry. Proper water resource managment techniques from the begining of drilling through production are critical to ensure the energy necessary for society is produced while also protecting the environment.",

Whereas, the quality and quantity of environmental monitoring data is continually improving (e. g., spectral and spatial resolution of satellite imagery) contextual information needed to effectively utilize the data is sparse. Examples of such contextual information include ground truth data for land cover classification, presence/absence of species, prevalence of mosquito breeding sites and characteristics of urban land cover. Often, there are no agencies tasked with routine collection of such contextual information, which could be effectively collected through crowdsourcing.\nCrowdsourcing of such information, that is useful for environmental science research and applications, also provide opportunities for experiential learning at all levels of education. Appropriately designed crowdsourcing activity can be transform students from passive recipients of information to generators of knowledge. Multiple examples of synergistic use of crowdsourcing, developed by the Public Environmental Education and Research Apps (PEERA) group, at the University of Alabama in Huntsville will be presented. One example is crowdsourcing of land use and land cover (LULC) data using Open Data Kit (ODK) and associated analysis of satellite imagery using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Implementation of this activity as inquiry based learning exercise, for both middle school and for pre-service teachers will be discussed. Another example will detail the synergy between crowdsourcing for biodiversity mapping in southern India and environmental education.

            "abstract": "Seismic noise in the period band 3-10 s is known as secondary microseism and it is generated at the ocean surface by the interaction of ocean gravity waves coming from nearly opposite directions. The seismic wavefield generated by a noise source is strongly affected by the source location and the propagation across 3D structures. In order to study the relative noise amplitudes recorded at the ocean bottom and on continental regions and investigate the seismic wavefield content, a simplified 2D model based on the spectral element method has been employed.\nThe seismic wavefield recorded on the vertical component seismograms below the seafloor is mainly composed by the fundamental mode and the first overtone of Rayleigh waves and a mode conversion from the first overtone to the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves occurs at the ocean-continent boundary. The presence of a continental shelf at the ocean-continent boundary produces a negligible effect on land-recorded seismograms, whereas the source site effect, i.e. the source location with respect to the local ocean depth and sediment thickness, plays the major role. A source in shallow water mostly enhances the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves, whereas a source in deep water mainly enhances the first overtone of Rayleigh waves. Land-recorded long period signals (T>6 s) are mostly due to deep water sources, whereas land-recorded short period signals (T<6 s) are due to sources in relatively shallow water, located close to the shelf break.",

            "abstract": "The Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) provides continuous global observations of Birkeland currents on a 10 minute cadence. During geomagnetic storms, currents intensify to over 15 MA, are dynamic both in intensity and distribution, and exhibit features not discernible in statistical analyses. For all of the subject grand challenge storms, AMPERE data reveal a number of novel phenomena illustrating the profound dynamics of the storm-time system. Storm-time onsets associated with shock arrivals are often very prompt and lead to dramatic surges in total current from 1 MA to over 5 MA in less than 20 minutes. The current surges occur predominantly on the dayside at high latitudes prior to any ring current or auroral expansions, indicating that neutral density upwelling is often driven independently of ring current or auroral zone intensifications. Rapid reconfigurations of the currents with IMF BY reversals within the sheath structures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are also common. This implies that convection of ionospheric density patches over the polar cap may be quite complex, particularly during the early phase of geomagnetic storms related to the CME sheath passage. The 3 September 2012 storm exhibited intense driving with classic quasi-stable Region 1 and 2 currents spanning 55 to 70 degrees magnetic latitude for over 10 hours at the beginning of the day, corresponding to stable southward IMF prior to shock arrival at noon on that day. The shock arrival and IMF southward intensification led to further expansion of the currents below 50 degrees magnetic latitude and to episodic surges in currents on the nightside, which is unique to storms. The resulting current structure showed multiple large-scale alternations in downward-upward-downward-upward direction that often occurs during intense, sustained driving during strong storms.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the composition and the spatial evolution of volcanic plumes provides insights to processes occurring in the Earth’s interior. On the other hand, quantification of gaseous emission fluxes is also a fundamental task in the framework of climate change in order to refine the contribution of natural emissions. UV cameras allow us to image volcanic plumes and evaluate SO2 fluxes, although can be subject to uncertainties in the retrieval. Another technique of imaging is now available in the infra-red. Such infrared hyperspectral imager (pixel-by-pixel spectra) might represent a major step forward in volcanology due to its potential to allow SO2 flux measurements during the night and gives access to additional relevant species but has to be tested and validated as a first step.\nIn June 2015 a campaign of measurements - IMAGETNA – was performed at Mt Etna (Pizzi Deneri Volcano Observatory) with the intent to explore the application of these techniques for volcanic gas measurements all together. Over five days the volcanic plume was remotely observed simultaneously by employing three different hyperspectral imagers (commercial and under development), FTIR instrument, UV LWIR cameras, and radiometer. Results gathered from the different instruments will be compared and by performing sensitivity tests on the retrieval codes the reliability of applying these techniques to volcanic gas observations will be evaluated.\nThe campaign, the characteristics of the different instruments involved as well as the instrumental deployment strategy will be presented. Direct comparisons of spectral radiance in the infrared obtained by the different infrared instruments will be shown for several selected fields of view. First results for SO2 from UV and in the infrared imagers will be shown, as well as first investigations on other species detected in the infrared.",

            "abstract": "An Estuary turbidity maximum or zone (ETM or ETZ) is an area of elevated sediment concentration that often occurs in coastal plain, salt wedge, and river-dominated estuaries. ETMs influence the morphodynamic development, biogeochemical cycling, and contaminant distribution of the many systems in which they occur. In developed estuaries, they are often created or augmented by dredging. Material of either fluvial or marine origin may be trapped, but fluvial supply is dominant in most river-estuary ETMs. An ETM can be described in terms of the type of particle trapping mechanisms that concentrate or trap suspended particulate matter (SPM). Convergent alongchannel SPM fluxes are required to create an ETM, and for a steady-state to pertain, seaward fluxes related to river flow must be balanced by landward mean, tidal or overtide fluxes. Horizontal and vertical salinity and/or sediment gradients often enhance trapping by concentrating SPM near the bed and cause near-bed landward flow and SPM transport. Also, lateral processes can concentrate or disperse SPM, and lags between SPM concentration and velocity are often a dominant factor in systems with fine grained sediment. The settled bed in an ETM may be fine grained, but ETM also occur in sand-bedded systems where no long-term deposition of ETM material occurs. We summarize results of theoretical models that provide a conceptual understanding of how ETM fluxes trap material and how ETM properties vary in response to external forcing. Remote sensing images provide a spatial view of ETM phenomena, and analyses of 15 years of ocean color data for the Columbia River Estuary validate theoretical results. Recent advances in acoustic and optical instrumentation in other environments should facilitate a new generation of ETM measurements, providing better time-space coverage and better flux estimates. Accordingly, we suggest ETM research questions for the coming decade.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice melt onset, the appearance of liquid water in its snow cover, decreases surface albedo which increases shortwave absorption and thereby accelerates snow and sea ice melting. Earlier melt onset leads to the earlier formation of open water which enhances the ice-albedo feedback. Sea ice melt onset timing and duration vary considerably, both spatially and temporally, owing to variability in atmospheric forcing; this in turn influences the September sea ice extent. Sea ice melt onset variability has been investigated using coarse resolution passive microwave observation in Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA); however, this does not provide sufficient information about sea ice melt dynamics. We developed a new melt onset algorithm using high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from RADARSAT to better understand sea ice melt onset dynamics in northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago (fig 1) from 1997 to 2014. The algorithm is based on the temporal evolution of the SAR backscatter coefficient (σo), using separate thresholds for seasonal first-year ice and multi-year ice. Results indicated that the mean annual average melt onset date in the northern CAA was on year day 164 (mid–June) with a standard deviation of 4 days over the 18 year period. No significant trend for melt onset date was found over the 18 year period (fig: 2) but extreme early melt onset was detected in 1998 and 2012 associated with anomalous atmospheric forcing. Spatially, sea ice onset over the entire northern CAA varied from a 10-day minimum in 2007, to a 35-day maximum in 2011 and exhibited negative correlation (r=0.70) with the rate of increase in surface air temperature (fig 3) derived from Extended AVHRR Polar Pathfinder (APP-x) dataset. An earlier (later) melt onset also results in light (heavier) September sea ice area in the northern CAA (fig 4).",

            "abstract": "Coastal forests in California are frequently covered by clouds or immersed in fog in the rain-free summer. Scientists have long surmised that fog might provide critical water inputs to these forests. However, until recently, there has been little ecophysiological research to support how or why plants should prefer foggy regions; similarly, there is very little work quantifying water delivered to ecosystems by fog drip except for a few notable sites along the California coast. However, without spatial datasets of summer cloudcover and fog inundation, combined with detailed process studies, questions regarding the roles of cloud shading and fog drip in dictating plant distributions and ecosystem physiology cannot be addressed effectively. The overall objective of this project is to better understand how cloudcover and fog influence forest metabolism, growth, and distribution. Across a range of sites in California’s Channel Islands National Park we measured a wide variety of ecosystem processes and properties. We then related these to cloudcover and fog immersion maps created using satellite datasets and airport and radiosonde observations. We compiled a spatially continuous dataset of summertime cloudcover frequency of the Southern California bight using satellite imagery from the NOAA geostationary GOES-11 Imager. We also created map of summertime cloudcover frequency of this area using MODIS imagery. To assess the ability of our mapping approach to predict spatial and temporal fog inundation patterns, we compared our monthly average daytime fog maps for GOES pixels corresponding to stations where fog inputs were measured with fog collectors in a Bishop pine forest. We also compared our cloudcover maps to measurements of irradiance measurements. Our results demonstrate that cloudcover and fog strongly modulate radiation, water, and carbon budgets, as well as forest distributions, in this semi-arid environment. Measurements of summertime fog drip, pine sapflow and growth, and soil respiration are strongly related to variations in cloudcover and fog drip. Importantly, spatial variations in cloud cover and fog immersion drive large changes in modeled water budgets and correspond closely to patterns of tree growth and mortality.",

There is a latitudinal zonation of albedo. The conspicuous bright albedo heart-shaped feature informally named Tombaugh Regio is comprised of several terrain types. Most striking is Texas-sized Sputnik Planum, which is apparently level, has no observable craters, and is divided by polygons and ovoids bounded by shallow troughs. Small smooth hills are seen in some of the polygon-bounding troughs. These hills could either be extruded or exposed by erosion. Sputnik Planum polygon/ovoid formation hypotheses range from convection to contraction, but convection is currently favored. There is evidence of flow of plains material around obstacles. Mountains, especially those seen south of Sputnik Planum, exhibit too much relief to be made of CH4, CO, or N2, and thus are probably composed of H2O-ice basement material. The north contact of Sputnik Planum abuts a scarp, above which is heavily modified cratered terrain. Pluto’s large moon Charon is generally heavily to moderately cratered. There is a mysterious structure in the arctic. Charon’s surface is crossed by an extensive system of rift faults and graben. Some regions are smoother and less cratered, reminiscent of lunar maria. On such a plain are large isolated block mountains surrounded by moats. At this conference we will present highlights of the latest observations and analysis.",

The relative air pollution exposure dose and time effects on various diseases remains unknown. This study compares the increased risk of health complications when patients are exposed to short term high-levels of air pollution vs. longer term exposure to lower levels of air pollution.\nWe used the electronic medical record of an integrated hospital system based in Utah, Intermountain Healthcare, to identify a cohort of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) who were seen between 2009-2014. We determined patient demographics as well as comorbidity data and healthcare utilization. To determine the approximate air pollution dose and time exposure, we used the Hestia highly-resolved emissions inventory for Salt Lake County, Utah in conjunction with emissions based on the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). Hourly emissions of CO2 and criteria air pollutants were gridded at a 0.002o x 0.002o resolution for the study years. The resulting emissions were transported using the CALPUFF and AERMOD dispersion models to estimate air pollutant concentrations at an hourly 0.002o x 0.002oresolution. Additionally, pollutant concentrations were estimated at each patient’s home and work address to estimate exposure.\nMultivariate analysis adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidities and severity of COPD was performed to determine association between air pollution exposure and the risk of hospitalization or emergency department (ED) visit for COPD exacerbation and an equivalency estimate for air pollution exposure was developed.\nWe noted associations with air pollution levels for each pollutant and hospitalizations and ED visits for COPD and other patient comorbidities. We also present an equivalency estimate for dose of air pollution exposure and health outcomes. This analysis compares the increased risk of health complications when patients are exposed to short term high-levels of air pollution vs. longer term exposure to lower levels of air pollution. These findings highlight pollutant emissions and exposures spatial and temporal heterogeneity and associated health effects.",

            "abstract": "We present a user-friendly modeling tool on MS Excel to predict the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and estimate potential carbon sequestration from the coastal wetlands. The dominant controls of wetland GHG fluxes and their relative mechanistic linkages with various hydro-climatic, sea level, biogeochemical and ecological drivers were first determined by employing a systematic data-analytics method, including Pearson correlation matrix, principal component and factor analyses, and exploratory partial least squares regressions. The mechanistic knowledge and understanding was then utilized to develop parsimonious non-linear (power-law) models to predict wetland carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes based on a sub-set of climatic, hydrologic and environmental drivers such as the photosynthetically active radiation, soil temperature, water depth, and soil salinity. The models were tested with field data for multiple sites and seasons (2012-13) collected from the Waquoit Bay, MA. The model estimated the annual wetland carbon storage by up-scaling the instantaneous predicted fluxes to an extended growing season (e.g., May-October) and by accounting for the net annual lateral carbon fluxes between the wetlands and estuary. The Excel Spreadsheet model is a simple ecological engineering tool for coastal carbon management and their incorporation into a potential carbon market under a changing climate, sea level and environment. Specifically, the model can help to determine appropriate GHG offset protocols and monitoring plans for projects that focus on tidal wetland restoration and maintenance.",

            "abstract": "Current approaches to quantifying surface-atmosphere fluxes of carbon often combine inventories of fossil fuel carbon emissions (ffCO2) and biosphere flux estimates with atmospheric measurements to drive forward and inverse-atmospheric modeling at high spatial and temporal resolutions (1km grids, hourly time steps have become common). Given that over 70% of total ffCO2 emissions are attributable to urban areas, accurate estimates of ffCO2 at urban scales are critical to support emissions mitigation policies at state and local levels. A successful regional or national carbon monitoring system requires a careful quantification of the uncertainties associated with estimates of both ffCO2 and biogenic carbon fluxes.\nErrors in the spatial distribution of ffCO2 priors used to inform atmospheric transport models can bias posterior flux estimates, and potentially provide misleading information to decision makers on the impact of policies. Most current ffCO2 priors are either too coarsely resolved in time and space, or suffer from poorly quantified errors in spatial distributions at local scales. Accurately downscaling aggregate activity data requires a careful understanding of the potentially non-linear relationships between source processes and spatial proxies. We report on ongoing work to develop an integrated, high-resolution carbon monitoring system for the Northeastern U.S., and discuss insights into the impact of spatial scaling on model uncertainty.\nWe use a newly developed dataset of hourly surface carbon fluxes for all human and biogenic sources at 1km grid resolution for the years 2013 and 2014. To attain these spatial and temporal resolutions, ffCO2 flux estimates were subject to varying degrees of aggregation and/or downscaling depending on the native source data for each sector. We will discuss several important examples of how the choice of scaling variables and priors influences the spatial distribution CO2 and CH4 retrievals.",

            "abstract": "In addition to the classical El Niño, other structures in tropical Pacific SST anomalies have a strong influence on extratropical weather. Since 1979 the second EOF of global SST is a mode with warm SST in the western equatorial Pacific and cool SST in the eastern equatorial Pacific. This pattern has a strong signal in the extratropical North Pacific associated with the Rossby wave anomalies that are forced in the tropics and propagate over North America, and has been termed the North Pacific Mode. This mode is associated with a ridge on the west coast of North American and a trough downstream of the Rocky Mountains. This mode of variability had a strong influence on the winters of 2014 and 2015, and appears to have played a strong role in the cold winter of 2014 in central and eastern North America. This pattern persisted from the middle of 2013 through at least July of 2015, and also seems to have an effect on summer weather anomalies of the same nature. In the past the strength of the North Pacific Mode has preceded strong El Niño events, after which point it went into a strongly negative phase. This history suggests a transition to a more classical El Niño anomaly pattern for the winter of 2016, which would produce a warmer winter in central and eastern North America and cool and moist conditions over the Gulf of Mexico.",

            "abstract": "The National Risk Assessment Partnership has developed a suite of reduced-order models (ROMs) that can be used to predict the impact of CO2 and brine leaks on overlying aquifers. The these computationally-efficient models are based on field-scale reactive transport simulations. The ROMs reproduce the ensemble behavior of large numbers of simulations very well and thus are well-suited to applications that consider a large number of scenarios such as sensitivity analysis, risk assessment, and uncertainty analysis. In this presentation, we seek to demonstrate applicability of ROM-based ensemble analysis. We consider two questions. First, what types of decisions could these analyses support? Second, what types of aquifers could these ROMs be applied to?\nFour examples are presented for applying these ROMs, in ensemble mode, to supporting decisions in the early stages in a hypothetical geologic CO2 sequestration project. These decisions pertain to site selection, site characterization, monitoring network evaluation, and health impacts. In all these cases, we consider potential brine/CO2 leak rates at the base of the aquifer to be uncertain. We show that derived probabilities provide information relevant to the decision at hand.\nAlthough the ROMs were developed using site-specific data from two aquifers (the High Plains, and the unconfined, carbonate portion of the Edwards), the models accept aquifer characteristics as variable inputs and so they may have more broad applicability. Of the nine water quality metrics the ROMs can predict (pH, TDS, 4 trace metals, 3 organic compounds) we conclude that pH and TDS predictions are the most transferable to other aquifers. Guidelines are presented for determining the aquifer types for which the ROMs should be applicable.",

            "abstract": "Sustainability of water resources is a particular concern in arid and semiarid regions including the southwestern USA. With increasing water needs and diminishing supplies due to drought, surface water shortfalls are leading to increased groundwater extraction. Groundwater extraction may provide short-term resiliency of the hydrologic system at the cost of long-term resource sustainability. Proactive conjunctive use of surface and subsurface water requires research-based information. The inaccessibility and variability in groundwater data can make it challenging to examine impacts of drought, changes in agriculture, and population variability. The purpose of this study was to advance our understanding of changes in groundwater levels and how they relate to water use dynamics. We utilized both spatial and temporal methods for evaluation of changes in groundwater level data. We compiled monitoring data provided by several government agencies in New Mexico, simulated, with loess regression, the temporal trends between data collection periods, and used geographic information system software to spatially represent changes in groundwater levels for various time intervals. Wells located closer to major rivers typically had lower rates of decrease in groundwater elevation. Areas without surface water had higher rates of groundwater elevation decrease. Several regions had reversals in groundwater-change trends from increasing groundwater elevation to decreasing and vice versa. There were some anomalously increasing groundwater elevations even when overall groundwater elevations decreased in certain areas. The rate of water-level change as a function of time shows promise for evaluation of groundwater use and dynamics, thus providing the basis for improved groundwater sustainability.",

In particular, how urban stormwater systems are designed have implications for flood regimes and biogeochemical transformations. Flood and stormwater management paradigms have shifted over time at large scales, but patterns and drivers of local stormwater infrastructure designs are unknown. We describe patterns of infrastructure design and use over the 20th century in three cities along an urbanization gradient in Utah: Salt Lake, Logan, and Heber City. To understand changes in stormwater management paradigms we conducted a historical media content analysis of newspaper articles related to flooding and stormwater in Salt Lake City from 1900 to 2012.\nStormwater infrastructure design varied spatially and temporally, both within and among cities. All three cities transitioned from agriculture to urban land use, and legacies were evident in the use of agricultural canals for stormwater conveyance. Salt Lake City infrastructure transitioned from centralized storm sewers during early urbanization to decentralized detention systems in the 1970’s. In contrast, newer cities, Logan and Heber, saw parallel increases in conveyance and detention systems with urbanization. The media analysis revealed significant changes in flood and stormwater management paradigms over the 20th century that were driven by complex factors including top-down regulations, local disturbances, and funding constraints. Early management paradigms focused on infrastructural solutions to address problems with private and public property damage, whereas more recent paradigms focus on behavioral solutions to flooding and green infrastructure solutions to prevent negative impacts of urban stormwater on local ecosystems. Changes in human perceptions of the environment can affect how we design urban ecosystems, with important implications for ecological functions.",

            "abstract": "The last decade has seen a substantial expansion of geophysical observations. Exploiting this wealth of data involves large ill-conditioned inverse problems requiring large numbers of uncertain parameters. A common approach in geophysics is to use some form of regularization that transforms the inversion into a well-conditioned optimization problem. While this approach is convenient and computationally inexpensive, the inherent non-uniqueness of our problems suggest that we should not simply search for a single optimal model, but rather attempt to describe the ensemble of plausible models that can fit the data and are consistent with prior information. This talk will present various applications of full Bayesian analysis techniques to large ill-posed inverse problems in geophysics. Despite significant computational cost, Bayesian sampling is a powerful tool to combine prior information, theoretical knowledge and data in order to address scientific problems probabilistically. We shall illustrate this by showing recent results for two types of problems: (1) the study of earthquakes sources and (2) imaging of the Earth interior. In particular, we will present different strategies that can be employed in order to achieve realistic uncertainty estimates.",

This has arisen, in part, from the fact microphysical processes cannot be measured directly; instead, cloud properties, which can be measured, are and have been used to validate model results.\nThe utilization of current and future global high-resolution models is rapidly increasing and are at what has been traditional CRM resolutions and are using microphysics schemes that were developed in traditional CRMs. A potential NASA satellite mission called the Cloud and Precipitation Processes Mission (CaPPM) is currently being planned for submission to the NASA Earth Science Decadal Survey. This mission could provide the necessary global estimates of cloud and precipitation properties with which to evaluate and improve dynamical and microphysical parameterizations and the feedbacks. In order to facilitate the development of this mission, CRM simulations have been conducted to identify microphysical processes responsible for the greatest uncertainties in CRMs.\nIn this talk, we will present results from numerical simulations conducted using two CRMs (NU-WRF and RAMS) with different dynamics, radiation, land surface and microphysics schemes. Specifically, we will conduct sensitivity tests to examine the uncertainty of the some of the key ice processes (i.e. riming, melting, freezing and shedding) in these two-microphysics schemes. The idea is to quantify how these two different models’ respond (surface rainfall and its intensity, strength of cloud drafts, LWP/IWP, convective-stratiform-anvil area distribution) to changes of these key ice microphysics processes. Preliminary results indicate similar model responses to changes of the riming process, thus suggesting that CRM simulations are particularly sensitive to riming independent of the modeling framework or the dynamical core. We will present more quantitative analyses of the models’ responses to the meeting.",

            "abstract": "The new sunspot number series introduces a number of changes, including dropping the multiplicative factor of ~0.6 that was previously used to bring the numbers into agreement with those obtained by Rudolf Wolf with his small telescope in the mid-19th century. Using the new numbers clearly requires changing the functional relationships between sunspot number and other solar activity indices (e.g. sunspot area, 10.7 cm radio flux, total solar irradiance, x-ray flares, and geomagnetic activity). We find that, in most cases, these relationships exhibit less scatter with the new numbers. Solar cycle prediction methods must also be recalibrated with the new numbers. The new numbers clearly indicate the need for a reassessment of the impact of solar variability on terrestrial climate. There is now no appearance of a significant secular rise in solar activity levels since the early 18th century, suggesting, that earlier estimates of the impact of solar activity on climate should be revised downward.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands not adjacent to streams (i.e. “non-adjacent wetlands”) are hypothesized to affect downgradient hydrology in a number of ways. Non-adjacent wetlands may, for example, attenuate peak flows, serve as focal points for groundwater recharge, and decrease streamflow variability. The lack of spatially and temporally continuous data elucidating these relationships makes hydrological models an important medium for testing these hypotheses at broad spatial scales (e.g., mesoscale watersheds). We present results from two case studies that apply a hydrological model modified to represent non-adjacent wetland hydrological processes and thereby evaluate their watershed-scale aggregate hydrological effects. We focus on non-adjacent wetlands in two North American landscapes: (1) a ~202 km2 watershed in the Coastal Plain with an extensive distribution of Carolina Bay wetlands and (2) a ~1672 km2 watershed in the Great Plains, which is characterized by a dense distribution of landscape depressions (i.e., prairie potholes). Preliminary results suggest that non-adjacent wetlands significantly affect downgradient hydrology in both landscapes – specifically the baseflow and quickflow components of the hydrograph. However, the emergent watershed-scale hydrological effects of non-adjacent wetlands in the two diverse landscapes differ widely, primarily in response to the varying importance of wetland (e.g., discharge, recharge, flow-through) and wetland to stream transport (e.g., surface, shallow subsurface, deep groundwater flows) functions in these systems. We highlight the watershed-scale hydrological effects of non-adjacent wetlands in these two physiographic settings and describe the need for additional analyses of wetlands in disparate landscapes, using alternative conceptual and simulation models.",

With funding coming from the Bureau of Reclamation and the US Army Corps of Engineers, a series of self-paced online lessons and live courses targeted at technical climate change and water science professionals have already been delivered. Since it’s release in 2012, the first self-paced lesson developed under this partnership entitled, “Preparing Hydro-climate Inputs for Climate Change in Water Resource Planning”, has been taken over 2600 times. Users have come from federal, state, and local agencies as well as academia, government and private sectors around the US as well as from other countries. Additionally, the most popular multi-day course, Hydrologic Impacts Under Climate Change (HIUCC), has been offered to a diverse audience in both residence and virtual formats.\nThis presentation provides an overview of the training materials developed through this partnership as well as plans for future offerings. A recommended set of lessons for all users who wish explore the open materials will be highlighted, including excerpts from the newest materials covering climate change influences on water temperature for inland streams and watershed and channel sedimentation. These self-paced, online materials are currently freely available on the of the MetEd Web site (http://www.meted.ucar.edu) via the “Education & Training”, “Climate” topic area. Users interested in directly accessing the materials can take these and many other lessons at http://meted.ucar.edu/climate. Additionally, the presentation highlights opportunities for learners to register for ongoing multi-day courses taught both live in person and at a distance.\nNow, in the beginning of the 6th year of partnership, new initiatives to train non-technical staff in many areas of climate science and water change management as well as training technical staff in topics related to coastal vulnerabilities and sea level change are underway. New self-paced training and live instructor courses will be developed to support these efforts and details will be provided in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the impacts caused by engineered activities in the deep subsurface, such as waste disposal, necessitates a comprehensive borehole monitoring strategy. Similarly, characterization of continental subsurface properties for scientific understanding requires optimal use of deep boreholes. While surface-based and other remote geophysical methods can provide information on the structure, lithology and properties of subsurface formations, the scale of investigation is typically large and some properties require direct measurement, e.g. verification of the geochemical conditions. Validation of remote sensing data, along with increasing data spatial resolution, requires measurements from boreholes that penetrate the formations of interest. Unfortunately, the high cost of drilling deep wellbores and deploying instrumentation systems constrains the number of dedicated monitoring borings as well as limits the technologies that can be incorporated in a borehole completion. We recently completed a Modular Borehole Monitoring (MBM) Program to develop a robust suite of well-based tools optimized for subsurface monitoring of CO2 injected into sedimentary basins. These tools included seismic sensing, temperature sensing, in-situ fluid sampling and in-situ fluid pressure measurement. as part of a comprehensive well-based monitoring program. Characterization of crystalline rock requires a similar suite of tools. A MBM system should have enough flexibility to be easily reconfigured for various borehole geometries and geologies. The MBM Program sought to provide operators with a turn-key, fully engineered design that incorporated key technologies, could function over the long time-span necessary for monitoring engineered activities, and meet industry acceptable risk profiles for deep-well installations. We will present design information and monitoring results from previous installations and discuss needs for crystalline rock monitoring.",

            "abstract": "A human mission to Mars presents many challenges, not least of which is the radiation exposure that crew members will certainly receive in all phases of the journey, but most critically during the transits to and from Mars. Measurements from the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) aboard the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover, made both in flight and on the surface of Mars, confirm previous estimates that crew members under reasonable shielding would receive a dose equivalent of about 1 Sievert on a 1000-day mission. In standard radiation biology, an acute exposure to 1 Sievert would be expected to increase lifetime fatal cancer risk by about 5%. This is well beyond the currently allowed 3% risk increase limit used by NASA and JAXA. Perhaps more significantly, the nature of exposure in space differs greatly from the terrestrial exposures that lead to the 5% estimate -- in space, the exposure is received at a very low dose rate, and includes a significant component from heavy ions in the Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). Acute exposures to Solar Energetic Particles are also possible, but the generally lower energies of SEPs (kinetic energies typically below 100 MeV/nuc) mean that modest amounts of shielding are effective against them. Thus the greater concern for long-duration deep-space missions is the GCR exposure.\nIn this presentation, I will briefly review the MSL-RAD data and discuss current approaches to radiation risk estimation, including the NASA limit of 3% at the 95% confidence level. Recent results from the NASA radiation biology program indicate that cancer may not be the only risk that needs to be considered, with emerging concerns about cardiovascular and central nervous system health. These health effects are not accounted for in the current methodology and could potentially be threatening to mission success if they manifest in the course of the mission, rather than appearing many years after the exposure as radiation-induced cancer typically does.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate clumped isotope geothermometry is a powerful tool for reconstructing past temperatures, both in surface environments and in the shallow crust. The method is based on heavy isotope \"clumps\" within single carbonate groups (e.g., 13C18O16O2-2), whose overabundance beyond levels predicted by chance is determined by mineralization temperature. The degree of clumped isotope overabundance can change at elevated temperatures (ca. >100ºC) owing to solid-state diffusion of C and O through the mineral lattice. Understanding the kinetics of this clumped isotope reordering process is a prerequisite for application to geological questions involving samples that have been heated in the subsurface. Thus far, the effect of water on reordering kinetics has not been explored. The presence of water dramatically increases rates of oxygen self-diffusion in calcite, but whether this water-enhanced diffusion is limited to the mineral surface or extends into the bulk crystal lattice is not clear. Here we present experimentally determined Arrhenius parameters for reordering rates in optical calcite heated under aqueous high pressure (100 MPa) conditions. We observe only marginal increases in reordering rates under these wet, high pressure conditions relative to rates observed for the same material reacted under dry, low pressure conditions. The near identical clumped isotope reordering rates for wet and dry conditions contrasts with the orders of magnitude increase in oxygen diffusivity at the mineral surface when water is present. This suggests the latter effect arises from surface reactions that have minimal influence on the diffusivity of C or O in the bulk mineral. Our results also imply that previously published reordering kinetics determined under dry, low pressure experimental conditions are applicable to geological samples that have been heated in the presence of water.",

The coupling between hydrological and biogeochemical processes is particularly evident in drylands, but also in areas with strong seasonal precipitation patterns or in mesic systems during droughts. Moreover, this coupling is apparent at all levels in the ecosystems – from soil microbial cells to whole plants to landscapes. A holistic approach is essential to fully understand function and processes in water-limited ecosystems and to predict their responses to environmental change. We examine some of the mechanisms responsible for microbial and vegetation responses to moisture inputs in water-limited ecosystems through a synthesis of existing literature and we also summarize the modeling advances in addressing these interactions. This paper focuses on three opportunities to advance coupled hydrological and biogeochemical research: (1) improved quantitative understanding of mechanisms linking hydrological and biogeochemical variations in drylands, (2) experimental and theoretical approaches that describe linkages between hydrology and biogeochemistry (particularly across scales), and (3) the use of these tools and insights to address critical dryland issues of societal relevance.",

However, the role of soil organisms, including viruses in C and N sequestration in soil has not been studied as extensively. Φ6, a member of the cystoviridae family, is a bacteriophage that infects Pseudomonas syringae, a common plant pathogen known to readily form biofilms.\nThe small mineral fraction (< 0.2 μm) of soil and Φ6 are colloidal particles, therefore aggregation can be explained by DLVO (Derjaguin & Landau, Verwey & Overbeek) theory. Time-resolved visible-light turbidity measurements were used to calculate the heteroaggregation rates of Φ6 with the sediments. Samples were suspended in a low-concentration cation buffer so that the kinetics were in the reaction limited cluster aggregation (RLCA) regime in where the probability of two particles adhering after collision is determined by the interaction forces between the particles.\nAt neutral pH to slightly acidic pH, Φ6 is slightly negatively charged; montmorillonite and illite are negatively charged; and kaolinite and goethite are positively charged. In isolation, neither Φ6 nor the sediments aggregated in the modified buffer. However, in mixtures, Φ6 and montmorillonite, and Φ6 and illite, exhibited increases in turbidity, indicating heteroaggregation. Neither Φ6 and kaolinite, nor Φ6 and goethite, exhibited increased turbidity upon mixing indicating little or no aggregation. These results suggest that the interaction of the virus with the sediments is governed by hydrophobic rather than electrostatic forces. Heteroaggregation rates were calculated from the time rate of change of the turbidity.",

            "abstract": "Marine microbes produce a wide variety of metal binding organic ligands that regulate the solubility and availability of biologically important metals such as iron, copper, cobalt, and zinc. In marine environments where the availability of these metals limits microbial growth and carbon fixation rates, the ability to access organically bound metal confers a competitive advantage. Thus, the speciation of metals and the compounds that microbes produced to acquire and detoxify them play an important role in biogeochemical carbon and metal cycling. However, the source, abundance, and identity of these compounds are poorly constrained.\nTo investigate these processes, we recently developed sensitive methodologies that offer a compound-specific window into marine metal speciation by combining trace metal clean sample collection and liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICPMS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESIMS). LC-ICPMS is used to investigate the abundance and chemical diversity of metal-binding organics in the marine environment. We then use LC-ESIMS to provide information on the identity of these metal-organic complexes. With algorithms that search for isotopic patterns, we can determine the mass of metal-organic compounds within ESIMS spectra using natural abundance isotope distributions or through exchange experiments with a rare isotope spike.\nUsing these techniques, we have begun to explore the distribution and diversity of metal binding organic matter. In cultures, LC-ICPMS-ESIMS provides a method for rapid untargeted screening for metallophores that are produced for metal uptake and detoxification. We have identified new members of siderophore classes including synechobactins and marinobactins produced by cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. Applications to environmental samples have revealed a wide diversity of both known and new metal compounds that vary across nutrient regimes and influence metal bioavailability. The ability to map and characterize these compounds has opened up opportunities to better understand mechanisms that link metals with the microbes that use them.",

            "abstract": "Pluto and its satellites were explored by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft in 2015, with closest approach to Pluto on 14 July 2015. Pluto’s surface is found to be remarkably diverse in terms of its range of landforms, terrain ages, and albedo, color, and composition gradients. Strong evidence was found for geologically young surface units, a water-ice crust, ice convection, and glacial flow. Pluto’s wide range of surface expressions and long term activity raise fundamental questions about how small planets can have active processes billions of years after their formation. Pluto’s atmosphere was found to be more extended than anticipated, to have an extensive global haze layer, several new trace species, and a low surface pressure of ~10 microbars. Pluto’s large satellite Charon’s surface geology is also diverse, displaying tectonics and evidence for a heterogeneous crustal composition; Charon's north pole displays puzzling dark terrain; no evidence for a Charon atmosphere has been found. Sizes and reflectivities for all four of Pluto's small satellites will be reported. Despite much improved diameter limits, no new satellites of Pluto were detected by New Horizons. In this review talk I will summarize these and other findings about the Pluto system.",

            "abstract": "Greater precipitation falls in the northern hemisphere (NH) tropics than in the southern hemisphere (SH) tropics over the course of the year. Here, we examine how Andes topography, ocean heat fluxes, and the presence of land affect the location of tropical precipitation in an idealized aquaplanet version of GFDL's AM2.1 GCM. We find that all three of these features influence which hemisphere has greater precipitation, though to different extents. The addition of Andes topography leads to a small regional northward shift of rainfall, but realistic ocean heat transport leads to a much larger and more global northward shift of precipitation. In simulations with an idealized NH subtropical continent, the location of tropical precipitation depends on the land albedo and continent width. To demonstrate this, we place a single Sahara-like rectangular continent with a width of 60-degrees and an albedo of 0.3 into the NH. This simulation has greater SH tropical precipitation, despite the NH continent's hot surface: the high land albedo increases the NH deficit of energy, creating an anomalous Hadley circulation that imports energy to the NH and moisture to the SH. As a result, the hemisphere with greater temperature is not the hemisphere with greater precipitation. However, simulations with wider continents and the same fixed albedo shift precipitation into the NH as the continent widens. While northward ocean heat transport is likely the reason for the observed annual NH peak in tropical precipitation, these experiments show that continents and topography also play an important role in modifying its location.",

            "abstract": "Modeled estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) calculated with CLM4.5 at 4 km horizontal resolution were optimized using a classical Bayesian inversion approach with atmospheric mixing ratio observations from a dense tower network in Oregon. We optimized NEE in monthly batches for the years 2012 through 2014, and determined the associated reduction in flux uncertainties broken up by sub-domains. The WRF-STILT transport model was deployed to link modelled fluxes of CO2 to the concentrations from 5 high precision and accuracy CO2 observation towers equipped with CRDS analyzers. To find the best compromise between aggregation errors and the degrees of freedom in the system, we developed an approach for the spatial structuring of our domain that was informed by an unsupervised clustering approach based on flux values of the prior state vector and information about the land surface, soil, and vegetation distribution that was used in the model. To assess the uncertainty of the transport modeling component within our inverse optimization framework we used the data of 7 airborne measurement campaigns over the Oregon domain during the study period providing detailed information about the errors in the model boundary–layer height and wind field of the transport model. The optimized model was then used to estimate future CO2 budgets for Oregon, including potential effects of LULC changes from conventional agriculture towards energy crops.",

These data sets will be used to investigate the light scattering properties of rocks and soils along the Curiosity traverse using radiative transfer models. Images were acquired by the Mastcam-34 (M-34) camera on Sols 872-892 at 8 times of day (Mojave drill location), Sols 914-917 (Telegraph Peak drill location) at 9 times of day, and Sols 1000-1003 at 8 times of day (Stimson-Murray Formation contact near Marias Pass). Data sets were acquired using filters centered at 445, 527, 751, and 1012 nm, and the images were jpeg-compressed. Data sets typically were pointed ~east and ~west to provide phase angle coverage from near 0° to 125-140° for a variety of rocks and soils. Also acquired on Sols 917-918 at the Telegraph Peak site was a multiple time-of-day Mastcam sequence pointed southeast using only the broadband Bayer filters that provided losslessly compressed images with phase angles ~55-129°. Navcam stereo images were also acquired with each data set to provide broadband photometry and terrain measurements for computing surface normals and local incidence and emission angles used in photometric modeling. On Sol 1028, the MAHLI camera was used as a goniometer to acquire images at 20 arm positions, all centered at the same location within the work volume from a near-constant distance of 85 cm from the surface. Although this experiment was run at only one time of day (~15:30 LTST), it provided phase angle coverage from ~30° to ~111°. The terrain included the contact between the uppermost portion of the Murray Formation and the Stimson sandstones, and was the first acquisition of both Mastcam and MALHI photometry images at the same rover location. The MAHLI images also allowed construction of a 3D shape model of the Stimson-Murray contact region. The attached figure shows a phase color composite of the western Stimson area, created using phase angles of 8°, 78°, and 130° at 751 nm. The red areas correspond to highly backscattering materials that appear to concentrate along linear fractures throughout this area. The blue areas correspond to more forward scattering materials dispersed through the stratigraphic sequence.",

Samples (mud, homogenized soft mats and endoevaporites) were incubated anaerobically with deoxygenated site water, and the increase in methane concentration through time in the headspaces of the incubation vials was used to determine methane production rates. To ascertain the substrates used by the methanogens, 13C-labeled methylamines, methanol, dimethylsulfide, acetate or bicarbonate were added to the incubations (one substrate per vial) and the stable isotopic composition of the resulting methane was measured. The vials amended with 13C-labeled methylamines produced the most 13C-enriched methane, generally followed by the 13C-labeled methanol-amended vials. The stable isotope data and the methane production rates were used to determine first order rate constants for each of the substrates at each of the sites. Estimates of individual substrate use revealed that the methylamines produced 55 to 92% of the methane generated, while methanol was responsible for another 8 to 40%.",

            "abstract": "Water managers at all levels of government worldwide are challenged to make decisions that support the long-term sustainability of our groundwater resources. The goal of our research is to develop a decision-support system that utilizes abundant remote sensing data, integrated with other forms of hydrologic data, as key inputs to an integrated surface water-groundwater model. We are developing such a prototype system for application in the San Luis Valley of Colorado and Butte County in California. Our approach incorporates the analysis of  >20 years (1992-present) of data to determine the spatial and temporal links between the principle components of the basin-scale water cycle; the model can be continually updated with the addition of newly acquired data. The comparison of model input data derived from remote sensing measurements to those obtained from currently employed sources (e.g. the comparison of rainfall data from TRMM to rain gauge data), allows us to assess any impact that converting to remote sensing data might have on the sensitivity or accuracy of the model. Central to our approach is the use of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) deformation images to provide head measurements in the semi/confined aquifers, commonly the least well characterized element of the groundwater system. We have recently developed analysis and interpretation methods, utilizing local well calibration, that allow us to obtain long-term and seasonal head variation at a spatial resolution of ~100 m with sub-meter precision. This gives us the ability to fill in the large temporal and spatial gaps in the traditional well data, including head estimates in regions prior to the existence of any wells. The integration of InSAR and other forms of remote sensing data with hydrologic data addresses critical needs in model development and monitoring, both of which are key elements in making decisions about activities that could impact the sustainability of our groundwater resources.",

            "abstract": "As the climate models (GCMs and RCMs) fail to satisfactorily reproduce the real-world surface weather regime, various statistical methods are applied to downscale GCM/RCM outputs into site-specific weather series. The stochastic weather generators are among the most favourite downscaling methods capable to produce realistic (observed‑like) meteorological inputs for agrological, hydrological and other impact models used in assessing sensitivity of various ecosystems to climate change/variability. To name their advantages, the generators may (i) produce arbitrarily long multi-variate synthetic weather series representing both present and changed climates (in the latter case, the generators are commonly modified by GCM/RCM-based climate change scenarios), (ii) be run in various time steps and for multiple weather variables (the generators reproduce the correlations among variables), (iii) be interpolated (and run also for sites where no weather data are available to calibrate the generator).\nThis contribution will compare two stochastic daily weather generators in terms of their ability to reproduce various features of the daily weather series. M&Rfi is a parametric generator: Markov chain model is used to model precipitation occurrence, precipitation amount is modelled by the Gamma distribution, and the 1st order autoregressive model is used to generate non-precipitation surface weather variables. The non-parametric GoMeZ generator is based on the nearest neighbours resampling technique making no assumption on the distribution of the variables being generated. Various settings of both weather generators will be assumed in the present validation tests. The generators will be validated in terms of (a) extreme temperature and precipitation characteristics (annual and 30‑years extremes and maxima of duration of hot/cold/dry/wet spells); (b) selected validation statistics developed within the frame of VALUE project. The tests will be based on observational weather series from several European stations available from the ECA&D database.\nAcknowledgements: The weather generator is developed and validated within the frame of projects WG4VALUE (sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR), and VALUE (COST ES 1102 action).",

            "abstract": "Global food security is an elusive challenge and important policy focus from the community to the globe. Food is provisioned through food systems that may be simple or labyrinthine, yet each has vulnerabilities to climate change through its effects on food production, transportation, storage, and other integral food system activities. At the same time, the future of food systems is sensitive to socioeconomic trajectories determined by choices made outside of the food system, itself. Constrictions for any reason can lead to decreased food availability, access, utilization, or stability – that is, to diminished food security. Possible changes in trade and other U.S. relationships to the rest of the world under changing conditions to the end of the century are considered through integrated assessment modelling under a range of emissions scenarios.\nClimate change is likely to diminish continued progress on global food security through production disruptions leading to local availability limitations and price increases, interrupted transport conduits, and diminished food safety, among other causes. In the near term, some high-latitude production export regions may benefit from changes in climate.\nThe types and price of food imports is likely to change, as are export demands, affecting U.S. consumers and producers. Demands placed on foreign assistance programs may increase, as may demand for advanced technologies.\nAdaptation across the food system has great potential to manage climate change effects on food security, and the complexity of the food system offers multiple potential points of intervention for decision makers at every level. However, effective adaptation is subject to highly localized conditions and socioeconomic factors, and the technical feasibility of an adaptive intervention is not necessarily a guarantee of its application if it is unaffordable or does not provide benefits within a relatively short time frame.",

            "abstract": "The 2013 March 17 storm has excellent coverage from ground-based all-sky imagers and radars and the Van Allen Probes, as well as from the usual ground-based instruments and low-altitude spacecraft. The storm shock impacted the magnetosphere during a period when the auroral oval was extremely thin, with some weak activity and weak duskside convection that penetrated to mid-latitudes. This impact drove activity almost immediately: dramatic poleward expansion of the poleward boundary of the auroral oval, strong auroral activity, and strong penetrating mid-latitude convection and ionospheric currents.\nDuring the expansion phase, the auroral oval expanded gradually equatorward in association with mid-latitude electric fields. These electric fields were at first relatively smooth as is often employed in storm modeling, but then became extremely bursty and were associated with equatorward extending auroral streamers. These two different modes of mid-latitude electric fields during the expansion phase should give substantial, but different storm-time effects within the ionosphere and ring current/radiation belts. We see evidence for this in total electron content and particle injections into the storm-time ring current, but much more should become apparent as additional ionospheric and magnetospheric datasets are synergistically brought into the study of this event, as well as of other events.",

            "abstract": "Sea level-change pumping of mantle melt to create abyssal hills is a very innovative and elegant hypothesis. However, I see 2 issues: 1. Abyssal hill observations indicate that they are bounded by normal faults in most cases. 2. The resolution of the crustal accretion “tape recorder” and its ability to accurately record cycles as short as 20Kyr and 40Kyr is limited given the width of the zone of crustal accretion. Magnetic anomaly polarity transition widths give us one measure of estimating the resolution of this tape recorder. Based on these measurements, the half-width of the zone of crustal accretion ranges from 1-8 km, with 2-4 km being typical. At a half-spreading rate of 3 cm/yr, a width of 3km of crust is created during the 100Kyr Milankovich cycle, ~1.2 km during the 40Kyr cycle, and 600m during the 20Kyr cycle, so only the 100K signal is likely to be resolvable. In contrast, consider the effect of pressure changes on fault slip. In critically stressed lithosphere, a small change in pressure can produce nearly instantaneous slip. For example, pressure changes of only ~0.1 MPa near injection wells in OK, TX trigger earthquakes at depths of 3-5 km (Mark Zoback, personal comm.). This pressure change is equivalent to a 100 m sea level change. For the 20Kyr and 40Kyr cycles, sea level-change pumping of fault slip may dominate because fault uplift of abyssal hills is not smeared by the time-averaging effects of crustal accretion. The spacing of the abyssal hills in this scenario would be controlled by the elastic thickness and flexural rigidity of young lithosphere. Faulting also can accommodate variations in melt supply, with most of the melt freezing at depth; this would explain why we observe dominantly tectonic rather than constructional volcanic origins of abyssal hills. If abyssal hills are caused by variations in melt production, the crust should be measurably thicker beneath the axes of the hills. If faulting dominates, crustal thickness would be more uniform. This would be a key test.",

            "abstract": "Soil water dynamics within a thick vadose (unsaturated) zone is a key component in the hydrologic cycle in arid regions. The partitioning of precipitation and soil water into fluxes of percolation to the subsurface, surface runoff and evapotranspiration at the land-atmosphere-vegetation interface is accompanied by characteristic δ2H and δ18O values of water. The isotopic composition of the transpiration flux is very similar to soil water, since the uptake by plant roots is usually not associated with isotope fractionation. The isotopic composition of evaporation flux from unsaturated soils, which becomes an important flux in arid regions, has extensively been modeled by the Craig-Gordon model with the assumption that equilibrium isotopic fractionation between adsorbed/pored condensed water within soils and water vapor is identical to that between bulk liquid water and vapor. To test this critical assumption, we have conducted laboratory experiments on equilibrium isotope fractionation between adsorbed water in mesoporous silica (15nm pore, as soil analog) and the vapor. Firstly, the adsorption/desorption isotherms of H2O and N2 in the silica are determined at 30°C and liq-N2 temperature, respectively, and large hysteresis loops were observed. Secondly, the isotope fractionation factors between condensed water in the silica pores and the vapor (18αsilica water-vapor and 2αsilica water-vapor for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes, respectively) were determined at 30°C along the adsorption curve from near saturation pressure (p/po=1). We found that 18αsilica water-vapor values are smaller than that between free liquid-vapor (1.0088) and progressively decreased from1.0083 at p/po= 0.9 to 1.0054 at p/po=0.5, establishing a trend very similar to the isotherm curve. The corresponding 2αsilica water-vapor values are also smaller than that of free liquid-vapor system (1.0740) and decreased from 1.0651 at p/po=0.9 to 1.0295 at p/po=0.5. Our experimental results challenge the long-held assumption and the finding needs to be considered in the interpretation and modeling of the isotopic compositions of soil water and paleoclimate proxies in arid regions.",

            "abstract": "As H2O-rich melts ascend from the base of the mantle wedge into the hotter overlying mantle, reaction occurs between melts and the surrounding mantle. These mantle melt-mantle wall rock reactions have been little studied under the wet conditions of subduction zone settings. Here, we present the results of an experimental approach to quantify the effect of such reactions on melt composition. We have conducted a series of experiments that react deeper melts from 1.6 GPa with shallower mantle at 1.2 GPa under H2O-undersaturated conditions. The ratio of melt:mantle is varied to determine the influence of percent reaction on phase stability and on the compositions of the resulting melts.\nExperiments conducted using 70% deeper melt and 30% shallower mantle contain glass (gl) + olivine (ol) + clinopyroxene (cpx) + spinel (sp). Decreasing the melt:mantle ratio to 20% melt and 80% mantle stabilizes orthopyroxene (opx) in the crystallizing assemblage, as demonstrated by the following crystallization sequence produced using a melt:mantle ratio of 20:80 over a temperature range of 1180-1120 °C: gl + ol + sp; gl + ol + opx + sp; and gl + ol + opx + cpx + sp. For all ratios investigated, high SiO2, high MgO melts are produced that contain ~6 wt% H2O. Decreasing the melt:mantle ratio from 70:30 to 20:80 causes small increases in SiO2 (55-56 wt% to 58-61 wt%) but significant decreases in Al2O3 (15-18 wt% to 10-14 wt%).\nUsing the experimental results, we develop a quantitative model to predict changes in melt composition as a function of reaction with the surrounding mantle. The experimental and model results presented determine how reaction within the mantle can alter the range of melts that erupt into the crust at convergent margins.",

            "abstract": "Iron formations (IFs), Fe- and Si-rich chemical sediments common in Precambrian successions, preserve key information about the compositional, biological, and oxidative evolution of the Precambrian ocean. Stable Si isotopes (δ30Si) of IF have been used to infer paleo-oceanic composition, and secular variations in δ30Si may reflect ancient biogeochemical cycles. The δ30Si of primary Fe-Si precipitates that formed IF depends not only on the δ30Si of aqueous silica but also on the precipitation mechanism. Multiple formation mechanisms for these primary precipitates are plausible. Aqueous Si may have adsorbed on newly precipitated iron oxyhydroxide surfaces; alternatively, Fe and Si may have coprecipitated as a single phase. Here we explore variations in the Si isotope fractionation factor (ε) with Fe-Si aqueous interaction mechanism (adsorption vs. coprecipitation). In adsorption experiments, sodium silicate solutions (pH 8.1, 125-2000 µM Si) were reacted with iron oxide particles (hematite, ferrihydrite, goethite, and magnetite) for 24 to 72 hours. Resultant solutions had δ30Si between 0 and +6‰. Calculated ε varied significantly with oxide mineralogy and morphology. For ferrihydrite, ε = -1.7‰; for hematite, ε = -2 to -5‰, depending on particle morphology. Apparent ε decreased upon surface site saturation, implying a smaller isotope effect for polymeric Si adsorption than monomeric adsorption. In coprecipitation experiments, solutions of Na-silicate and Fe(II) chloride (0.4-10 mM) were prepared anaerobically, then air-oxidized for 3 days to induce precipitation. At low Si concentrations, magnetite formed; near silica saturation, lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite formed. The Si isotope fractionation factor for coprecipitation was within the range of ε observed for adsorption (ε = -2.3 ± 1.0‰). These results indicate that the mechanism of Fe-Si interaction affects ε, presumably due to varying silicate coordination environments. These isotopic analyses will be paired with Si K-edge and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectra of the solids to illustrate how Si bonding environment affects ε. Effective reconstruction of paleo-oceanic δ30Si may require additional constraints on the relative importance of Si adsorption and Fe-Si coprecipitation in the production of IF primary precipitates.",

The simultaneous occurrence of floods in different medium size catchments is often the reason for large scale floods. Depending on the geographic location and the dominating weather pattern certain catchments have frequent simultaneous extremes while others behave in a complementary fashion. The purpose of this work is to investigate the simultaneous and complementary occurrence of floods in catchments using atmospheric circulation patterns (CPs). Possible flood producing patterns are identified using areal precipitation and/or unusual discharge increases. Patterns are identified using a fuzzy rule based approach based on anomalies of the 700 hPa surfaces. The rules are formed by maximizing the explained variance under the assumption of simultaneous and complementary behavior. Differences in the performance are used to decide if catchments behave in a simultaneous or a complementary fashion.",

Charge volumes and spacing were estimated from the convex hull of VHF sources emitted by positive and negative breakdown. Energy was obtained by solving for the electric field and potential in two ways. For reference, a three-dimensional Poisson solver was used with the observed convex hull geometry. Analytical estimates were then made by applying the same charge volumes to simplified geometries: charged spheres, cylinders, and plane parallel discs. Charge density was retrieved by applying constraints of charge conservation and the presence of a breakeven electric field. The analytic geometries were compared to the convex hull method in order to quantify and evaluate the geometric dependence of the total energy dissipated. Preliminary results showed the cylindrical geometry produced values within the range of other values reported in the literature, and in close agreement with solutions for the convex-hull geometry.

(2015a) developed a model, Forecasting a CME’s Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT), of CME deflections due to magnetic forces, not including the effects of reconnection. ForeCAT is able to reproduce the deflection of observed CMEs (Kay et al. 2015b). The deflecting CMEs tend to show a rapid increase of their angular momentum close to the Sun, followed by little to no increase at farther distances. Here we quantify the distance at which the CME deflection is “determined,” which we define as the distance after which the background solar wind has negligible influence on the total deflection. We consider a wide range in CME masses and radial speeds and determine that the majority of simulated CMEs obtain 90% of their total angular momentum at 1 AU below 2 Rs. The deflection of these CMEs can be well-described by assuming they propagate with constant angular momentum beyond 10 Rs. The assumption of constant angular momentum beyond 10 Rs yields underestimates of the total deflection at 1 AU of only 5% to 10%. Since the deflection from magnetic forces is determined by 10 Rs, non-magnetic forces must be responsible for any observed interplanetary deflections where the CME has increasing angular momentum.",

            "abstract": "Global precipitation isoscapes are an important toolset that aids our understanding of global hydrologic cycles. The Global Network for Isotopes in precipitation (GNIP) database is a starting point for modelling global isoscapes; however, the network has deficiencies that affect the accuracy of the isoscapes in several regions. These deficiencies include low or non-existent data coverage in regions of strong hydrological interest (e.g., drylands), discontinuous data and poor correlation between temperature and isotope distributions in the tropics. To evaluate the efficacy of global isoscape interpretation in the regional context and investigate precipitation to groundwater recharge to groundwater, in this study, we downscaled a global isoscape model (Regional Cluster Water Isotope Prediction (RCWIP)) to the geographic extent of Namibia and compared the predicted versus observed ones. Furthermore, we generated precipitation and groundwater isoscapes based on local isotopic studies and compared the data-driven precipitation isoscape with RCWIP model. Results indicated that there was no correlation between the RCWIP model values and the observed values. The local meteoric water line for Namibia determined from the RCWIP model reflects the global meteoric water line suggesting that the model reflects global trends missing out on local variations. This raises the question of how relevant are these global isoscapes to inadequately covered or represented regions such as drylands. Extending the isoscape concept to groundwater over the same area and juxtaposition to the rainfall isoscapes we can determine areas of potential recharge as groundwater is the most important water resource in these dryland systems. Although this does not quantify the available groundwater resources, it nonetheless enables us to make interpretations on whether aquifers contain modern or paleo waters and the areas of potential recharge. These interpretations are important for sustainable urban planning.",

In this talk we examine new features in the ring current and radiation belts captured by the Van Allen Probes, TWINS and ground-based observations. In particular, we will discuss the double-peaks ring current injection, local-time dependence of EMIC wave emissions, and the remnant belt. To understand the physics behind these interesting signatures, we perform simulations with the Comprehensive Inner Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (CIMI) model. One of the results from comparison with measurements and simulations will be evidence for energy dependent and pitch-angle dependent drift.

            "abstract": "Biologically-available nitrogen is the primary limiting nutrient in the global ocean. The complex physical-biological interdependencies of nitrogen fixation and denitrification, the source and sink of bioavailable nitrogen, have led to uncertainty over their future trajectories under higher CO2. Sedimentary nitrogen isotope evidence suggests that the global rate of denitrification was on the order of 50% lower during the last glacial maximum, and reveals that significant changes in denitrification have occurred on a decadal-centennial timescale. Coupled atmosphere-ocean-biogeochemistry models simulate similar changes, through physically-driven changes in anoxia, which then feed back on nitrogen fixation through the availability of phosphorus to diazotrophs. In addition, diazotroph culture experiments suggest that nitrogen fixation was further limited during glacial maxima by low CO2, causing an additional slowdown of the nitrogen cycle. The emergent picture suggests that deglaciation accelerated both sides of the N cycle, with more rapid loss encouraged by expanded shallow anoxia, and more rapid gain encouraged by higher CO2. It will be argued that the net effect on the nitrogen inventory can be approximated by knowing the distribution of surface ocean PO4, given the observed correlation of surface PO4 concentrations on the P:C ratio of exported organic matter.",

            "abstract": "Visible light and 5-micron infrared images of Jupiter reveal the familiar zone-belt structure, where the brown belts appear as warm regions at 5 micron. As clouds are a major source of opacity at this wavelength, the high 5 micron temperatures are indicative of no or relatively thin cloud decks so that deeper warmer layers are probed. In the mid-eighties microwave images at 1 – 6 cm showed a similar zone-belt structure, where deeper warmer layers were probed in the belts, due to a lower NH3 abundance in the belts than in the zones. Conventional radio interferometric images are integrated over many hours to meet the required sensitivity and to use Earth rotation synthesis to achieve good sampling of the Fourier plane. Consequently, any potential structure in longitude is smeared out in such maps. In 2004, we published an innovative technique to synthesize together many hours of radio data to produce a longitude-resolved map [1]. This map showed the hot spots on Jupiter very clearly, and we showed that the NH3 gas abundance must be depleted significantly down to several bars in these hot spots.\nWe embarked on a program to map Jupiter at multiple wavelengths with the much-improved (order of magnitude in sensitivity) VLA. In this talk we will present our first maps of Jupiter at different wavelengths. These maps will be compared with maps produced by the amateur community at optical wavelengths, with similar resolution. We will also present radiative transfer calculations of a select number of features.\n[1] Sault, R.J., C. Engel, and I. de Pater, 2004. Longitude-resolved Imaging of Jupiter at l=2 cm.

            "abstract": "Sustainable phosphorus (P) management in agricultural and urban ecosystems is necessary to ensure global food security and healthy aquatic ecosystems. Researchers and decision-makers alike need to understand how social, economic, political, and biophysical factors interact to create risks and opportunities around future P cycling. For example, P can accumulate in soils and be lost to waterways over a long-time scale. Such lags between application, use, and transport of P could affect our ability to identify sources of P enrichment of surface waters and, consequently, influence the development of strategies to limit water quality degradation. To enhance understanding of the relationship between human activities, P loading to the landscape and P loading to surface waters, we are examining cumulative P additions from 1950 to 2007 at the county level for the major US hydrologic basins. We examine the temporal relationship between net P additions and water quality in order to identify especially important time periods for P management. We also compare the timing of P additions and losses across hydrologic basins. Concurrently, the P-FUTURES project, a partnership between researchers and stakeholders to advance and understand the process of social transformation, focuses on the role of urban ecosystems in future sustainable P management. In this project we are using a cross-city comparison approach and transdisciplinary methods, including participatory workshops and future visioning activities, to determine pathways to more sustainable P management in Phoenix, USA; Sydney, Australia; Hanoi, Vietnam; and Blantyre, Malawi. In Blantyre for example we have identified possible synergies between decreasing nutrient losses and deforestation and existing municipal goals to increase affordable hydroelectric power. Preliminary results from both on-going projects allow us to gain insight into how local context shapes P cycling and locally-appropriate solutions.",

Judging from a sample of some 150 recent scientific papers, the gross majority of the reported success rates of these statistical methods are overwhelmingly high and promising at between 71% and 98%. Perhaps surprisingly, though, the death toll and damage from landslides has remained elevated in the early 21st century, so that reliably predicting the occurrence of rock-slope failures without overfitting our models remains challenging. Here I review some of the recent advances in this field, and show how novel results from landslide seismology and landslide sedimentology have promoted our ability of detecting large rock-slope failures in mountainous terrain. Several new detailed investigations of the internal nature of large rockslide deposits, for example, help to reduce the confusion potential with macroscopically similar moraine debris, or microscopically similar fault breccia. I further outline some of the limitations of empirical models that use rainfall intensity-duration thresholds for landslide early warning, and of multivariate methods concerned with mapping landslide susceptibility at the regional scale. I conclude by discussing the occurrence of ‘black swans’ such as long-runout rock-ice avalanches in size distributions of rock-slope failures, and their implications for quantitative hazard appraisals.",

            "abstract": "The recent availability of high resolution optoelectronic sensors has revived holography as a useful technique to study aerosol particles. By placing a two-dimensional detector in a collimated laser beam, the interference pattern produced by this light and that forward-scattered by a particle in the beam can be easily measured. This pattern is the particle’s in-line hologram and information can be extracted from it directly. For example, applying a Fourier-transform operation to the hologram yields a silhouette-like image of the particle, thus revealing its size and shape without a priori information. In this sense, digital holography “solves” the classic inverse problem in applied light scattering. Moreover, this measurement can be done in situ and applied to flowing aerosol particles using pulsed illumination. In recent work, we have discovered there is also an inherent link between a particle’s extinction cross section and the integral of the hologram. Using Mie theory, we have shown this relationship for a variety of spherical particles. The generality of the concept, however, suggests that it applies to nonspherical particles as well. In this presentation we will show that, indeed, the extinction cross section can be extracted from the holograms produced by such particles. Specifically, we investigate prolate and oblate spheroids and cubical particles in the wavelength-size range. Using both the discrete dipole approximation and the T-Matrix method, when applicable, we are able to simulate the holograms and then perform a simple integration to yield the cross sections. We will also present our ongoing experimental work applying this technique to coarse-mode aerosol particles.",

            "abstract": "Physically based models of the hydrological cycle are critical for testing our understanding of the natural world and enabling forecasting of extreme events. Previous intercomparison studies (i.e. SNOWMIP I & II, PILPS) of existing snow models that vary in complexity have been hampered by multiple differences in model structure. Recent efforts to encompass multiple model hypothesizes into a single framework (i.e. the Structure for Understanding Multiple Modeling Alternatives [SUMMA] model), have provided the tools necessary for a more rigorous validation of process representation. However, there exist few snow observatories that measure sufficient physical states and fluxes to fully constrain the possible combinations within these multiple model frameworks. In practice, observations of bulk snow states, such as the snow water equivalent (SWE) or snow depth, are most commonly available. The downfall of calibrating a snow model using such single bulk variables can lead to parameter equanimity and compensatory errors, which ultimately impacts the skill of a model as a predictive tool.\nThis study provides two examples of diagnosing modeled snow processes through novel error source identification. Simulations were performed at a recently upgraded (Oct. 2012) snow study site located at Snoqualmie Pass (917 m), in the Washington Cascades, USA. We focused on two physical processes, new snow accumulation and snowpack outflow during mid-winter rain-on-snow events, for their importance towards controlling runoff and flooding in this rain-snow transitional basin. Main results were: 1) modifying the snow model structure to match what was actually observed (i.e. a snow board), allowed the attribution of daily errors in model new snow accumulation to either partitioning, new snow density, or compaction. 2) Observed snow pit temperature profiles from infrared cameras and manual thermometers found that cold biases in the model snowpack temperature prior to rain-on-snow events could delay model outflow multiple days compared to lysimeter observations. These two examples illustrate a commonly discussed, but rarely implemented, method of diagnosing model errors using multiple observations of internal snowpack states.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is a gradual process most apparent over long time-scales and large spatial scales, but it is experienced by those affected as changes in local weather. Climate change will gradually push the weather people experience outside the bounds of historic norms, resulting in unprecedented and extreme weather events. However, people do have the ability to learn about and respond to a changing climate. Therefore, connecting the weather people experience with their perceptions of climate change requires understanding how people infer the current state of the climate given their observations of weather. This learning process constitutes a first-order constraint on the rate of adaptation and is an important determinant of the dynamic adjustment costs associated with climate change.\nIn this paper I explore two learning models that describe how local weather observations are translated into perceptions of climate change: an efficient Bayesian learning model and a simpler rolling-mean heuristic. Both have a period during which the learner’s beliefs about the state of the climate are different from its true state, meaning the learner is exposed to a different range of extreme weather outcomes then they are prepared for. Using the example of surface temperature trends, I quantify this additional exposure to extreme heat events under both learning models and both RCP 8.5 and 2.6. Risk exposure increases for both learning models, but by substantially more for the rolling-mean learner. Moreover, there is an interaction between the learning model and the rate of climate change: the inefficient rolling-mean learner benefits much more from the slower rates of change under RCP 2.6 then the Bayesian. Finally, I present results from an experiment that suggests people are able to learn about a trending climate in a manner consistent with the Bayesian model.",

            "abstract": "Accurate measurements of evapotranspiration are required for many meteorological, climatological, ecological, and hydrological research applications and developments. Here we examine and compare two widely used methods to measure evapotranspiration at the site level: lysimeter-based measurements (EL) and eddy-covariance (EC) flux measurements (EEC). The analyses are based on parallel measurements at the research catchment Rietholzbach in northeastern Switzerland, and focus on the period June 2009 to December 2013. The measurements are compared on the yearly, monthly, daily, and hourly time scales, and with respect to an over 35-year lysimeter-based evapotranspiration time series. Overall, the two measurement techniques agree well, especially on the annual time scale. They are also within the range of catchment water-balance estimates of evapotranspiration. The good agreement of these methods emphasizes the representativeness of the lysimeter and EC measurements for the entire catchment despite their comparatively small source areas and the heterogeneous land use and topography within the catchment. This finding is supported by the fact that the in-situ lysimeter estimates also agree well with remote sensing-based estimates of evapotranspiration on a 25 km scale.\nWe also assess different methods to close the EC-based energy balance. Based on the comparison of EL and EEC, the commonly used method of closing the energy balance according to the Bowen ratio is found to be reasonable and supported by our results. Furthermore, we identify that lack of EC observations during and following rainfall events (due to shortcomings of the measurement technique under these conditions) significantly contributes to an underestimation of EEC and to the overall energy balance gap at the site.",

Additionally, we highlight how network resources are facilitating a multi-institutional, collaborative investigation to understand the distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) stocks, their stability and vulnerability at 40 NEON sites across eleven of the twelve soil orders. Soil cores for this study were collected as an oppurtunistic byproduct of network construction. Cores will be separated by genetic horizon, characterized according to standard laboratory physical and chemical analyses, and exposed to powerful quantitative assays including X-ray diffraction and radiocarbon analysis. The experimental design includes density fractionation to elucidate the dynamics of discrete SOM pools, as well as a long-term incubation experiments to understand SOM vulnerability to changes in soil moisture and temperature regimes.\nWhile network science has already greatly advanced scientific understanding, its full power may be best realized by moving toward standardizing protocols and expanding these standardized measurements over space and time. It is also critical that networks maintain the flexibility to incorporate studies by individual investigators at some or all sites, adopt new methodologies, and evolve quickly in light of new community priorities. Funding opportunities or network resources (e.g. technician time for sample collection) directed at facilitating PI driven macrosystems scale research are also necessary to maximize results.",

            "abstract": "Electric field and plasma density observations gathered on the C/NOFS satellite are presented in cases where the ionosphere F-peak has been elevated above the satellite perigee of 350-400 km near sunset. During these orbits, data from the electric field probes consistently show evidence of reversed zonal drifts -- i.e., westward drifts at the lower altitudes -- whenever the satellite journeys below the F-peak near sunset. Similar to observations of sheared zonal drifts in the evening sector by sounding rockets and the Jicamarca radar, these observations demonstrate that zonal plasma drifts, sheared with respect to altitude at and below the F-peak, are routinely observed and suggest that this shear may be a source of large scale, Kelvin-Helmholtz-like instabilities that could seed equatorial “spread-F”. Indeed, in addition to the shear in the DC electric field data, the C/NOFS data set also provides direct observations of large scale (100’s of km) and medium scale (10’s of km) undulations of the plasma density on the bottomside ledge of the sunset equatorial ionosphere and their associated shorter scale irregularities. These undulations are generally devoid of smaller scale structures in the early evening, particularly when the satellite is still in the sunlit ionosphere, yet appear at later local times with associated, fully-developed smaller scale structures along the same orbit. We present examples of both the sheared zonal plasma flow and the large scale undulations and discuss their implications for our understanding of the unstable equatorial ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater change is difficult to monitor over large scales. One of the most successful approaches is in the remote sensing of time-variable gravity using NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission data, and successful case studies have created the opportunity to move towards a global groundwater monitoring framework for the world’s largest aquifers. To achieve these estimates, several approximations are applied, including those in GRACE processing corrections, the formulation of the formal GRACE errors, destriping and signal recovery, and the numerical model estimation of snow water, surface water and soil moisture storage states used to isolate a groundwater component. A major weakness in these approaches is inconsistency: different studies have used different sources of primary and ancillary data, and may achieve different results based on alternative choices in these approximations.\nIn this study, we present two cases of groundwater change estimation in California and the Colorado River basin, selected for their good data availability and varied climates. We achieve a robust numerical estimate of post-processing uncertainties resulting from land-surface model structural shortcomings and model resolution errors. Groundwater variations should demonstrate less variability than the overlying soil moisture state does, as groundwater has a longer memory of past events due to buffering by infiltration and drainage rate limits. We apply a model ensemble approach in a Bayesian framework constrained by the assumption of decreasing signal variability with depth in the soil column. We also discuss time variable errors vs. time constant errors, across-scale errors v. across-model errors, and error spectral content (across scales and across model). More robust uncertainty quantification for GRACE-based groundwater estimates would take all of these issues into account, allowing for more fair use in management applications and for better integration of GRACE-based measurements with observations from other sources.",

These two statements form the basis for the development of the Net Resources Assessment (NetRA) framework.\nNetRA is a policy-relevant, interdisciplinary approach to assessing natural resources availability in examining the regional-scale interrelationships between energy or mineral extraction and impact on ecosystem services. The systems dynamics approach (SD) emphasizes the interdependence of natural resource development and its effect on collocated ecosystem services over space and time.\nThe example of the NetRA that will be presented focuses on tradeoffs associated with land management decisions in the West. The Piceance Basin, CO example that will be discussed involves development of a continuous gas deposit and its impact on Mule Deer and water quality. The SD is the hub for generating a range of simulated landscape outcomes. The probabilistic model provides an economic indicator as to the expected net societal benefit of economic development and biophysical indicators for ecosystem services affected in the region. Both natural and economic indicators are associated with each outcome via a tradeoff analysis the can be used for risk analysis.\nThe NetRA also retains map attributes for before and after map comparisons to specific alternatives for an existing baseline. The model has three stages: map-based scenario development with slider bars (choice variables), side-by–side extraction and ecosystem services sub-models, and integrated multiple resource trade-off outcomes.",

As a result the anelastic response of ice, and associated energy dissipation, are not well understood and modeled.\nThe Planetary Tides Simulation Facility (PTSF) installed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (California Institute of Technology) has the capability to quantify the anelastic behavior of ice at stresses between 20-100 kPa and over a frequency range of 3x10-6 to 0.1 Hz simulating tidal forcing frequencies relevant to many icy satellites, including Europa, Enceladus, and Charon.\nData are best fitted by the Andrade model, i.e., a function that accounts for anelasticity in the form of two parameters: a parameter β function of the density of defects in the material and a parameter α that captures the complexity of the defect distribution. From preliminary results we have derived empirical expressions of the fitting parameter β in terms of the intrinsic properties of the sample (i.e., viscosity and elastic moduli), leading to a function that is uniquely function of the parameter α. Combining our results with previous studies we have established trends for describing the behavior of α as a function of testing conditions and material properties (e.g., microstructure, presence of melt).\nWe will present applications of these results to icy satellites, and especially Europa.\nAcknowledgement: Part of this work is been carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under contract to NASA.

To properly interpret past changes recorded in sedimentary archives it is crucial to understand the sources and variability of exported plant waxes in modern systems on seasonal to inter-annual timescales. Here, we present distributions, δ13C, and δD composition of three compound classes (n-alkanes, n-alcohols, n-alkanoic acids) in a 34-month time series of suspended sediments from the Congo River. We show multiple end-members contribute differentially to n-alkanes, as evidenced by a large δ13C spread of 4.2 ± 0.7‰ across homologues and low correlation between homologue concentrations. n-Acids and n-alcohols exhibit less δ13C variability, indicating dominance of C3 end-members.\nTemporally, n-acid and n-alcohol concentrations, distributions, and δD values are much more influenced by seasonal changes in discharge than n-alkanes. Increasing discharge through the low-lying swamp forest likely biases n-acids and n-alcohols toward this highly productive source area, while n-alkanes are less affected due to their more refractory nature and persistence during transport. This is reflected in large changes in n-alcohol/acid minus n-alkane δD (∆δD) between high and low discharge of 15-20‰. We conclude that the n-alkanoic acids and n-alcohols respond to seasonal/inter-annual changes in source area while n-alkanes better represent a seasonally stable signal, and that multiple n-alkyl lipid classes therefore record complementary information in sedimentary archives.",

            "abstract": "Modeling deadwood dynamics is limited by our empirical understanding of decomposition patterns and drivers. This gap is significant in dry tropical forests (and in the tropics, broadly) where forest regeneration is a management priority but where decision-making lacks resources. Our goal was to track decomposition and its biological drivers in tree boles added to the forest floor of a regenerating dry forest. We cut and then placed logs (~18 cm dia) of eight representative tree species in ground contact at two different sites (n=8, per site). We tracked density loss and element import/export in both sapwood and heartwood each 6 months over two years. We measured initial and final lignin, structural carbohydrates, nitrogen, and extractives. We also quantified insect gallery volumes, and used two residue ‘signatures’ to determine dominant fungal rot type: 1) dilute alkali solubility (DAS) and lignin:glucan loss. By year 2, mean density losses in sapwood were 11.6 - 44.4% among tree species, excluding one species that decomposed completely. The best predictor of density loss in sapwood was initial pH, but the correlation was negative rather than positive, as has been reported in temperate systems. Decay was consistently more advanced in sapwood than in heartwood, and although extractives were as high as 16.4% in heartwood, trait-density loss correlations were insignificant. Insects contributed little at this stage to density loss (<3%), and both lignin:glucan loss and DAS confirmed that white rot fungi dominated decomposition. Although element import dynamics broadly resembled those from temperate studies (e.g., Ca gain, P, K loss), there was high spatial variability. This perhaps related to zone line (spalting) complexity, suggesting intense competition among fungi colonizing small territories within the wood. Estimated CO2 fluxes from the test logs ranged from ~25 to 75% of the annual fluxes from litter fall at these sites. Collectively, these results implicate wood decomposition as an important component of dry forest carbon cycling. Emergent patterns from decomposers are also interesting in this case, where fungi assigned as a single functional group (white rot type) produced little variability in decay rates (Function 1) but high variability in element translocation (Function 2).",

            "abstract": "The humid tropics contain vast stores of carbon and dominate terrestrial-atmspheric carbon exchange. They are difficult to observe, whether in situ or from the atmosphere for logistical, climatic and ecological reasons, leading to persistent uncertainty about their quantitative role in the current carbon cycle, and how they might change in the future. In addition, as recent work has shown, the tropics have fast turnover times and short response times. As a result, they are the most likely focus of rapid change to terrestrial carbon-climate feedbacks. I will review what is known, and what remains controversial, about carbon fluxes in the tropics, and particularly in the Amazon. Current tropical carbon budgets suggest both high emissions, from land use, and high uptake from a combination of regrowth and carbon dioxide fertilization. Recent analyses also suggest significant trends in both these terms. We will propose a hypothesis to explain the current budget and a strategy for reducing uncertainty combining the OCO-2 satellite XCO2 observations in conjunction with other space-based measurememts.",

Free iOS infrasound apps can be readily downloaded from the Apple App Store, and Android versions are in progress. Infrasound propagates for great distances, has low sample rates, and provides a tractable pilot study scenario for open distributed sensor networks at regional and global scales using one of the most ubiquitous sensors on Earth – microphones. Data collection is no longer limited to selected vendors at exclusive prices: anybody on Earth can record and stream infrasound, and the diversity of recording systems and environments is rapidly expanding. Global deployment may be fast and easy (www.redvox.io), but comes with the cost of increasing data volume, velocity, variety, and complexity. Flocking - the collective motion of mobile agents – is a natural human response to threats or events of interest. Anticipating, modeling and harnessing flocking sensor topologies will be necessary for adaptive array and network processing. The increasing data quantity and complexity will exceed the processing capacity of human analysts and most research servers. We anticipate practical real-time applications will require the on-demand adaptive scalability and resources of the Cloud. Cloud architectures for such heterogeneous sensor networks will consider eventual integration into the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).",

            "abstract": "Static recrystallization and grain growth take place during high-temperature annealing following deformation at lower temperature, and they reorganize grain and subgrain boundaries to produce entirely new, strain-free grains. These processes influence the microstructure and mechanical behavior of the material by reducing the level of long-range internal stress field. The non-linear flow law of ice Ih makes it an ideal analogue to model rock deformation, thus analyses of recrystallized ice textures contribute to understanding mechanisms which control the nucleation and grain growth deep in the Earth’s interior. Water ice microstructures allow for the study of grain-scale processes including nucleation, grain growth, recovery and recrystallization. On the other hand, these mechanisms directly influence the behavior of terrestrial ice systems (e.g., glaciers and ice sheets) in response to deformation. Therefore, their understanding may help us to improve climatic signal interpretation and predictions, that are mostly based on ice dynamics. However, at present there are no data by which recovery, and strain energy-driven grain boundary migration rates in ice can be estimated.\nHere we present the results of annealing experiments of pre-deformed polycrystalline water ice together with microstructural analyses by means of Automatic Ice Texture Analyzer (AITA) and high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) crystal orientation maps. We performed constant load uniaxial compression creep experiments at -7°C on columnar samples, composed of mm-sized polycrystals, to attain 4% deformation and we applied post-deformational heat treatment at -5°C. We carried out a series of AITA and EBSD maps in representative time steps up to 25 hours of total annealing in order to study the microstructural evolution. In this contribution, we evaluate the stored energy distribution and the rate of grain boundary migration during post-dynamic and static recrystallization, that control strain energy-driven grain boundary mobility of water ice.\nWe have used the state-of-art open source MTEX toolbox for quantitative texture analysis. MTEX is a scriptable MATLAB toolbox, which permits all aspects of quantitative texture analysis using the modern methods and anisotropic physical property calculations.",

            "abstract": "Methane, a critical greenhouse gas, is increasing rapidly but neither the causes of this increase, nor the recent large variations in the rate are understood. The tropics are the largest natural source for methane, and a likely focus of much recent variation. We will propose two hypotheses to explain why tropical fluxes may be changing, one linked to recent trends in the carbon cycke, and the other suggesting a connection to trends in the wate cycle. We carried out an observing system experiment using model-data-fusion approach and simulated fluxes arising from both of these hyotheses using a diagnostic model, forced with satellite observations, and then translated them into concentration patterns using an attmspheric transport model. We then sampled these simulated concentrations, taking into account cloud cover and estimated the resulting sampling pattern and radiances, using a full-physics radiation model. This allowed us to simulate the performance of alternative approaches for observing XCH4 from space. We then estimated fluxes usng an inverse model to determine the required characteristics of a satellite mission able to distinguish between our two hypotheses. Geostationary observations, obtained at least 3x/day with an uncertainty of 1% are required to determine regional patterns of tropical methane flux with sufficiently high confidence to distinguish between alternative hypotheses. The key instrument characteristics are determined by the need to obtain adequate data in the presene of clouds. Reducing carbon cycle uncertainty in the tropics requires more sampling than low earth orbit missions are likely to provide.",

            "abstract": "The timeline of hazards associated with earthquakes ranges from seconds for the strong shaking at the epicenter, to minutes for strong shaking at more distant locations in big quakes, to tens of minutes for a local tsunami. Earthquake and tsunami warning systems must therefore include very fast initial alerts, while also taking advantage of available time in bigger and tsunami-generating quakes.\nAt the UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory we are developing a suite of algorithms to provide the fullest possible information about earthquake shaking and tsunami inundation from seconds to minutes after a quake. The E-larmS algorithm uses the P-wave to rapidly detect an earthquake and issue a warning. It is currently issuing alerts to test users in as little as 3 sec after the origin time. Development of a new waveform detector may lead to even faster alerts. G-larmS uses permanent deformation estimates from GNSS stations to estimate the geometry and extent of rupture underway providing more accurate ground shaking estimates in big (M>~7) earthquakes. It performed well in the M6.0 2014 Napa earthquake. T-larmS is a new algorithm designed to extend alert capabilities to tsunami inundation. Rapid estimates of source characteristics for subduction zones event can not only be used to warn of the shaking hazard, but also the local tsunami inundation hazard.\nThese algorithms are being developed, implemented and tested with a focus on the western US, but are also now being tested in other parts of the world including Israel, Turkey, Korea and Chile. Beta users in the Bay Area are receiving the alerts and beginning to implement automated actions. They also provide feedback on users needs, which has led to the development of the MyEEW smartphone app. This app allows beta users to receive the alerts on their cell phones. All these efforts feed into our ongoing assessment of directions and priorities for future development and implementation efforts.",

Sev- eral Martian meteorites contain organic carbon (i.e., macromolecular reduced carbon-rich material, not nec- essarily related to biota), but there is little agreement on its origins. Initial hypotheses for the origin of this organic carbon included: terrestrial contamination; chondritic meteoritic input; thermal decomposition of Martian carbonate minerals; direct precipitation from cooling aqueous fluids; and the remains of ancient Martian biota. We report on results from the analysis of 14 martian meteorites and show the distribution of organic phases throughout the samples analyzed. We will present formation scearios for each of the types of organic matter discovered. These studies when combined show 4 possible pools of reduced carbon on Mars. 1) impact generated graphite in the Tissint meteorite, 2) secondary hydrothermal generated graphite in ALH 84001, 3) primary igneous reduced carbon in 12 Martian meteorites associated with spinel inclusions in olivine and pyroxene 4) and potentially primary hydrothermally formed organic carbon / nitrogen containing organic species in the maskelynite phases of the Tissint meteorite.

Addressing this solar energy challenge is tied ultimately to the quantitative relationship between the direct, diffuse and total radiation reaching the surface and clouds in the atmosphere, which remains elusive. Here we will first introduce a theoretical framework that relates DNI and GHI to cloud fraction and cloud albedo through two dimensionless numbers: the relative cloud radiative forcing for the direct radiation (defined as the difference between the clear sky and all sky direct downwelling radiative fluxes normalized by the clear sky direct downwelling radiative fluxes) is primarily determined by cloud fraction; the ratio of the relative cloud radiative forcing for the total downwelling radiation to the relative cloud radiative forcing for the direct radiation is primarily determined by cloud albedo. We then use decade-long measurements of partitioned radiation and cloud properties at the ARM sites to validate the theoretical relationships between the two dimensionless radiation-based parameters and cloud properties. We will also explore the potentials and challenges of using the relationships between cloud properties and radiation partition at the surface for solar energy research, opening new avenues to utilizing ARM measurements.",

            "abstract": "Earth system models that are designed to project future carbon (C) cycle – climate feedbacks exhibit notably poor representation of soil biogeochemical processes and generate highly uncertain projections about the fate of the largest terrestrial C pool on Earth. Given these shortcomings there has been intense interest in soil biogeochemical model development, but parallel efforts to create the analytical tools to characterize, improve and benchmark these models have thus far lagged behind. A long-term goal of this work is to develop a framework to compare, evaluate and improve the process-level representation of soil biogeochemical models that could be applied in global land surface models. Here, we present a newly developed global model test bed that is built on the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach model (CASA-CNP) that can rapidly integrate different soil biogeochemical models that are forced with consistent driver datasets. We focus on evaluation of two microbial explicit soil biogeochemical models that function at global scales: the MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization model (MIMICS) and Carbon, Organisms, Rhizosphere, and Protection in the Soil Environment (CORPSE) model. Using the global model test bed coupled to MIMICS and CORPSE we quantify the uncertainty in potential C cycle – climate feedbacks that may be expected with these microbial explicit models, compared with a conventional first-order, linear model. By removing confounding variation of climate and vegetation drivers, our model test bed allows us to isolate key differences among different soil model structure and parameterizations that can be evaluated with further study. Specifically, the global test bed also identifies key parameters that can be estimated using cross-site observations. In global simulations model results are evaluated with steady state litter, microbial biomass, and soil C pools and benchmarked against independent globally gridded data products.",

There is segmentation in the arc magmas, in the seismicity, episodic tremor and slip, crustal structure and mantle structure all the way down to ~400 km depth. What is striking is the fact that the segment boundaries for these processes at depths of a few kilometers to hundreds of kilometers align. We must determine if this is coincidence, or if not, what the causative process is.\nThe seismic deployments of the Cascadia Initiative onshore and offshore allow us to image the structure of the subduction zone, including the incoming Juan de Fuca plate, with unprecedented resolution. We use data from three one-year deployments of 70 ocean bottom seismometers across the Juan de Fuca plate, along with hundreds of onshore stations from the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, the Berkeley Digital Seismic Network, the Earthscope Transportable Array, and smaller temporary seismic deployments.\nOur 3D tomographic models show significant variation in the structure of the subducting slab along its length. It extends deepest in the south (the Gorda section) where the plate is youngest, and shallows to the north across southern Oregon. There is a gap in the slab beneath northern Oregon, which appears to correlate with the geochemistry of the arc magmas. The slab is then visible again beneath Washington. We also constrain mantle flow paths using shear-wave splitting measurements at the offshore and onshore seismic stations. Beneath the Juan de Fuca plate the flow is sub-parallel to the motion of the plate. However, beneath the Gorda section of the Juan de Fuca place the flow is sub-parallel to the motion of the Pacific plate, not the Juan de Fuca plate.

            "abstract": "Science uses observations to build knowledge by testable explanations and predictions. The “scientific method” requires controlled systematic observation to examine questions, hypotheses and predictions. Thus, enquiry along the scientific method responds to questions of the type “what if …?” In contrast, long-term observation programs follow a different strategy: we commonly take great care to minimize our influence on the environment of our measurements, with the aim to maximize their external validity. We observe what we think are key variables for ecosystem-atmosphere exchange and ask questions such as “what happens next?” or “how did this happen?” This apparent deviation from the scientific method begs the question whether any explanations we come up with for the phenomena we observe are actually contributing to testable knowledge, or whether their value remains purely anecdotal.\nHere, we present examples to argue that, under certain conditions, data from long-term observations and observation networks can have equivalent or even higher scientific validity than controlled experiments. Internal validity is particularly enhanced if observations are combined with modeling.\nLong-term observations of ecosystem-atmosphere fluxes identify trends and temporal scales of variability. Observation networks reveal spatial patterns and variations, and long-term observation networks combine both aspects. A necessary condition for such observations to gain validity beyond the anecdotal is the requirement that the data are comparable: a comparison of two measured values, separated in time or space, must inform us objectively whether (e.g.) one value is larger than the other. In turn, a necessary condition for the comparability of data is the compatibility of the sensors and procedures used to generate them. Compatibility ensures that we compare \"apples to apples\": that measurements conducted in identical conditions give the same values (within suitable uncertainty intervals). In principle, a useful tool to achieve comparability and compatibility is the standardization of sensors and methods. However, due to the diversity of ecosystems and settings, standardization in ecosystem-atmosphere exchange is difficult. We discuss some of the challenges and pitfalls of standardization across networks.",

            "abstract": "Northern high-latitude carbon sources and sinks, including those resulting from degrading permafrost, are expected to be sensitive to the rapidly warming climate in the coming decades. Because the daytime lower atmosphere integrates surface fluxes over large (~500-1000 km) scales, atmospheric monitoring of CO2 and CH4 mole fractions is a promising method for the detection of change throughout boreal Alaska. Here we use greenhouse gas measurements from a NOAA tower 17 km north of Fairbanks AK, established as part of NASA’s Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE), to investigate regional fluxes of CO2 and CH4 for 2012-2014. CARVE was designed to use aircraft and surface observations to better understand and quantify the sensitivity of Alaskan carbon fluxes to climate variability over several years. We use high-resolution meteorological fields from the Polar Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model coupled with the Stochastic Time Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model, along with the Polar Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (PVPRM), to infer fluxes of CO2 in boreal Alaska using the tower observations, which are sensitive to large areas of central Alaska. We show that simulated mole fractions agree remarkably well with tower observations, indicating that the model represents the meteorology of the region quite well, and that the PVPRM flux magnitudes and spatial distribution are largely correct. CO2 flux signals at the tower are larger than predicted by the model, however, with significant respiration occurring in the fall that is not captured by the model. Using the same WRF-STILT model, we find that average CH4 fluxes in boreal Alaska are lower than those estimated by Chang et al. (2014) over all of Alaska, with emissions persisting during some wintertime periods, augmenting those observed during the summer and fall. The presence of significant fall and winter CO2 and CH4 fluxes underscores the need for year-round in situ observations to quantify changes in boreal Alaskan annual carbon balance.",

            "abstract": "Alternations between siliciclastic, carbonate and evaporitic sedimentary systems, as recorded in the Aptian mixed succession of southern Tunisia, reflect profound paleoceanographic, paleoclimatic and tectonic changes in this area of the southern Tethyan margin.\nWhereas the early Aptian is interpreted as having been dominated by slightly humid conditions, the onset of a gypsiferous sedimentation near the early to late Aptian boundary is associated with the appearance of palygorskite and sepiolite, which supports the installation of arid conditions in the study area. The evaporitic sedimentation may have also been promoted by the peculiar tectonic setting of the Bir Oum Ali area during the Aptian, where local subsidence may have been tectonically-enhanced in relation to the opening of northern and central Atlantic.\nChemostratigraphic (δ13C) correlation of the Bir Oum Ali succession with other peri-Tethyan regions complements biostratigraphic findings, and indicates that a potential expression of the Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) 1a may be preserved in this area of Tunisia. Although the characteristic negative spike in δ13C values located at the base of this event is not recognized in the present study, a subsequent, large positive excursion is of similar amplitude and absolute values to those reported from other peri-tethyan regions. This comparison supports the identification of isotopic segments C4 to C7 of the OAE1a, during which the dominance of macroalgae over other benthic organisms is observed at Bir Oum Ali. The absence of the negative spike may be linked to either non preservation or non deposition: the OAE1a occurred in a global transgressive context, and since the study area was located in the innermost part of the southern Tethyan margin during most of the Aptian, stratigraphic hiatuses may have been longer than in other regions of the Tethys.",

            "abstract": "The representation of microphysics, especially ice microphysics, remains one of the major uncertainties in cloud-resolving models (CRMs). Most of the cloud schemes use the so-called bulk microphysics approach, in which a few moments of such distributions are used as the prognostic variables. The System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) is the CRM that employs two such schemes. The single-moment scheme, which uses only mass for each of the water phases, and the two-moment scheme, which adds the particle concentration for each of the hydrometeor category. Of the two, the single-moment scheme is much more computationally efficient as it uses only two prognostic microphysics variables compared to ten variables used by the two-moment scheme. The efficiency comes from a rather considerable oversimplification of the microphysical processes. For instance, only a sum of the liquid and icy cloud water is predicted with the temperature used to diagnose the mixing ratios of different hydrometeors. The main motivation for using such simplified microphysics has been computational efficiency, especially in the applications of SAM as the super-parameterization in global climate models. Recently, we have extended the single-moment microphysics by adding only one additional prognostic variable, which has, nevertheless, allowed us to separate the cloud ice from liquid water. We made use of some of the recent observations of ice microphysics collected at various parts of the world to parameterize several aspects of ice microphysics that have not been explicitly represented before in our sing-moment scheme. For example, we use the observed broad dependence of ice concentration on temperature to diagnose the ice concentration in addition to prognostic mass. Also, there is no artificial separation between the pristine ice and snow, often used by bulk models. Instead we prescribed the ice size spectrum as the gamma distribution, with the distribution shape parameter controlled by the temperature using the analytic expression also derived from observations. The new scheme has been implemented in SAM and has been tested and compared against the SAM’s single and two moment microphysics schemes in the simulations using the forcing data from several field campaigns. The preliminary results of such simulations will be presented.",

These observations are providing a satellite-based global data record of increasing relevance to climate change monitoring (where clouds are thought to play an integral feedback role). The lack of complete diurnal information regarding these key parameters presents an important shortfall from the MODIS or GOES sensors.\nBased on a lunar irradiance and reflectance model for the DNB channel (Miller and Turner, 2009), we have developed a new cloud optical properties retrieval scheme applicable to nighttime observations referred to nighttime lunar cloud optical and microphysical properties (NLCOMP), published in Walther et al. 2013. NLCOMP is implemented in the cloud retrieval scheme inside of the Pathfinder Atmospheres Extended (PATMOS-x) processing system and routine global processing has been demonstrated.\nWe will present validation studies and multi-months survey of optical cloud properties during night from NLCOMP,and in comparison to the daytime equivalent. We hope that on a long term, NLCOMP can help to extend regional and global ISCCP-like climatologies of cloud optical depth and effective particle size to fill the nighttime and polar winter gap of cloud observations.\nThe moonlight reflectance also add important input to the current cloud detection and cloud height retrievals at night.

As part of the mandate to explore for, characterize, and report Alabama’s mineral, energy, water, and biological resources for the betterment of Alabama’s citizens, communities, and businesses, the GSA has increasingly been called upon to make our data (including samples) more accessible to stakeholders.\nThe GSA has been involved in several data management, preservation, and rescue projects, including the National Geothermal Data System and the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program. GSA staff utilizes accepted standards for metadata, such as those found at the US Geoscience Information Network (USGIN). Through the use of semi-automated workflows, these standards can be applied to legacy data records.\nAs demand for more detailed information on samples increases, especially so that a researcher can do a preliminary assessment prior to a site visit, it has become critical for the efficiency of the GSA to have better systems in place for sample tracking and data management. Thus, GSA is in the process of registering cores and related samples for International Geo Sample Numbers (IGSNs) through the System for Earth Sample Registration. IGSNs allow the GSA to use asset management software to better curate the physical samples and provide more accurate information to stakeholders.

            "abstract": "Glacier surging represents an end-member behavior in the spectrum of ice dynamics, involving marked acceleration and high flow speeds due to abrupt changes in basal mechanics. Though much effort has been devoted to understanding the role of basal hydrology and thermal regime in fast glacier flow, fewer studies have addressed the potential role of the geologic substrate. One interesting observation is that surge-type glaciers appear almost universally associated with unconsolidated (till) beds, and several large-scale statistical studies have revealed correlations between glacier surging and bedrock properties. We revisit this relationship using field measurements.\nWe selected 20 individual glaciers for sampling in a 40x40 km region of the St. Elias Mountains of Yukon, Canada. Eleven of these glaciers are known to surge and nine are not. The 20 study glaciers are underlain by lithologies that we have broadly classified into two types: metasedimentary only and mixed metasedimentary-granodiorite. We characterized geological and geotechnical properties of the bedrock in each basin, and analyzed the hydrochemistry and mineralogy and grain size distribution (GSD) of the suspended sediments in the proglacial streams. Here we focus on some intriguing results of the GSD analysis.\nUsing statistical techniques, including significance testing and principal component analysis, we find that: (1) lithology determines GSD for non-surge-type glaciers, with metasedimentary basins associated with finer mean grain sizes and mixed-lithology basins with coarser mean grain sizes, but (2) the GSDs associated with surge-type glaciers are intermediate between the distributions described above, and are statistically indistinguishable between metasedimentary and mixed lithology basins. The latter suggests either that surge-type glaciers in our study area occur preferentially in basins where various processes conspire to produce a characteristic GSD, or that the surge cycle itself exerts an influence on grain size that masks the basic lithological control. If the presence of till promotes flow instability, our results suggest that the distribution of fines in the till may be an important geologic control on glacier dynamics.",

However, cosmogenic radionuclides are not only influenced by solar variability but also by climate effects on the deposition processes into natural archives. Such climate effects have led to disagreeing 10Be records for the past centuries and to disagreeing reconstructions of solar activity based on cosmogenic radionuclides. Records from Greenland ice cores appear to indicate a strong increase in solar activity during the recent centuries while Antarctic records indicate high but not exceptional solar activity during the second part of the 20th century. Here, we will review the available 10Be records with respect to their agreement and disagreement with the new sunspot number series. In addition, we will show that the new sunspot number series agrees very well with previously published 14C-based reconstructions of past solar activity.",

They have founded ChangeScale, a regional collaborative dedicated to providing high quality environmental education to hundreds of thousands of youth---by working together. ChangeScale's work involves setting up school district-level partnerships, providing technical assistance to local environmental education networks, and training environmental educators across the region. In this talk, the presenter, who is a founding member and steering committee chair for ChangeScale, will outline the challenges of working at a regional scale with dozens of organizations. She will share the processes ChangeScale has used to develop a business plan and build membership.

Such documentation is also needed to characterize the memories, pathways and feedbacks between key water, energy and biogeochemical cycles, and to resolve overarching scientific goals. The WCRP Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) project has a long-term scientific goal to obtain a quantitative description of weather-scale variations in the global energy and water cycles over a period of at least 20 years, which will provide the needed scientific basis for understanding climate variability and change.\nPresented will be the development of a multi-decadal (1982-2009) Climate Data Records (CDR) for the terrestrial water and energy budget variables using multiple remote sensing estimates, merged with in-situ and model estimates. The data sets include in-situ, re-analysis and satellite precipitation, satellite-based terrestrial evapotranspiration developed as part of the GEWEX/GDAP LandFlux initiative, land surface model (LSM/VIC) estimates of runoff and discharge into the oceans, LSM/VIC and GRACE-based total terrestrial water storage, and satellite-based surface net radiation and turbulent heat fluxes from 1984-2007.\nThis data set is the first multi-decadal terrestrial water cycle CDR that offers self-consistent estimates based on satellite, in-situ and reanalysis estimates. These data sets have been used to assess the variability and trends in the terrestrial water and energy budgets for ~1600 small basins, 32 large global basins and at continental scales. When combined with the ocean precipitation and evaporation estimates from GDAP SeaFlux initiative, global water cycle can be closed to within less than 2.5%. At regional scales, the data set is significantly more consistent than estimates from reanalysis.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological and water scarcity predictions have the potential to provide vital information for a variety of needs including water resources management, agricultural and urban water supply, and flood mitigation. In particular, seasonal forecasts of drought risk can enable farmers to make adaptive choices on crop varieties, labor usage, and technology investments. Forecast skill is generally derived from teleconnections with ocean variability specifically sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and, equally important persistence in the state of the land in terms of soil moisture, snowpack, or streamflow conditions. Short term precipitation forecasts are critical in flood prediction by extending flood prediction lead times beyond the basin travel time, and thus allows for extended warnings. The Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) is a UN-wide initiative in which WMO Members and inter- and non- governmental, regional, national and local stakeholders work in partnership to develop targeted climate services. Thus, GFCS offers the potential for hydroclimatologists to develop products (hydroclimatic forecasts) and information services (i.e. product dissemination) to users with the expectation that GFCS will increase the resilience of the society to weather and climate events and to reduce operational costs for economic sectors and regions dependent on water.\nThis presentation will discuss the development of a nascent climate service system focused on hydroclimatic monitoring and forecasting, and initially developed by the authors for Africa and Latin America. Central to this system is the use of satellite remote sensing and hydroclimate forecasts (from days to seasons) in the development of weather and climate information useful for water management in sectors such as flood protection (precipitation and streamflow forecasting) and agriculture (drought and crop forecasting). The elements of this system will be discussed, including the challenges of monitoring and forecast skill and the effective delivery of the information to decision makers.",

            "abstract": "Within the past few years, great progress has been made in tapping the genomes of individual cells separated from environmental samples. Unfortunately, however, most often these efforts have been target blind, as they did not pre-select for taxa of interest or focus on metabolically active cells that could be considered key species of the system at the time. This problem is particularly pronounced in low-turnover systems such as deep sea sediments.\nIn an effort to tap the genetic potential hidden within functionally active cells, we have recently developed an approach for the in situ fluorescent tracking of protein synthesis in uncultured cells via bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid-tagging (BONCAT). This technique depends on the incorporation of synthetic amino acids that carry chemically modifiable tags into newly made proteins, which later can be visualized via click chemistry-mediated fluorescence-labeling. BONCAT is thus able to specifically target proteins that have been expressed in reaction to an experimental condition.\nWe are particularly interested in using BONCAT to understand the functional potential of slow-growing syntrophic consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria which together catalyze the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in marine methane seeps. In order to specifically target consortia that are active under varying environmental regimes, we are studying different subpopulations of these inter-domain consortia via a combination of BONCAT with rRNA-targeted FISH. We then couple the BONCAT-enabled staining of active consortia with their separation from inactive members of the community via fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) and metagenomic sequencing of individual consortia. Using this approach, we were able to identify previously unrecognized AOM-partnerships. By comparing the mini-metagenomes obtained from individual consortia with each other we are starting to gain a more hollistic understanding of the genetic similarities and niche-determining characteristics of a range of functional and taxonomic clades of AOM-consortia.",

            "abstract": "The inner working of solar system gas giant planets remain elusive after decades of exploration. One lasting debate concerns the nature of east-west zonal flows observed on the cloud level of these planets with amplitude on the order of 100 m/s: an observational fact is yet to be established about whether these flows are shallow atmospheric dynamics or surface expression of deep interior dynamics. There is a good chance that such an observational fact can be established within the next few years, given the upcoming gravity and magnetic field measurements to be carried out by the Juno mission and the Cassini Grand Finale.\nIn this presentation, I will first describe a critical assessment of the applicability of the thermal wind equation (TWE) in calculating the gravity field associated with deep zonal flows. The TWE, which is a local diagnostic relation, captures the local density variations associated with the zonal flows while neglects the global shape change and density variations with non-local origins. Our analysis shows that the global corrections to the high degree gravity moments are small (less than a few tens of percent). Our analysis also shows that the applicability of the TWE in calculating the gravity moments does depend crucially on retaining the non-sphericity of the background density and gravity. Only when the background non-sphericity of the planet is taken into account in the calculation, the thermal wind equation (TWE) makes accurate enough prediction for the high-degree gravity moments associated with deep zonal flows (with errors less than a few tens of percent).\nI will then turn to the magnetic signals associated with deep zonal flows. Using mean field dynamo theory (MFDT), we show that detectable magnetic signals are expected: in the spatial domain, poloidal magnetic fields spatially correlated with deep zonal flows are expected; in the temporal domain, periodic oscillations of the poloidal magnetic field are expected. The period of the magnetic oscillations is controlled by the amplitude of the shear in the zonal flow as well as the amplitude of the dynamo alpha-effect. Numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) calculations designed to study the magnetic field zonal flow interactions seem to confirm the mean field theory picture for this problem.",

Finally, ensembles of flashes exhibit a scale-dependent distribution of electrical energy like that of a turbulent energy cascade. The role of turbulence in organizing charge into small pockets is under ongoing investigation as part of the Kinematic Texture and Lightning Experiment (KTaL), where the primary observational tools are the TTU Ka-band mobile Doppler radars and the West Texas Lightning Mapping Array.

In this study, we examine long-term changes of precipitation in the central U.S. associated with changes of MCSs. A 35-year MCS database has been constructed based on North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) observed precipitation and validated against a shorter satellite-based record. We find that the increase in total precipitation in the central U.S. (11%/decade) is due to increasing duration and frequency of MCSs, resulting in an increase of MCS precipitation (27%/decade), while non-MCS precipitation decreases (5%/decade). Changes in the large-scale environments responsible for the increasing longevity of MCSs in both reanalysis and numerical model experiments are analyzed to better understand the underlying mechanisms, with implications for potential future changes in a warming climate.",

Dust strongly impacts the thermal structure of the atmosphere and thus greatly affects atmospheric circulation, while clouds provide radiative forcing and control the hemispheric exchange of water through the modification of the vertical distributions of water and dust. Recent improvements in the quality and sophistication of both observations and climate models allow for a more comprehensive understanding of how the interaction between the dust and water cycles (through cloud formation) affects the dust and water cycles individually. We focus here on the effects of clouds on the vertical distribution of dust and water, and how those vertical distributions control the net meridional transport of water. For this study, we utilize observations of temperature, dust and water ice from the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) combined with the NASA ARC Mars Global Climate Model (MGCM). We demonstrate that the magnitude and nature of the net meridional transport of water between the northern and southern hemispheres during NH summer is sensitive to the vertical structure of the simulated aphelion cloud belt. We further examine how clouds influence the atmospheric thermal structure and thus the vertical structure of the cloud belt. Our goal is to identify and understand the importance of radiative/dynamic feedbacks due to the physical processes involved with cloud formation and evolution on the current climate of Mars.",

            "abstract": "Urban heat islands (UHI) are a real threat in many cities worldwide and mitigation measures have become a central component of urban planning strategies. Even within a city, causes of UHI vary from one neighborhood to another, mostly due the spatial variability in surface thermal properties, building geometry, anthropogenic heat flux releases and vegetation cover. As a result, the performance of UHI mitigation measures also varies in space. Hence, there is a need to develop a tool to quantify the efficiency of UHI mitigation measures at the neighborhood scale. The objective of this ongoing study is to validate the fast-response micrometeorological model QUIC EnvSim (QES). This model can provide all information required for UHI studies with a fine spatial resolution (up to 0.5m) and short computation time. QES combines QUIC, a CFD-based wind solver and dispersion model, and EnvSim, composed of a radiation model, a land-surface model and a turbulent transport model. Here, high-resolution (1 m) simulations are run over a subset of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) campus including complex buildings, various surfaces properties and vegetation. For nearly five months in 2006-07, a dense network of meteorological observations (92 weather stations over 0.1 km2) was deployed over the campus and these unique data are used here as a validation dataset. We present validation results for different test cases (e.g., sunny vs cloudy days, different incoming wind speeds and directions) and explore the effect of a few UHI mitigation strategies on the spatial distribution of near-surface air temperatures. Preliminary results suggest that QES may be a valuable tool in decision-making regarding adaptation of urban planning to UHI.",

Identifying areas of change mandates a baseline of nighttime light sources to use for comparison. Ideally this baseline would be free from ephemeral events such as fires, and have background (non-light) values identified and removed. Annual maps of persistent light sources have historically been created using data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) sensor, but the last available annual product is from 2013. Using the more recently available data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS-DNB) provides an opportunity to extend the record of nighttime lights products beyond the DMSP era, and it is possible to create vastly improved products due to the increased spatial resolution and dynamic range of the DNB over the OLS. This presentation will focus on the use of long time-series of DNB radiance values to identify background (non-light) areas and to separate areas with persistent nighttime lights from ephemeral lights, especially fires. Stability of the DNB radiance values will also be addressed.",

Basal melt driven by ocean heat flux has been linked to ice shelf thinning elsewhere in Antarctica, but no oceanographic measurements had been made near the Totten. In January 2015 the RSV Aurora Australis was the first ship to reach the Totten calving front. Observations from ship-board CTD, moorings and profiling floats provide direct confirmation that warm water reaches the ice shelf cavity. Warm water is present near the sea floor at every station deeper than 300 m depth, with maximum temperatures at mid-shelf >0.5°C. Mooring data confirm that the warm water is present year-round. A deep (>1100 m) channel at the calving front allows warm water (-0.4°C, >2°C above the local freezing point) to access the ice shelf cavity. The contrast between the oceanographic conditions near the Totten and near the Mertz Glacier is stark, although they are separated by only 30 degrees of longitude. East Antarctic ice shelves have often been assumed to behave in a similar manner and to be invulnerable to ocean change; these measurements suggest these assumptions need to be reconsidered.",

            "abstract": "The pulsating aurora is caused by intermittent precipitations of tens keV electrons. It is also expected that not only tens keV electrons but also sub-relativistic/relativistic electrons precipitate simultaneously into the polar ionosphere owing to whistler-mode wave-particle interactions. We analyzed a pulsating aurora event in November 2012 using several ground-based observation data from EISCAT radar, riometer, sub-ionospheric radio wave receivers, and the Van Allen Probes satellite. The electron density profile obtained from EISCA Tromsø VHF radar identifies electron density enhancements at >68 km altitudes. The electron energy spectrum derived from the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method indicates the wide energy electron precipitations from 10 - 200 keV, suggesting precipitation of the population from the outer belt. The riometer and network of sub-ionospheric radio wave observations also show energetic electron precipitations coinciding with the electron density enhancements at 68 km altitude. During this period, footprint of the Van Allen Probe-A satellite was very close to Tromsø, and the satellite observed rising tone emissions of the lower-band chorus (LBC) waves near the equatorial plane. Using the satellite-observed LBC and trapped electrons as an initial condition, we conducted a computer simulation of the wave-particle interactions. The simulation showed simultaneous precipitation of electrons at both tens of keV and a few hundred keV. This result is consistent with the energy spectrum estimated with the MCMC method. This result revealed that electrons with a wide energy range from the plasma sheet to the outer belt simultaneously precipitate into the polar ionosphere in association with the pulsating aurora. Using the Sodankylä Ion Chemistry (SIC) model that is a detailed coupled neutral and ion chemistry model of the upper atmosphere, we also discuss the possible impacts on the middle atmosphere due to precipitations of wide energy electrons.",

However, only a few numerical models (if any) consider coupled water, vapor and energy transport in both the subsurface and at the soil-atmosphere interface. While the subsurface is commonly implemented in existing models, which often consider both isothermal and thermally induced water and vapor flow, the effects of slope inclination, slope azimuth, variable surface albedo and plant shading on incoming radiation and spatially variable surface mass and energy balance, and consequently soil moisture distribution, is rarely considered. In this presentation we discuss these missing elements and our attempts to implement them into the HYDRUS model. We demonstrate implications of some of their interactions, their impact on the spatial distributions of soil temperature and water content, and their effect on soil evaporation.",

            "abstract": "California is currently suffering from a multiyear extreme drought and the impacts of the drought are anticipated to worsen in a warming climate. The resilience of critical infrastructure under extreme drought conditions is a major concern which has not been well understood. Thus, there is a crucial need to improve our understanding about the potential threats of drought on infrastructure and take subsequent actions in a timely manner to mitigate these threats and adopt our infrastructure for forthcoming extreme events. The need is more pronounced for earthen levees, since their functionality to protect limited water resources and dryland is more critical during drought. A significant amount of California’s levee systems are currently operating under a high risk condition. Protracted drought can further threaten the structural competency of these already at-risk levee systems through several thermo-hydro mechanical weakening processes that undermine their stability. Viable information on the implications of these weakening processes, particularly on California’s earthen levees, is relatively incomplete. This article discusses, from a geotechnical engineering perspective, how California’s protracted drought might threaten the integrity of levee systems through the imposition of several thermo-hydro mechanical weakening processes. Pertinent facts and statistics regarding the drought in California are presented and discussed. Catastrophic levee failures and major damages resulting from drought-induce weakening processes such as shear strength reduction, desiccation cracking, land subsidence and surface erosion, fissuring and soil softening, and soil carbon oxidation are discussed to illustrate the devastating impacts that the California drought might impose on existing earthen levees. This article calls for further research in light of these potential drought-inducing weakening mechanisms to support mitigation strategies for reducing future catastrophic levee failures.",

            "abstract": "We find that a portion of the north-south interplanetary magnetic field measured in situ near Earth is present from a direct outward mapping of closed fields from the low solar corona. Using the Current-Sheet Source Surface (CSSS) model (Zhao & Hoeksema, 1995 JGR 100, 19), these lower coronal fields are extrapolated upward from near the solar surface. Global velocities inferred from a combination of observations of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) matched to in-situ velocities and densities measured by spacecraft instrumentation provide an accurate outward timing to 1 AU from a model assuming conservation of mass and mass flux. The north-south field component at 1 AU is compared with the appropriate ACE magnetometer in-situ Normal (RTN) or Bn field coordinate (Jackson et al., 2015, ApJL, 803:L1). From a significant positive correlation between this method of determining the Bn field compared with in-situ measurements over a three-year period during the last solar minimum, we find that a small fraction of the low-coronal Bn component flux (~1%) regularly escapes from closed-field regions. Since the Bn field provides the major portion of the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) Bz field component that couples most closely to the Earth’s geomagnetic field, the prospects for its determination using this technique for space weather use are being actively developed by our many colleague groups.",

            "abstract": "The concept of the time-dependence of the occurrence of large events on a given geologic structure emerged from the elastic rebound theory of Reid (1910). Models were developed or chosen to account for it. For the most part, those models need the long-term recurrence time, a measure of the allowed short-term variability of the recurrence time (e.g., the coefficient of variation CoV), and are applied in conjunction with the time since the last event whenever possible. Geologic estimates of the long-term have been used for a long time. CoV values, on the other hand, were first assigned usually through a logic-tree approach featuring a preferred value and one or two alternative values. Later-on a generic CoV value was determined on a global dataset (Elssworth et al 1999). It is only recently that earthquake timing data at a site have become numerous and high resolution enough to warrant data-constrained estimates of CoV.\nWhereas a logic-tree approach, meant to formulate epistemic uncertainties, leads to different (weighted) estimates of risk metrics, an approach in which the model parameters (such as CoV) are constrained by earthquake data presents a different view of risk uncertainty.\nIndeed, when the data are not informative, the resulting hazard rate curve vs. time since last event is flat. As information becomes integrated in the model, if the fault indeed exhibits a time-dependent behavior, the hazard rate curve shows variability with elapsed time. In terms of risk, a flat hazard rate translates into a time-independent view of risk whereas a time-varying hazard rate results in short-term variations in risk estimates.\nIn this view, the hazard rate at a given time does not have an uncertainty associated to it (in the same way that a probability density function does not have an uncertainty associated to it). Its value integrates all the uncertainties coming from model and data. This approach allows a seamless update of risk metrics as new earthquake data becomes available.\nWe show on the example of crustal faults in the Wellington region, New Zealand, how very impactful the choice on a model for CoV is in terms of capital reserve requirements and other risk metrics. To do this, we choose various individual values of CoV, and we compare the risk results with those obtained using data-constrained posterior distributions of CoV.",

            "abstract": "One of the central questions in unconventional oil and gas production research is the cause of limited recovery of hydrocarbon. There are many hypotheses including: 1) inadequate penetration of fractures within the stimulated volume; 2) limited proppant delivery; 3) multiphase flow phenomena that blocks hydrocarbon migration; etc. Underlying any solution to this problem must be an understanding of the hydrologic properties of hydraulically fractured shale. In this study, we conduct triaxial coreflood experiments using a gasket sealing mechanism to characterize hydraulic fracture development and permeability of Utica Shale samples. Our approach also includes fracture propagation with proppants.\nThe triaxial coreflood experiments were conducted with an integrated x-ray tomography system that allows direct observation of fracture development using x-ray video radiography and x-ray computed tomography at elevated pressure. A semi-circular, fracture initiation notch was cut into an end-face of the cylindrical samples (1\"-diameter with lengths from 0.375 to 1\"). The notch was aligned parallel with the x-ray beam to allow video radiography of fracture growth as a function of injection pressure. The proppants included tungsten powder that provided good x-ray contrast for tracing proppant delivery and distribution within the fracture system. Fractures were propagated at injection pressures in excess of the confining pressure and permeability measurements were made in samples where the fractures propagated through the length of the sample, ideally without penetrating the sample sides. Following fracture development, permeability was characterized as a function of hydrostatic pressure and injection pressure. X-ray video radioadiography was used to study changes in fracture aperture in relation to permeability and proppant embedment. X-ray tomography was collected at steady-state conditions to fully characterize fracture geometry and proppant distribution.",

            "abstract": "California (CA) is currently experiencing a record-setting drought that started in 2012. Snowpack conditions in the Sierra Nevada (SN) mountains present an ominous sign of the severity of this drought: the April 1, 2015 snow water equivalent (SWE) was at only 5% of its historical average. However, no long-term historical context is available for the recent SN snowpack decline. We present an annually-resolved reconstruction of SN-wide April 1 SWE conditions for the past 500 years (Fig. 1). We combined an extensive compilation of blue oak tree-ring series that reflects large-scale CA winter precipitation anomalies with a CA February-March temperature reconstruction in a reconstruction that explains 63% of the SN SWE variance over the instrumental period. Our reconstruction reveals that the 2015 low is unprecedented in the context of the last 500 years. Our error estimation indicates that there is a possibility that a few - primarily16thcentury - years exceeded the 2015 low, but the estimated return interval for the 2015 SWE value - as calculated based on a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution - is 3,100 years and confirms the exceptional character of the 2015 SWE low. We further find that the 2015 SWE value is strongly exceptional - exceeding the 95 % CI for a 1000-yr return period - at low elevation SN sites where winter temperature has a strong control on SWE, but less so at high elevation sites, where it exceeds the 95 % CI for only a 95-yr return period.\nThe 2015 record low snowpack coincides with record high CA January-March temperatures and highlights the modulating role of temperature extremes in CA drought severity. Snowpack lows – amongst other drought metrics- are driven by the co-occurrence of precipitation deficits and high temperature extremes and we find that the exacerbating effect of warm winter temperatures is stronger at low than at high SN elevations. Anthropogenic warming is projected to further increase the probability of severe drought events, advance the timing of spring snowmelt, and increase rain-to-snow ratios. The ongoing and projected role of temperature in the amount and duration of CAs primary natural water storage system thus foreshadows major future impacts on CA water supplies.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands emit a third to half of the global CH4 flux and have the largest uncertainty of any emission source. Moreover, wetlands have provided an important radiative feedback to climate in the geologic and recent past. A number of largescale wetland CH4 models have been developed recently, but intermodel comparisons show wide discrepancies in their predictions. I present an empiricist's overview of the current limitations and challenges of more accurately modeling wetland CH4 emissions. One of the largest limitations is simply the poor knowledge of wetland area, with estimated global values varying by a more than a factor of three. The areas of seasonal and tropical wetlands are particularly poorly constrained. There are also few wetlands with complete, multi-year datasets for all of the input variables for many models, and this lack of data is particularly alarming in tropical wetlands given that they are arguably the single largest natural or anthropogenic global CH4 source. Almost all largescale CH4 models have little biogeochemical mechanistic detail and treat anaerobic carbon cycling in a highly simplified manner. The CH4:CO2 ratio in anaerobic carbon mineralization is a central parameter in many models, but is at most set at a few values with no mechanistic underpinning. However, empirical data show that this ratio varies by five orders of magnitude in different wetlands, and tropical wetlands appear to be particularly methanogenic, all for reasons that are very poorly understood. The predominance of the acetoclastic pathway of methanogenesis appears to be related to total CH4 production, but different methanogenesis pathways are generally not incorporated into models. Other important anaerobic processes such as humic substances acting as terminal electron acceptors, fermentation, homoacetogenesis, and anaerobic CH4 oxidation are also not included in most models despite evidence of their importance in empirical studies. Moreover, there has been an explosion of microbial studies in wetlands using high-throughput molecular techniques, but microbial community and functional parameters are largely missing from models. However, recently developed trait-based models show promise for reducing the multivariate complexity of this data into manageable parameters for large-scale CH4 models.",

            "abstract": "Snow cover monitoring has greatly benefited from remote sensing technology but, despite their critical importance, spatially distributed measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) in mountain terrain remain elusive. Current methods of monitoring SWE rely on point measurements and are insufficient for distributed snow science and effective management of water resources. Many studies have shown that the spatial variability in SWE is largely controlled by the spatial variability in snow depth. JPL’s Airborne Snow Observatory mission (ASO) combines LiDAR and spectrometer instruments to retrieve accurate and very high-resolution snow depth measurements at the watershed scale, along with other products such as snow albedo. To make best use of these high-resolution snow depths, spatially distributed snow density data are required to leverage SWE from the measured snow depths. Snow density is a spatially and temporally variable property that cannot yet be reliably extracted from remote sensing techniques, and is difficult to extrapolate to basin scales. However, some physically based snow models have shown skill in simulating bulk snow densities and therefore provide a pathway for snow depth to SWE conversion. Leveraging model ability where remote sensing options are non-existent, ASO employs a physically based snow model (iSnobal) to resolve distributed snow density dynamics across the basin. After an adjustment scheme guided by in-situ data, these density estimates are used to derive the elusive spatial distribution of SWE from the observed snow depth distributions from ASO. In this study, we describe how the process of fusing model data with remote sensing retrievals is undertaken in the context of ASO along with estimates of uncertainty in the final SWE volume products. This work will likely be of interest to those working in snow hydrology, water resource management and the broader remote sensing community.",

            "abstract": "Kinematic inversions of GPS and tide gauge/leveling data display an unresolved gap between the down-dip limit of the locked region and the top of the ETS zone in northern Cascadia. Moreover, physics-based models of slow slip events (SSE) result in nearly constant shear stress when averaged over the SSE cycle, implying additional slip-deficit within the ETS zone. Assuming the fault is locked to the top of the ETS zone, the predicted deformation-rates from such models do not adequately fit long-term GPS velocities, and especially the uplift rates.\nWe analyze long-term deformation rates to determine how much interseismic slip deficit accumulates on the megathrust. We first show that the use of heterogeneous Green's functions, which include a stiff oceanic mantle, compared to homogeneous, does not sufficiently bias the predicted slip rates to explain the gap identified in kinematic inversions. We then explore physics-based models with velocity-strengthening regions up-dip of the ETS zone, to account for steady creep within the gap. This yields ~1cm/year of creep within the gap, improving the fit to the geodetic data, however these models still misfit the uplift rates.\nAs an intermediate step between kinematic and fully physics-based inversion, we invert for the distribution of shear stress rate on the megathrust that best fits the data. We find that a small decrease in shear stress within the ETS zone, reaching 5 kPa/year at a depth of ~30 km, is required to fit the data. Possible explanations for this include a slow decrease in normal stress with time, possibly due to an increase in pore pressure, or a reduction in fault friction. We explore these hypotheses, and study their impact on both the SSE characteristics and on the seismic cycle, using 2D quasi-dynamic simulations with rate-and-state friction and isothermal v-cutoff models for generating slow slip events.",

            "abstract": "The last two decades have seen a grassroots effort by the international geochronology community to “calibrate Earth history through teamwork and cooperation,” both as part of the EARTHTIME initiative and though several daughter projects with similar goals. Its mission originally challenged laboratories “to produce temporal constraints with uncertainties approaching 0.1% of the radioisotopic ages,” but EARTHTIME has since exceeded its charge in many ways. Both the U-Pb and Ar-Ar chronometers first considered for high-precision timescale calibration now regularly produce dates at the sub-per mil level thanks to instrumentation, laboratory, and software advances. At the same time new isotope systems, including U-Th dating of carbonates, have developed comparable precision. But the larger, inter-related scientific challenges envisioned at EARTHTIME’s inception remain – for instance, precisely calibrating the global geologic timescale, estimating rates of change around major climatic perturbations, and understanding evolutionary rates through time – and increasingly require that data from multiple geochronometers be combined. To solve these problems, the next two decades of uranium-daughter geochronology will require further advances in accuracy, precision, and reproducibility.\nThe U-Th system has much in common with U-Pb, in that both parent and daughter isotopes are solids that can easily be weighed and dissolved in acid, and have well-characterized reference materials certified for isotopic composition and/or purity. For U-Pb, improving lab-to-lab reproducibility has entailed dissolving precisely weighed U and Pb metals of known purity and isotopic composition together to make gravimetric solutions, then using these to calibrate widely distributed tracers composed of artificial U and Pb isotopes. To mimic laboratory measurements, naturally occurring U and Pb isotopes were also mixed in proportions to mimic samples of three different ages, to be run as internal standards and as measures of inter-laboratory reproducibility. The U-Th community is undertaking many of the same protocols, and has recently created publicly available gravimetric solutions, and large volumes of three age solutions for widespread distribution and inter-laboratory comparison.",

            "abstract": "Summer stream temperature generally increases from the headwaters down to the outlets of major rivers, with longitudinal thermal gradients modified by riparian forest cover, groundwater and tributary inflows, the presence of surface water bodies, and potentially other landscape features. The objective of this study was to document downstream changes in summer stream temperature associated with a waterfall. The study focused on Shannon Falls in south coastal British Columbia, which descends 350 m over a horizontal distance of 500 m. Flow is cascading and highly aerated for most of its descent. Stream temperature was recorded at 10-minute intervals above and below the falls, and discharge was recorded 200 m downstream of the falls. Hourly air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were recorded at Squamish Airport, 12 km from the falls; air temperature and humidity were also recorded upstream of the falls at streamside and at an open site 100 m from the stream. The stream warmed 1 to 4 °C during its descent, with diurnal variations of about 1 °C during fine weather. A full energy balance analysis is not possible due to an inability to quantify the stream's surface area and its complex radiation geometry. Calculations indicate that the conversion of potential energy accounts for 0.8 °C of warming. An index of the combined effects of sensible and latent heat flux explained 70% of the variance in the downstream temperature changes, consistent with the hypothesis that the turbulent exchanges are enhanced in cascading, aerated flow.",

            "abstract": "Kīlauea alternates between periods of high and low magma supply rate, each period lasting centuries. The low rate is only a few percent of the high rate. High supply rate, typified by the past 200 years, leads to frequent lava flows, elevated SO2 emission, and relatively low-hazard Hawaiian-style explosive activity (lava fountains, spattering). Periods of low magma supply are very different. They accompany formation and maintenance of a deep caldera, the floor of which is at or below the water table, and are characterized by phreatomagmatic and phreatic explosive eruptions largely powered by external water. The low magma supply rate results in few lava flows and reduced SO2 output. Studies of explosive deposits from the past two periods of low magma supply (~200 BCE–1000 CE and ~1500–1800 CE) indicate that VEIs calculated from isopach maps can range up to a low 3. Clast-size studies suggest that subplinian column heights can reach >10 km (most recently in 1790), though more frequent column heights are ~5–8 km. Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) present severe proximal hazards; a PDC in 1790 killed a few hundred people in an area of Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park today visited by 5000 people daily. Ash in columns less than about 5 km a.s.l. is confined to the trade-wind regime and advects southwest. Ash in higher columns enters the jet stream and is transported east and southeast of the summit caldera. Recurrence of such column heights today would present aviation hazards, which, for an isolated state dependent on air transport, could have especially deleterious economic impact. There is currently no way to estimate when a period of low magma supply, a deep caldera, and powerful explosive activity will return. Hazard assessments must take into account the cyclic nature of Kīlauea's eruptive activity, not just its present status; consequently, assessments for periods of high and low magma supply rates should be made in parallel to cover all eventualities.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Antarctic and Southern Ocean science is vital to understanding natural variability, the processes that govern global change and the role of humans in the Earth and climate system. The potential for new knowledge to be gained from future Antarctic science is substantial. Therefore, the international Antarctic community came together to ‘scan the horizon’ to identify the highest priority scientiﬁc questions that researchers should aspire to answer in the next two decades and beyond. Wide consultation was a fundamental principle for the development of a collective, international view of the most important future directions in Antarctic science. From the many possibilities, the horizon scan identiﬁed 80 key scientiﬁc questions through structured debate, discussion, revision and voting. Questions were clustered into seven topics: i) Antarctic atmosphere and global connections, ii) Southern Ocean and sea ice in a warming world, iii) ice sheet and sea level, iv) the dynamic Earth, v) life on the precipice, vi) near-Earth space and beyond, and vii) human presence in Antarctica. Answering the questions identiﬁed by the horizon scan will require innovative experimental designs, novel applications of technology, invention of next-generation ﬁeld and laboratory approaches, and expanded observing systems and networks. Unbiased, non-contaminating procedures will be required to retrieve the requisite air, biota, sediment, rock, ice and water samples. Sustained year-round access to Antarctica and the Southern Ocean will be essential to increase winter-time measurements. Improved models are needed that represent Antarctica and the Southern Ocean in the Earth System, and provide predictions at spatial and temporal resolutions useful for decision making. A co-ordinated portfolio of cross-disciplinary science, based on new models of international collaboration, will be essential as no scientist, programme or nation can realize these aspirations alone.",

In situ observations in our solar system have shown that massloading is most conspicuous at active comets as their extended exospheres facilitate the implantation of cometary ions up to a few million km away from their nuclei. But massloading is also important in planetary induced magnetospheres as it contributes to the formation of the obstacle to the incoming plasma winds in addition to gravitationally bound ionosphere. In this work we revisit observations around planets, moons, and active comets with different degree of massloading and discuss the importance of planetary exospheres in the formation of induced magnetospheres. In particular, we focus on the formation of plasma boundaries (induced magnetospheric boundary, bow shock) and in particular the phenomena of accreted, 'fossil' magnetic flux tubes fields - first unveiled at comet P/Halley and more recently observed at Titan.",

            "abstract": "Changes in climate are forcing complex glaciological responses that can be transmitted to downstream ecosystems via glacier runoff. Along the Gulf of Alaska, rates of glacier mass loss are among the highest measured on Earth. Changes in glacier volume in this region are altering the amount of glacier runoff delivered to the coastal ocean. Moreover, shifts in glacier extent are changing the location of the ice-ocean interface and, in cases where tidewater glaciers become grounded, fundamentally altering circulation in glacierized fjords. The runoff from glacier ecosystems is unique in terms of its physical and chemical properties when compared to runoff from non-glacial ecosystems. For example, the silt and chemical constituents in glacier discharge alter light penetration and the nutrient regime in near-shore marine ecosystems, which, in turn, influence levels of marine primary productivity. Future changes in the magnitude, timing, and location of glacier runoff have important implications for biogeochemical and ecological processes in glacially-dominated fjords and estuaries. This talk will highlight research from glacierized watersheds and fjords to synthesize what is known about the physical, chemical, and biological linkages that characterize icefield-ocean ecosystems along the Gulf of Alaska.",

By coupling advances in the stability and portability of these measurements with new techniques for sampling trace gases, it has been possible to advance our understanding of the processes that contribute most to greenhouse gas emissions, to understand the distribution of these emissions in space and magnitude, as well as to quantify the regional impact of these emissions. These advances can best be illustrated through the recent focus on the CH4 emissions from oil and gas production in the US and the deployment of in-situ measurements on aircraft, automobiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Although these recent advances have significantly improved our ability to verify emission inventory estimates of CH4 emissions there are still gaps in our ability to extract multi-species information from point-source emissions and our ability to fully utilize the smaller UAV platforms that have reduced payload capacity and power.",

            "abstract": "Although multiple, sub-orbital peaks in sea level during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e have a long history in the literature, there is still debate regarding the number, timing, and magnitude of sea–level peaks. A wide range of competing scenarios have been proposed based on observations from individual field sites including: (i) a stable sea level, (ii) a stable sea level punctuated by an ephemeral drop in sea level (2 peaks), (iii) a stable sea level followed by a rapid rise (2 peaks), or (iv) several (3-4) peaks in sea level that define an oscillating trend during the highstand. While some field sites appear to have conflicting evidence regarding the timing and nature of relative sea-level changes that cannot be reconciled through glacial isostatic processes alone, clearly there must be one global mean sea level (GMSL) reconstruction that gave rise to the evidence that is presently observed in the geologic record.\nWe take a holistic approach to understanding the evolution of sea level during the MIS 5e highstand by integrating sedimentary, floral, faunal, and geochemical evidence from coral reef sites around the globe. Our aim is to develop a scenario for sea-level change during the MIS 5e highstand that satisfies the global observational dataset. Several conclusions emerge from this analysis: (1) there are many sites that preserve clear sedimentary evidence for two distinct sub-orbital peaks in sea level, and fewer that have possible evidence for more than two peaks; (2) there is conflicting evidence as to whether these two peaks are separated by an ephemeral sea-level fall, or whether they are defined by a stable sea level followed by a rapid rise; (3) multiple sites demonstrate significantly different geochemical signatures associated with distinct generations of reef growth as defined by their U-series geochemistry, indicating different post-depositional histories that may be related to differences in post-depositional marine submergence and exposure. Finally, while many studies agree that there was a significant Antarctic contribution to the MIS 5e sea level budget, the timing of this contribution remains debated. This presentation will focus on evaluating and reconciling competing hypotheses about the timing of rapid mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet.",

            "abstract": "Recent sea-level rise has been dominated by thermal expansion and glacier loss, but the contribution from mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is expected to exceed other contributions under future sustained warming. Due to limitations of existing ice sheet models and the lack of relevant analogues in the historical record, projecting the timing and magnitude of polar ice sheet mass loss in the future remains challenging. One approach to improving our understanding of how polar ice-sheet retreat will unfold is to integrate observations and models of sea level, ice sheets, and climate during past intervals of warmth when the polar ice sheets contributed to higher sea levels.\nA recent review evaluated the evidence of polar ice sheet mass loss during several warm periods, including interglacials during the mid-Pliocene warm period, Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11, 5e (Last Interglacial), and 1 (Holocene). Sea-level benchmarks of ice-sheet retreat during the first of these three periods, when global mean climate was ~1 to 3 deg. C warmer than preindustrial, are useful for understanding the long-term potential for future sea-level rise. Despite existing uncertainties in these reconstructions, it is clear that our present climate is warming to a level associated with significant polar ice-sheet loss in the past, resulting in a conservative estimate for a global mean sea-level rise of 6 meters above present (or more).\nThis presentation will focus on identifying the approaches that have yielded significant advances in terms of past sea level and ice sheet reconstruction as well as outstanding challenges. A key element of recent advances in sea-level reconstructions is the ability to recognize and quantify the imprint of geophysical processes, such as glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and dynamic topography, that lead to significant spatial variability in sea level reconstructions. Identifying specific ice-sheet sources that contributed to higher sea levels is a challenge that is currently hindered by limited field evidence at high latitudes. Finally, I will explore the concept of how increasing the quantity and quality of paleo sea level and ice sheet reconstructions can lead to improved quantification of contemporary changes in ice sheets and sea level.",

            "abstract": "Although field experiences are an important aspect of geoscience education, the opportunity to provide physical world experiences to large groups of introductory students is often limited by access, logistical, and financial constraints. Our project (NSF IUSE 1504619) is investigating the use of immersive virtual reality (VR) technologies as a surrogate for real field experiences in introductory geosciences classes. We are developing a toolbox that leverages innovations in the field of VR, including the Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard, to enable every student in an introductory geology classroom the opportunity to have a first-person virtual field experience in the Grand Canyon. We have opted to structure our VR experience as an interactive game where students must explore the Canyon to accomplish a series of tasks designed to emphasize key aspects of geoscience learning.\nSo far we have produced two demo products for the virtual field trip. The first is a standalone “Rock Box” app developed for the iPhone, which allows students to select different rock samples, examine them in 3D, and obtain basic information about the properties of each sample. The app can act as a supplement to the traditional rock box used in physical geology labs. The second product is a fully functioning VR environment for the Grand Canyon developed using satellite-based topographic and imagery data to retain real geologic features within the experience. Players can freely navigate to explore anywhere they desire within the Canyon, but are guided to points of interest where they are able to complete exercises that will be aligned with specific learning goals. To this point we have integrated elements of the “Rock Box” app within the VR environment, allowing players to examine 3D details of rock samples they encounter within the Grand Canyon. We plan to provide demos of both products and obtain user feedback during our presentation.",

            "abstract": "Amazon Forests, which play a vital role in global water, energy and carbon cycling, are predicted to experience both longer and more intensive dry seasons by the end of the 21st century. However, the climate sensitivity of this ecosystem remains uncertain: several studies have predicted large-scale die-back of the Amazon, while several more recent studies predict that the biome will remain largely intact. In this study we use an individual-based terrestrial ecosystem model to explore the sensitivity and ecological resilience of these forests to changes in climate. Our results show that water stress operating at the scale of individual plants, combined with spatial variation in soil texture, strongly influence the ecosystem’s resilience to changes in dry season length. Further analysis shows that two key traits influencing the climatic sensitivity of individuals within the plant canopy are their phenology and hydraulic architecture. In contrast to existing predictions of either stability or catastrophic biomass loss, our analyses indicate that, as a result of these effects of ecosystem diversity and heterogeneity, the Amazon forest’s response to a drying regional climate is likely to be an immediate, graded, heterogeneous transition from high biomass moist forests to transitional dry forests and woody savannah ecosystems. While fire, logging and other anthropogenic disturbances may exacerbate the impacts of climate-induced changes, our analysis indicates considerable spatial variation in the vulnerability of Amazon forests to human induced climate change.",

In this study, we examine how remote-sensing derived estimates of root zone soil moisture (RZSM) available from the AirMOSS P-band radar remote sensing instrument can be used to constrain terrestrial biosphere model predictions of carbon, water and energy fluxes on timescales ranging from hours to decades. Results from ecosystems in the continental US, including an eastern temperate forest, a mid-western grassland, a Californian oak-savannah, and a\nwestern conifer forest, indicate that RZSM measurements can provide an important data-constraint on terrestrial biosphere model predictions of how plant photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration respond to changes in soil moisture availability. In doing so, they pave the way for improved estimates of key model parameters and for reducing uncertainty in regional and continental carbon budgets.",

            "abstract": "This work presents a methodology for topographic and bathymetric data collection using multiple robot platforms in the data sparse Arkavathy region around Bangalore, India. In the late 20th century, Arkavathy River flows began declining; consequently, a dependence on the Cauvery River has occurred while the reasons for the drying of the Arkavathy remain unknown. Understanding this shift is critical for managing local water resources, specifically for quantifying the socio-hydrologic effects of human intervention through the use of tanks which serve as a controlled method of irrigation for farmers. Determining the potential volume of water capable of being stored in these tanks can aid investigators to better understand hydrologic parameters such as recharge and streamflow. At present, satellite and LiDAR data are the two methods to collect topographic and bathymetric data for this region, but both options are either too poor of resolution or too costly. Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) were demonstrated as low-cost and reliable, high-resolution alternatives for surface data gathering at two locations in the Arkavathy basin during a Summer 2015 field campaign: i) Hadonahalli, and ii) SM Gollahalli. This robot-assisted approach for data gathering will be of interest to investigators in the geophysical sciences, especially those operating with budget constraints in data sparse regions.",

            "abstract": "In 2013 the PAGES 2k Consortium released a paleo-temperature database with more than 500 records from 7 continental-scale regions, along with continental-scale temperature reconstructions derived independent by expert groups for each region. A major motivation of this effort was to increase the amount of regional expertise involved in identifying and evaluating paleoclimate records for their use in temperature reconstructions. The project highlighted the value of engaging regionally-based expertise in paleoclimatology; however, the resulting database was somewhat disjoint, as each group assembled data independently with somewhat distinct goals and criteria, which hindered the use of the database to answer questions that span across multiple regions. Moreover, key data (e.g., native measurements, chronological uncertainties) and metadata (e.g., seasonality) were not included. Phase 2 of the PAGES 2k temperature database improves upon these shortcomings with a community-built flexible database that can be used to address major questions about the climate of the Common Era, and to refine the methodologies used to reconstruct it. As in phase 1, the database was built upon the expertise of dozens of paleclimatologists whose regional expertise spans the globe. Phase 2 of the temperature database includes about 800 temperature-sensitive timeseries, derived from ten archive types, including from the oceans. Here we present the characteristics and structure of the database, including a suite of diagnostics used to evaluate the fidelity of the temperature signal in the data. This includes their correlation with instrumental temperature data; however this assessment is not possible with all the records in the database, and we also recognize that such correlations are an imperfect metric of how strongly a timeseries reflects temperature throughout the Common Era. Consequently, we also explore other metrics, including how well each record corresponds with with nearby sites back through time. We also present a simple global index reconstruction for the Common Era. These first-blush analyses highlight the potential for further discovery with these data, and we encourage the paleoclimate community to take advantage of this open resource.",

The behavior of turbulent transport in the weak-wind stably stratified boundary layer is then examined in terms of the non-stationarity of the wind field using measurements from three field programs with towers ranging from 12 to 20 m and an extensive horizontal network of sonic anemometers. The relationship of the friction velocity to the stratification and small non-stationary submeso motions are studied from several points of view and nominally quantified. The relationship of the turbulence to the stratification is less systematic than expected due to the important submeso motions. Cause and effect relationships are difficult to isolate because the non-stationary momentum flux significantly modifies the profile of the non-stationary mean flow. The link between the turbulence and accelerations at the surface is examined in terms of the changing vertical structure of the wind profile and sudden increases of downward transport of momentum. The relationship between the heat flux, wind speed and stratification is investigated. Weak wind conditions include frequent vertical convergence of the heat flux and implied temperature advection.",

            "abstract": "At Rio+20, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were conceived mainly as a mechanism to integrate and coordinate among the many multilateral agreements that already exist at the global level, as well as to identify any gaps among them. In Sep 2015 nations signed off on 17 goals with 169 targets, which had been developed through the most open process of consultation the United Nations has ever run. Agreement on a reasonably concise set of goals for achieving global sustainability and human development is an existential step forward, and to be applauded. However, the process led to much fragmented lobbying which is reflected in a loss of focus on the original objective of integration. There are many areas of the goals where interactions lead to trade-offs that need managing, and synergies which should be captured capturing. A few trade-offs, such as that between more energy use and less greenhouse gas emissions, are explicit in a target to double the rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030 (target 7.3). But there are many other interactions which are characterised poorly or not at all. In some cases integrative indicators are known; in others we do not necessarily know what to focus on to manage the interaction. Furthermore, the package of SDGs will be implemented at both global and national levels. Integrated thinking will be needed in this process of implementation, for example to assist developing countries to leapfrog western development pathways, and to promote a systems view on how environmental, social and economic outcomes are deeply integrated in the effecting of country development plans. Existing research can inform many of these interactions, whilst in other areas there in fact profound and fascinating new research needed to help decision makers. I will discuss this framing and highlight research, both existing and needed, that could speed up the world’s ability to deliver on its SDG commitment.",

            "abstract": "In this distributed, data-intensive era, developing any solution that requires multi-disciplinary data and service requires careful review of interfaces with data and service providers. Information is stored in many different locations and data services are distributed across the Internet. In design and development of mash-up heterogeneous data systems, the challenge is not entirely technological; it is our ability to document the external interface specifications and to create a coherent environment for our users. While is impressive to present a complex web of data, the true measure of our success is in the quality of the data we are serving, the throughput of our creation, and user experience. The presentation presents two current funded NASA projects that require integration of heterogeneous data and service that reside in different locations. The NASA Sea Level Change Portal is designed a “one-stop” source for current sea level change information. Behind this portal is an architecture that integrates data and services from various sources, which includes PI-generated products, satellite products from the DAACs, and metadata from ESDIS Common Metadata Repository (CMR) and other sources, and services reside in the data centers, universities, and ESDIS. The recently funded Distributed Oceanographic Matchup Service (DOMS) project is a project under the NASA Advance Information Technology (AIST) program. DOMS will integrate with satellite products managed by NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC) and three different in-situ projects that are located in difference parts of the U.S. These projects are good examples of delivering content-rich solutions through mash-up of heterogeneous data and systems.",

            "abstract": "We present the concept of a neutral gas torus surrounding the Sun, aligned with Pluto’s orbit, and place observational constraints based primarily on comparison of New Horizons (NH) measurements with a 3-D Monte Carlo model adapted from analogous satellite tori surrounding Saturn and Jupiter. Such a torus, or perhaps partial torus, should result from neutral N2 escaping from Pluto’s exosphere. Unlike other more massive planets closer to the Sun, neutrals escape Pluto readily owing, e.g., to the high thermal speed relative to the escape velocity. Importantly, escaped neutrals have a long lifetime due to the great distance from the Sun, ~100 years for photoionization of N2 and ~180 years for photoionization of N, which results from disassociated N2. Despite the lengthy 248-year orbit, these long e-folding lifetimes may allow an enhanced neutral population to form an extended gas cloud that modifies the N2 spatial profile near Pluto. These neutrals are not directly observable by NH but once ionized N2+ or N+ are picked up by the solar wind, reaching ~50 keV, making these pickup ions (PUIs) detectable by NH’s Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI) instrument. PEPSSI observations analyzed to date may constrain the N2 density; the remaining ~95% of the encounter data, scheduled for downlink in August along with similarly anticipated data from the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) experiment, should help determine the Pluto outgassing rates. Measurements from SWAP include the solar wind speed, a quantity that greatly enhances PUI studies by enabling us to directly account for the PUI distribution’s sensitive dependence on plasma speed. Note that anomalous cosmic ray Si observed at Voyager is overabundant by a factor of ~3000 relative to interstellar composition. This might be related to “outer source” PUIs, but the fact that N2 and Si are indistinguishable in many instruments could mean that N2 is actually driving this apparent Si discrepancy.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have concentrated on organized topography with well-defined slopes or valleys in an effort to understand the flow dynamics. However, most of the Earth’s land surface consists of gentle terrain that is quasi three dimensional. Different scenarios are briefly classified. A network of measurements are analyzed to examine shallow cold pools and drainage flow down the valley which develop for weak ambient wind and relatively clear skies. However, transient modes constantly modulate or intermittently eliminate the cold pool, which makes extraction and analysis of the horizontal structure of the cold pool difficult with traditional analysis methods. Singular value decomposition successfully isolates the effects of large-scale flow from local down-valley cold air drainage within the cold pool in spite of the intermittent nature of this local flow. \nThe traditional concept of a cold pool must be generalized to include cold pool intermittency, complex variation of temperature related to some three-dimensionality and a diffuse cold pool top. Different types of cold pools are classified in terms of the stratification and gradient of potential temperature along the slope. The strength of the cold pool is related to a forcing temperature scale proportional to the net radiative cooling divided by the wind speed above the valley. The scatter is large partly due to nonstationarity of the marginal cold pool in this shallow valley",

Feedbacks between processes result in complex dynamics that must be unraveled if one is to predict and, in the case of unconventional resources, facilitate fracture propagation, fluid flow, and interfacial transport processes. The proposed work is part of a broader class of complex systems involving coupled fluid flow and fractures that are critical to subsurface energy issues, such as shale oil, geothermal, carbon sequestration, and nuclear waste disposal. We use unique LANL microfluidic and triaxial core flood experiments integrated with state-of-the-art numerical simulation to reveal the fundamental dynamics of fracture-fluid interactions to characterize the key coupled processes that impact hydrocarbon production. We are also comparing CO2-based fracturing and aqueous fluids to enhance production, greatly reduce waste water, while simultaneously sequestering CO2. We will show pore, core and reservoir scale simulations/experiments that investigate the contolling mechanisms that control hydrocarbon production.",

            "abstract": "Evidence for late Holocene cooling (Neoglaciation) has been observed in proxy records from lake and marine sediments, ice cores, glacier moraines, and other archives. Despite the prevalence of such observations, an Arctic-wide quantitative analysis of the onset of Neoglaciation has not been undertaken. Here we use the proxy climate records in the Arctic Holocene Transitions (AHT) database to characterize the timing of the onset of Arctic Neoglaciation, as well as the amplitude of temperature change across the mid-Holocene transition. We then compare the results with a Holocene transient climate model simulation from the Community Climate System Model v3 (CCSM3 - TraCE-21 experiment). We applied both a broken-stick regression algorithm and a Bayesian change-point detection algorithm to systematically evaluate the presence and timing of the onset of Neoglaciation in the paleoclimate time series, propagating age uncertainty through both analyses. The resulting distribution of onset ages allows us to reject the hypothesis that there was a single Arctic-wide interval of Neoglacial cooling; rather, there were multiple onsets. Remarkably, we find similar results applying the same algorithms to surface temperatures simulated by the TraCE-21 experiment. CCSM3 also simulated multiple intervals of Neoglacial onsets, which are associated in the model with variability in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Consistent with the model simulations, observed temperature change across observed transitions ranged from 0 to 4ºC, with most sites showing less than 1.5ºC cooling. The similarities between the transient model simulations and the observed Arctic Neoglaciation are striking, especially given the discrepancies between simulated and observed Holocene temperature evolution based on global means.",

            "abstract": "Accurate simulations of turbulent flows require solving all the dynamically relevant scales of motions. This technique, called Direct Numerical Simulation, has been successfully applied to a variety of simple flows; however, the large-scale flows encountered in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) would require meshes outside the range of the most powerful supercomputers for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the current generation of petascale computers has enabled unprecedented simulations of many types of turbulent flows which focus on various GFD aspects, from the idealized configurations extensively studied in the past to more complex flows closer to the practical applications. The pace at which such simulations are performed only continues to increase; however, the simulations themselves are restricted to a small number of groups with access to large computational platforms. Yet the petabytes of turbulence data offer almost limitless information on many different aspects of the flow, from the hierarchy of turbulence moments, spectra and correlations, to structure-functions, geometrical properties, etc. The ability to share such datasets with other groups can significantly reduce the time to analyze the data, help the creative process and increase the pace of discovery.\nUsing the largest DOE supercomputing platforms, we have performed some of the biggest turbulence simulations to date, in various configurations, addressing specific aspects of turbulence production and mixing mechanisms. Until recently, the visualization and analysis of such datasets was restricted by access to large supercomputers. The public Johns Hopkins Turbulence database simplifies the access to multi-Terabyte turbulence datasets and facilitates turbulence analysis through the use of commodity hardware. First, one of our datasets, which is part of the database, will be described and then a framework that adds high-speed visualization and wavelet support for multi-resolution analysis of turbulence will be highlighted. The addition of wavelet support reduces the latency and bandwidth requirements for visualization, allowing for many concurrent users, and enables new types of analyses, including scale decomposition and coherent feature extraction.",

Little mass loading was observed until quite close to Pluto and the solar wind was excluded from a region filled with heavy ions from Pluto’s escaping atmosphere that extended well behind it.

The Probes reveal radiation belt and ring current dynamics with unrivaled accuracy and resolution, providing unambiguous evidence of resonant wave-particle interactions in the inner magnetosphere (e.g., L<7). It is well known that a class of such wave-particle interactions, namely ultra-low frequency (ULF; ~1-10 mHz) wave interactions, contribute to the radial transport of electrons and protons in this region and thus, the large-scale, global morphology of the radiation belts. We focus our investigations on observations of drift-resonance with shock-induced ULF waves, drift-resonance with localized, monochromatic ULF waves, and ULF fluctuations related to nightside particle injections.

            "abstract": "Unconventional energy production in semi-arid regions places additional stress on already over-allocated water systems. Production of shale gas and oil resources in northern Colorado has rapidly increased since 2010, and is expected to continue growing due to advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. This unconventional energy production has implications for the availability of water in the South Platte watershed, where water demand for hydraulic fracturing of unconventional shale resources reached ~16,000 acre-feet in 2014. Groundwater resources are often exploited to meet water demands for unconventional energy production in regions like the South Platte basin, where surface water supply is limited and allocated across multiple uses. Since groundwater is often a supplement to surface water in times of drought and peak demand, variability in modeled recharge estimates can significantly impact projected availability. In the current work we used the Soil-Water Balance Model (SWB) to assess the variability in model estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ET) and soil-moisture conditions utilized to derive estimates of groundwater recharge. Using both point source and spatially distributed data, we compared modeled actual ET and soil-moisture derived from several potential ET methods, such as Thornthwaite-Mather, Jense-Haise, Turc, and Hargreaves-Samani, to historic soil moisture conditions obtained through sources including the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). In addition to a basin-scale analysis, we divided the South Platte watershed into sub-basins according to land cover to evaluate model capabilities of estimating soil-moisture parameters with variations in land cover and topography. Results ultimately allow improved prediction of groundwater recharge under future scenarios of climate and land cover change. This work also contributes to complementary subsurface groundwater modeling and decision support modeling in the South Platte.",

Here, we highlight the extent to which unforced, low-frequency climate variability can drive multi-decadal trends in ozone. Using output from six experiments of the GFDL chemistry climate model (CM3), we demonstrate that 20-year trends in surface ozone driven by climate variability alone can be as large or larger than those forced by changes in ozone precursor emissions or by anthropogenic climate change over the same period. We highlight regions and seasons where seasonal surface ozone is more (less) influenced by climate variability, and thus, where forced trends may be more (less) difficult to detect. The time of emergence of forced trends in ozone between 2006-2055 is shown to be most dependent on changes in ozone precursor emissions and the regional unforced climate variability, while the impact of anthropogenic climate change is shown to be comparatively small.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost regions are changing rapidly, with even greater changes and potential infrastructure damage projected in coming decades. The Permafrost Forecasting System (PFS) will supply one-year-ahead, seasonal forecasts of Active Layer Thickness (ALT) and permafrost temperature for the state of Alaska to Federal, state, and local stakeholders. The PFS would consist of satellite and in situ data merged with NOAA seasonal forecasts to drive a permafrost forecast model using data assimilation. Measures of skill based upon existing observation networks such as the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program would allow critical tests of utility. Many of the required components exist, but require development and integration to create the end-to-end flow of data and products required for the PFS. Advanced permafrost models realistically simulate permafrost dynamics but lack the assimilation tools to link model, observations and NOAA seasonal forecasts. Here we describe the components of the PFS, the physical and organizational infrastructure to support it, and a basic implementation strategy consistent with available state and Federal resources. Such a system could prove useful in other countries with significant permafrost.",

            "abstract": "The panoramic splendor and complexity of mountain environments have inspired and challenged humans for centuries. These areas have been variously perceived as physical structures to be conquered, as sites of spiritual inspiration, and as some of the last untamed natural places on Earth. In our time, the perception that “mountains are forever” may provide solace to those seeking stability in a rapidly changing world. However, changes in the hydrology and in the abundance and species composition of the native flora and fauna of mountain ecosystems are potential bellwethers of global change, because these systems have a propensity to amplify environmental changes within specific portions of this landscape.\nMountain areas are thus sentinels of climate change. We are seeing effects today in case histories I present from the Himalaya’s, Andes, Alps, and Rocky Mountains. Furthermore, these ecosystem changes are occurring in mountain areas before they occur in downstream ecosystems. Thus, mountains are early warning indicators of perturbations such as climate change. The sensitivity of mountain ecosystems begs for enhanced protection and worldwide protection. Our understanding of the processes that control mountain ecosystems—climate interactions, snowmelt runoff, biotic diversity, nutrient cycling—is much less developed compared to downstream ecosystems where human habitation and development has resulted in large investments in scientific knowledge to sustain health and agriculture. To address these deficiencies, I propose the formation of an international mountain research consortium.",

            "abstract": "With a warming Earth’s atmosphere, the global water cycle is expected to intensify, a process that is likely to yield changes in the frequency and intensity of hydrological extremes. To quantify such changes over Europe, most previous research has been based upon precipitation scenarios. However, seldom has the horizontal water vapor transport (integrated vapor transport IVT) been investigated, a key variable responsible for heavy precipitation events and one that links water source and sink regions. It is hence the aim of this study to assess the projections of IVT across Europe.\nThe Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) is the source of the climate model projections. The historical simulations (1979–2005) and two emissions scenarios (2073–2099), or representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) from 22 global circulation models were retrieved and evaluated. In particular, at model grid points across Europe the mean, standard deviation, and the 95th percentile of IVT were calculated for December, January, and February (Boreal winter); and for June, July, and August (Austral winter).\nThe CMIP5 historical multi-model mean closely resembles the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. In the future under the two emissions scenarios, the IVT increases in magnitude, with the highest percentage changes occurring in the extreme emissions (RCP8.5) scenario; for example, multi-model mean IVT increases of 30% are found in the domain. An evaluation of the low-altitude moisture and winds indicates that higher atmospheric water vapor content is the primary cause of these projected changes.",

            "abstract": "Existing estimates of methane fluxes from wetlands differ in both magnitude and distribution across North America. We discuss seven different bottom-up methane estimates in the context of atmospheric methane data collected across the US and Canada. In the first component of this study, we explore whether the observation network can even detect a methane pattern from wetlands. We find that the observation network can identify a methane pattern from Canadian wetlands but not reliably from US wetlands. Over Canada, the network can even identify spatial patterns at multi-provence scales. Over the US, by contrast, anthropogenic emissions and modeling errors obscure atmospheric patterns from wetland fluxes. In the second component of the study, we then use these observations to reconcile disagreements in the magnitude, seasonal cycle, and spatial distribution of existing estimates. Most existing estimates predict fluxes that are too large with a seasonal cycle that is too narrow. A model known as LPJ-Bern has a spatial distribution most consistent with atmospheric observations. By contrast, a spatially-constant model outperforms the distribution of most existing flux estimates across Canada. The results presented here provide several pathways to reduce disagreements among existing wetland flux estimates across North America.",

            "abstract": "Ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet makes up roughly a third of current sea level rise, also generating substantial local and regional freshwater fluxes. Containing more than 6 meters of sea level rise equivalent in ice, Greenland has the potential to contribute much more to rising ocean levels and freshening water in the future. Understanding the dynamics of the ice sheet, particularly the behavior of fast flowing coastal outlet glaciers, is critical to improving predictions of future ice sheet change and associated impacts. Combining velocity, glacier ice front, sea ice, and ice sheet surface melt data, we made several important advances in characterizing and understanding seasonal glacier behavior and the processes driving change: 1) seasonal velocity patterns fall into at least 3 distinct patterns, 2) these seasonal velocity patterns likely indicate differences in glacier responsiveness to ocean versus subglacial hydrologic processes, and 3) in some regions seasonal versus multi-year velocity changes appear most strongly influenced by different environmental factors. Further progress was previously hampered by limits in measurement resolution across space and time. To address this challenge, we are creating a new - and continuously growing - ice velocity dataset from Landsat 8 imagery. This data stream supports comprehensive global measurements of ice flow, providing a leap in our understanding of ice sheet motion across space and time. We offer a high-level discussion of our research findings and an introduction to the new Landsat 8-enabled data stream. Our results and measurement capabilities deliver critical new knowledge about ice sheet behavior and interaction with ocean and climate factors. These advances, in turn, have important implications for other elements of Earth system research, including climate, oceanography, and biology.",

            "abstract": "Dextral oblique convergence in the Denali fault system results from subduction zone strain in the Alaska syntaxis that is partitioned into the upper plate. This convergence is accommodated by dextral-reverse oblique slip on segments of the main strand of the Denali fault in the center of the Alaska Range and by splay faults north and south of the Denali fault at the margins of the Alaska Range. Low-temp. thermochronometry applied to basement rocks bounded by faults within the Denali fault system aids stratigraphic data to determine the timing and locations of exhumation in the Alaska Range, which augment regional seismicity studies aimed at resolving modern fault activity in the Denali fault system. The McCallum Creek and Broxson Gulch faults are north-dipping faults that splay southward from the Denali fault near the Delta River and mark the southern margin of the eastern Alaska Range. Apatite fission track thermochronometry on rocks north of the McCallum Creek fault shows rapid cooling in the hanging wall coeval with basin development in the footwall initiating at the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. Apatite fission track and apatite (U-Th)/He ages from plutonic rocks in the hanging wall of the Broxson Gulch fault, west of the McCallum Creek fault, show final cooling in the Miocene, slightly younger than hanging wall cooling associated with the Susitna Glacier thrust further to the west. Neogene low-temp. cooling ages in the hanging walls of the Susitna Glacier thrust, Broxson Gulch, and McCallum Creek faults suggest that these structures have been accommodating convergence in the Denali fault system throughout the Neogene. More recent cooling in the hanging wall of the McCallum Creek compared to the Susitna Glacier thrust suggests that this fault-related exhumation has migrated eastward throughout the Neogene. Convergence on these splay faults south of the Denali fault results in internal contraction of the crust south of the Denali fault, implying that the Southern Alaska Block does not move as a purely rigid body and does move with components of both northwestward translation and counterclockwise rotation. These low-temp. cooling ages illustratively reveal that complex patterns of exhumation in the Alaska Range reflect the complicated evolution of the Denali fault system as a major tectonic component in southern Alaska.",

The existing models of the proton and ion environments at Jupiter have been revised and extended from the original 12 jovian radii out to 50 jovian radii using the latest Galileo data. In addition to the physical significance of these particle populations, the new models will be important in the evaluation and design of solar arrays at Jupiter as they can affect the radiation damage to the solar array cells and cover glass. The new models represent an important update to the tools currently being used to study the effects of the jovian environment on spacecraft. These models (part of the GIRE family of electron and proton models) are currently used worldwide to describe that jovian environment and are the main tools used by NASA to determine the effects of this environment on spacecraft systems and instruments. The update to be presented is the first significant revision (extending the proton and ion models from 12 Rj to 50 Rj) to the GIRE proton environment since 1983 and fills an important gap in our understanding.",

Two issues of interest in the region are changes in the water footprint and nitrogen use of wheat-based systems as a result of climate change. These two are related to the interaction between crop performance and the partitioning of water and nitrogen budget components. They also inform the tradeoff between crop production and environmental services and the sustainability of wheat systems in the future.\nComputer simulation-based assessment is being done using the CropSyst cropping systems model and daily weather data downscaled to a 4x4 km grid. Future weather is projected using 14 general circulation models (GCMs) and two representative concentration pathways of future atmospheric CO2 (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The study region is divided in 3 agro-ecological zones (AEZ): low, intermediate and high precipitation zones. The following rotations were included by AEZ: WW – SF (low precipitation), WW – SW – SF (intermediate precipitation), and WW – SW – SP (high precipitation), where WW is winter wheat, SW is spring wheat, SP is spring peas, and SF is summer fallow.

            "abstract": "Nutrient addition experiments, such as Tracer Additions for Spiraling Curve Characterization (TASCC), have become widely popular as a means to study nutrient uptake dynamics in stream ecosystems. However, the impact of these additions on ambient concentrations of non-added solutes is often overlooked. TASCC addition experiments are ideal for assessing interactions among solutes because it allows for the characterization of multiple solute concentrations across a broad range of added nutrient concentrations. TASCC additions also require the addition of a conservative tracer (NaCl) to track changes in conductivity during the experimental manipulation. Despite its use as a conservative tracer, chloride (Cl) and its associated sodium (Na) might change the concentrations of other ions and non-added nutrients through ion exchange or other processes. Similarly, additions of biologically active solutes might change the concentrations of other non-added solutes. These methodological issues in nutrient addition experiments have been poorly addressed in the literature. Here we examine the response of non-added solutes to pulse additions (i.e. TASCC) of NaCl plus nitrate (NO3-), ammonium, and phosphate across biomes including temperate and tropical forests, and arctic taiga. Preliminary results demonstrate that non-added solutes respond to changes in the concentration of these added nutrients. For example, concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in suburban headwater streams of New Hampshire both increase and decrease in response to NO3- additions, apparently due to biotic processes. Similarly, cations such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium also increase during TASCC experiments, likely due to cation exchange processes associated with Na addition. The response of non-added solutes to short-term pulses of added nutrients and tracers needs to be carefully assessed to ensure that nutrient uptake metrics are accurate, and to detect biotic interactions that may provide insights into fundamental aspects of stream nutrient cycling.",

            "abstract": "Volatile and ore metals within magmas record a wide variety of magmatic processes in the Earth’s shallow upper crust. These elements have previously been linked to volatile degassing or exsolution and such processes as eruption triggering and the formation of magmatic ore deposits. However, it is unknown why different volcanoes, or different eruptions of the same volcano, record such wide-ranging geochemical behaviour. More fundamental questions related to the source of these metals also remain unanswered, such as what role (if any) does subduction play in controlling metal fluctuations. In an effort to ascertain the sources of volatile and ore metal variation in intermediate-silicic magmas, this study attempts to take a more comprehensive look at the causes of volatile and ore metal variation in arc magmas as a function of composition and location within a single arc system.\nThis study focuses on the New Zealand arc system, stretching from Mt Taranaki to White Island, examining volatile and trace metals (including Li, Cu, As, Mo, Sb, Sn, W, and Tl) from varying phenocryst phases and melt inclusions. Melt inclusion compositions range from basaltic (51 wt% SiO2) to high-Si rhyolite (81 wt% SiO2), however are predominantly andesitic to dacitic. Sulfur and Cl melt compositions are also highly variable, with concentrations from below detection limit up to ~2000 ppm S and 5300 ppm Cl. Trace metal abundances were determined for all major phenocryst phases, including plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and amphibole and biotite where available. Comparing trace metal abundances of phenocrysts and inclusions to both glass and crystal major element/volatile compositions allows for a systematic comparison of volcanoes along the arc. Lithium and Cu are the only two trace metals above detection limit in all analysed phases, however, Cu variations are highly variable compared to other ore metals. New experimental crystallisation runs with hydrous dacite also allow us to assess the variations in Li partitioning behaviour between different mineral phases and glass, to test for potential volatile fluxing. Results show that Li is moderately incompatible in both plagioclase and amphibole, and compatibility for plagioclase < amphibole, with DLi (crystal/melt) averaging 0.30 and 0.40 for these two phases, respectively.",

This provides a high level of robustness in this system, and geographically disperses the impacts of local actions.",

Increased access to the Arctic and the push to develop its resources has also created a requirement for developing national policies to address the possibilities of oil spill response and remediation. Norway and Russia are the significant regional powers, with a shared arctic boundary, yet substantially differing approaches to policy development and implementation. We are exploring the variations in their approaches to Arctic offshore oil-spill policy development, in the context of policy informed by economic, social, and physical sciences.",

            "abstract": "Earth is the only planet known to currently feature active plate tectonics. Two features that may influence the Earth's ability to sustain plate-like surface motion are the presence of continents and the inferred chemical piles lying on the core mantle boundary. In our previous study that modelled thermochemical convection in the mantle with evolving plates, it was shown that upwellings that form on top of chemical piles are relatively weak and make a diminished contribution to lithospheric stress. Yet, surface yielding is required in order to maintain plate tectonics and form new plate boundaries. Consequently an intrinsically dense layer in the lower mantle can decrease the vigour of convection and the likelihood of surface failure. In contrast to the mantle upwellings that form above the chemically dense provinces in our models, particularly vigorous plumes form where the ambient mantle lies adjacent to the core mantle boundary and at the edges of the chemically dense piles. Continents also affect surface mobility, due to their inherent buoyancy and their distinct yield strength. In this study we employ numerical models of mantle convection featuring both tectonic plates and compositional variation in the mantle and lithosphere. Plate-like surface motion is dynamically modelled using a force-balance method that determines plate velocities based upon lithospheric stresses. Oceanic and continental margins evolve in response to the plate velocities and specified lithospheric yield stresses. Compositional variations in the deep mantle are tracked using the tracer ratio method. For a range of ratios of the ambient mantle density to the density of the compositionally enriched material, we examine the the impact of mantle compositional variation on plate evolution, the effect of continents on planetary surface mobility and the frequency of supercontinent assembly versus the mobility of compositional provinces.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_Mace_PNNL-SA-114966.pdf\nArgon-39 can be used as a radiotracer to age-date groundwater aquifers to study recharge rates and to better understand the mean residence time, or age distributions, of groundwater. Argon-39 (with a half-life of 269 years) is created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays interacting with argon in the air (primarily 40Ar). The use of 39Ar as a radiotracer fills a gap in the age dating range which is currently covered by 3H/3He or 85Kr (< 50 years) and 14C (>1000 years); 39Ar fills the intermediate time scale range from 50-1000 years where the previously established radiotracers are not adequate.\nWe will introduce the process for purifying and detecting 39Ar in ground water using ultra-low-background proportional counters (ULBPCs) at the shallow underground laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Argon-39 is detected through direct beta counting using ULBPCs loaded with a mixture of geologic argon (extracted from a carbon dioxide well with no measureable 39Ar activity) and methane, which enhances the sensitivity for 39Ar measurements. The ULBPCs have been shown to have a background count rate of 148 counts per day (cpd) in the energy range 3-400 keV when filled with 10 atm of P-10 counting gas (90% geologic Ar, 10% CH4).\nInitial demonstration samples were collected from groundwater aquifers in Fresno, California supported by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). A discussion of the sampling technique to degas the water from these wells and to then purify it for counting will be presented. In order to quantify the 39Ar contribution in the groundwater samples, the ULBPCs were characterized to determine two components: 1) the detector efficiency to modern levels of 39Ar, and 2) the remaining detector background (using geologic sourced argon which is free from 39Ar – no measureable 39Ar activity). These characterization results will be presented along with a discussion of the quantification of the 39Ar age of the demonstration measurements.",

            "abstract": "The development of unconventional oil and gas resources in Colorado started to rapidly increase since the early 2000’s. The recent oil price plunge resulted in a decline of well starts’ rate in the US, but in Weld County, Colorado, it is currently at the 2013-levels. The additional water demand, despite its insignificant percentage in overall state’s demand (0.1% in 2012), it competes with traditional ones, since Colorado’s water is almost fully appropriated. Presently, the state has 53,597 active producing oil and gas wells. More than 40% of these are located in Weld County, which happens also to be one of top food production U.S. counties. The competition for land and water resources between the energy and agricultural sectors in water stressed areas, like the western U.S., is further intensified if recycle and reuse practices are not preferred to water disposal by the energy industry. Satisfying the multiple objectives of the Water-Energy-Food Nexus in order to achieve sustainable economic development requires balanced management of these resources. Identifying pressures on key areas that food and energy sectors are competing for water, is essential for prudent water management and developing appropriate policies. Weld County, as a water stressed and fossil fuel producing area, was selected for investigating current stresses on local water resources alongside with future climatic and water demand scenarios for exploring probable long-term effects.",

Strong competition for water resources in an over-appropriated system brings challenges to meeting future water demands. Balancing the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater from the South Platte alluvial aquifer and the Denver Basin aquifer system is critical for meeting future demands. Over the past decade, energy development in the basin has added to the competition for water resources, highlighting the need to advance our understanding of the availability and sustainability of groundwater resources. Current work includes evaluating groundwater storage changes and recharge regimes throughout the South Platte Basin under competing uses, e.g. agriculture, oil and gas, urban, recreational, and environmental. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites in conjunction with existing groundwater data is used to evaluate spatiotemporal variability in groundwater storage and identify areas of high water stress. Spatiotemporal data will also be utilized to develop a high resolution groundwater model of the region. Results will ultimately help stakeholders in the South Platte Basin better understand groundwater resource challenges and contribute to Colorado’s strategic future water planning.",

            "abstract": "Little is known of the reaction products of emissions to the atmosphere from extraction of oil from unconventional sources in the oil sands (OS) region of Alberta, Canada. This study examines these reaction products, and in particular, the extent to which they form secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which can significantly contribute to regional particulate matter formation. An aircraft measurement campaign was conducted over the Athabasca oil sands region between August 13 and September 7, 2013. A broad suite of measurements were made during 22 flights, including organic aerosol mass and composition with a High Resolution Time of Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and organic aerosol gas-phase precursors by Proton Transfer Reaction (PTR) and off-line gas chromatography mass spectrometry.\nLarge concentrations of organic aerosol were measured downwind of the OS region, which we show to be entirely secondary in nature. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that bitumen (the mined product) contains semi-volatile vapours in the C12-C18 range that will be emitted at ambient temperatures. When oxidized, these vapours form SOA with highly similar HR-ToF-AMS spectra to the SOA measured in the flights. Box modelling of the OS plume evolution indicated that the measured levels of traditional volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are not capable of accounting for the amount of SOA formed in OS plumes. This discrepancy is only reconciled in the model by including bitumen vapours along with their oxidation and condensation into the model. The concentration of bitumen vapours required to produce SOA matching observations is similar to that of traditional VOC precursors of SOA. It was further estimated that the cumulative SOA mass formation approximately 100 km downwind of the OS during these flights, and under these meteorological conditions was up to 82 tonnes/day. The combination of airborne measurements, laboratory experiments and box modelling indicated that semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) are emitted from OS operations which accounted for >85% of the formed SOA mass in these plumes. Implications of this SOA formation will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Soil is a major reservoir of carbon (C) that contains more than three times the C in vegetation. While the terrestrial biosphere acts as a sink for approximately 2.5 petagrams C per year (PgC/yr) – equivalent to about 25% of fossil fuel emissions – anthropogenic land-use change reduces the global net land C sink by approximately 1 PgC/yr. Although most assessments of land-use focus on changes in aboveground biomass C, changes to ‘live C’ (above- and below-ground plant biomass) drive lagged, yet substantial, changes to ‘dead C’ (soil, dead wood, and litter) storage, with important implications for the overall land C balance.\nHere we provide an observation- and model-based assessment of the impacts of land-cover change on total C stocks (live and dead C) over the last decade and the potential for long-term soil C storage or loss. We find that afforestation in northern latitudes counteracts deforestation in the tropics, due in part to the greater soil C content of boreal and temperate forests. Deriving geospatial estimates of the steady-state ratio of dead to live C and the turnover time of dead C, we demonstrate that, although many recent studies have focused on forests, non-forest ecosystems (particularly shrublands and savannahs) may be responsible for larger changes in total C stocks in response to changes in C input rates due to their high soil C content. Furthermore, we disaggregate our geospatial predictions by biome and explore the depth-resolved vulnerability of soil C globally, with particular focus on the covariation of soil C sensitivity with soil properties and climate. Our findings suggest that the response of soil to changes in plant inputs significantly contributes to regional and global C budgets.",

            "abstract": "Deep long-offset seismic-reflection now frequently provide imaging of strong and laterally continuous reflectors in the TWTT range of 10 to 14 seconds. Examples of deep laterally-coherent reflectivity can be seen within the ocean-continent transition of the Argentine, Uruguayan and S Brazilian volcanic margins of the S Atlantic. Qualitative interpretation of the seismic data suggests the presence of deep crustal \"keels\" or crustal roots underlying well developed seaward dipping reflectors (SDRs).\nWhile an initial interpretation might be that these reflectors correspond to the crust-mantle interface, this interpretation may in some cases be incorrect or over-simplistic. Do these deep reflectors correspond to the petrological Moho or could they be located within the mantle?\nJoint inversion of the PSTM time-domain seismic reflection and gravity anomaly data has been used to determine the average interval density and seismic velocity between base sediment and the deep seismic reflectivity. Joint inversion densities and seismic velocities for this depth interval reach values in excess of 3000 kg/m3 and 7.0 km/sec for the entire thickness of the interval, substantially in excess of densities and velocities observed for normal oceanic and continental crust. The high densities determined from joint seismic-gravity inversion under the SDR regions are also consistent with results from flexural subsidence analysis.\nWe consider two interpretations of these results. One interpretation is that the strong deep reflectivity corresponds to the base of the petrological crust and that the crust has an abnormally high average density and seismic velocity due to high-temperature mantle-plume-related magmatism. An alternative interpretation is that the deep seismic reflectivity is located within the mantle beneath the petrological Moho, and that the high density and seismic velocity result from averaging of both crustal basement (~2850 kg/m3) and mantle (~3300 kg/m3) values. In some examples, additional analysis of the deep seismic reflection data suggests that the latter interpretation is correct i.e. the strong deep seismic reflectivity is located within the mantle. The presence of well developed SDRs above suggests that the strong deep seismic reflectivity within the mantle may be magmatic in origin.",

The design of national and international policies targeted at building more resilient and environmentally sustainable food systems needs to rely on access to robust and reliable data which is largely absent. In this context, the improvement of the modelling of current and future agricultural production losses using the unifying language of risk is paramount. In this study, we use a methodology that allows the integration of the current understanding of the various interacting systems of climate, agro-environment, crops, and the economy to determine short to long-term risk estimates of crop production loss, in different environmental, climate, and adaptation scenarios. This methodology is applied to Tanzania to assess optimum risk reduction and maize production increase paths in different climate scenarios. The simulations carried out use inputs from three different crop models (DSSAT, APSIM, WRSI) run in different technological scenarios and thus allowing to estimate crop model-driven risk exposure estimation bias. The results obtained also allow distinguishing different region-specific optimum climate risk reduction policies subject to historical as well as RCP2.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios. The region-specific risk profiles obtained provide a simple framework to determine cost-effective risk management policies for Tanzania and allow to optimally combine investments in risk reduction and risk transfer.",

            "abstract": "The origin of the martian moons Phobos and Deimos is obscure and enigmatic. Hypotheses include the capture of asteroids originally from the outer main belt or beyond, residual material left over from Mars’ formation, and accreted ejecta from a large impact on Mars, among others. Measurements of reflectance spectra indicate a similarity to dark, red D-type asteroids, but could indicate a highly space-weathered veneer. Here we suggest a way of constraining the near-surface composition of the two moons, for comparison to known meteoritic compositions. Neutron spectroscopy, particularly the thermal and epithermal neutron flux, distinguishes clearly between various classes of meteorites and varying hydrogen (water) abundances. Perhaps most surprising of all, a rendezvous with Phobos or Deimos is not necessary to achieve this. A low-cost mission based on the LADEE spacecraft design in an eccentric orbit around Mars can encounter Phobos every 2 weeks. As few as five flyby encounters at speeds of 2.3 km/sec and closest-approach distance of 3 km provide sufficient data to distinguish between ordinary chondrite, water-bearing carbonaceous chondrite, ureilite, Mars surface, and aubrite compositions. A one-Earth year mission design includes many more flybys at lower speeds and closer approach distances, as well as similar multiple flybys at Deimos in the second mission phase, as described in the Phobos And Deimos Mars Environment (PADME) mission concept. This presentation will describe the expected thermal and epithermal neutron fluxes based on MCNP6 simulations of different meteorite compositions and their uncertainties.",

Geochemical trends of fluvial mudstones from these units indicate changing sedimentary source areas through time. While the Kirtland and Nacimiento Formations represent periods of high accommodation within the San Juan Basin, the Ojo Alamo Sandstone represents a period of low accommodation and general reworking and transport by southeast-flowing paleorivers. The Kirtland and Nacimiento Formations thin and fine away from their interpreted source area whereas the Ojo Alamo Sandstone thickens and fines away from the source area. Here we investigate the enigmatic sedimentary architecture of the Ojo Alamo Sandstone, geochemical evidence for a changing source area through this time period, and the complex relationships between sedimentation, source area, accommodation, and basin tectonic evolution. Incorporating new measured sections, petrographic analyses, geochemical trends, and stratigraphic relationships, we propose that the Ojo Alamo Sandstone represents an anomalous short period of low accommodation in the San Juan Basin during the early Laramide Orogeny and explore possible intra- and extra-basinal tectonic, climatic, and sedimentologic explanations as well as implications for understanding the evolution of the basin.",

            "abstract": "Meltwater storage in and beneath the ice sheet exerts strong control on ice flow velocity by modifying the ice thermal structure and basal sliding. However, observations of meltwater storage in Greenland are sparse and mostly limited to the margins of the ice sheet, providing an incomplete view on how water is distributed. To address this shortcoming, we use an integrated approach of radar analyses, and thermal and subglacial hydrology modeling to produce the first, catchment-wide characterization of the subglacial hydrological network. Our study focuses on a 1450 km2 section of Russell Glacier and Isunnguata Sermia. We use the depth profiles of ice temperature from a thermal model to correct radar englacial attenuation losses, and produce maps of relative basal reflectivity from radar bed echoes. We examine the reflectivity relative to a subglacial hydrology model, and show that substantial volumes of water store in an extensive subglacial hydrological network. Data from mid-April show that subglacial water concentrates along the basal valleys in the lower catchment directly below where numerous moulins open later in the season. Additionally, we identify an unusually low apparent reflectivity feature at the catchment boundary of Russell and Isunnguata. We suggest that the apparent reflectivity anomaly is a result of high englacial attenuation losses associated with a basal temperate layer ~250 m thick and ~14 km2 in area. This temperate layer was previously observed in another melt season from boreholes temperature measurements, suggesting that it is likely is a persistent and contiguous feature. Our results demonstrate the integration of observations and modeling are a powerful approach to characterize Greenland hydrology and its effect on ice sheet thermal state that may modify ice dynamics critically.",

            "abstract": "A Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the uncertainty of mass discharge measurements from point and pumping based measurements was conducted. Mass flux (MF) and mass discharge (MD) have been recognized as important metrics for contaminated site management. They utilize both groundwater flux and contaminant concentration information to estimate the contaminant mass per unit time across control planes at contaminated sites. Two different approaches are generally applied to measure MF: point measurement methods and pumping based methods. Both methods inherently contain uncertainty that should be identified and quantified to utilize MD information appropriately. This uncertainty results primarily from incomplete knowledge about subsurface complexity and an inability to fully characterize such complexity due to cost and resource limitations. The focus of this study is the evaluation of uncertainty resulting from aquifer heterogeneity, measurement methods, and plume conditions. The result showed that the common conception that pumping based methods are generally superior to point measurement methods for estimating the MD is not valid for all circumstances. If there are no extreme hot spots in the domain, the point-based methods showed comparable uncertainty to pumping based methods, even under highly heterogeneous conditions. It was also noted, as in previous studies, that the hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient are determining factors for the uncertainty of MD measurements. The uncertainty varied significantly depending on how these parameters were estimated.",

Stream interactions due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), corotating interaction regions (CIRs), and other transient phenomena are known to merge producing global merged interaction regions (GMIRs). Numerical simulations of the solar wind interaction with the local interstellar medium (LISM) show that GMIRs, as well other time-dependent structures in the solar wind, may produce compression and rarefaction waves and shocks in the LISM behind the heliopause. These shocks may initiate wave activity observed by the Voyager spacecraft. The magnetometer onboard Voyager 1 indeed observed a few structures that may be interpreted as shocks. Starting from OMNI data at 1 AU, we present numerical simulations of such shocks in 2012, when Voyager 1 observed traveling shocks. We analyze the shock properties such as strength, propagation speed, and inter-shock separation by enhancing the resolution locally with adaptive mesh refinement. We compare these results with the plasma and magnetic field behavior after Voyager 1 crossed the heliospheric boundary. Lastly, we perform timing tests on the fully 3-D propagation of solar transients through the termination shock and heliopause, and determine if the transient features observed by Voyagers 1 and 2 beyond the heliopause might correspond to particular solar transients observed at 1 AU.",

Interception and prevention of the vapor form of flow is critical for soil water conservation and drought alleviation in the arid and semiarid regions.\nResearches are conducted to quantify the amount of near-surface vapor flow in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China and the central California of USA. Quantitative leaf water absorption and desorption functions were derived and tested based on laboratory experiments. Results show that plant leaves absorb and release water at different speeds depending on species and varieties. The “ideal” native plants in the dry climates can quickly absorb water and slowly release it. This water-holding capacity of a plant is characterized by the plant’s water retention curves.\nField studies are conducted to measure the dynamic water movements from the soil surface to ten meters below the surface in an attempt to quantify the maximum depths of water extraction due to different vegetation types and mulching measures at the surface. Results show that condensation is usually formed on soil surface membranes during the daily hours when the temperature gradients are inverted toward the soil surface. The soil temperature becomes stable at 13 Degree Celsius below the 4-meter depth in the Loess Plateau of China thus vapor flow is not likely deriving from deeper layers. However, the liquid flow may move in and out depending on water potential gradients and hydraulic conductivity of the layers. The near-surface vapor flow can be effectively intercepted by various mulching measures including gravel-and-sand cover, plant residue and plastic membranes. New studies are attempted to quantify the role of vapor flow for the survival of giant sequoias in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains of California.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate is broadly understood for the Cenozoic era: warmer periods are associated with higher atmospheric carbon dioxide. This understanding is supported by atmospheric samples of the past 800,000 years from ice cores, which suggest CO2 levels play a key role in regulating global climate on glacial interglacial timescales as well. In this context, the late Miocene poses a challenge: sea-surface temperatures indicate substantial global warmth, though existing data suggest atmospheric CO2 concentrations were lower than pre-industrial values.\nRecent work using the stable carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of coccolith calcite has demonstrated these organisms began actively diverting inorganic carbon away from calcification and to the site of photosynthesis during the late Miocene. This process occurs in culture experiments in response to low aqueous CO2 concentrations, and suggests decreasing atmospheric pCO2 values during the late Miocene. Here we present new data from ODP Site 806 in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean that supports declining atmospheric CO2 across the late Miocene. Carbon isotope values of coccolith calcite from Site 806 demonstrate carbon limitation and re-allocation of inorganic carbon to photosynthesis starting between ~8 and 6 Ma. The timing of this limitation at Site 806 precedes shifts at other ODP sites, reflecting the higher mixed layer temperature and resultant lower CO2 solubility at Site 806. New measurements of carbon isotope values from alkenones at Site 806 show an increase in photosynthetic carbon fractionation (εp) accompanied the carbon limitation evident from coccolith calcite stable isotope data. While higher εp is typically interpreted as higher CO2 concentrations, at Site 806, our data suggest it reflects enhancement of chloroplast CO2 from active carbon transport by the coccolithophore algae in response to lower CO2 concentrations.\nOur new data from ODP Site 806 combined with previous published measurements suggests atmospheric CO2 values declined across the late Miocene and early Pliocene. This decline is coincident with decreasing ocean temperatures suggesting the fundamental relationship between atmospheric CO2 and climate can qualitatively explain late Miocene warmth.",

Assessing and minimizing these impacts requires novel methods compared to traditional supply chain lifecycle assessment. When properly validated and applied at appropriate spatial resolutions, biogeochemical process models are useful for simulating how the productivity and soil greenhouse gas fluxes of cultivating both conventional crops and advanced feedstock crops respond across gradients of land quality and management intensity. In this work we use the DayCent model to assess the biogeochemical impacts of agricultural residue collection, establishment of perennial grasses on marginal cropland or conservation easements, and intensification of existing cropping at high spatial resolution across several real-world case study landscapes in diverse US agricultural regions. We integrate the resulting estimates of productivity, soil carbon changes, and nitrous oxide emissions with crop production budgets and lifecycle inventories, and perform a basic optimization to generate landscape cost/GHG frontiers and determine the most practical opportunities for low-impact feedstock provisioning. The optimization is constrained to assess the minimum combined impacts of residue collection, land use change, and intensification of existing agriculture necessary for the landscape to supply a commercial-scale biorefinery while maintaining exiting food, feed, and fiber production levels. These techniques can be used to assess how different feedstock provisioning strategies perform on both economic and environmental criteria, and sensitivity of performance to environmental and land use factors.\nThe included figure shows an example feedstock cost-GHG mitigation tradeoff frontier for a commercial-scale cellulosic biofuel facility in Kansas.",

            "abstract": "Observations strongly suggest that convectively coupled Kelvin waves can be generated by extratropical wave activity. This mechanism is particularly efficient over Australia, where wave activity appears immediately after the extratropical Rossby waves propagate into the region during the Austral winter. This interaction occurs where the zonal wind is strongly sheared both in the meridional and vertical directions.\nIn order to understand this phenomenon the authors study the linear primitive equations in the presence of barotropic and baroclinic shear and the dispersion characteristics of the sheared Matsuno modes are calculated. Depending on the shear strength, the waves are stable or unstable and can be categorized into three groups. First there are the classical Matsuno modes modified by shear. Second there are extratropical \"free\" Rossby waves. Third, there are Rossby waves meridionally confined to the shear layer - these latter modes can be unstable, or stable and part of the continuous spectrum.\nIn examples where the zonal winds are barotropically and baroclinically stable, we show that a continuous spectrum of Rossby waves exists. If the zonal winds are strong enough, the Rossby waves in the continuous spectrum have an equatorial signature exactly like the Matsuno Kelvin wave - despite the fact that, in these examples, the Matsuno Kelvin wave also exists on its own and that all modes are stable.\nFor stronger shears, these continuous spectrum modes become unstable. Although the appear similar to Sakai's Rossby/Kelvin instability, their existence arises from a completely different phenomenon. The Sakai instability requires the frequency of a stable equatorial Rossby mode to coincide with the stable Kelvin wave frequency in order for the two modes to create a stable/unstable pair. Our results show that unstable Rossby waves need only have their frequencies Doppler shifted to that of the Kelvin wave frequency by the underlying shear in order that they acquire a Kelvin-like component - the Matsuno Kelvin wave remains stable for these values of shear.\nWe conclude that a Kelvin-like signature is a ubiquitous feature of equatorial waves in shear, irrespective of whether or not the shear is unstable.",

            "abstract": "A central goal in geomorphology is to untangle the competing controls of climate, tectonics, and rock strength on the topography and relief structure of mountain ranges. This is important for deciphering the history of climate and tectonics encoded in landscapes, predicting natural hazards, and quantifying critical zone processes. Incorporating rock strength into landscape evolution models has been a particularly challenging problem, because the factors that determine rock strength vary in importance depending on process. Here we propose a mechanism of hillslope-channel coupling by which tectonically-induced fracturing influences the relief structure of steep, rocky “threshold” landscapes by leading to A) increased fracture density in exposed bedrock outcrops, thereby limiting hillslope relief, and B) decreased grain size of channel bed material, thereby reducing the magnitude of fluvial incision thresholds and increasing the erosional efficiency of bedrock rivers. To test this hypothesis, we compare two contrasting landscapes in southern California—the eastern San Gabriel Mountains and the northern San Jacinto Mountains. The eastern San Gabriel Mountains rise 2 km in relief and exhibit high uplift and erosion rates due to active faulting along the Cucamonga thrust fault. Although bedrock on hillslopes is common, the exposed granitic and metamorphic basement rock is highly fractured at the decimeter or finer scale, and river channels are mantled with a thin layer of gravel-cobble alluvium. The northern San Jacinto Mountains, 80 km to the southeast, experience similar mean runoff and daily runoff variability, and are underlain by similar bedrock. Yet, despite an absence of active faulting, and erosion rates slower than the eastern San Gabriel Mountains by a factor of 5, the northern San Jacinto Mountains preserve one of the steepest escarpments in the contiguous US (2-3 km high), characterized by massive bedrock outcrops on hillslopes with meter-scale or larger fracture spacing, and a resulting channel network mantled with large boulders. Preliminary analyses suggest that fracture spacing and bed material grain size in threshold landscapes are tightly coupled, and influence the steepness of hillslopes and channels that control the relief structure of mountain ranges in a predictable manner.",

            "abstract": "Iron (Fe) and Aluminum (Al) oxides are common minerals in the soil system that can constitute 0.5 to 50% of soil mass. Fe and Al oxides occur in both crystalline and poorly crystalline forms, typically as <150nm in diameter nano-particles that have high specific surface area, high degree of hydration, and are very reactive with a variable charge. Fe and Al oxides have a tendency to form strong organic matter (OM)-mineral bonds through anion and inner-sphere ligand exchange reactions that enable them to be critical for persistence of OM in the soil system. Currently, we lack basic measurements and understanding of rates of lateral distribution of metal oxides with soil erosion; factors regulating transport of reactive soil minerals; and its implications for SOM dynamics. In this study, we determined concentration in soils and the rate of sediment and carbon erosional export from catchments within the Kings River Experimental Watersheds of California (Sierra National Forest in the southern part of the Sierra Nevada). In addition, we determined soil concentrations and rate of erosion of three classes of Fe and Al oxides (total pedogenic Fe, poorly crystalline Fe and Al oxides, and Fe and Al complexed with organic matter). Our results show that considerable variability exists in the concentration and transport rates of Fe and Al oxides in the study watersheds, but slope is strongly associated with rate of oxide transport across the three years (2009-2011) that we studied. We also found that the crystalline and poorly crystalline species of Fe and Al were transported at higher rates than the metal oxides that were complexed with iron oxides.",

Very-High Spatial Resolution (VHSR, 1 m or less) optical data could be used to estimate forest structure in remote and difficult to access forests of the world, but little information exists about the utility of multi-sensor cross-track stereo pairs for this purpose. We estimated Siberian boreal forest structure in Tura Krasnoyarsk, Russia from a tasked dense 2014 summer time-series of WorldView-1 and 2 in multi-angle combinations of Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) runs to generate point clouds from parallax that are used to produce digital surface models (DSMs). We evaluated single pair point cloud DSMs and accumulated point cloud DSMs with different viewing geometries from ASP to estimate root mean square errors (RMSEs). Our results suggest that a dense multi-angle time series from the WorldView constellation is a useful tool for estimating forest canopy height and dense multi-temporal observations can reduce height RMSEs if they have the appropriate viewing geometry.",

            "abstract": "A critical component in assessing the viability of proposed plate tectonic or geodynamic processes in regions of convergence is the expected or predicted age and rate of deformation in the overriding plate. Commonly, age of deformation is inferred through geochronology of foreland basin and wedge-top sedimentary rocks and bedrock thermochronometer cooling signals. In Bolivia the original pulse of deformation of the fold-thrust belt is argue to be as young as 38-25 Ma based on the age of synorogenic strata or as old as 65-45 Ma due to proposed foreland basin rocks deposited in the Bolivian Altiplano. The large discrepancies in proposed age, rate and magnitude of deformation through the Bolivian Andes limit our ability to relate age and rate of shortening to internal geodynamic or external plate tectonic processes.\nWe evaluate permissible ranges in age of initiation and rate of deformation through a forward kinematic model of the northern Bolivian fold-thrust belt. Each step of deformation accounts for isostatic loading from thrust faults and subsequent erosional of structural highs. The kinematic model predicts an evolution of flexural basins into which synorogenic sediments are deposited allowing us to fully integrate age of exhumation and deposition to age and magnitude of deformation. By assigning an age to each deformation step, we create a range of velocity vectors that are input into the thermokinematic model Pecube, which predicts thermochronometer cooling histories based on kinematics, topography, thermal parameters and shortening rates. We match the pattern of predicted ages with the across strike pattern of measured zircon fission track, apatite fission track and apatite (U-Th)/ He cooling ages. The sensitivity of modeled thermochronologic data to the age at which deformation initiates indicate that northern Bolivian EC started deforming at 50 Ma and may have begun as early as 55 Ma. The acceptable velocity envelope for the modeled section permits either a constant rate of shortening (~4-5 mm/yr) or varying shortening rates with faster rates (7-10 mm/yr) at 45-50 Ma and 11-8 Ma and significantly slower rates (2-4 mm/yr) from 35-15 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Fungal spores are a major component of primary biogenic aerosol particles that are emitted to the atmosphere, are ubiquitous, and play an important role in the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere, climate, and public health. Every year, during summer months, African dust (AD) particles are transported to the Caribbean region causing an increase in the concentrations of particulate matter in the atmosphere. AD is one of the most important natural sources of mineral particulate matter at the global scale, and many investigations suggest that it has the ability to transport dust-associated biological particles through long distances. The relationship between AD incursions and the concentration of fungal spores in the Caribbean region is poorly understood. In order to investigate the effects of AD incursions on fungal spore’s emissions, fungal spore concentrations were monitored using a Burkard spore trap at the tropical montane cloud forest of Pico del Este at El Yunque National Forest, Puerto Rico. The presence of AD was supported with satellite images of aerosol optical thickness, and with the results from the air masses backward trajectories calculated with the NOAA HYSPLIT model. Basidiospores and Ascospores comprised the major components of the total spore’s concentrations, up to a maximum of 98%, during both AD incursions and background days. A considerably decrease in the concentration of fungal spores during AD events was observed. Ergosterol, biomarker for measuring fungal biomass, concentrations were determined in aerosols that were sampled at a marine site, Cabezas de San Juan Nature Reserve, in Fajardo Puerto Rico, and at an urban site, Facundo Bueso building at the University of Puerto Rico. Additional efforts to understand the relationship between the arrival of AD to the Caribbean and a decrease in spore’s concentrations are needed in order to investigate changes in local spore’s vs the contribution of long-range spores transported within the AD.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution satellite imagery of marine shallow cumulus convection frequently shows rich mesoscale modulation of the cloud population and depth. A airborne field study in July-Aug. 2015, Cloud System Evolution in the Trades (CSET), extensively sampled this cloud regime through repeat sampling of the lowest 3 km of the atmosphere between California and Hawaii, including profiling, in-situ cloud and aerosol properties, turbulence, lidar and cloud radar. East of Hawaii, CSET flights all encountered 100-300 km wide patches of enhanced shallow cumulus convection penetrating up to a weak temperature inversion at altitudes 2-3 km, often accompanied by thin stratiform cloud layers, alternating with suppressed regions of similar size with only a few shallow cumulus clouds of a few hundred meter depth. What causes this modulation and do high-resolution models simulate it? Do internal feedbacks help reinforce it?\nThe hypothesis advanced is that the organization is maintained by mesoscale modulation of weak vertical motion. This might represent a downscale cascade from synoptically driven disturbances, but it is suggested that internal feedbacks due to enhanced precipitation and latent heating in the active patches are also important. A near-global aquaplanet model with 4 km horizontal resolution is shown to support similar mesoscale modulation of subtropical shallow cumulus convection; such behavior has also been seen in high-resolution weather forecast models and may affect the time-mean cloud and aerosol properties in marine shallow convection regimes.",

            "abstract": "The tidal channel network in southwest Bangladesh has been undergoing major adjustment in response to anthropogenic modification over the past few decades. Densely inhabited, agricultural islands that have been embanked to protect against inundation by tides, river flooding, and storm surges (i.e., polders) preclude tidal exchange and sedimentation. Studies reveal this results in elevation deficits relative to mean high water, endangering local communities when embankment failures occur (e.g., during storms, lateral channel erosion). In addition, many studies suggest that the decrease in tidal prism and associated change in hydrodynamics from poldering causes shoaling in remaining tidal channels, which can cause a disruption in transportation. The widespread closure and conversion of tidal channel areas to profitable shrimp aquaculture is also prevalent in this region. In this study, we quantify the direct closure of tidal channels due to poldering and shrimp aquaculture using historical Landsat and Google Earth imagery, and analyze the morphologic adjustment of the tidal channel network due to these perturbations.\nIn the natural Sundarbans mangrove forest, the tidal channel network has remained relatively constant since the 1970s. In contrast, construction of polders removed >1000 km of primary tidal creeks and >90 km2 has been reclaimed outside of polders through infilling and closure of formerly-active, higher order conduit channels now used for shrimp aquaculture. Field validation confirm tidal restriction by large sluice gates is prevalent, favoring local channel siltation at rates up to 20cm/yr. With the impoundment of primary creeks and closure of 30-60% of conduit channels in the study area, an estimated 1,400 x 106 m3 of water has been removed from the tidal prism and potentially redirected within remaining channels. This has significant implications for tidal amplification in this region. Further, we estimate that 12.3 x 106 MT of sediment annually infills remaining channels, which amounts to ~12% of the total annual sediment load supplied to the tidal deltaplain. This suggests that significant sediment is available in the system for elevation remediation of polders, however the hydrodynamic feasibility of reopening clogged channels and effective sediment dispersal is questionable",

            "abstract": "Confluences are a basic component in all fluvial systems, which are often characterized by complex flow and sediment transport patterns. Addressing confluences, however, started only recently in parallel with new advances of flow measurement tools and computational techniques. A limited number of field studies exist investigating flow hydrodynamics through confluences, particularly for large confluences with central zone widths of 100 m or greater. Previous studies have indicated that the size of the confluent rivers and the post-confluence zone may impact flow and sediment transport processes in the confluence zone, which consequently could impact the biodiversity within the river network.\nThis study presents the results of a field study conducted at the confluence of the Snake and the Clearwater rivers near the towns of Clarkston, WA and Lewiston, ID (average width of 700 m at the confluence center). This confluence supports many different and, sometimes, conflicting purposes including commercial navigation, recreation, and fish and wildlife conservation. The confluence properties are affected by dredging operations carried out periodically to maintain the minimum water depth required for safe flow conveyance and navigation purposes. Also, a levee system was constructed on the confluence banks as an extra flood control measure.\nIn the recent field work, an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler was used to measure water velocity profiles at cross sections in the confluence region. Fixed and moving vessel measurements were taken at selected locations to evaluate both the spatial and temporal variation in velocity throughout the confluence. The confluence bathymetry was surveyed with a multi-beam sonar to investigate existent bed morphological elements. The results identify the velocity pattern in the mixing zone between the two rivers. The present findings are compared to previous studies on small confluences to demonstrate the influence of scale on flow processes.",

This enables, for the first time, a statistical investigation of the thermospheric density response to SSW events. A superposed epoch analysis of 37 SSW events reveals a density reduction of 3-7% at 250-575 km around the time of polar vortex weakening.

The two main branches of this National Science Foundation-funded project are a series of courses called Science in the Studio (SitS) and the design of the Mobile Units for Science Exploration (MUSE) system, which allow instructors to bring science equipment directly into the studios. Ongoing since 2010, each fall semester a series of interdisciplinary SitS courses are offered in the college’s principal areas of study (architecture, design, fine arts, humanities and sciences, and diversity studies) thematically linked by Earth and environmental science topics such as water, waste, and sustainability. Each course receives funding to embed guest scientists from other colleges and universities, industry, or agriculture directly into the studio courses. These scientists worked in tandem with the studio faculty and gave lectures, led field trips, conducted studio visits, and advised the students' creative endeavors, culminating in an annual SitS exhibition of student work.\nThe MUSE system, of fillable carts and a storage and display unit, was designed by undergraduate students in a Furniture studio who explored, experimented, and researched various ways science materials and equipment are stored, collected, and displayed, for use in the current and future science and studio curricula at CCA. Sustainable practices and \"smart design\" underpinned all of the work completed in the studio. The materials selected for the new Science Collection at CCA include environmental monitoring equipment and test kits, a weather station, a stream table, a rock and fossil collection, and a vertebrate skull collection. The SitS courses and MUSE system provide two new, easily transferable models for scientific inquiry for other similarly sized colleges of art and design. Additionally, the MUSE provide a replicable model for bringing science instructional materials and equipment directly into classrooms at colleges that do not have stand-alone science departments or facilities.",

Nitrate is highly mobile in groundwater and if transported to denitrifying environments (i.e. anaerobic areas with the presence of bioavailable organic carbon (basis for heterotrophic denitrification) or pyrite (basis for autotrophic denitrification)) degraded to nitrogenous gas. These areas are often small, but account for a high percentage of nitrate removal. Consequential groundwater flow, a nitrate supplier to these hot spots, influence significantly the fate of nitrate.\nA hydro-geochemical modeling approach is used to demonstrate the relation between nitrate inputs and denitrifying services provided by catchment structure and flow dynamics. A developed three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model is capable to map groundwater flow and visualize preferential nitrate flow paths in a 35 km2 agricultural catchment, western France. Environmental proxies for microbial processes (natural isotopic abundance of nitrogen and oxygen) are used to identify denitrification processes in the aquifer. These information are combined with the flow paths obtained by the groundwater model in a post-processing step. An overall understanding of groundwater flow patterns and therefore nitrate input to denitrifying environments yield to better management decisions and predictions for nitrate attenuation.",

            "abstract": "Plant leaf wax carbon isotopic composition (δ13Cwax) reflects the net isotopic effects associated with diffusion into the leaf, fixation of carbon by Rubisco and biosynthesis of individual leaf wax biochemicals. As declining pCO2 with elevation affects the first two fractionations, we expect to find an isotopic gradient in δ13Cwax, if the fractionation of leaf wax biosynthesis is constant. To test this, we report δ13Cwax values from 500 samples of leaves collected by tree-climbers from the upper canopy from 9 forest-inventory plots spanning a 3.5km elevation transect in the Peruvian Andes and western Amazonia during the CHAMBASA field campaign. These samples provide a unique opportunity to study the relationship between δ13Cwax and pCO2 in diverse species across this remote tropical montane forest and lowland rainforest. The very wet climate throughout (2-5 m rainfall per year) minimizes fractionation effects due to stomatal restrictions (i.e. water use efficiency) that may be an important factor elsewhere. Preliminary results show δ13Cwax values on average increase with elevation by ~1.5‰/km, a trend consistent with bulk plant δ13C in previous studies. The mean epsilon between bulk and C29 n-alkane is -7.3±2.2‰. Inter-sample differences are large on the order of 10‰. Shaded leaves and understory leaves are found to be depleted relative to sunlit leaves, presumably due to a lower photosynthetic rate and use of respired CO2 in the understory. C29 n-alkanes are on average ~2.5‰ more depleted than C30 n-alkanoic acids, indicating fractionation during selective decarboxylation. We further compare results from plants with soil and river sediments to provide insights into how leaf wax signals are archived in soils and exported from the landscape. We find a ~1.4‰/km gradient in forest soils similar to plants. We observe a ~2‰ offset between C29 n-alkane in plant leaves and in soils across the elevation profile, which is likely a signal of degradation. Suspended sediments from the Kosñipata and Madre de Dios Rivers draining this region show δ13Cwax values aligned with soils from the mean elevation of the catchment, suggesting soils as the sources of waxes exported in rivers, with ages on average 400-2,000 years revealed by compound specific radiocarbon analysis.",

            "abstract": "In October 2015, we held a five-day workshop at the Keck Institute for Space Studies, bringing together experts on terrestrial ecology and the carbon cycle, remote sensing, in-situ networks, modeling, and systems engineering. The goals of the workshop were to:\n1) Identify grand challenges in terrestrial ecology and carbon cycle science and outline how new multi-instrument remote sensing products can enable revolutionary advancements towards unlocking those challenges\n2) Collaborate on using existing airborne, space-based, and ground-based measurements to highlight and quantify those potential advancements\n3) Explore how multi-instrument data products can reduce key parameter and structural uncertainties in terrestrial biosphere models\nThe more general themes of the workshop were framed around the potential, that in a few years time, we could see co-flight of suite of sensors aboard the International Space Station providing simultaneous observations of ecosystem structure, functioning, and composition. These include two instruments recently selected by the NASA Earth Venture Instrument program, GEDI, a LiDAR which will measure the 3D structure and biomass of forests, and ECOSTRESS, a thermal radiometer, which will estimate evapotranspiration and plant water stress. These also include two proposed instruments, OCO-3, capable of targeted mapping of solar-induced fluorescence and column CO2, and an imaging spectrometer, which would provide near-global maps of plant biodiversity and plant canopy biochemistry. The workshop sought to break down the ‘stovepiping’, that can arise from the traditionally contingency-adverse systems engineering approach to mission planning, by developing a broader strategy that would combine data products from multiple sensors to address carbon cycle grand challenge questions that no single sensor can address alone. We will present highlights from the workshop, as well as results from the discussion of observation needs, potential data products, and plans for future work.",

However, the vast land requirements of solar energy arrays may make installation impractical when available land is better suited for other purposes, like livestock grazing lands. The goal of this research was to investigate changes to the environmental physics, grass production, and grass species diversification under solar panels in an active pasture. To this end, different land characteristics were studied observationally including the length of the growing season, the greenness, the production per acre (especially in winter-limited environments), and the environmental physical processes (soil water movement and air movement). The observation setup involved two microclimatological stations that were installed in the Rabbit Hills solar array, OSU campus Oregon; one in and open area and the other in the solar array. The soil moisture was quantified using a complimentary system of electronic sensors and neutron probe readings. The data analysis was conducted to obtain the possible coupling between local atmospheric temperature, wind speed, humidity, and soil moisture. Soil moisture beneath the solar array was significantly higher. The solar array was found to reduce the local wind speed, and increase the local humidity. This resulted in a reduced evaporation resulting and a longer period of grass growth through the season.",

To investigate the relationship between ice surface roughness and variations in albedo in space and time at ~dm resolution, a suite of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) were deployed from the margin of Russell Glacier between June and August, 2014. The UAVs were equipped with digital and multispectral cameras, GoPros, fast response broadband pyranometers and temperature and humidity sensors. The primary mission was regular repeat longitudinal transects attaining data from the margin to the equilibrium line 80 km into the ice sheet interior and which were complimented by selected watershed and catchment surveys. The pyranometers reliably measure bare ice surface albedo between 0.34 and 0.58 that correlate well against concurrent MODIS data (where available). Repeat digital photogrammetric analysis enables investigation of relationship between changing meso- and micro-scale albedo and melt processes modulated by ice surface roughness that, in turn, are related to the seasonally evolving surface energy balance recorded at three AWS on the flight path.",

            "abstract": "Hubbard Glacier has been steadily advancing into tidewater > 200 years; advance over last 40 years has averaged ~34 m/yr, although at spatially variable rates across the terminus (14-80 m/yr) and with a seasonal advance and retreat cycle of ~100 m to 300 m, but as much as 600 m. The advance of the terminus is synchronous with the movement of the morainal bank that underlies it. The mechanics of this motion and the related sedimentological processes responsible for this coordinated advance of the grounding line are based largely on inferences from geophysical surveys of remnant morainal banks. In situ and repeated observations of the submarine margin are required to improve our understanding of how the terminus advances into deep fjords. We conducted initial submarine observations using a Bluefin 9M AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) and acquired high-resolution swath bathymetry and sidescan backscatter along a ~2 km long section of the ice face of the glacier. Onboard oceanographic measurements and surface CTD casts were obtained during AUV deployment. Decimeter-scale imagery of the seabed reveals numerous erosional and depositional bedforms and gravitational features next to the ice face and down the morainal bank’s proximal slope. The moraine surface adjacent to the ice face is coarse, apparently swept clear of finer materials, exhibits gravel stripes and boulder lags. The slope into the fjord displays a sequence of bedforms from barchan-shaped dunes up to 15 m on a side to barchanoid transverse ridges >50 m long to transverse ridges >100 m long. This transition implies increased sand supply to the bed downslope. Channels, erosional gullies and scours cross the upper slope, while localized slump and flow failures occur sporadically across the face. We speculate that high concentration bottom flows originating from turbulent subglacial discharge are likely processes creating the barchan forms and that the flow velocity reduces with distance from the grounding line. Which bedforms were active or remnant features could not be told by our limited duration survey and in this location/time, the deposits appear indicative of a line source rather than distinct subglacial point sources. Changes in water depth at the current terminus indicate shoaling rates of ~10 m/yr near the ice face to ~1m/yr at the edge of the basin.",

            "abstract": "Accurate and rapid detection and assessment of tsunamis in the open ocean is critical for predicting how they will impact distant coastlines, enabling appropriate mitigation efforts. The unexpectedly huge fault slip for the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake, and the unanticipated type of slip for the 2012 event at Queen Charlotte Islands, Canada highlighted weaknesses in our understanding of earthquake and tsunami hazards, and emphasized the need for more densely-spaced observing capabilities. Crucially, when each sensor is extremely expensive to build, deploy, and maintain, only a limited network of them can be installed. Gaps in the coverage of the network as well as routine outages of instruments, limit the ability of the detection system to accurately characterize events.\nShip-based geodetic GNSS has been demonstrated to be able to detect and measure the properties of tsunamis in the open ocean. Based on this approach, we have used commercial ships operating in the North Pacific to construct a pilot network of low-cost, tsunami sensors to augment the existing detection systems. Partnering with NOAA, Maersk and Matson Navigation, we have equipped 10 ships with high-accuracy GNSS systems running the Trimble RTX high-accuracy real-time positioning service. Satellite communications transmit the position data streams to our shore-side server for processing and analysis. We present preliminary analyses of this novel network, assessing the robustness of the system, the quality of the time-series and the effectiveness of various processing and filtering strategies for retrieving accurate estimates of sea surface height variations for triggering detection and characterization of tsunami in the open ocean.",

            "abstract": "Spacecraft observations such as WIND, and ACE show ample evidence of turbulent spectra of magnetic and velocity fluctuations, and kinetic dissipation in the solar wind plasma at ~1AU. Helios and MESSENGER confirm these properties close to the Sun at ~0.3AU, and future Solar Probe+ mission will provide information on turbulent spectra closer to the Sun in the outer corona. The transition between turbulence and dissipation occurs at scales that have clear dependence on heliocentric distance, as expected from solar wind expansion. We perform 2.5 hybrid modeling studies (where ions are described as particles, and electrons as background fluid) of the evolution of the turbulent spectra of fluctuations in electron-proton-He++ solar wind plasma at 1AU and closer to the Sun by varying the model plasma parameters. We investigate the dependence of the turbulence cascade and the transition to kinetic dissipation on the plasma parameters. We consider the effects of the solar wind expansion on the evolution of the turbulence and on the ion heating. We find important differences between the magnetic fluctuations spectrum, and the velocity fluctuations parallel and perpendicular to the field affected by ion-cyclotron, and mirror instabilities, as well as proton and alpha density fluctuations due to coupling to magnetosonic instability. We investigate the effects of the alpha-proton drift, and an injected spectrum on the turbulent magnetic fluctuations on the evolution of the solar wind plasma and the ion heating.",

            "abstract": "In 2010, science and technology studies expert Sheila Jasanoff concluded an article in Science by observing that the scientific community “…has demonstrated that it can learn and change in its methods of representing science to scientists. That ingenuity should now be directed toward building relationships of trust and respect with the global citizens whose future climate science has undertaken to predict and reshape.” This kind of statement indicates a large shift in the focus on climate-related work, in a sense concluding that the scientific conclusions are well-established, but there is a human-to-human, relationship-based element of the work that needs attention. At the same time, there is increasing emphasis on transitioning to more participatory models of research, practice, and engagement in climate work, the human relationships that underlie these approaches are rarely explicitly addressed. For example, conflict, a key relational process, is often an inevitable element of engagement in societal processes. Although conflict can lead toward more successful long-term solutions if addressed constructively, dealing with it can be highly uncomfortable on an individual level and is often avoided. Acknowledging the often pivotal role conflict plays in eventual solutions bolsters the notion of complementing current training with a focus on relationship building. Professional development to increase relational capacity is being adopted in fields such as law and medicine; these same approaches are also increasingly relevant for climate practitioners where strong emotions such as grief and anxiety are often present for both practitioners and those they interact with. A framework for teaching and learning to effectively interact in this rich, relational world will be presented.",

We will illustrate our argument using examples from an Antarctic festival with public lectures and science cafes, outreach associated with an Antarctic expedition, the global launch of a climate change documentary that had a significant focus on Antarctica, and a series of \"Polar Weeks\" led by an international community of scientists and educators.\nWhile there is an excellent culture of accountability in both formal and informal science communication sectors, the same rigour is not applied to the majority of ‘outreach’ activities that are initiated by the science research community. Many of these activities are undertaken based on 'what feels right' and opportunism, and are proclaimed to be a success based on little or no formal evaluation. As a result, much of this work goes undocumented, is not evaluated from the perspective of the science community, and is rarely subject to peer-review and its associated benefits, including professional rewards. We therefore recommend new opportunities for publication in this field that would encourage science communication theory and practice to better inform each other, and for scientists to gain professional recognition for their efforts in this arena.",

            "abstract": "During the summer of 2013, measurements of NO2, SO2 and HONO were made at a ground site in a rural forested region of Alberta known to be impacted by several oil sands processing facilities. Such sources are known to be the main sources of NOx and SOx emissions in the region. Nitrous acid (HONO) can be emitted directly from combustion sources in addition to being formed from the heterogeneous hydrolysis of NO2 on moist surfaces. The measurements were made both day and night by Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) along a 2.304 km optical return path through the forest canopy using a 30-corner cube reflector. Nitrous acid (HONO) is of particular relevance to atmospheric chemistry as it can contribute to photochemical production of the OH radical, the main daytime oxidant in the troposphere, which was estimated to exceed 2∙107 molec cm-3 on several days during the study, giving rise to rapid aerosol formation. Typically in urban areas HONO mixing ratios accumulate during the night, and are lost the next morning due to photolysis (HONO + hv→ OH + NO2). During this study however, HONO mixing ratios were found to be quite low with a median nightime mixing ratio of ~ 200 ppt. This is attributed to the very low nighttime NO2 precursor levels, perhaps in combination with a high surface area for deposition on the coniferous canopy. The low nighttime mixing ratios of NO2 and SO2 were driven by limited nocturnal mixing of elevated plumes down to the surface, while high daytime levels of NO2 and SO2 were episodic and frequently driven by daytime fumigation of the elevated plumes to the surface with additional contribution from surface sources of NOx. Daytime mixing ratios of HONO persisted longer than expected with median noontime mixing ratios of >50ppt. While this can imply an additional daytime source of HONO as has been observed by many others, it may also result from reduced photolysis rates below the canopy. This issue is being pursued more quantitatively at the current time.",

In the former, unconventional reservoir rock and hydraulic fracturing fluid possessing a range of ionic strengths (I = 0.01, 0.15) and initial pH values (2.5 and 7.3) reacted at 115°C and 35 MPa for 28 days. In the latter, a model carbon storage reservoir (Fe-rich dolomite), shale caprock (illite), and shale-reservoir mixture each reacted with formation water (I = 0.1 and pH 6.3) at 160°C and 25 MPa for ~15 days. These three experiments were subsequently injected with sufficient CO2 to maintain CO2 saturation in the water and allowed to react for ~40 additional days.\nAcidic frac fluid was rapidly buffered (from pH 2.5 to 6.2 after 38 hrs) by reaction with reservoir rock whereas the pH of near-neutral frac fluid decreased (from 7.3 to 6.9) after 47 hrs. Carbonate dissolution released Ca and Sr into solution and feldspar dissolution released SiO2 and Li; the extent of reaction was greater in the experiment containing acidic frac fluid. All three carbon storage experiments displayed a similar pH decrease of 1.5 units after the addition of CO2. The pH remained low for the duration of the experiments because the immiscible supercritical CO2 phase provided an infinite reservoir of carbonic acid that could not be consumed by reaction with the rock. In all three experiments, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn and SO4 increase with injection, but slowly decline through termination of the experiments. This trend suggests initial dissolution followed by re-precipitation of carbonates, which can be seen in modeling and SEM results. New clay minerals form in experiments emulating both unconventional and carbon reservoirs. Smectite precipitates in the latter, the identity of clays in the former is still being determined. Both systems are initially dominated by acid reactions; subsequent differences in geochemical behavior derive from the amount and source of acidity and buffering reactions of the rock.",

            "abstract": "Surface exposure dating with cosmogenic nuclides is a dating method under continuous development. It is particularly useful for dating ice-sheet fluctuations in glacial environments, which is essential to increase our understanding of past climate fluctuations and glacial dynamics. Constraining the landscape history in previously glaciated terrains may be difficult, however, due to unknown erosion rates and the presence of inherited nuclides. The potential use of cosmogenic nuclides in landscapes with a complex history of exposure and erosion is therefore often quite limited. In this study, we investigate the landscape history in eastern and western Greenland by applying a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion approach to the existing 10Be-26Al data from these regions.\nThe new MCMC approach allows us to constrain the most likely landscape history based on comparisons between simulated and measured cosmogenic nuclide concentrations. It is a fundamental assumption of the model approach that the exposure history at the site/location can be divided into two distinct regimes: i) interglacial periods characterized by zero shielding due to overlying ice and a uniform interglacial erosion rate, and ii) glacial periods characterized by 100 % shielding and a uniform glacial erosion rate. We incorporate the exposure/burial history in the model framework by applying a threshold value to the global marine benthic d18O record and include the threshold value as a free model parameter, hereby taking into account global changes in climate. The other free parameters include the glacial and interglacial erosion rates as well as the timing of the Holocene deglaciation. The model essentially simulates numerous different landscape scenarios based on these four parameters and zooms in on the most plausible combination of model parameters.\nHere, we apply the MCMC-model to the concentrations of 10Be and 26Al measured in three previous studies of glacial fluctuations in Greenland (Upernavik, Sisimiut, and Jameson Land) and delineate the most likely exposure/burial history in these areas over the last 106 years. The results allow for comparison of glacial and interglacial erosion rates and exposure/burial history in similar landscape settings across different regions of Greenland.",

            "abstract": "The products of spatial analyses that leverage the interpolation of sparse, point data to represent continuous phenomena are often presented without clear explanations of the uncertainty associated with the interpolated values. As a result, there is frequently insufficient information provided to effectively support advanced computational analyses and individual research and policy decisions utilizing these results. This highlights the need for a reliable approach capable of quantitatively producing and communicating spatial data analyses and their inherent uncertainties for a broad range of uses. To address this need, we have developed the Variable Grid Method (VGM), and associated Python tool, which is a flexible approach that can be applied to a variety of analyses and use case scenarios where users need a method to effectively study, evaluate, and analyze spatial trends and patterns while communicating the uncertainty in the underlying spatial datasets. The VGM outputs a simultaneous visualization representative of the spatial data analyses and quantification of underlying uncertainties, which can be calculated using data related to sample density, sample variance, interpolation error, uncertainty calculated from multiple simulations, etc. We will present examples of our research utilizing the VGM to quantify key spatial trends and patterns for subsurface data interpolations and their uncertainties and leverage these results to evaluate storage estimates and potential impacts associated with underground injection for CO2 storage and unconventional resource production and development. The insights provided by these examples identify how the VGM can provide critical information about the relationship between uncertainty and spatial data that is necessary to better support their use in advance computation analyses and informing research, management and policy decisions.",

            "abstract": "The Fruitvale Oil Field lies in a populated area where oil production, water disposal injection wells, and drinking water wells lie in close proximity. The purpose of this project is to build a lithological framework of the area that can then be used to determine if water disposal from petroleum production has a chance of reaching usable groundwater aquifers.\nUsing the DOGGR database, data were collected from well logs. Lithologic data from drilling logs and cores were coded and entered into a relational database, where it was combined with the surface elevation and location coordinates of each well. Elevation data was acquired through ArcGIS using a USGS 24k 10 m DEM. Drillers logs that started at the surface, and were continuous, were sorted by the density of intervals recorded, in order to select high quality drillers logs for use in creating a model. About 900 wells were coded and approximately 150 wells were used in the model. These wells were entered into the modeling program (Rockworks), which allowed the wells to be visualized as strip logs and also as cross sections, and 2D fence models were created to represent subsurface conditions. The data were interpolated into 3D models of the subsurface. Water disposal wells, with the depths of the perforation intervals as well as injection volume, were added to the model, and analyzed.\nTechniques of interpolation used in this project included kriging, which requires statistical analysis of the data collected. This allowed correlation between widely-spaced wells. Up scaling the data to a coarse or fine texture was also been found to be effective with the kriging technique. The methods developed on this field can be used to build framework models of other fields in the Central Valley to explore the relationship between water disposal injection and usable groundwater.",

Over its 15-year existence, the CCMC has changed how state-of-the-art space weather models are utilized in research, and has also facilitated the transition of many research models into operational environments. The CCMC currently hosts a large and expanding collection of physics-based space weather models that have been developed by the international research community, and has amassed a peta-byte of model simulation output that represents advances in space weather modeling and space science research for the past 15 years.\nThe ability of the CCMC to engage the international research community and support community challenges, campaigns, studies, and general research is vital to its success - so a flexible cyberinfrastructure that facilitates data discovery and interoperability with external systems is a necessity. There are many challenges associated with supporting a large number of disparate, physics-based models and the computational infrastructure to support them.

            "abstract": "Magnetospheric waves have the potential to convert to Kinetic Alfven Waves (KAW) at scales close to the ion larmor radius and the electron inertial length. At this length scale, it is observed that KAW generated at reconnection propagates super-Alfvenically and the wave is responsible for the parallel propagation of the Hall magnetic field near the separatrice from the magnetotial region. The pointing flux associated with this Hall magnetic field is also consistent with observed Cluster data observations [1]. An important question is whether this KAW energy will be able to propagate all the way to the Earth, creating aurora associated with a substorm. If this KAW propagation can be well understood, then this will provide valuable insight as to the relative timing of substorm onset versus reconnection onset in the magnetotail. The difficulty currently is that the nonlinear damping of KAW is not well understood even in a homogenous system, let alone more realistic magnetotail geometries including changes to density, magnetic field strength, and magnetic orientation. We study the propagation, dispersion, and damping of these KAWs using P3D, a kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation code. Travelling waves are initialized based on a fluid model and allowed to propagate for substantial time periods. Damping of the waves are compared with Landau damping predictions. The waves are simulated in both homogenous and varying equilibrium meant to determine the effect on propagation. Implications for energetic electron production and Poynting flux input into the ionosphere are discussed.\n[1] Shay, M. A., J. F. Drake, J. P. Eastwood, and T. D.

            "abstract": "Wildfires are increasing in size and severity across the western United States with impacts on regional biogeochemical cycling. The resiliency of resident soil microbial communities determines rates of nutrient transformations as well as forest structure and recovery. Redox conditions in soil determine metabolic activities of microorganisms, which first consume oxygen and a succession of alternative terminal electron acceptors to support growth and metabolism using a variety of carbon sources. Controls on redox zonation are largely unknown in dominantly oxic soils, and microbial community adaptation and response to fluctuations in redox potential in a sub-alpine forested post-disturbance catchment has not been studied. Previous work has shown that fluctuating or rising water tables result in redox-dynamic sites, which can be ‘hot spots’ of biogeochemical activity depending on landscape position. Fire-induced tree mortality results in altered hydrologic flow paths and decreased evapotranspiration, leading to potential for intensified hot spot activity. We are testing such coupling of microbial activity with fluctuations in redox status using field measurements and laboratory incubation experiments. The 2013 Thompson Ridge Fire in the Jemez River Basin (NM) Critical Zone Observatory provides a highly-contextualized opportunity to examine how disturbance regime affects changes in soil microbial community dynamics and fluctuations in reduction-oxidation potential (as quantified by continuous CZO measurements of O2, CO2 and Eh as a function of soil depth and landscape location). We hypothesize that areas of depositional convergence in the catchment, which have been shown to exhibit more reducing conditions, will host microbial communities that are better adapted to fluctuating redox conditions and exhibit a greater diversity in functional capabilities. In these mixed conifer forests we find shifts in redox potential status in relation to depth and topography where more reducing conditions typically occur in convergent zones and at depth. These results highlight the significance of fluctuating oxygen-depleted zones in aerobic soils on microbial community activity and structure, linking community response to larger scale ecosystem processes.",

            "abstract": "We have established a network of nine field locations where continuous, canopy-level optical sampling occurs in tandem with ecosystem-atmosphere flux observations. These field sampling efforts are part of the broader SpecNet network, and address several of SpecNet’s core objectives. One of these objectives is to define best practices for sensor installation, data management, and data analysis in the context of paired optical-flux observations. Participants at each of the nine field locations have installed sensors and are collecting data in a way that will facilitate cross-site comparisons. Work is currently under way to develop data management and data analysis protocols. Another objective is to use the paired optical-flux observations to better understand how optical data are related to vegetation properties, especially those related to ecosystem metabolism. Although many studies have investigated linkages between vegetation properties and optical signals in the past, most have done so at individual sites, making it difficult to broadly apply their findings. During initial site selection for the current study, a core requirement was that the final collection of participating sites needed to represent a variety of global ecosystems. The final group of sites includes agricultural croplands, deciduous and evergreen forests, and woodlands, all with unique phenology and controls on ecosystem metabolism. We propose that cross-site synthesis of paired optical-flux data will lead to a deeper understanding of how optical data are related to vegetation properties. Here we present an overview of progress toward defining best practices and preliminary data and insights gathered since the establishment of this network over the past year.",

Over the last few years, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations from satellite and aircraft platforms have been used to produce maps of subsidence with ~cm accuracy. For this study, we have obtained and analyzed Japanese PALSAR data for 2006 – 2011, Canadian Radarsat-1 data for 2011 – 2013, Radarsat-2 data for 2012 - 2015, and ESA’s Sentinel-1A for 2015 and produced maps of subsidence for those periods. High resolution InSAR data were also acquired along the California Aqueduct by the NASA UAVSAR from 2013 – 2015. Using multiple scenes acquired by these systems, we were able to produce the time histories of subsidence at selected locations and transects showing how subsidence varies both spatially and temporally. The maps show that subsidence is continuing in areas with a history of subsidence and that the rates and areas affected have increased due to increased groundwater extraction during the extended western US drought. The high resolution maps from UAVSAR were used to identify and quantify new, highly localized areas of accelerated subsidence along the California Aqueduct that occurred in 2014.\nThe California Department of Water Resources (DWR) funded this work to provide the background and an update on subsidence in the Central Valley to support future policy. Geographic Information System (GIS) files are being furnished to DWR for further analysis of the 4 dimensional subsidence time-series maps.\nPart of this work was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with NASA.",

            "abstract": "Yamaguchi and Feingold (2012) note that the cloud fields in their Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) large-eddy simulations (LESs) of marine stratocumulus exhibit a strong sensitivity to time stepping choices. In this study, we reproduce and analyze this sensitivity issue using two stratocumulus cases, one marine and one continental. Our results show that (1) the sensitivity is associated with spurious motions near the moisture jump between the boundary layer and the free atmosphere, and (2) these spurious motions appear to arise from neglecting small variations in water vapor mixing ratio (qv) in the pressure gradient calculation in the acoustic sub­-stepping portion of the integration procedure. We show that this issue is remedied in the WRF dynamical core by replacing the prognostic equation for the potential temperature θ with one for the moist potential temperature θm=θ(1+1.61qv), which allows consistent treatment of moisture in the calculation of pressure during the acoustic sub­steps. With this modification, the spurious motions and the sensitivity to the time stepping settings (i.e., the dynamic time step length and number of acoustic sub­steps) are eliminated in both of the example stratocumulus cases.",

            "abstract": "Large-volumes of basalt-hosted fluids from the sediment-covered subseafloor were collected in July 2011 from a horizon extending 29-117 meters below the sediment-rock interface at borehole 1362B, as well as from a deep horizon extending 193-292 meters below the sediment-rock interface at borehole 1362A, which are two of the latest generation of borehole observatories on the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Environmental DNA was sequenced from one fluid sample collected from each borehole, and a genomic bin related to the terrestrial Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator lineage within the Firmicutes phylum of bacteria was identified. The near-complete bacterial genome, herein named Candidatus Desulfopertinax inferamarinus, is composed of six scaffolds totaling 1.78 Mbp in length. Despite vast differences in geography and environment of origin, phylogenomic analysis indicate that D. inferamarinus and D. audaxviator form a monophyletic clade to the exclusion of all other sequenced genomes. Similar to its terrestrial relative, the draft genome of the marine D. inferamarinus revealed a motile, sporulating, sulfate-reducing, chemoautotrophic thermophile that is capable of synthesizing all amino acids and fixing inorganic carbon via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Unlike the terrestrial clade, relatively few integrases and transposases were identified. The marine genome described here provides evidence that a life-style adapted to the isolated deep subsurface environment is a general feature of the broader, globally-distributed Desulforudis/Desulfopertinax lineage and provides insight into the adaptations required for microbial life in the marine versus terrestrial deep biospheres.",

            "abstract": "The NARCCAP ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) simulations over North America is aimed at providing a range of regional-scale climate change projections for use in impacts analyses. Previous studies have shown that the performance of the NARCCAP RCMs and their projections – of seasonal precipitation for instance – could be very different and at times much larger than those obtained from their driving GCMs. We explore the idea of using seamless assessment approach to diagnose model errors at various spatial and temporal scales and identify models that provide plausible realizations of historical climates. This is achieved by carrying out regional assessment of model performance over North America by combining information from the NARCCAP RCMs, their drivers (NCEP2, CMIP3 GCMs), and the Transpose-AMIP (TAMIP, NWP-style) experiments. An assessment of the performance of the CMIP3-GCMs used in dynamical downscaling indicates that although the RCMs add value to the GCM results, a large fraction of the RCM errors are inherited from the driving GCM. A seasonal dry bias over central and southern US and a wet bias over the Rockies are some of the errors that are not only seen in the NARCCAP RCMs and the driving GCMs, but are also common to many current generation of climate models (CMIP5). We demonstrate that some of these errors in climate simulations such as an underestimation of precipitation in the southern US develop within the first five days of the integration when the climate model is run in weather forecast mode, i.e., the TAMIP experiments. The design of the TAMIP experiments facilitates linking these systematic errors to model physics. We explore if such an assessment across spatial and temporal scales can be used to gain process-level understanding of model errors and if it has the potential to help constrain future projections by identifying models with credible simulations of historical climates.",

            "abstract": "Changes in the high latitude climate system have the potential to affect global climate through feedbacks with the atmosphere and connections with mid latitudes. Sea ice and climate models used to understand these changes have uncertainties that need to be characterized and quantified. In this work we characterize parametric uncertainty in Los Alamos Sea Ice model (CICE) and quantify the sensitivity of sea ice area, extent and volume with respect to uncertainty in about 40 individual model parameters. Unlike common sensitivity analyses conducted in previous studies where parameters are varied one-at-a-time, this study uses a global variance-based approach in which Sobol sequences are used to efficiently sample the full 40-dimensional parameter space. This approach requires a very large number of model evaluations, which are expensive to run. A more computationally efficient approach is implemented by training and cross-validating a surrogate (emulator) of the sea ice model with model output from 400 model runs. The emulator is used to make predictions of sea ice extent, area, and volume at several model configurations, which are then used to compute the Sobol sensitivity indices of the 40 parameters. A ranking based on the sensitivity indices indicates that model output is most sensitive to snow parameters such as conductivity and grain size, and the drainage of melt ponds. The main effects and interactions among the most influential parameters are also estimated by a non-parametric regression technique based on generalized additive models. It is recommended research to be prioritized towards more accurately determining these most influential parameters values by observational studies or by improving existing parameterizations in the sea ice model.",

            "abstract": "Despite advances in understanding the structural development of hyperextended magma-poor rift margins, the temporal and thermal evolution of lithospheric hyperextension during rifting remains only poorly understood. In contrast to classic pure-shear models, multi-stage rift models that include depth-dependent thinning predict significant lower-crustal reheating during the necking phase due to buoyant rise of the asthenosphere. The Santa Lucia nappe of NE Corsica is an ideal laboratory to test for lower-crustal reheating as it preserves Permian lower crust exhumed from granulitic conditions during Mesozoic Tethyan rifting. This study presents the first use of apatite U-Pb depth-profile thermochronology in conjunction with novel rutile U-Pb and zircon U-Pb thermo- and geochronology to reconstruct a continuous t-T path to constrain the syn-rift thermal evolution of this exposed lower-crustal section. LASS-ICP-MS depth-profile analyses of zircon reveal thin (<10 μm) ~210-180 Ma overgrowths on 300-270 Ma cores in lower-crustal lithologies, indicative of renewed thermal activity during Mesozoic rifting. Cooling due to rapid rift margin exhumation is recorded by the topology of rutile and apatite depth profiles caused by thermally-activated volume diffusion at T >400°C. Lower-crustal rutile reveal a rounded progression from core plateaus at ~170 Ma to 150-145 Ma at the outer 8-10 μm of grains while middle-crustal apatite records 170 Ma cores grading to 140-135 Ma rims. Inverse modeling of rutile profiles suggests the lower crust cooled from 700°C at 200 Ma to 425°C at 140 Ma. Middle-crustal apatite yield a two-stage history, with rapid cooling from 500°C at 200 Ma to 420°C at ~180 Ma followed by slow cooling to 400°C by 160 Ma. Combined with zircon overgrowth ages, these data indicate the Santa Lucia nappe underwent a thermal pulse in the late Triassic-early Jurassic associated with depth-dependent thinning and hyperextension of the Corsican margin.",

            "abstract": "Meteorological conditions directly impact aerosol loading, especially dust emissions. Variations in dust emissions on the other hand, will also impact meteorology and climate through direct and indirect aerosol forcing. To study these impacts in more detail we use the global Flow-following finite-volume Icosahedra Model (FIM, http://fim.noaa.gov/), a new global weather prediction model currently under development in the Global Systems Division of NOAA/ESRL, as it is coupled online with the aerosol modules from the Goddard Gobal Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model (FIM-Chem). FIM-Chem includes direct and semi direct feedback, and uses the dust schemes of GOCART and the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). FIM-Chem is able to investigate the contribution of climate feedbacks to simulated hyperspectral data by considering a range of simulations with different dust emissions and different levels of aerosol feedbacks enabled at four different spatial resolutions. The emitted dust flux and total emissions are highly depending on the surface wind and model resolution. We compare the dust emissions by including and excluding the aerosol radiative feedback in the simulations to quantify the sensitivity of dust emissions to aerosol feedback. Also, the simulations based on different resolutions of 240x240 km, 120x120 km, 60x60 km and 30x20 km are performed to test the impacts of model resolution on total dust emissions. By comparing the dust emission sensitivity to aerosol feedback and model resolution, we can estimate the uncertainty of model resolution versus aerosol feedback. We also conduct FIM-Chem simulations to investigate the climate forcing due to different dust schemes for different model resolutions. Comparing the simulated spectra using FIM-Chem and GEOS-Chem shows how much the dust feedback and dynamical diversity modulate the spectra with consistent emissions across the models.",

            "abstract": "Reservoir souring is caused by the activity of sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM) in subsurface oil reservoirs, and is often induced by seawater injection during secondary oil recovery. Souring can potentially contribute to corrosion of infrastructure, health and safety hazards to the workforce, and reduction in value by increasing refining costs associated with producing the oil resource. Souring causes annual losses in the billions of dollars to the oil industry. Endospore-forming SRM, such as Desulfotomaculum spp., are often suspected culprits in reservoir souring. Endospores can survive unfavourable conditions for long periods, yet remain poised to germinate and become active if conditions become more favourable. Factors governing endospore germination are poorly understood, but are thought to include availability of nutrients, possibly metabolic by products of other anaerobic bioprocesses, and/or variations in temperature. Most research has focused on aerobic Bacillus spp., with very few studies dedicated to spore germination among anaerobes (order Clostridiales) including the sulfate-reducing Desulfotomaculum found in anoxic subsurface petroleum reservoirs. For Desulfotomaculum spores in deep hot oil reservoirs, cold seawater introduction during secondary oil recovery may create thermal viability zones for sulfate reduction near the injection wellbore. To evaluate these processes, sulfate-containing microcosms were prepared with different marine sediments as a source of spores, and amended with organic substrates in the presence or absence of oil. Incubation at 80°C for six days was followed by a down-shift in temperature to 60°C to mimic cold seawater injection into a hot reservoir. Souring did not occur at 80°C, but commenced within hours at 60°C. Microcosms were monitored for sulfate reduction and organic acids in combination with next generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes (Ion Torrent, Illumina MiSeq). Through a combination of high-throughput microbial DNA sequencing and geochemical process analyses we show that altered conditions in oil reservoirs during seawater flooding activates dormant Desulfotomaculum endospores, which leads to reservoir souring, and provide insights on the factors governing the germination of endospores in the deep hot biosphere.",

While these isotopes have been used successfully in investigations of water residence times, mixing, and groundwater discharge in oceanic, coastal and estuarine environments, the well-established techniques for measuring Ra and Rn isotopes were developed for seawater and dilute groundwaters which have near neutral pH, moderate temperatures, and a limited range of chemical composition. Unfortunately, these techniques, as originally developed are not suitable for the extreme range of compositions found in YS waters, which have pH ranging from <1 – 10, Eh -.208 to .700 V, water temperatures from ambient to 93 degree C, and high dissolved CO2 concentrations.\nHere we report on our refinements of these Ra and Rn methods for the extreme conditions found in YS. Our methodologies are now enabling us to quantitatively isolate Ra from fluids that cover a large range of chemical compositions and conduct in-situ Rn isotope measurements that accommodate variable temperatures and high CO2 (Lane-Smith and Sims, 2013, Acta Geophys. 61).\nThese Ra and Rn measurements are now allowing us to apply simple models to quantify hot spring water residence times and aquifer to surface travel times. (224Ra/223Ra) calculations provide estimates of water-rock reaction zone to discharge zone of 4 to 14 days for Yellowstone hot springs and (224Ra/228Ra) shallow aquifer to surface travel times from 2 to 7 days. Further development of more sophisticated models that take into account water-rock-gas reactions and water mixing (shallow groundwater, surface run-off, etc.) will allow us to estimate the timescales of these processes more accurately and thus provide a heretofore-unknown time component to the YS hydrothermal system.",

            "abstract": "Observations of shear wave splitting derived from local sources in subduction zones suggest viscous flow in the mantle wedge is commonly non-parallel to both the subducting plate velocity vector and the motion of the overriding plate. However, far from the subduction zone trench, observations indicate the fast axis of shear wave splitting tends to align with the velocity vector of the surface plates. Similarly, previous 3D geodynamic models show the slab can drive local decoupling of the mantle and surface plates, in both direction and speed. This suggests that there is some distance from the trench over which there is significant decoupling of the mantle flow from surface plate motion, and that this decoupling zone then decays with continued distance from the trench, resulting in far-field plate-mantle coupling. Here we present results from geodynamic models of subduction coupled with calculations of olivine fabric deformation and synthetic splitting to 1) examine the influence of slab strength, slab dip, and non-Newtonian viscosity on the deformation fabric in the mantle wedge and subslab mantle and 2) quantify the spatial extent and intensity of this slab driven decoupling zone. We compare the deformation fabric in a 2D corner flow solution with varying dip to that of a 2D free subduction model with varying initial dip and slab strength. The results show that using an experimentally derived flow law to define viscosity (both diffusion creep and dislocation creep deformation mechanisms) has a first order effect on the viscosity structure and flow velocity in the upper mantle. The free subduction models using the composite viscosity formulation produce a zone of subduction induced mantle weakening that results in reduced viscous support of the slab and lateral variability in coupling of the mantle to the base of the surface plates. The maximum yield stress, which places an upper bound on the slab strength, can also have a significant impact on the viscosity structure and flow rates induced in the upper mantle, with maximum mantle weakening and mantle flow rates occurring in models with a lower maximum yield stress and shallower slab dip. The results suggest that even in a 2D model, the inclusion of the composite viscosity can result in rapid flow in the mantle wedge and significant decoupling of the mantle from the surface plates.",

            "abstract": "Fine structure of the 660 discontinuity is essential to understanding the Earth evolution and its dynamics. Both receiver function images and triplication waveforms have provided some evidence for a double 660 discontinuity. However, due to lack of resolution of these methods, definitive finding of the double feature is still under question. In this study, we use seismic data from over 1000 broadband stations, archived by the Data Management Center of State Earthquake Information Services in China, to probe the transition zone structures in details. The permanent array is denser than USArray and records regional earthquakes at triplication distances from western Pacific, which provide excellent ray path coverage of the upper-mantle structures beneath eastern China. In this study, we analyze waveforms from three deep earthquakes in the transition zone beneath the Bonin Island, northeastern China, and Russia. These earthquakes mainly sample the transition-zone structures, which are related to the subducted Pacific Plate beneath eastern China. The CD branch of the S-wave triplication from the Bonin earthquake has relative longer period, while the AB branch shows two distinct arrivals with enhanced high-frequency energy. This double-AB feature appears to be associated with a double 660 discontinuity and disappear at stations in the south and north, which suggest that the subducted Pacific slab may be present in the transition zone beneath the Yellow Sea effecting this phase transition. Preliminary modeling of the waveforms indicates a ~2% velocity increase at 660 km and another ~6% increase at about 680 km. The double 660 feature may be indicative of Al content of more than 4%.",

Such helical turbulence exhibits interesting features: Turbulence works not only to enhance the effective transport leading to a decrease of coherent large-scale structure, but also to suppress the effective transport leading to the sustainment and generation of large-scale localized flows. Yokoi and Yoshizawa (1993) showed that the inhomogeneous turbulent helicity coupled with the large-scale vortical motion and/or rotation induces a large-scale flow. This suggests a possibility of a new way of the vortex dynamo even in incompressible turbulence without resorting to any baroclinicity effect. It is distinguished from the previously studied anisotropic kinetic alpha (AKA) effect. Following their suggestions, we examine the flow generation due to inhomogeneous helicity with the aid of a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of rotating helical turbulence. It is shown that a large-scale flow is induced by the inhomogeneous turbulent helicity effect whereas no flow is generated in the zero and/or homogeneous turbulent helicity cases. Physical origin of this helicity effect is discussed by considering the Reynolds stress and turbulent vortexmotive (pondermotive) force.\nYokoi, N. and Yoshizawa, A. Phys.

A characterization of aerosol sources, production, and lifecycle processes in the Polar Regions is required to better understand the polar atmosphere. In an attempt to better characterize Antarctic aerosol and trace gas interactions, the Two-Season, Ozone Depletion and Interaction with Aerosols Campaign (2ODIAC) was launched over the Austral Spring/Summer of 2014 and Austral Winter of 2015. One highlight of the campaign is the first ever deployment of a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer to Antarctica. In conjunction with trace gas, meteorology, and aerosol sizing measurements, this presentation will focus on case studies from the campaign relevant to the atmospheric science community. Questions about the role of iodine, MSA, and ozone depletion events in regards to aerosol composition will be examined. Specific attention will be paid to aerosol compositional changes before, during, and after particle bursts especially where changes in aerosol sulfate oxidation occurred (SO2 -> SO4)",

AIMD calculations for tetragonal distortions of Fe along the isochoric Bain path for densities of 18 and 20 g/cc at temperatures of 6000 and 7000 K indicate stresses becoming anisotropic for tetragonal distortions on either side of the lattice-parameter ratio c/a = 1, resulting in anisotropy in longitudinal stress, SL: SL > 0 for c/a < 1 and SL < 0 for c/a > 1, with SL ~ 0 within uncertainties for c/a = 1. The shear modulus BS becomes negative, violating the Born stability criterion. Variation of the longitudinal stress SL with free energy for the static lattice shows the same mechanical instability seen in the AIMD calculations, revealing the role of mechanical instability in causing the anomalies in SL. Also, based on free-energy calculations with temperature-dependent phonon and electron contributions, the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase of Fe is found to be the most stable for pressure-temperature conditions extending beyond those of Earth’s inner core to the 1.5 TPa range.",

            "abstract": "Uranium (U) isotope variation in marine sediments has been proposed as a proxy for changes in average global-ocean redox conditions. Here, we investigate U isotope variation in the black shale (BS) member of the Hushpuckney Shale (Swope Formation) at two sites ~400 km apart within the Late Paleozoic Midcontinent Sea (LPMS) of North America, with the goal of testing whether sediment δ238U records a global-ocean redox signal or local environmental influences. Our results document a spatial gradient of at least 0.25‰ in δ238U within the LPMS, demonstrating that local (probably redox) controls have overprinted any global U-isotope signal. Furthermore, the pattern of stratigraphic variation in δ238U in both study cores, with low values (‒0.4 to ‒0.2‰) at the base and top and peak values (+0.4 to +0.65‰) in the middle of the BS, is inconsistent with dominance of a global-ocean redox signal because (1) the middle of the BS was deposited at maximum eustatic highstand when euxinic conditions existed most widely within the LPMS and coeval epicontinental seas, and (2) more extensive euxinia should have shifted global-ocean seawater δ238U to lower values based on mass-balance principles. On the other hand, the observed δ238U pattern is consistent with a dominant local redox control, with larger U-isotope fractionations associated with more reducing bottom waters. We therefore conclude that U was not removed quantitatively to euxinic facies of the LPMS, and that sediment U-isotope compositions were controlled mainly by local redox and hydrographic factors. Our results imply that U-isotope signals from epicontinental-sea sections must be vetted carefully through analysis of high-resolution datasets at multiple sites in order to validate their potential use as a global-seawater redox proxy.",

            "abstract": "Cotopaxi is an andesitic stratovolcano, located in the highland region of Ecuador, which renewed its activity in April 2015, showing an increased number of volcano-tectonic (VT), long-period (LP), very long period events (VLP), and tremors. The VLP events were recorded in several episodes between 2002 and 2014, and have been interpreted as volumetric changes due to the release of gas and subsequent pressure drop and recovery in the magma intrusion. The two peaks of VLP seismicity in June 2002 and April 2015 preceded an increase of surficial activity (fumarolic increase) and the deformation data during those episodes suggested a small intrusion of magma beneath the volcano.\nUsing polarization analysis, we found that most of these events were located at 2–3 km depth beneath the volcano summit, while the deformation data suggests the intrusion is deeper (5-10 km deep). Using tiltmeter data, Mogi point source modelling on successive periods of inflation and deflation show a significant shallowing of sources since the end of May 2015, matching the recent very large spike in SO2 emissions (~3000 t/d). From mid-February until the gas emission spikes in May 2015, Mogi source modelling has indicated inflation/deflation events at 11 to 10 km depth, having shallowed to a depth of between 8 and 7 km after the SO2 emission increase. Shallow source volumes suggested by deformation indicate values of 4 - 31x106 m3, with the most recent, most shallow inflation currently at 8x106 m3.",

            "abstract": "In this study, a set of consistent and reliable long-term time series of snow depth observations on a daily scale, from selected sites across the Austrian Alps is used. The Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) and the Hydrographical Central Bureau of Austria (HZB) collected the data, enabling to investigate time series covering a period from the late nineteenth century until today.\nSpatiotemporal characteristics of seasonal snow depth observations were analyzed by using the method of principal component analysis (PCA). In order to derive regions with similar temporal evolution we regionalized the time series based on their spatial variability patterns for the period 1961-2010. In some cases, the regionalisation was limited due to sparse data coverage. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test were used to assess the significance of trends of several snow indices, e.g. snow depth, maximum snow depth, snow cover duration, at monthly and seasonal time scales. We removed lag-1 serial correlations from the snow data by the trend-free pre-whitening approach. For the monthly and seasonal time series during the period 1961-2010, negative trends in snow indices were significant at the 95% confidence level, primarily at stations in the Western and Southern part of Austria. Correlation between snow observations and gridded winter air temperature and precipitation fields (HISTALP data set) show that increased air temperatures and decreasing precipitation during the 1990s, yield to a pronounced reduction in both snow depth and snow duration. In fact, the results indicate major shifts of the snow depth and snow cover duration around the 1970s and especially the 1990s, which are predominantly causing these trends. Decreasing trends of snow-depth in the West and South of Austria, as well as stable snow depth trends in the Northeast are well correlated to changing weather patterns, using an objective weather type classification system. In particular, changes in the frequency of weather types with cyclones moving from South towards the Alps are relevant for snow depth trends, which is also captured by respective changes of the NAOI.",

            "abstract": "Alpine climate change in the Rocky Mountains has been linked to changes in precipitation patterns between summer and winter periods, and in total amounts of accumulation over the year. Annual variation in alpine snowpack can have important effects on concentrations and amounts of nitrogen (N) deposition entering the alpine from the atmosphere, as between one third to one half of N deposition occurs in association with precipitation, and high elevations primarily receive precipitation in the form of winter snow. Variation in snowpack further affects the amount and timing of water available to vegetation during the growing season, which can have large implications for alpine ecosystem responses in association with N deposition. To examine the potential interactive effects of variation in winter weather and N deposition, we established five sites along an ambient gradient of N deposition in the Rocky Mountains and collected measurements of N cycling between 2012 and 2014. This time frame included a year with low snow pack (2012), a year with average snow pack (2013), and a year with high snow pack (2014) among sites in the study, and allowed for us to examine candidate dynamic climatic drivers that may create variation in ecosystem processes associated with N. We found that soil water nitrate concentrations following snow melt were highly different for 4 sites along the N deposition gradient between 2013 and 2014. Growing season resin extractable N, however, was unaffected by inter-annual changes in winter precipitation. One possible explanation for no change in resin N may be associated with high inter-annual variation in plant community composition. There were significant differences in the species composition between 2012 and 2013, as well as shifts in the concentrations of N found in dominant plant species tissue. Our results suggest that plants will be important controls on biogeochemical responses of alpine moist meadows under variation in winter precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Ice core records of atmospheric methane show that on orbital and millennial timescales methane closely follows changes in Greenland temperature, presumably driven by variations in tropical hydrology. Over glacial-interglacial cycles methane mole fractions can range from 350ppb up to 700ppb. Over the last 110,000 years, warm events referred to as Greenland Interstadials (GI), noted in Greenland ice core δ18O records as well as in ocean sediments, speleothems, and other archives, are characterized by a coeval rise in atmospheric methane (Brook, Harder et al. 2000). At the onset of these events methane rises by 50 to 300ppb from Greenland Stadial (GS) concentrations (Brook, Sowers et al. 1996). In addition to the GI/GS methane variations, there are distinct, though smaller, increases in methane during Heinrich Stadials (HS) 1, 2, 4 and 5(Rhodes, Brook et al. 2015). These HS features in the methane record are unique as there is no coeval change in Greenland water isotopes or in 30°N summertime insolation.\nUsing the Inter-Polar Difference (IPD) of methane mole fractions, we investigate the hypothesis that the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), normally positioned north of the equator, shifted southward during HSs, causing an intensification of monsoons and tropical wetland methanogenisis in the southern hemisphere and drying in the northern hemisphere, as suggested by cave records in China (Wang, Cheng et al. 2001) and Peru (Kanner, Burns et al. 2012). For this study we obtained a high-resolution, high-precision methane record from the WAIS Divide and GISP2 ice cores covering GS 10 through GI 8. Because methane is sufficiently well mixed in the atmosphere to allow synchronization of Greenland and Antarctic ice cores, yet has a short enough lifetime to preserve an inter-hemispheric gradient, a change in the latitudinal distribution of sources can be determined from the difference between these two records. Our data show a distinct decrease in the gradient over the first 500 years of HS4, reaching a minimum proximal to the mid-stadial rise in methane. The gradient then gradually increased over the remaining 1000 years of the stadial. This shape in the gradient suggests the maximum southward migration of the ITCZ occurred mid-stadial and then returned northward for the remainder of the stadial.",

            "abstract": "Dispersionless and dispersed particle injections associated with substorms have been studied for many years based on observations acquired primarily at geosynchronous orbit. A general picture that has emerged is that particles are energized and rapidly transported/organized behind an \"injection boundary\" that penetrates closer to Earth in some magnetic local time sector (e.g. the so-called double-spiral injection boundary model). While this picture provides a very good description of injections at geosynchronous orbit, with the launch of the Van Allen Probes mission, we are now able to explore the evolution of injection signatures well inside of geosynchronous orbit at multiple locations as well. We find that the injection boundary model also appears to reproduce a number of complicated types of dispersion patterns observed in the Van Allen Probes particle data. The dispersion patterns are found to depend dramatically on orbital configuration and timing of onset relative to the phasing of the spacecraft in their orbits. In addition to observational results, we present results of simulated dispersion patterns obtained from the injection boundary model using guiding center particle tracing in two different field configurations: 1) a simplistic dipole magnetic field with Volland-Stern electric field, and 2) RAM/SCB running in the Space Weather Modeling Framework.",

            "abstract": "The Permittivity Probe (SESAME-PP) on-board the Philae Lander of the ROSETTA mission was designed to constrain the complex permittivity of the first 2 m of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and to monitor its variations with time. Doing so, it is meant to provide a unique insight into the composition of the comet, and in particular, into its water content. PP-SESAME acquired data on November 13, 2015, both during Philae descent to the comet and at the surface of the nucleus.\nThe PP-SESAME instrument is derived from the quadrupole array technique. A sinusoidal electrical current is sent into the ground through a transmitting dipole, and the induced electrical voltage on a receiving dipole is measured. The complex permittivity of the material is inferred from the mutual impedance derived from the measurements. In practice, the influence of both the electronic circuit of the instrument and the conducting elements in its close environment must be accounted for in order to best estimate both the dielectric constant and electrical conductivity of the ground. For that purpose, we have developed a method called the “capacity-influence matrix method”.\nA replica of the instrument was recently built in LATMOS (France) in order to validate this method. In this paper, we will present the tests conducted with the replica in a controlled environment and their comparison to numerical simulations. We will also show simulations relevant to the PP-SESAME experiment on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. These simulations were run for realistic scenarios of the Philae’s attitude and environment at its final landing site. We discuss their implications in terms of surface electrical and compositional properties.",

            "abstract": "Observations of water storage anomalies monitored by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiments (GRACE) satellite mission have recently been used to estimate regional-scale groundwater depletion. Different GRACE products are available such as the JPL 1°x1° GRACE Tellus dataset and the University of Colorado (CU) dataset of regional-averages. In addition, in order to estimate groundwater depletion rates, GRACE data must be used in conjunction with auxiliary hydrologic and land-use information such as soil moisture, vegetation types, snow storage, etc. These auxiliary datasets are usually estimated using coarse scale (usually 1°x1°) hydrological/land surface observations and models. Therefore, it is important to quantify the sensitivity of estimates of groundwater depletion to different GRACE products, types of auxiliary datasets, and different spatial scales. In this study we show results of a sensitivity analysis of groundwater depletion trends for the Central Valley aquifer of California using three different GRACE products: i) GRACE Tellus, ii) CU GRACE data and, iii) Scaled CU data (filtered CU data optimally scaled to capture peaks in observed water balance). Using soil moisture and snow water storage estimated from 1/8th degree Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and observed surface water storages (e.g., reservoirs etc.), groundwater depletion from April 2006-March 2010 for three GRACE products is estimated as 15.8, 13.9 and 36.3 km3 respectively. For the time period April 2006-September 2009 these estimates are 7.95, 5.5 and 29.2 km3, respectively. In addition, a sensitivity analysis with respect to spatial scale of VIC model will be presented, which involves using estimates of soil moisture and snow storage at the following three different spatial scales: i) 1 degree, ii) 1/8th degree and, iii) 1/16th degree.",

In this study, we investigate interfaces and defects in NdTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures using analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. It is found that the strain in the NdTiO3 film supplies driving force to form a new type of line defect to adapt the strain. To the best of our knowledge this new type of defect has yet become known.

            "abstract": "In this paper, we quantify properties of relativistic electron precipitation at low altitudes in order to constrain the mechanism(s) for microburst loss occurring in Earth’s radiation belt. Though studied for decades, the physical mechanism(s) responsible for the loss of radiation belt particles through microburst precipitation to the atmosphere remains uncertain, and, unquantified in a global sense. Accordingly, we appeal to new measurements from the NSF FIREBIRD (Focused Investigation of Relativistic Electron Burst Intensity Range and Dynamics) mission. FIREBIRD comprises two 1.5U CubeSats launched in early 2015 into identical coplanar polar low altitude orbits; a small spring imparted a slow separation between the two spacecraft upon orbit insertion. Over the course of the mission, the orbits of the two identically-instrumented spacecraft slowly evolve, sampling spatial scales of electron precipitation measured simultaneously at separations of 10’s to 1000’s of kilometers. FIREBIRD provides electron energy spectra from ~250 keV to > 1MeV, with both high spectral resolution (6 to 12 energy channels) and high temporal resolution (principally operated at ~18 millisecond sampling). To do so, FIREBIRD employs two solid-state detectors on each CubeSat, one an uncollimated detector with a large geometric factor (optimized for weak events) and the other a collimated detector (optimized for intense events). While the primary goal of FIREBIRD is to establish the spatial/temporal coherence of microburst precipitation, it also provides the capability of quantifying on each spacecraft the dispersive properties of microbursts. In this work, we report on the energy-time dispersive qualities of individual bursts, which in turn provide a means for testing models and constraining where and how the bursts are generated. To test these models, we use measurements made near the magnetic equator by the Van Allen Probes mission during times when the two FIREBIRD and two Van Allen Probes spacecraft were in optimal magnetic conjunctions. To the greatest extent possible, we will study times when the four spacecraft were also overflying the August 2015 BARREL (Balloon Array for RBSP Relativistic Electron Losses) campaign to further constrain the temporal and spatial properties of microbursts.",

Without a data management plan, data (for any practical purpose) could be lost, resulting in a non-uniform coverage that will reduce any chance of local and international collaboration, i.e., data will never become scientific knowledge.\nSince 2009, huge efforts from four different institutions are establishing the new permanent Brazilian Seismographic Network (RSBR), mainly with resources from PETROBRAS, the Brazilian Government oil company.\nFour FDSN sub-networks currently compose RSBR, with a total of 80 permanent stations. BL and BR codes (from BRASIS subnet) with 47 stations maintained by University of Sao Paulo (USP) and University of Brasilia (UnB) respectively; NB code (RSISNE subnet), with 16 stations deployed by University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN); and ON code (RSIS subnet), with 18 stations operated by the National Observatory (ON) in Rio de Janeiro.\nMost stations transmit data in real-time via satellite or cell-phone links. Each node acquires its own stations locally, and data is real-time shared using SeedLink. Archived data is distributed via ArcLink and/or FDSNWS services. All nodes use the SeisComP3 system for real-time processing and as a levering back-end.\nOpen-source solutions like Seiscomp3 require some homemade tools to be developed, to help solve the most common daily problems of a data management center: local magnitude into the real-time earthquake processor, website plugins, regional earthquake catalog, contribution with ISC catalog, quality-control tools, data request tools, etc.\nThe main data products and community activities include: kml files, data availability plots, request charts, summer school courses, an Open Lab Day and news interviews.\nFinally, a good effort was made to establish BRASIS sub-network and the whole RSBR as a unified project, that serves as a communication channel between individuals operating local networks.",

Rayleigh scatter and resonance lidars, particularly sodium resonance lidar, have been the two dominant ground-based techniques for acquiring mesosphere and MLT vertical temperature profiles, respectively, for more than two decades. With these measurements, the dynamics (gravity waves, tides) and long-term temperature trends (upper atmosphere cooling) of the MLT region can be studied. The Utah State University (USU; 41.7º N, 111.8º W) campus hosts a unique upper atmospheric observatory which houses both a high-power, large-aperture Rayleigh lidar and a sodium resonance Doppler lidar. For the first time, we will present coordinated, night-time averaged temperatures, overlapping in observational range (80-110 km), from the two lidars. This overlap has been achieved through the relocation of the sodium lidar from Colorado State University to USU’s campus and through upgrades to the existing USU Rayleigh lidar which elevated its observational range from 45-90 km to 70-115 km. The comparison of the two sets of temperature measurements is important because the two lidar techniques derive temperature profiles using different scattering processes and analysis methods. Furthermore, previous climatological comparisons, between Rayleigh and sodium lidar, [Argall and Sica, 2007] have suggested that significant temperature differences can occur. This comparison aims to explore possible temperature effects from the differences in the two measurement techniques.",

            "abstract": "Surface water is a critical resource in semi-arid areas. The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia, one of the largest semi-arid basins in the world is aiming to set a worldwide example of how to balance multiple interests (i.e. environment, agriculture and urban use), but has suffered significant water shrinkages during the Millennium Drought (1999-2009), followed by extensive flooding. Baseline information and systematic quantification of surface water (SW) extent and flooding dynamics in space and time are needed for managing SW resources across the basin but are currently lacking.\nTo synoptically quantify changes in SW extent and flooding dynamics over MDB, we used seasonally continuous Landsat TM and ETM+ data (1986 – 2011) and generic machine learning algorithms. We further mapped flooded forest at a riparian forest site that experienced severe tree dieback due to changes in flooding regime. We used a stratified sampling design to assess the accuracy of the SW product across time.\nAccuracy assessment yielded an overall classification accuracy of 99.94%, with producer’s and user’s accuracy of SW of 85.4% and 97.3%, respectively. Overall accuracy was the same for Landsat 5 and 7 data but user’s and producer’s accuracy of water were higher for Landsat 7 than 5 data and stable over time.\nOur validated results document a rapid loss in SW bodies. The number, size, and total area of SW showed high seasonal variability with highest numbers in winter and lowest numbers in summer. SW extent per season per year showed high interannual and seasonal variability, with low seasonal variability during the Millennium Drought.\nExamples of current uses of the new dataset will be presented and include (1) assessing ecosystem response to flooding with implications for environmental water releases, one of the largest investment in environment in Australia; (2) quantifying drivers of SW dynamics (e.g. climate, human activity); (3) quantifying changes in SW dynamics and connectivity for water dependent organisms; (4) assessing the impact of flooding on riparian vegetation health. The approach developed here is globally applicable, relevant to areas with competing water demands (e.g. Okavango delta, Mekong Basin). Future work should incorporate Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data for continued quantification of SW dynamics.",

However, the highly spatially and temporally variable nature of water conditions and constituents, as well as atmospheric conditions are challenging factors, especially for spaceborne observations.\nHere, we study the quantitative impact of uncertainties in the spectral aerosol optical and microphysical properties, namely aerosol optical depth (AOD), spectral absorption, and particle size, on the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) of simulated typical open ocean and coastal waters. Rrs is related to the inherent optical properties of the water column and is a fundamental parameter in ocean optics retrievals. We use the successive order of scattering (SOS) method to perform radiative transfer calculations of the coupled system of atmosphere and water. The optics of typical open ocean and coastal waters are simulated with bio-optical models. We derive sensitivities by comparing spectral SOS calculations of Rrs with a reference aerosol model against similar calculations performed using a different aerosol model. One particular focus of this study lies on the impact of the spectral absorption of dust and brown carbon, or similar particles with greater absorption at short wavelengths on Rrs. The results are presented in terms of the minimum expected error in Rrs due to the choice of an incorrect aerosol model during the atmospheric correction of ocean color remote sensing data from space. This study is independent of errors related to observational data or retrieval techniques.\nThe results are relevant for quantifying requirements of aerosol retrievals to derive accurate Rrs from spaceborne observations, such as NASA’s future Pre-Aerosol, Clouds, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission.",

However, as each spectral return from these systems is a vector with several hundred elements, they can be very difficult to process and analyze, and problemeatic to compare within, across, and between datasets over time and space. Vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI, ARVI, EVI, et al) attempt to combine spectral features in to single-value scores. When derived from calibrated and atmospherically compensated reflectance data, these indices can be quantitatively compared. Historically, these indices have been calculated from multispectral sensor data. These sensors have a handful (4 to 16 or so) of bandbasses ranging from 20 nm to 200 nm FWHM covering specific spectral regions for a variety of reasons, including both intended applications and system limitations. Hyperspectral sensors, however, cover the spectrum with many, many narrow (5 to 10 nm) bandpasses. This allows for analyses using the full, detailed spectral curve, or combination of the bands in to regions by averaging or in to composites using transforms or other techniques. This raises the question of exactly which bands should be used and combined in what manner for ideally deriving well-known vegetation indices typically made from multispectral data. In this study we use derivatives and other curve and signal analysis techniques to analyze vegetation reflectance spectra to quantitatively define optimal bandpasses for several vegetation indices and combine the 5 nm hypserspectral bandpasses of the NEON Imaging Spectrometer to synthesize them.",

            "abstract": "The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed the Radiometer Atmospheric CubeSat Experiment (RACE) that was lost during the Orbital 3 (Orb-3) launch anomaly on October 28, 2014. The 3U CubeSat mission would have measured 2 channels of the 183 GHz water vapor line and raised the technology readiness level (TRL) of various subsystems to 6. Despite the launch failure, several hundreds of hours of instrument operation data was taken, including measurements in thermal vacuum of the complete spacecraft system. These data is used to evaluate the 35 nm Indium Phosphide (InP) receivers, and the low noise amplifier (LNA) based internal calibration system.\nThe thermal vacuum measurements included frequent observations of a ‘cold’ and ‘hot’ target allowing for various receiver parameters to be calculated. The payload thermal vacuum data show that the receiver front ends performed as expected in terms of the gain (>35 dB) and drift (0.06 dB/K). The data also shows that integration could be performed with decreasing noise up to ~30 seconds, allowing for the system to be calibrated within that time period. The expected spacecraft calibration period would have been every 12 seconds.\nThe injected noise from the load terminated LNA show magnitudes from 50 – 150 K that can be tuned which would meet most requirements. However the temperature coefficient is large at ~3 K/K which is over an order of magnitude larger than typical noise diodes. For nanosatellite class spacecraft, the power required to properly maintain the physical temperature range (±0.1K) would be challenging. On larger spacecraft, this methodology may still be viable, depending on the availability of suitable noise diodes at 183 GHz.\nWhile the CubeSat did not take measurements in space, the ground data in the relevant environment and extensive testing allows us to raise the following subsystems to TRL 6: 1) 183 GHz 35 nm InP receiver, 2) 183 GHz direct detect receiver and 3) 183 GHz LNA based calibration system.",

            "abstract": "The Holocene East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) was characterized by a trend to weaker monsoon intensity paced by orbital insolation. Here, we attribute the stronger EASM intensity in the early-mid Holocene to changes in the timing of the transition between the EASM seasonal stages – Spring, pre Mei- Yu, Mei-Yu, and Summer - during that time. Following the recent ‘jet transition hypothesis’ (Chiang et al., 2015), we explore the role of north-south displacement of the westerlies relative to the Tibetan Plateau that is hypothesized to control the downstream EASM seasonality changes across the Holocene. To this end, we analyze model simulations of the Holocene EASM, compare the simulated Holocene climate with the paleodata observations, and examine the role of atmospheric circulation and specifically the westerlies in modulating the East Asia summer climate.\nThe PMIP3 climate model simulations suggest that, compared to the pre-industrial, the Mei-Yu onset and the transition from Mei-Yu to Summer rainfall occur earlier in the mid-Holocene. The advanced seasonal rainfall transition is accompanied by the weakened and northward-shifted upstream westerlies. In our atmospheric general circulation model (coupled to a slab ocean) simulations of various time periods across the Holocene (9ka, 6ka, 3ka, and pre-industrial), we quantitatively show that the timing and the length of each rainfall stage are closely related to the jet position over East Asia. We also show that the simulated changes in the maximum annual rainfall band and dust emission over East Asia largely agree with the paleo-proxy observations. In addition, we find that changes to the seasonal rainfall transitions, latitudinal westerly position, and stationary eddy activity over East Asia co-vary across the Holocene. In particular, we argue that the changes in the rainfall seasonal transitions are tied to an altered stationary wave pattern, resembling today’s the so-called ‘Silk Road Pattern’, riding along the westerly jet.\nWe end by discussing the mechanism that is proposed to explain the changed EASM seasonality across the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization and shifts in precipitation patterns have altered the risk of inland flooding. Methods to assess the flood risk, such as flood frequency analysis, are based on the key assumption of stationarity (ST). Under the ST assumption, the behavior of the hydroclimatic system (precipitation, temperature) and watershed is assumed to be time invariant. This ST assumption is quite restrictive and perhaps not accurate for flood risk assessment in watersheds that have undergone significant urbanization. Consequently, there is an urgent need for statistical methods that can account explicitly for system non-stationarity (NS) in the analysis and quantification of flood risks. One approach is to use time variant parameters in an extreme value distribution. This approach, called NEVA, has shown to improve the statistical representation of observed data (within-sample), yet NEVA has not been comprehensively evaluated for predictive analysis (out-of-sample). We apply NEVA to 1,548 records of observed annual maximum discharges with the goal to (1) assess which of the two approaches (ST/NS) and their parametric models, in Log-Pearson Type III (LPIII) distribution, best describe the statistical representation of future flood risks, and (2) which diagnostic is most suitable for model selection (NS/ST). To explore these questions, we use the first half of each flood record for inference of the LPIII model parameters using MCMC simulation with the DREAM(ZS) algorithm – and the second part of the record is used for evaluation purposes (predictive analysis). Our results show that in about 70% of the records with a trend, the LPIII ST model performed better during evaluation than the LPIII NS model – unless the “trend” record is more than 55-years long; then the NS model is always preferred. If trend classification of the 1,548 records was done using summary metrics of watershed processes (runoff coefficient) rather than the peak discharges, the performance of the NS model improved markedly. Altogether, our results demonstrate that summary metrics rooted in hydrologic theory are more useful for assessing NS than trends in peak discharges, and NEVA is reliable for predictive analysis if records are sufficiently long or NS can be attributed to physical changes in watershed processes.",

As was evidenced in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, “ghost towns” emerged in neighborhoods with high concentrations of damaged rental housing. Also, rental properties that served predominantly lower income households had more difficulty financing repairs which led to blight and other long-term community recovery challenges. Our approach is to develop a framework for identifying and spatially analyzing communities at risk of long-term displacement and recovery challenges for an earthquake scenario.\nThe HayWired scenario postulates a M7.05 earthquake on the Hayward Fault in the San Francisco Bay Area with surface fault rupture, liquefaction, landslides, and fires, as well as subsequent aftershocks. The analytical framework relies on the literature and prior disaster experience to identify and systematically combine physical and socioeconomic impacts of the earthquake sequence with pre-existing socioeconomic conditions to identify areas where housing and building damage, lifeline service disruption, and socioeconomic challenges intersect and can potentially lead to long-term displacements of people, businesses, and jobs. Hazus analyses estimate $46 billion in building damage from the HayWired main shock, which increases by 10-25% due to aftershocks. Heavy damage to large apartment buildings exceeds many other housing types, and preliminary analyses identify neighborhoods where these damage concentrations also intersect with concentrations of low income households. Also, in some counties, the estimated population displaced from severely damaged housing far exceeds the number of vacant housing units, which means residents may be forced to move well away from former neighborhoods and even outside the region altogether.",

Although primarily designed for icecap and sea ice monitoring, ATLAS also will record dense observations over Pan-Arctic inland water bodies throughout its designed three year life span. These measurements will offer improved understanding of the linkages between climate variability and Arctic hydrology including closure of the Pan-Arctic water balance. An ICESat-2 Inland Water Body Height Data Product is being developed consisting of along-track water surface height, slope, and roughness for each ATLAS strong beam, and also aspect and slope between adjacent beams. The data product will be computed for all global inland water bodies that are traversed by ICESat-2 during clear to moderately clear atmospheric conditions. While the domain of the ATL13 data product is global, the focus is on high-latitude terrestrial regions where the convergence of the ICESat-2 orbits will provide spatially dense observations. Water bodies will be identified primarily through the use of an “Inland Water Body Shape Mask”. In preparation for the mission, the Multiple Beam Altimeter Lidar Experimental Lidar (MABEL), was built and flown during numerous high altitude experiments, observing a wide range of water targets. The current analysis examines several MABEL inland and near coastal coastal targets during 2012 to 2015, focusing on along track surface water height, light penetration into water under a range of atmospheric and water conditions. Sites include several Alaska lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, and the near shore Atlantic coast. Results indicate very good capability for retrieving along track surface water height and standard deviation and penetration depth. Overall, the MABEL data and subsequent analyses have demonstrated the feasibility of the ATL13 algorithm for providing quantifiable ICESat-a data products of inland and near shore waters.",

Soil moisture and snow cover have been recognized as potential sources of predictability for temperature and precipitation on this time scale. They can play a crucial role through better initialization and improved representation of land surface processes. In this study, we focus on the identification of potential regions of strong land-atmosphere coupling during March-April-May (MAM) and June-July-August (JJA). A quantification of the land-atmosphere coupling strength in the models is also made on the basis of several coupling indices. Comparison with earlier studies helps us identify the regions where biases in the terrestrial and/or atmospheric segments may affect the overall land-atmosphere coupling strength in individual models. Better representation of land surface processes and accurate initialization of the land surface states during MAM has important implications for variability of Indian summer monsoon rainfall on sub-seasonal time scales, which is also addressed in this study.",

Complete microbial denitrification can be viewed as a nitrogen sink, converting soluble nitrate into inert nitrogen gas. This research aims to quantify and correlate the driving parameters in microbial denitrification and explore the relationship to the abundance of denitrifying genes and the microbial communities at these sites. Denitrifying genes for each step in the denitrification process have been quantified. Data from a field site in Southern Minnesota has been collected throughout the season for two years enabling investigation into the temporal variability of denitrification. Data was collected at two cross-sections across the channel to determine the effect of bank location and moisture content on denitrification.\nData were collected in an experimental basin in the summer of 2015 to determine the effect of flooding and benthic organic matter content and quality on microbial denitrification and nitrous oxide production. Four sediment types were investigated in three different flood regimes. After each raising or lowering of the water level, soil cores were taken to determine soil characteristics, the potential denitrification using the denitrification enzyme activity method, nitrous oxide production using a static core method, and the denitrifying gene abundance. Chambers were also deployed over each soil amendment in each flood regime to determine the nitrous oxide production over time.\nResults from these studies will convey a more complete explanation of denitrification and nitrous oxide production under varying environmental conditions. By determining the driving parameters for microbial denitrification, denitrification hot spots and hot moments can be created and enhanced. One potential consequence of increased denitrification is the possibility of incomplete denitrification resulting in the release of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas with 300 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. The investigation of nitrous oxide emissions and correlation to denitrification rates will facilitate smart management and remediation efforts of agricultural landscapes.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, there have been a number of large spring floods in the Red River basin in the states of North Dakota and Minnesota, and in the Province of Manitoba. These recent floods have led to speculation that increased greenhouse gas concentrations may be changing precipitation patterns and impacting the frequency of floods. In this study, we investigate whether this is a reasonable assumption based on global climate model output. A regression model is developed to predict spring peak discharge on the Red River at a streamflow gage located at the border of the US and Canada. The predictor variables include antecedent fall precipitation used as a proxy for soil moisture at freeze-up, winter snow accumulation, and spring precipitation during the period of melt. Data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) have been used to calibrate the model. Bias-corrected projections from the CMIP5 GCM model ensemble are then used to predict floods in future years. The predicted floods are modeled using non-stationary frequency analysis. The use of multiple GCMs and multiple Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) allow for an estimate of uncertainty to be associated with the results. It is concluded that climate change will likely have an impact on floods in the Red River basin, but the uncertainty surrounding this assessment is rather large.",

            "abstract": "The deployment of a temporary, 60 km aperture, broadband seismic array on the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS), West Antarctica provides an opportunity to analyze ocean-derived seismic noise sources. The location of Antarctica, surrounded by the Southern Ocean and the seasonal effect of sea ice on shallow water noise production, allows for an intriguing experiment as to the production of primary and secondary microseisms. The WIS array was deployed for 2 months between December 2010–January 2011 with its primary objective to study WIS stick–slip events and glacial microseismicity. However, daylong stacks of station-to-station correlograms show directionality of the ambient noise field within the frequency bands of the primary and secondary microseisms. Although the WIS array is located close to the grounding line, it lies 700 km from the nearest open water at the end of the austral summer. The array consists of 17 broadband stations arranged in a series of offset concentric circles that minimizes spatial artifacts with regards to the array response. We use beamforming analysis to show that primary microseisms (~15 s) are sourced from three azimuthal directions with some ice-free coastline: Antarctic Peninsula, Victoria Land, and Dronning-Maude Land. Long-period secondary microseisms (~10 s) appear to be sourced in the deep Southern Ocean and track storm systems. Short-period secondary microseisms (~6 s) show much more dependence on the continental shelf and possibly coastal reflections. This is consistent with year-long noise spectra showing diminishment in the 15 s and 6 s bands [Grob et al. 2011]. Modeling of secondary microseism sources [Ardhuin et al. 2011] provides insight on the sources of surface wave noise at higher frequencies. We backproject daily P and PKPbc body wave microseism signals found at lower ray parameters sourced at distances of ~20–90° and ~145–155° respectively. The ocean sources for these arrivals remain fairly consistent, suggesting a bathymetric control, although the signal power increases with the passing of storm systems. We conclude that both 15 s primary microseisms and 6 s secondary microseisms at surface wave slownesses are generated in shallow coastal regions, but 10 s microseisms and noise with body wave slownesses are largely generated in deeper oceanic regions.",

            "abstract": "The Toba super-eruption in Sumatra, ~74,000 years ago, was the largest terrestrial volcanic event of the Quaternary. Some have proposed that the eruption produced widespread perturbations of climate and ecosystems. Evaluation of the environmental impact of the eruption and linkage to rapid climate oscillations recorded in ice core, sediment and speleothem records requires an accurate and precise age for the event, with uncertainties at the centurial level. Two recent studies, however, have proposed quite different 40Ar/39Ar ages for this volcanic event of 73.88 ± 0.32 ka (Storey et al., 2012) and 75.0 ± 0.9 ka (Mark et al, 2014), with both uncertainties expressed at 1σ, leading to radically different interpretations of its global impact.\n40Ar/39Ar is a relative dating method, in which the unknown is run against a mineral standard of known age. Storey et al (2012) obtained their age estimate using a new-generation, multi-collector noble gas mass spectrometer (NU Instruments Noblesse) equipped with ion-counters, while Mark et al. (2014) used an earlier generation of lower resolution, single-collector mass spectrometer (MAP 215-50). Both studies used the same mineral standard (Alder Creek sanidine, ACs), except that Mark et al. (2014) used an older value, which accounts for the discrepancy in ages between the two studies. The value used by Mark et al. for ACs is geologically implausible, because it results in older 40Ar/39Ar dates than the youngest co-existing zircon U/Pb CATIMS ages (e.g., Rivera et al., 2013, 2014). Use of the same value for ACs as used by Storey et al. (2012) results in an identical, but less precise, astronomically calibrated age of 73.9 ± 0.9 ka for the Mark et al. data.\nHere, we review combined U/Pb and 40Ar/39Ar age data (both published and unpublished) for a number of Quaternary and older volcanic ash deposits, and U/Th ages for late Quaternary speleothems. These data strongly support the age assigned to ACs by Storey et al. (2012) and Rivera et al. (2013) and, hence, an astronomically calibrated age of 73.9 ka age for the Toba super-eruption. This confirms the original high-precision 40Ar/39Ar age determination of Storey et al. (2012)\nStorey et al., 2012, PNAS, 109, 18684-18688; Rivera et al., 2013, Chem.

            "abstract": "Marchetti [1977] proposed that CO2 could be directly injected into the deep ocean to mitigate its rapid build-up in the atmosphere. Although previous studies have investigated biogeochemical and climatic effects of injecting CO2 into the ocean, they have not looked at global carbon cycle feedbacks and backfluxes that are important for accounting. Using an Earth System Model of intermediate complexity we simulated the injection of CO2 into the deep ocean during a high CO2 emissions scenario. At seven sites 0.1 GtC yr-1 was injected at three different depths (3 separate experiments) between the years 2020 and 2120. After the 100-year injection period, our simulations continued until the year 3020 to assess the long-term dynamics. In addition, we investigated the effects of marine sediment feedbacks during the experiments by running the model with and without a sediment sub-model. Our results, in regards to efficiency (the residence time of injected CO2) and seawater chemistry changes, are similar to previous studies. However, from a carbon budget perspective the targeted cumulative atmospheric CO2 reduction of 70 GtC was never reached. This was caused by the atmosphere-to-terrestrial and/or atmosphere-to-ocean carbon fluxes (relative to the control run), which were effected by the reduction in atmospheric carbon. With respect to global oceanic carbon, the respective carbon cycle-climate feedbacks led to an even smaller efficiency than indicated by tracing the injected CO2. The ocean also unexpectedly took up carbon after the injection at 1500 m was stopped because of a deep convection event in the Southern Ocean. These findings highlighted that the accounting of CO2 injection would be challenging.",

            "abstract": "As big data computing capabilities are increasingly paired with spatial analytical tools and approaches, there is a need to ensure uncertainty associated with the datasets used in these analyses is adequately incorporated and portrayed in results. Often the products of spatial analyses, big data and otherwise, are developed using discontinuous, sparse, and often point-driven data to represent continuous phenomena. Results from these analyses are generally presented without clear explanations of the uncertainty associated with the interpolated values. The Variable Grid Method (VGM) offers users with a flexible approach designed for application to a variety of analyses where users there is a need to study, evaluate, and analyze spatial trends and patterns while maintaining connection to and communicating the uncertainty in the underlying spatial datasets. The VGM outputs a simultaneous visualization representative of the spatial data analyses and quantification of underlying uncertainties, which can be calculated using data related to sample density, sample variance, interpolation error, uncertainty calculated from multiple simulations. In this presentation we will show how we are utilizing Hadoop to store and perform spatial analysis through the development of custom Spark and MapReduce applications that incorporate ESRI Hadoop libraries. The team will present custom ‘Big Data’ geospatial applications that run on the Hadoop cluster and integrate with ESRI ArcMap with the team’s probabilistic VGM approach. The VGM-Hadoop tool has been specially built as a multi-step MapReduce application running on the Hadoop cluster for the purpose of data reduction. This reduction is accomplished by generating multi-resolution, non-overlapping, attributed topology that is then further processed using ESRI’s geostatistical analyst to convey a probabilistic model of a chosen study region. Finally, we will share our approach for implementation of data reduction and topology generation via custom multi-step Hadoop applications, performance benchmarking comparisons, and Hadoop-centric opportunities for greater parallelization of geospatial operations. The presentation includes examples of the approach being applied to a range of subsurface, geospatial studies (e.g. induced seismicity risk).",

The latter is a typical example for the spatio-temporal clustering of seismicity arising from triggering processes related to static and/or dynamic stress changes, yet the microscopic origin of the Omori-Utsu law is not well understood. Here, we study triggering processes in tri-axial compaction and fracture experiments under constant displacement on sandstone and granite samples using spatially located acoustic emission events and their focal mechanisms. We present strong evidence that triggering of such events by other acoustic emission events plays an important role in the presence of large heterogeneities while such triggering is basically absent if no significant heterogeneities are present. In the former case, we recover all established empirical laws of seismicity including the Gutenberg-Richter law, a modified version of the Omori-Utsu law and the productivity law. For the Gutenberg-Richter law, we find that the b-value is smaller for triggered events compared to background events. Moreover, we show that triggered acoustic emission events have a focal mechanism much more similar to their associated trigger than expected by random chance.",

Now in its ninth year, the course provides instruction in survey design, data acquisition, processing, interpretation, and visualization. Methods covered include seismic reflection, multibeam bathymetry, sidescan sonar, and sediment sampling. The emphasis of the course is team-oriented, hands-on, field training in real-world situations.\nThe course begins with classroom instruction covering the field area and field methods, followed by a week of at-sea field work in 4-student teams. The students then return to the classroom where they integrate, interpret, and visualize data using industry-standard software. The teams present results in a series of professional-level final presentations before academic and industry supporters. Our rotating field areas provide ideal locations for students to investigate coastal and sedimentary processes of the Gulf Coast and continental shelf .\nIn the field, student teams rotate between two research vessels: the smaller vessel, the Jackson School’s newly-commissioned R/V Scott Petty (26 feet LOA), is used principally for multibeam bathymetry, sidescan sonar, and sediment sampling; the other, NOAA’s R/V Manta (82 feet LOA) is used for high-resolution seismic reflection, CHIRP sub-bottom profiling, multibeam bathymetry, gravity coring, and vibracoring. Teams also rotate through a field laboratory performing processing of geophysical data and sediment samples.\nThis past year’s course in Freeport, Texas proceeded unabated despite concurrent record-breaking rainfall and flooding, which offered students a unique opportunity to observe and image, in real time, flood-related bedform migration on a time scale of hours. The data also allowed an in-class opportunity to examine natural and anthropogenic processes recorded in the river and coastal morphology and stratigraphy.\nhttp://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/mgg/courses/geof348K/",

The resulting time-series analysis indicates that the deformation began in late 2007, shortly after a 13-megawatt geothermal power plant began commercial production. The rate of deformation appears to be decreasing over time since 2008. The resulting maps of deformation show primarily uplift with some subsidence. The uplift signal is located in an ~8-km-by-5-km area centered near three injection wells that recycle produced brine into the Salt Lake formation, which consists of Miocene-Pliocene lacustrine deposits, volcanic tuffs, and lava flows. Subsidence occurs in an adjacent ~4-km-by-4-km area to the northwest. These two signatures remain in the same location in all of the well-correlated interferometric pairs since 2008. Although all production wells are also located inside the area experiencing uplift, most of them are close to the boundary that separates the two areas, and likely associated with the steeply dipping Bridge Fault zone. We explore the relative roles of thermal (T), and hydrological (H) processes on mechanical deformation (M). To do so, we use finite element based numerical models to calculate the time-dependent deformation field due to thermal contraction/expansion of rock (T-M coupling), and changes in pore pressure (H-M coupling).",

In the American Southwest, long records are revolutionizing our understanding of megadroughts, which have occurred in the past and will most certainly occur in the future with rapidly changing climate.\nOne site with the potential to study ancient megadroughts is Stoneman Lake, central Arizona, whose basin is a circular depression formed by a collapse in late Tertiary volcanics. The lake is spring fed, most recently alternating between a marsh and a lake, with water levels having fluctuated by > 3 meters over the last 25 years. Its small closed drainage basin (ca. 2.5 km2) with one small inflowing stream is key to the sensitivity of the record.\nTwo parallel lacustrine sediment cores (70 m and 30 m deep) were recovered in October of 2014. Our preliminary chronology includes 8 AMS dates in the upper 7 m and two distinct tephras at 30.8 m depth and 36.3 m depth. Radiocarbon dates show a 2.7-m-thick Holocene section, and then a low Pleistocene SAR with an age of 11,000 cal yr B.P. at ~2.8 m to an age of 46,500 cal yr B.P. at 4.2 m depth. We estimate that the 70-m deep hole will provide a climate record back to ~1.3 million years ago. Of particular interest are the interglacials that serve as good analogs for future climate including MIS 11 and MIS 19.\nInitial core description includes MS, bulk density and high-resolution images. Holocene sediments are characterized by massive, dark organic rich silty clays with no distinct lamination. Sediments from the Last Glacial Maximum are well-laminated, light brown silty clays with few organics present. The distinctive laminations probably represent a very deep lake and therefore a wet cold climate, also verified by pollen data. There are several repeated intervals of laminated sediments deeper in the core that may represent older glacial maxima.\nFuture work will include detailed pollen, plant macrofossil and charcoal analysis, scanning XRF, TOC and carbon isotopic analyses as well as compound specific carbon and hydrogen work.",

The feature is roughly circular, with a diameter of about 10 km; it has some depth extent and disrupts underlying strata. Two major possibilities exist for its origin: that it is an igneous diatreme or that it is a meteorite impact crater. We assess both possibilities through a detailed description of its morphology and seismic characteristics. Although a line of known alkaline volcanic pipes does project towards the coast, comparison of this feature with similar structures worldwide leads us to suggest that the crater is more likely to have formed through the impact of a meteorite. Using simple scaling relationships, we estimate the likely size of the impactor and attempt to arrive at an age limit by extrapolating the ages of mapped horizons from a borehole, located at a distance of approximately 5.5 km.",

            "abstract": "Magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents close in the nightside lower ionosphere. These spatially inhomogeneous and time varying volume currents are difficult to capture with in situ observations. Our understanding of M-I coupling systems is limited by our understanding of the actual structure of ionospheric current closure. A path forward includes assimilation of a variety of data sets into increasingly capable ionospheric models. While each data set provides only a piece of the picture, the assimilation process allows optimal use of each piece.\nAn important development for the necessary in situ observations involves making them truly multi-point, and therefore, low-resource. For thermal particle observations, the high densities of the lower ionosphere allow the use of low-gain (current-sensing rather than particle-counting) particle sensors. One observational goal is the definition of the actual structure of ionospheric closure currents. This can be approached with a number of different measurement techniques, in tandem with an ionospheric model, since the closure currents need to follow the rules of electrodynamics and current continuity. Low resource thermal plasma sensors such as retarding potential analyzers and drift meters can provide valuable measurements of plasma parameters, including density and plasma flow, without the need for high voltages or deployable boom systems. \nThese low-resource measurements, which can be reproduced on arrays of in situ observation platforms, used in tandem with proper plasma physics interpretation of their signatures in the disturbed observing environment, and as part of an assimilated data set into an ionospheric model, can allow us to progress in our understanding of ionospheric structuring and its effects on auroral coupling. Now, with increasingly capable multipoint arrays of spacecraft, and quantitative 2D-with-time context from cameras and imagery, we are moving toward truly multipoint studies of the system-level structure of the ionosphere, including in particular the question of current closure. The Ionospheric Cubeswarm Pathfinder concept explores the possibilities of using a short-lived (several months) localized (several hundred km) ionospheric swarm of cubesats to address these questions.",

Remote presence applications occur when one or more humans use a robot to project themselves into an environment in order to complete an inaccessible or time-critical mission. The more difficult problem of physical object manipulation goes one step further by incorporating physical-based interaction, in additional to visualization. Forested environments present especially unique challenges for small UAS versus similar domains (e.g., disaster response, inspection of critical infrastructure) due to the navigation and interaction required with dense tree canopies. This work describes two field investigations that inform: i) the type of physical object manipulation and visualization necessary for sensor placement (ventral, frontal, dorsal), ii) the necessary display form (hybrid) for piloting and sensor placement, and iii) visual feedback mechanisms useful for handling human-robot team role conflicts.",

We present here the initial results from the first workshop, which explores the various drivers responsible for changes in salmon allocation. Ranging from global to local, and biophysical to socioeconomic, these drivers are also linked to specific actors in the region. These complex interactions comprise the Kenai Peninsula’s social-ecological system and determine its ability to react to change. Using a stakeholder-driven scenario framework, we aim to: 1) explore the adaptive capacity of natural resource agencies in the region by exploring and exposing managers to different but logically coherent salmon allocation scenarios; 2) build stakeholder confidence in the science of environmental change on the Kenai Peninsula; and 3) develop a decision support tool that helps regional resource managers better understand their changing environment. We utilize and present the scenario framework as a platform for integrating hydrologic, landscape, and cultural change information into actionable decisions, crafted by the stakeholders, so that landscape change on the Kenai becomes more coordinated.",

            "abstract": "The oxygen isotope composition of the Martian atmosphere is of interest for comparison with recent MSL SAM results, and to understand the origin of oxygen isotope anomalies (i.e., mass-independent fractionation or MIF) in secondary minerals in SNC meteorites. Our focus here is on spin-forbidden photolysis of CO2, CO2 + hv (>167 nm) → CO(X1S) + O(3P). The spin-forbidden photolysis of CO2 is unusual in the Martian atmosphere because of its high reaction rate from the upper atmosphere (80 km) all the way to the ground. This range of altitudes spans 4 orders of magnitude in atmospheric pressure, and occurs because of the gradual decrease in the CO2 cross sections from 167 to ~200 nm. Previous laboratory photolysis experiments on CO2 in the spin-allowed and spin-forbidden regions have yielded a remarkably large MIF signature (17O excess ~ 100 permil) in O2 product for photolysis at 185 nm. Recent theoretical cross sections for CO2 isotopologues argue for a much smaller MIF signature from spin-forbidden photolysis. Here, we report the results of photolysis experiments on CO2 at the Soleil synchrotron DESIRS beamline. High purity, natural isotope abundance CO2 was placed in a 20 cm photocell with MgF2 windows. Experiments were performed at 3 wavelengths (7% FWHM): 160 nm (spin-allowed), and at 175 nm and 185 nm (spin-forbidden). After VUV exposure, aliquots of the photolyzed CO2 were sent to the Department of Isotope Geology at the University of Goettingen for O isotope analysis. The isotope results show that the spin-allowed photolysis yields normal, mass-dependent fractionation in agreement with earlier work. Photolysis at 175 nm, which is mostly spin-forbidden, yields a small positive (or zero) MIF signature. Photolysis at 185 nm, which is entirely spin-forbidden, yields O2 with a negative MIF signature (D17O ~ -8 to -10 permil). The results at 185 nm disagree in magnitude and sign with the very large positive MIF signature previously reported, and provides support for the theoretical cross sections. Photochemical simulations of the experiments are in progress to test the possibility that the negative MIF in O2 results from O3 formation. Incorporation of these results into Mars atmosphere photochemical models is in progress. We anticipate isotopic O2 predictions that will be testable by MSL SAM.",

            "abstract": "The Cordillera Banca Detachment (CBD) in the north-central Peruvian Andes is recognized as a rare example of active extension parallel to the direction of shortening within a convergent orogenic setting. Despite longstanding interest in the geodynamic significance of the CBD relatively little work has been done to characterize the basic geometry, kinematics and evolution of the detachment or the petrology and distribution of brittle and ductile tectonites within the fault zone. This contribution presents preliminary results of a basic structural analysis of the CBD based on field observations, laboratory results, and GIS analysis. Basic structural observations of fault geometry and kinematics are needed to constrain the regional geodynamic role of the CBD.\nThe NNW topographic trace of the CBD is defined by faceted ridges up to 2000 m in height. The lower slopes of the facets are locally cut by steep fault scarps that offset quaternary glacial moraines, debris fans and colluvium. The shear zone comprises both brittle and ductile tectonites including mylonite series rocks, pseudotachylyte, and breccia – often highly silicified. Highly polished mirrored surfaces are observed locally. Deformation mechanisms show a consistent progression from plastic in structurally lower positions to brittle in structurally higher positions. Evidence for overprinting deformation mechanisms is preserved in many samples. The shear zone ranges up to about 200 m thick. The average orientation of mylonitic foliation and fault slip surfaces (strike/dip = 140/30) and lineations/slickenlines (plunge-trend = 35-235) is quite consistent along the ~200 km detachment, but some systematic variation along strike may be related to concave fault segments or corrugations. Slip indicators are nearly down-dip with a minor left-lateral or right-lateral component in some locations. Offsets in marker horizons constrain total offset between about 4500 m near the central section of the fault to near zero approaching the fault tips. Structural observations are consistent with a long history of displacement across the CBD resulting in the progressive exhumation of deep rocks under relatively constant tectonic conditions.",

This study focuses on spatially continuous multifrequency electro-magnetic (EM) data for near subsurface characterization. Recent advances in EM data processing allow for efficient inversion of multi-frequency data, utilization of calibration routines and additional constrains for better subsurface imaging. For this work the newly developed FEMIC (Frequency-Domain Electromagnetic Inversion Code) code was used to invert the EM data. High resolution electrical resistivity (ER) data were used to calibrate the EM process; additionally, available data from ground penetrating radar (GPR) and field observations were used to better constrain the inversions.\nThe multistep EM processing allowed for improving characterization of the subsurface over long (i.e. Km scale) 2D transects. The aim of this work was to better understand the lateral extent of the bedrock-regolith interface in the Rio Icacos watershed of the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO), while providing evidence for changes in regolith thickness as related to proximity to the nickpoint. This research highlights the advantages of geophysical methods for critical zone studies and their potential for improving spatial characterization of the subsurface at multiples scales. Furthermore it shows the potential of EM methods for translating high resolution spatially limited point measurements (e.g. boreholes) to large (km) scales. ",

            "abstract": "Since its departure from the plains of Aeolis Palus, the Curiosity rover has traversed through a number of new geologic units at the base of Mount Sharp in Gale crater. These have included both units inferred to comprise the lower strata of Mount Sharp itself, along with units that appear to superpose Mount Sharp. Over the last 100 sols, Curiosity has documented several occurrences of a stratigraphic contact between fine-grained mudstones of the Murray Formation, and coarser sandstones of the overlying Stimson Unit. Detailed mapping from both orbital and rover image and topographic data suggests an unconformable relationship between the two units. From orbit, inferred exposures of the unconformity span at least several tens of meters, climbing up the lowermost slopes of Mount Sharp. Although the absolute timing of the two units is poorly constrained, this unconformity between likely represents a geologically significant gap in time. Deposition of the overlying Stimson Unit is inferred to post-date the large-scale erosion of Mount Sharp, likely requiring late stage aqueous interaction in the lithification of the Stimson Unit.\nFrom the rover, stereo imaging reveals the small-scale topography preserved at the Murray-Stimson contact, and allows the determination of bedding geometries within the units. Where laminations are expressed, the basal Mount Sharp rocks exhibit planar stratification at low angles to horizontal. In contrast, the coarser-grained Stimson Unit exhibits large-scale cross stratification. Three dimensional bedding geometry within this unit indicates a predominant southward transport direction uphill towards Mount Sharp. The observation of rounded calcium sulfate clasts in the lowermost Stimson Unit, interpreted to be reworked veins from the underlying Murray formation, supports the interpretation of an erosional unconformity. Investigations at the boundary between these two distinct units present a unique opportunity to probe the long-term environmental history of the Gale crater basin.",

            "abstract": "Coral and sclerosponge skeletons provide long time-series of ocean DIC D14C values, a tracer of oceanic circulation, effectively extending the observational record back in time. Here, we present new coral and sclerosponge D14C records from the Atlantic that provide useful constraints on the dynamics of the subtropical cells (STCs). The STCs are shallow meridional wind-driven circulations that transport heat and water masses from the subtropics to the tropics. We use a coral from the Cape Verde Islands and a sclerosponge from the Bahamas to investigate the circulation patterns of the off-equatorial upwelling regions of STCs, which are not well understood. We find an abrupt change in bomb curve of the Cape Verde record that is related to ventilation rate of the STC, and we use these data to show that the strength of the northern STC was likely constant through the latter half of the 20th century. Finally, we present the first 14C record of equatorial upwelling in the Atlantic using a coral from Principe Island in the Gulf of Guinea. We find that the water that upwells in the equator has a 14C signature that is markedly different than the water that is brought to the surface in the off-equatorial sites, suggesting that the northern and southern STCs interior pathways are not well connected in the Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "Recent analysis of the Vaisala global lightning data set GLD360 suggests that oceanic lightning tends to exhibit larger peak currents than continental lightning (lightning occurring over land). The GLD360 peak current measurement is derived from distant measurements of the electromagnetic fields emanated during the lightning flash. Because the GLD360 peak current measurement is a derived quantity, it is not clear whether the actual peak currents of oceanic lightning tend to be larger, or whether the resulting electromagnetic field strengths tend to be larger. In this paper, we present simulations of VLF signal propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide to demonstrate that the peak field values for oceanic lightning can be significantly stronger than for continental lightning. Modeling simulations are performed using the Long Wave Propagation Capability (LWPC) code to directly evaluate the effect of ground conductivity on VLF signal propagation in the 5-15 kHz band. LWPC is an inherently narrowband propagation code that has been modified to predict the broadband response of the Earth-Ionosphere waveguide to an impulsive lightning flash while preserving the ability of LWPC to account for an inhomogeneous waveguide. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of return stroke speed on these results.",

The gross moist stability (GMS), which represents MSE export efficiency by large-scale circulations associated with the convection, is studied, together with two relevant quantities, critical GMS (a ratio of diabatic forcing to the convective intensity) and drying efficiency (a version of the effective GMS; GMS minus critical GMS), which we coined. We show that convection over the tropical ocean intensifies/decays via negative/positive drying efficiency (or effective GMS). We propose a new composite method which is taken on values of the drying efficiency, and illustrate that that composite method is particularly useful for diagnosing convective amplification/decay. The proposed composite space provides us with a new interpretation of convective life-cycles with high frequencies (on a-couple-day time-scales), and furthermore, clarifies the relationship between the GMS of slowly changing, large-scale phenomena and the vertical motion profiles of higher-frequency convective disturbances (such as mesoscale convective systems and tropical waves). We also analyze the ERA-Interim dataset to compare the results from the satellite-based products and the re-analysis datasets.",

            "abstract": "The Lagonegro Basin was part of the southwestern branch of the western Tethys, an actively spreading young ocean during the Late Triassic (Ciarapica and Passeri, 2002, 2005). The sedimentary environment was a deepening-upward basin, bordered to the north by the Apenninic and Apulian carbonate platforms. Paleoseismic activity is evidenced by frequent debris flows on the basin margins (Passeri et al., 2005). The Lagonegro succession is characterized by Permian to Miocene formations deposited in shallow to deep basinal environments. The Upper Triassic is comprised of deep-marine sediments belonging to the Calcari con Selce (“Cherty Limestone”) Formation of late Ladinian to late Norian-early Rhaetian age and the Scisti Silicei (“Siliceous Shale”) Formation of late Norian-early Rhaetian to Late Jurassic age. The “Transitional Interval” between these two formations is gradational over a 20- to 40-m interval (Miconnet, 1983).\nThe Transitional Interval was investigated in three sections (Pignola-Abriola, Monte Volturino, and Madonna del Sirino) in the Southern Apennines (southern Italy), representing a proximal-to-distal transect across the Lagonegro Basin. The transition from mainly calcareous to mainly siliceous sedimentation may have been influenced by rapid, post-rift subsidence of the Lagonegro Basin. It also coincided with a shift to warmer or more humid conditions around the Norian/Rhaetian boundary, as reflected in a pronounced increase in the chemical index of alteration (CIA), a weathering proxy (Young and Nesbitt, 1998). Redox proxies indicate mainly oxic conditions in the deep basin, although organic-rich shale beds are present at multiple levels in the otherwise organic-poor succession. The abruptness of the transitions between organic-poor and –rich sediment layers suggests major changes in paleoceanographic conditions, possibly related to switches from lagoonal circulation (linked to a net negative water balance) to estuarine circulation (linked to a net positive water balance). We infer that the Transitional Interval was related primarily to climate-driven hydrographic changes within the Lagonegro Basin.",

Recurrent isolation and connection of the islands to mainland Asia due to sea level fluctuations has enabled repeated biotic migrations and encouraged genetic speciation. These migration waves also brought Homo erectus to Java. Together with extensive and well-documented collections of other terrestrial species, these hominin fossils form faunal assemblages of which the paleoenvironmental and paleogeographical background is poorly known.\nUsing carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopes, we have reconstructed the paleoenvironmental and paleoecological conditions of several Holocene and Pleistocene fossil sites on Sumatra and Java, Indonesia. Carbon (∂13C) and oxygen (∂18O) isotope analysis of well-preserved herbivore teeth enamel reveals a marked contrast between C3-dominated diets in warmer periods, and C4-dominated diets in cooler periods, reflecting the distinct changes in Sundaland vegetation cover between glacials and interglacials. These isotope patterns allow us to assign the appropriate climatic background to some of the older fossil assemblages from Java, for which dating uncertainty does not allow direct assignment to glacial or interglacial conditions. The stable isotope signatures of herbivores from Trinil and Sangiran, sites well-known for the fossil occurrence of Homo erectus, indicate glacial conditions. The isotope data of several H. erectus fossils from these sites seem to be in line with such an interpretation.\nFurthermore, we applied strontium (87Sr/86Sr) isotope analyses to a sample subset. The preliminary data show distinct Sr-isotope ratios for different sites, providing clues for the applicability of this isotope technique in detecting climate-related mobility of Sundaland fossil faunas.",

            "abstract": "Porphyry Cu (Mo-Au) and epithermal Au-Ag ores are globally associated with shallow hydrous, strongly oxidized, and sulfur-rich arc intrusions. In many localities, long-lived magmatism includes evolution from early andesitic volcanic (v) and plutonic (p) rocks to later dacitic or rhyolitic compositions dominated by plutons.\nWe compare zircon compositions from three igneous suites with different time spans: Yerington, USA (1 m.y., p>v), El Salvador, Chile (4 m.y., p>v), and Yanacocha, Peru (6 m.y., v>p). At Yerington granite dikes and ores formed in one event, at ES in 2 to 3 events spanning 3 m.y., and at Yanacocha in 6 events spanning 5 m.y. At both ES and Yanacocha, high-Al amphiboles likely crystallized at high temperature in the mid-crust and attest to deep magmas that periodically recharged the shallow chambers. At Yanacocha, these amphiboles contain anhydrite inclusions that require magmas were sulfur-rich and strongly oxidized (~NNO+2).\nThe Ti-in-zircon geothermometer provides estimates of 920º to 620º C for zircon crystallization, and records both core to rim cooling and locally high temperature rim overgrowths. Ore-related silicic porphyries yield near-solidus crystallization temperatures of 750-650°C consistent with low zircon saturation temperatures. The latter zircons have large positive Ce/Ce* and small negative Eu/Eu*≥0.4 anomalies attesting to strongly oxidized conditions (Ballard et al., 2001), which we propose result from crystallization and SO2 loss to the magmatic-hydrothermal ore fluid (Dilles et al., 2015). The Hf, REE, Y, U, and Th contents of zircons are diverse in the magma suites, and Th/U vs Yb/Gd plots suggest a dominant role of crystal fractionation with lesser roles for both crustal contamination and mixing with high temperature deep-sourced mafic magma. Ce/Sm vs Yb/Gd plots suggest that magma REE contents at <900°C are dominated by early crystallization of hornblende and apatite, and late crystallization (~<780°C) of titanite. Magma mixing and crustal contamination are most evident in pre-ore magmas, whereas ore-forming intrusions at low temperatures are dominated by crystal fractionation. Thus, zircon provides evidence for cyclic crystallization and mafic recharge that enrich late silicic melts in incompatible ore components water, sulfur, chlorine and metals.",

            "abstract": "The increased vulnerability of deltaic communities to coastal flooding as a result of upstream engineering has been acknowledged for decades. What has received less attention is the sensitivity of deltas to the interactions between river basin modifications and local scale cultivation and irrigation. Combined with reduced river and sediment discharge, soil and water management practices in coastal areas may exacerbate the risk of tidal flooding, erosion of arable land, and salinization of soils and groundwater associated with sea level rise. This represents a cruel irony to smallholder subsistence farmers whose priorities are food, water and economic security, rather than sustainability of the environment. Such issues challenge disciplinary approaches and require integrated social-biophysical models able to understand and diagnose these complex relationships. This study applies a new conceptual framework to define the relevant social and physical units operating on the common pool resources of climate, water and sediment in the Bengal Delta (Bangladesh). The new framework will inform development of a nested geospatial analysis and a coupled model to identify multi-scale social-biophysical feedbacks associated with smallholder soil and water management practices, coastal dynamics, basin modification, and climate vulnerability in tropical deltas. The framework was used to create household surveys for collecting data on climate perceptions, land and water management, and governance. Test surveys were administered to rural farmers in 14 villages during a reconnaissance visit to coastal Bangladesh. Initial results demonstrate complexity and heterogeneity at the local scale in both biophysical conditions and decision-making. More importantly, the results illuminate how national and geopolitical-level policies scale down to impact local-level environmental and social stability in communities already vulnerable to coastal flooding. Here, we will discuss components of the new conceptual framework, present results from the test surveys, and demonstrate how the framework can be dynamically adapted to reflect complex interactions at multiple scales.",

The coastal population density has dramatically increased over the past 20 years, putting more people at risk. Informing emergency managers, decision-makers and the public about the potential for wind driven storm surge, however, has been extremely difficult. Recently, the Storm Surge Unit at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida has developed a prototype experimental storm surge watch/warning graphic to help communicate this threat more effectively by identifying areas most at risk for life-threatening storm surge. This prototype is the initial step in the transition toward a NWS storm surge watch/warning system and highlights the inundation levels that have a 10% chance of being exceeded. The guidance for this product is the Probabilistic Hurricane Storm Surge (P-Surge) model, which predicts the probability of various storm surge heights by statistically evaluating numerous SLOSH model simulations. Questions remain, however, if exceedance values in addition to the 10% may be of equal importance to forecasters. P-Surge data from 2014 Hurricane Arthur is used to ascertain the practicality of incorporating other exceedance data into storm surge forecasts. Extracting forecast uncertainty information through analyzing P-surge exceedances overlaid with track and wind intensity forecasts proves to be beneficial for forecasters and decision support.",

In the study area of southeastern Sweden sediment stratigraphic investigations were used to identify and define the vertical extent of two Baltic Sea transgressive events. In-between these geographically spread study areas, the paleo-shorelines of these transgressive stages were mapped at places they were distinct, well developed and believed to be closely related to paleo sea level. The main factors determining formation of distinct shore-lines is exposure to the open sea and ample supply of erodible coarse grained minerogenic material.\nThe paleo-shorelines were traced and their absolute elevation established with the help of detailed LIDAR based shaded digital terrain models. These models were derived from the detailed LIDAR point cloud recently made available by the National Land Survey of Sweden. Additionally the paleo-shorelines were confirmed during field visits and details such as sedimentary composition were noted. One of the more difficult variable to determine, the paleo-sea level stand in relation to the shoreline were accessed also in field and related ground surfaces without tree canopies were GPS mapped. The absolute paleo sea level was later derived from the LIDAR ground surface model for these spots.\nThe c. 6ka shoreline, which is not fully synchronous throughout the whole study area, shows a rather smooth rise from c. 7 m a.s.l. in the south to more than 30 m a.s.l. in the north. Comparison between the 6 ka and the 10.5 ka paleo-shoreline, formed in the Ancylus Lake, further emphasize the glacioisostatic imprint of the Scandinavian ice sheet, but also reveals uplift irregularities, probably of neo tectonic origin.",

As the wildland fire problem evolved so did the public response through a wildland fire management policy guided by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management understanding of the problem. Globally it is estimated that more 350 million hectares of wildland burn annually. They oxidize approximately 3-8% of the total terrestrial net primary productivity. The economic and physical relevance of wildland fire management and protection programs is ever growing, particularly considering mounting wildfire costs and losses globally. In the US alone, from 2000 to 2013 more than 37 million hectares of wildland has been affected at a cost of over $21 billion. The increase in siege-like fires can be explained in part by increasing population, particularly in the wildland-urban interface and the accumulation of biomass fuel due to over a century of fire exclusion. Recent developments demonstrate a strong relationship between fire and weather and climate variations. \nHow the wildland fire management policy has evolved through time? The development can be divided in three stages: the formative years between 1905 and 1911; the consolidation years from 1911 through 1968; and the modern era from 1995 to present. Each stage is characterized by a series of significant events that caused changes on how the problem was approached. For example, the establishment of the Forest Service in 1905 and the rash of large wildfires in the western USA set the base for the wildfire suppression of all wildfires in 1911. During the second stage we see the 1935 policy of suppressing all wildfires by 10-am next-day. By 1968 the policy has evolved to include the use of prescribed burning and the elimination of the 10-am next-day policy. In the modern era, by 1995 the wildland fire management policy changed to require the use of economic efficiency analysis in fire suppression actions. The recently passed FLAME Act and establishment of the FS Cohesive Strategy have been in response to increases in the wildland-urban interface problem and climate change challenges.",

            "abstract": "Chemistry-climate models robustly predict increases in the large-scale stratospheric circulation and stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) in response to increasing greenhouse gases. Our previous work has shown that current variability in the stratospheric circulation and stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux driven by a combination of El Niño /Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) provides a “natural experiment” that may reduce uncertainties in predictions of the tropospheric ozone response to future changes in stratospheric transport. Using six years of measurements from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) onboard NASA’s Aura satellite, we found that interannual variability in the stratospheric circulation of ~±40% leads to changes of ~±2% in northern midlatitude tropospheric ozone (equaling ~1/2 the total observed interannual variability). Here, we further explore the relationship between the stratospheric circulation and tropospheric ozone variability using two models: the Whole Atmosphere Chemistry-Climate Model (WACCM) and the GEOS-Chem chemistry-transport model (CTM). With the WACCM model, we further explore and untangle the roles of ENSO and the QBO in driving circulation changes and examine small but important differences in the response of the residual vertical velocity and the transport velocity (as measured by the water vapor tape recorder) to these cycles. We also diagnose large differences in the relationship between stratospheric and tropospheric ozone in the specified dynamics and free-running versions of WACCM. With the GEOS-Chem CTM, we use a 30-year simulation to examine the stability of our satellite-derived diagnostics over longer time periods and their sensitivity to changes in meteorology and emissions. We also apply our diagnostics to a 6-year joint 3Dvar assimilation of TES and MLS observations in GEOS-Chem and examine whether the assimilation provides additional constraints on the stratospheric contribution to tropospheric ozone.",

            "abstract": "Although large-scale in situ soil moisture monitoring networks are becoming increasingly valuable research tools, deficiencies of many existing networks include the small spatial support of each station, the low spatial density of stations, and the almost exclusive deployment of stations in grassland vegetation. These grassland soil moisture observations may not adequately represent the real soil moisture patterns in landscapes with intermixed land cover types. The objectives of this study were i) to compare root-zone soil moisture dynamics of two dominant vegetation types across Oklahoma, grassland (observed) and winter wheat cropland (simulated); ii) to relate the soil moisture dynamics of grassland and cropland vegetation using an artificial neural network (ANN) as a transfer function; and iii) to use the resulting ANN to estimate the soil moisture spatial patterns for a landscape of intermixed grassland and wheat cropland. Root-zone soil moisture was represented by plant available water (PAW) in the top 0.8 m of the soil profile. PAW under grassland was calculated from 18 years of soil moisture observations at 78 stations of the Oklahoma Mesonet, whereas PAW under winter wheat was simulated for the same 78 locations using a soil water balance model. Then, we trained an ANN to reproduce the simulated PAW under winter wheat using only seven inputs: day of the year, latitude and longitude, measured PAW under grassland, and percent sand, silt, and clay. The resulting ANN was used, along with grassland soil moisture observations, to estimate the detailed soil moisture pattern for a 9x9 km2 Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) grid cell. The seasonal dynamics of root-zone PAW for grassland and winter wheat were strongly asynchronous, so grassland soil moisture observations rarely reflect cropland soil moisture conditions in the region. The simple ANN approach facilitated efficient and accurate prediction of the simulated PAW under winter wheat, RMSE = 24 mm, using observed PAW under grassland as an input. This promising new approach for estimating soil moisture under adjacent, contrasting land covers at a relatively low computational cost may significantly enhance the scientific and societal value of existing large-scale monitoring networks.",

            "abstract": "Regulating ammonia atmospheric abundances is important for reducing particle emissions of PM2.5 and PM10. A recent study employing three chemical transport models found an underestimation of the formation of ammonium particles, and concluded that the role of NH3 on particulate matter is larger than originally thought.\nMonitoring of NH3, on a large scale, is often carried out using low-cost diffusive samplers, active sampling with denuders, and a number of optical spectroscopic techniques. Although denuders are currently considered to be an unofficial “reference method”, they suffer from a few limitations, including low accuracy. They also do not provide rapid measurements in real-time, require complex post-exposure analysis by wet chemical techniques, and must be deployed over extended periods of up to one month to achieve the required sensitivity. These devices deliver only average concentration data, and their validation by traceable methods is not presently extensive.\nCavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) is a rapid on-line monitoring technique, which has regularly been employed for trace gas measurements, including that of dry ammonia gas mixtures. One of the goals of this work is, therefore, to extend the technology to enable more accurate ambient measurements of NH3 to be made in the field where the sampled atmosphere contains a wide range of concentrations and is also humid. We describe the implementation of this by adjustment of the CRDS instrument for the undesirable effects of cross interference due to water vapor (H2O). Water vapor influences such spectroscopic measurements through the presence of absorption features close to that of ammonia and through differences in matrix broadening effects. We also detail the establishment of metrological traceability of the measurements via new stable NH3 Primary Standard Gas Mixtures (PSMs), prepared by gravimetry, and subsequent dilution to typical ambient concentrations (parts per billion).",

NASA’s ocean salinity missions, that include Aquarius/SAC-D and the SPURS (Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study) field campaign, illustrate the value of integrated observations in support of studies on ocean circulation, the water cycle, and climate. However, the inherent heterogeneity of resulting data and the disparate, distributed systems that serve them complicates their effective utilization for both earth science research and applications. Key technical interoperability challenges include adherence to metadata and data format standards that are particularly acute for in-situ data and the lack of a unified metadata model facilitating archival and integration of both satellite and oceanographic field datasets. Here we report on efforts at the PO.DAAC, NASA’s physical oceanographic data center, to extend our data management and distribution support capabilities for field campaign datasets such as those from SPURS. We also discuss value-added services, based on the integration of satellite and in-situ datasets, which are under development with a particular focus on DOMS. The distributed oceanographic matchup service (DOMS) implements a portable technical infrastructure and associated web services that will be broadly accessible via the PO.DAAC for the dynamic collocation of satellite and in-situ data, hosted by distributed data providers, in support of mission cal/val, science and operational applications.",

ISCE is both a modular, flexible, and extensible framework for building software components and applications as well as a toolbox of applications for processing raw or focused InSAR and Polarimetric InSAR data. The ISCE framework contains object-oriented Python components layered to construct Python InSAR components that manage legacy Fortran/C InSAR programs. Components are independently configurable in a layered manner to provide maximum control. Polymorphism is used to define a workflow in terms of abstract facilities for each processing step that are realized by specific components at run-time. This enables a single workflow to work on either raw or focused data from all sensors. ISCE can serve as the core of a production center to process Level-0 radar data to Level-3 products, but is amenable to interactive processing approaches that allow scientists to experiment with data to explore new ways of doing science with InSAR data. The NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) Mission will deliver data of unprecedented quantity and quality, making possible global-scale studies in climate research, natural hazards, and Earth's ecosystems. ISCE is planned as the foundational element in processing NISAR data, enabling a new class of analyses that take greater advantage of the long time and large spatial scales of these new data. NISAR will be but one mission in a constellation of radar satellites in the future delivering such data. ISCE currently supports all publicly available strip map mode space-borne SAR data since ERS and is expected to include support for upcoming missions. ISCE has been incorporated into two prototype cloud-based systems that have demonstrated its elasticity in addressing larger data processing problems in a \"production\" context and its ability to be controlled by individual science users on the cloud for large data problems. ISCE has been downloaded by over 200 users by a license for WinSAR members through the Unavco.org website. Others may apply directly to JPL for a license at download.jpl.nasa.gov.",

            "abstract": "Many unconventional reservoir lithologies are comprised of pore regimes ranging from relatively uncommon large macropores at the millimeter scale to more numerous small micropores at the sub-micron and nanometer scale. The size, distribution and connectivity of these confined geometries, the chemistry of the solid, the chemistry of the fluids and their physical properties collectively dictate how fluids migrate into and through these micro- and nano-environments, wet and ultimately react with the solid surfaces. Our current understanding of the rates and mechanisms of fluid and mass transport and interaction within these multiporosity systems at the molecular scale is far less robust than we would like.\nThis presentation will take a two-fold approach to this topic area. First we will provide a brief overview on pore types and their relationship with mineralogy in key gas shale formations with special emphasis on the Utica/Pt. Pleasant and Eagle Ford. We will highlight results from conventional methods such as SEM along with more sophisticated approaches including small- and ultra-small angle neutron scattering that contribute to two key science question areas: (a) What are the size, distribution, connectedness, and contribution to total porosity of nano- to micropores in representative gas shales? and (b) How do these pore features vary with the distributions of clay and carbonate matrix and organic matter? The second more in-depth part of the presentation will focus the application of state-of-the-art experimental, analytical and computational tools to assess key features of the fluid-matrix interaction relevant to shale settings. The multidisciplinary approaches highlighted will include neutron scattering and NMR experiments, thermodynamic measurements and molecular-level simulations to quantitatively assess molecular properties of pure water, aqueous electrolytes and simple immiscible water-hydrocarbon mixtures confined to well-characterized porous media, subjected to temperatures and pressures relevant to subsurface energy systems. These studies conducted in concert are beginning to provide a fundamental understanding at the molecular level of how intrinsically different C-O-H fluids behave in confined geometries compared to bulk systems.",

While the National Weather Service\nAlaska Region (NWS-AR) forecasts conditions favorable for coastal flooding, an improvement\ncan be made in communicating event impacts between NWS-AR and local residents. Scientific\njargon used by NWS-AR to indicate the severity of flooding potential is often misconstrued by\nresidents. Additionally, the coastal flood forecasting process is cumbersome and time\nconsuming due to scattered sources of flood guidance. To alleviate these problems, a single\ncoastal flooding decision support tool was created for the Fairbanks Weather Forecast Office to\nhelp bridge the communication gap, streamline the forecast and warning process, and take into\naccount both the meteorological and socioeconomic systems at work during a flood event. This\ntool builds on previous research and data collected by the Alaska Division of Geological and\nGeophysical Surveys (DGGS) and the NWS-AR, using high resolution elevation data to model\nthe impacts of storm tide rise above the mean lower low water level on five of the most at-risk\ncommunities along the Alaskan coast. Important local buildings and infrastructure are\nhighlighted, allowing forecasters to relate the severity of the storm tide in terms of local\nlandmarks that are familiar to residents. In this way, this decision support tool allows for a\nconversion from model output storm tide levels into real world impacts that are easily understood\nby forecasters, emergency managers, and other stakeholders, helping to build a Weather-Ready\nNation. An overview of the new coastal flood decision support tool in NWS-AR forecast\noperations will be discussed.\nKEYWORDS\nForecasting; coastal flooding; coastal hazards; decision support",

Three clusters were generated and corresponded to three trophic levels that were manifested by three pH levels (3.5, 4.5, and 5). Hg methylation activity in laboratory incubations was determined using the short-lived radioisotope 197Hg. In the low pH, Sphagnum-dominated cluster, methylation rates were less than 1% day-1 and likely conducted by primary fermenters. Conversely, the high pH trophic cluster dominated by Carex aquatilis and active syntrophy exhibited Hg methylation rates as high as 12% day-1. In intermediate sites, rich in Sphagnum magellanicum with less Carex, a gradient in syntrophy and Hg methylation paths was observed. Amendments with process-stimulators and inhibitors revealed no evidence of SO42- reduction, but suggested that SRB, metabolizing either syntrophically with methanogens and/or by fermentation, likely methylated Hg. While on going metatranscriptomics studies are required to verify the role of syntrophs, fermenters, and methanogens as methylators, these results revealed that Hg methylation pathways change greatly along trophic gradients with a dominance of respiratory pathways in mineral-rich sites, syntrophy dominance in intermediate sites, and fermentation dominance in nutrient-poor sites.",

            "abstract": "For two decades, nadir altimetry mission measurements have been used to derive water elevation over rivers. It has been proven to be a powerful tool to estimate water elevation over big rivers (> 500 m), providing useful complementary data to in-situ gage networks. More recently, nadir altimetry data have been used successfully for some smaller rivers. It is therefore needed to assess potential errors from these measurements for these kind of river, using a well gaged basin.\nThat's why we have investigated water elevations estimates from three altimetry missions (ENVISAT, Jason-2 and SARAL) over the Garonne River (South West of France). River width at studied river goes from 160 to 230 m.\nBy comparison to nearby in-situ gages (IG), it has been shown that measurements from ENVISAT and Jason-2 virtual stations (VS) 100 km upstream of the estuary have errors between 20 to 70 cm for water anomaly, whereas most of the bias comes from river slope between IG and VS. 160 km upstream, the few usable ENVISAT VS have errors spanning from 80 to 160 cm.\nSARAL/AltiKa however, does not provide any water elevation information: there are rather no data in the record or measurements have huge bias with no correlation with water level variations. This is mainly due to high reliefs surrounding the river valley (up to 100 m difference between the valley and the top of the hills over few 10 km). SARAL/AlitKa, compared to previous instruments, has higher pulse bandwidth which results in a smaller range detection window of 30 m. It allows a higher vertical accuracy, but causes loss of data or to be 'locked' on the top of the hill even when it flies over the river valley, when there are important soil elevation variation over 'short' distance. This fact could also be observed for some Jason-2 and ENVISAT VS but to a much lower extent.\nBesides, water elevations time series has high frequencies due to local and upstream precipitation events. Therefore, it is more difficult to discriminate only from the VS measurements themselves if time series are physically coherent, contrarily to big rivers for which an annual cycle helps to identify usable VS. This is especially true for ENVISAT data, which has 35 days revisit period, which is not well suited for following dynamic of such kind of rivers.",

            "abstract": "The Nubia plate is normally considered to be a rigid plate and as such used in the realization of terrestrial reference frame. Gondwana breakup plate reconstruction, the Cameroon volcanic line, seismicity, and the morphology of the Okavango rift zone (ORZ) suggest the presence of internal deformation within the Nubia plate. To test this hypothesis, six different reference frames were developed from the velocity field of three individual regions (West, Central and South), and of different combinations of them (West+Central, South+Central, and Nubia as a whole). The residual velocities with respect to these references frame help us understand the presence of the relative motion between the different regions thus the stability of the plate.\nTo realize the reference frames, all the publicly available GPS data within the “stable” Nubia plate was processed.\nGiven the small relative velocity, it is important to eliminate eventual biases in the analysis and to have good estimates of uncertainty of the observed velocities. For this reason, velocities were analyzed, and rate uncertainties computed using the Allan variance of rate (AVR) technique, accounting for colored noise.\nAlthough geological and geophysical studies indicate the possibility of internal deformation within Nubia, the results of this study shows that the current GPS network is not capable to identify intraplate deformation and within uncertainties Nubia is a single plate. As final note, both the color of the noise and the amplitude of the annual signal of each time series as function of latitude and climatic region were analyzed. The study shows that the noise is approximately flicker for all the good stations independently of the location. On the contrary, the amplitude of the annual signal is strongly dependent on the climate of the regions.",

            "abstract": "Although temperate rainforests of the North American Pacific Coast contain a small proportion of the world’s forests, they contain some of the highest densities of biomass of any terrestrial system, and they store large quantities of carbon in soil. Understanding the residence time of organic carbon in these watersheds is of ecological significance. Given that rivers can mobilize sediment (and associated carbon) from across the catchment, carefully deciphering the organic signatures found within riverine particles can be a powerful tool to inform our understanding of carbon cycling catchment-wide. Here we examine the lignin phenol content (lignin is a biomarker unique to vascular plants) and the radiocarbon age (Δ14C) of fine particulate organic carbon (FPOC) exported by the Queets River of Washington State’s Olympic Peninsula over the course of one year, targeting winter storm events. This mountainous catchment is one of the largest and most pristine found on the Olympic Peninsula. The Δ14C of FPOC was quantified for each of the twelve sampling events, whereas the Δ14C of the individual lignin phenols was determined during a late-winter storm event. Sediments were enriched in lignin phenols at the end of the summer dry season and into the first storm of the fall, suggesting that surface soils were transported early on. The Δ14C of individual lignin phenols ranged from -161 to 26‰, with biomarkers for non-woody vegetation being most depleted. These results suggest that particulate lignin exported from temperate catchments is considerably aged, especially relative to the tropics. These findings are consistent with cool temperatures and abundant moisture limiting microbial decomposition, increasing the residence time of plant-derived organic carbon in temperate rainforests. We will compare the Δ14C content of lignin phenols to that of bulk organic matter to partition riverine FPOC amongst possible organic matter sources.",

HySEA implements a multi-GPU version that can compute in several minutes the maximum amplitude and arrival time of the main tsunami wave in about 17,000 selected locations along the Mediterranean. At the same time, HySEA is implemented in nested meshes with different resolution and multi-GPU environment, which allows much faster than real time (below few minutes) inundation simulations. The performances of the code allows as well the preparation of a huge number of different pre-calculated scenarios that are being used for PTHA and for warning applications.\nAcknowledgements.

            "abstract": "Non-indigenous rocks (meteorites) found on Mars by rover science teams offer insights into probable recent (mid- to late-Amazonian) weathering processes within 15° of the martian equator. While source materials are often in question for indigenous martian alteration scenarios, the starting materials for most meteorites are known as unweathered, curated falls in Earth-based collections. Both chemical and mechanical weathering processes have modified at least 21 confirmed and candidate exogenic rocks found at three rover landing sites. Such processes have been shown to include acidic corrosion, oxide production, and aeolian scouring. The unknown martian surface exposure duration of the meteorites makes separating physical from chemical weathering effects challenging: Saltating sand grains may accomplish alone what oxidation and rust removal by aeolian scouring may accomplish in a shorter time interval, for example. However, aeolian abrasion appears to dominate for at least some of the surface features in martian irons. Iron meteorites are resistant to wind-blown sand relative to silicate rocks, but are malleable and able to preserve aeolian abrasion effects. These include 1) regmaglypts enlarged into hollows with overhanging cornices; 2) surfaces scalloped or deeply fluted by straight-line groves, and/or 3) deep ‘boreholes’ present across many surfaces.\nThe flutings, boreholes, and scallops have oriented symmetry and are therefore potentially useful as paleo-wind direction indicators. Boreholes tend to be clean-edged, elliptical to round, of varying diameter, and often occur independently of local topography. Ventifacted igneous rocks found at Garnet Hill, San Gorgonio Pass, California, present features that resemble many aspects of those found in the metal masses on Mars. Though of different petrologies and mineralogies, both rock types are massive, homogeneous and unfractured, which may conceivably account for some apparent similarities in mechanical weathering behavior. For example, flutings appear to be coalesced boreholes in cross section, which can be truncated locally, producing sharp-edged margins in both martian and terrestrial examples. Topographic visualization from meteorite stereo imagery are expected to enable quantitative comparison with analog morphologies.",

Initially, we inspect the potential interplanetary shock fronts at 1AU induced by an ICME transient in different regions over the leading edge. We performed a review of all interplanetary shocks detected by these missions in two time periods: 2007-2010 and the first five months of 2014, with the aim of finding ICME-driver shock detected in three or two different regions. In that survey, we find one clear event that fulfill the conditions: the ICME of April 12-14, 2014. For that event, we report some shock parameters, the profiles of the main physical features of the proton plasma, the radio emission and the electron beam spectra for both spacecraft of STEREO mission. We assert that the region downstream of the detected interplanetary shock corresponds to a turbulent and intense magnetic field region, where electron flux generate a radio emission that saturates the instrument. We conclude that the two detection, over the two regions of the shock front, probably are associated to different dynamical processes due to the particular interaction that take place there. Moreover, with the aim of studying the magnetic cloud structure associated to the April 12-14, 2014 ICME event, we evaluate a model of magnetic structure derived from force-free plasma configuration over a spherical symmetry knows as Spheromak structure in order to compare it with the real data. We produce artificial magnetic field profiles (magnetic field strength and its three components in RTN coordinate system) which was compared with the magnetic cloud detected. The results suggest a correlation between the model and STEREO-B, which detect the bulk structure. We conclude that the magnetic structure of this magnetic cloud has toroidal topology similar to a closed flux rope structure.",

In practice, selecting the best remedial strategy is challenging due to uncertainties associated with the microbiology (e.g., presence and activity of Dhc) and geochemical factors influencing Dhc activity. Extensive groundwater datasets collected over decades of monitoring exist, but have not been systematically analyzed. In the present study, geochemical and microbial data sets collected from 35 wells at 5 contaminated sites were used to develop a predictive empirical model using a machine learning algorithm (i) to rank the relative importance of parameters that affect in situ reductive dechlorination potential, and (ii) to provide recommendations for selecting the optimal remediation strategy at a specific site. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was applied, and a representative classification tree model was developed that allowed short-term prediction of dechlorination potential. Indirect indicators for low dissolved oxygen (e.g., low NO3-and NO2-, high Fe2+ and CH4) were the most influential factors for predicting dechlorination potential, followed by total organic carbon content (TOC) and Dhc cell abundance. These findings indicate that machine learning-based data mining techniques applied to groundwater monitoring data can lead to the development of predictive groundwater remediation models. A major need for improving the predictive capabilities of the data mining approach is a curated, up-to-date and comprehensive collection of groundwater monitoring data.",

However, these soil microbial communities are sensitive to changes in their environment. A better understanding of the response of soil microbial communities to global change may help to predict future soil microbial diversity, and assist in creating more comprehensive models of terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycles. This study examines the effects of four global change factors (increased temperature, increased variability in precipitation, nitrogen deposition, and CO2 enrichment) on soil microbial communities at the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment (JRGCE), a full-factorial global change manipulative experiment on three hectares of California grassland. While similar studies have examined the effects of global change on soil microbial communities, few have manipulated more factors or been longer in duration than the JRGCE, which began field treatments in 1998. We find that nitrogen deposition, CO2 enrichment, and increased variability in precipitation significantly affect the structure of both fungal and bacterial communities, and explain more of the variation in the community structures than do local soil chemistry or aboveground plant community. Fungal richness is correlated positively with soil nitrogen content and negatively with soil water content. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which associate closely with herbaceous plants’ roots and assist in nutrient uptake, decrease in both richness and relative abundance in elevated CO2 treatments.",

            "abstract": "The multi-branched plate boundary across Iceland is made up of divergent and oblique rifts, and transform zones, characterized by entwined extensional and transform tectonics. The Tjörnes Fracture Zone (TFZ), located on the coast and offshore Northern Iceland, is a complex transform linking the northern rift zone (NVZ) on land with the Kolbeinsey Ridge offshore. Extension across TFZ is partitioned across three N-S trending rift basins; Eyjafjarðaráll, Skjálfandadjúp (SB) and Öxarfjörður and three WNW-NW oriented seismic lineaments; the Grímsey Oblique Rift, Húsavík-Flatey Faults (HFFs) and Dalvík Lineament. We compile the tectonic framework of the TFZ ridge-transform from aerial photos, satellite images, multibeam bathymetry and high-resolution seismic reflection data (Chirp). The rift basins are made up of normal faults with vertical displacements of up to 50-60 m, and post-glacial sediments of variable thickness. The SB comprises N5°W obliquely trending, eastward dipping normal faults as well as N10°E striking, westward dipping faults oriented roughly perpendicular to the N104°E spreading direction, indicative of early stages of rifting. Correlation of Chirp reflection data and tephrachronology from a sediment core within SB reveal major rifting episodes between 10-12.1 kyrs BP activating the whole basin, followed by smaller-scale fault movements throughout Holocene. Onshore faults have the same orientations as those mapped offshore and provide a basis for the interpretation of the kinematics of the faults throughout the region. These include transform parallel right-lateral, strike-slip faults separating domains dominated by spreading parallel left-lateral bookshelf faults. Shearing is most prominent along the HFFs, a system of right-lateral strike-slip faults with vertical displacement up to 15 m. Vertical fault movements reflect increased tectonic activity during early postglacial time coinciding with isostatic rebound enhancing volcanism within Iceland.",

            "abstract": "Fugitive methane (CH4) leaks from oil and gas production fields are a potential significant source of atmospheric methane. US DOE’s ARPA-E MONITOR program is supporting research to locate and quantify fugitive methane leaks at natural gas facilities in order to achieve a 90% reduction in CH4 emissions. LANL, Aeris and Rice University are developing an LDS (leak detection system) that employs a compact laser absorption methane sensor and sonic anemometer coupled to an artificial neural network (ANN)-based source attribution algorithm. LANL’s large-eddy simulation model, HIGRAD, provides high-fidelity simulated wind fields and turbulent CH4 plume dispersion data for various scenarios used in training the ANN. Numerous inverse solution methodologies have been applied over the last decade to assessment of greenhouse gas emissions. ANN learning is well suited to problems in which the training and observed data are noisy, or correspond to complex sensor data as is typical of meteorological and sensor data over a site. ANNs have been shown to achieve higher accuracy with more efficiency than other inverse modeling approaches in studies at larger scales, in urban environments, over short time scales, and even at small spatial scales for efficient source localization of indoor airborne contaminants. Our ANN is intended to characterize fugitive leaks rapidly, given site-specific, real-time, wind and CH4 concentration time-series data at multiple sensor locations, leading to a minimum time-to-detection and providing a first order improvement with respect to overall minimization of methane loss. Initial studies with the ANN on a variety of source location, sensor location, and meteorological condition scenarios are presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Brown’s Creek rhyolite (BCR), ~70 km south of Boise, Idaho, erupted during a period of widespread rhyolitic volcanism in southwestern Idaho during the middle Miocene. However, the Brown’s Creek unit has several characteristics that are unusual relative to near contemporaneous units in the Central Snake Rive Plain (CSRP) and units in the Western Snake River Plain (WSRP). The BCR can contain up to 40% phenocrysts, with some feldspar and quartz crystals in excess of 2 cm in diameter. A proximal vent location is particularly well exposed in the BCR, and appears as an elongated topographic “dome” with pervasive, chaotic and steep flow banding, ramp structures, and breccias. Evidence of dome building activity is also represented by a matrix supported deposit of ash and poorly sorted, angular, rhyolite clasts up to boulder size; which crops out in a small area near the vent. The BCR is among numerous units in the CSRP and WSRP that show evidence of interaction with ancient Lake Idaho (e.g. silicification, opalized zones, pepperites, etc), but the unconformity with the sedimentary rocks of the lake and its feeder streams, is extremely well preserved in the Brown’s Creek rhyolite.\nGeochemically, the Brown’s Creek rhyolite shows greater compositional variation in comparison to other individual units in the region. This variation (e.g. Ba/Sr and Zr/Nb) may be a result of variable crystal cargo in hand samples, but could potentially represent a zoned magma body, which is also extremely rare in the CSRP or WSRP. A limited number of samples have trace element concentrations/ratios (e.g. Rb, U, and Th) that may indicate the presence of a second unit underlying the dominant outcrops of BCR, but Nb/Ta ratios are relatively invariant across the entire BCR suite; if there are two units in the BCR, their sources are the same or very similar.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s magnetic field is very old, with recent data now showing the field possibly extended back to 4.1 billion years ago (Tarduno et al., Science, 2015). Yet, based upon our current knowledge there are difficulties in sustained a core dynamo over most of Earth’s history. Moreover, recent estimates of thermal and electrical conductivity of liquid iron at core conditions from mineral physics experiments indicate that adiabatic heat flux is approximately 15 TW, nearly 3 times larger than previously thought, exacerbating difficulties for driving a core dynamo by convective core cooling alone throughout Earth history. A long-lived basal magma ocean in the lowermost mantle has been proposed to exist in the early Earth, surviving perhaps into the Archean. While the modern, solid lower mantle is an electromagnetic insulator, electrical conductivities of silicate melts are known to be higher, though as yet they are unconstrained for lowermost mantle conditions. Here we explore the geomagnetic consequences of a basal magma ocean layer for a range of possible electrical conductivities. For the highest electrical conductivities considered, we find a basal magma ocean could be a primary dynamo source region. This would suggest the proposed three magnetic eras observed in paleomagnetic data originate from distinct sources for dynamo generation: from 4.5-2.45 Ga within a basal magma ocean, from 2.25-0.4 Ga within a superadiabatically cooled liquid core, and from 0.4-present within a quasi-adiabatic core that includes a solidifying inner core. We have extended this work by developing a new code, Dynamantle, which is a model with an entropy-based approach, similar to those commonly used in core dynamics models. We present new results using this code to assess the conditions under which basal magma oceans can generate positive ohmic dissipation. This is more generally useful than just considering the early Earth, but also for many silicate exoplanets in which basal magma oceans are even more likely to exist.",

The student population is diverse in ethnicity, age and income; and the Colleges understand that they play a salient role in educating its students on the foreseen impacts of climate change. This presentation will discuss the key investment Alamo Colleges has adopted to incorporate sustainability and climate science into non-traditional classrooms.   The established courses that cover climate-related course material have historically had low enrollments. One of the most significant challenges is informing the student population of the value of this class both in their academic career and in their personal lives. By hosting these lessons in hands-on simulations and demonstrations that are accessible and understandable to students of any age, and pursuing any major, we have found an exciting way to teach all students about climate change and identify solutions. \nSan Antonio College (SAC) hosts the Bill R. Sinkin Eco Centro Community Center, completed in early 2014, that serves as an environmental hub for Alamo Colleges’ staff and students as well as the San Antonio community. The center actively engages staff and faculty during training days in sustainability by presenting information on Eco Centro, personal sustainability habits, and inviting faculty to bring their classes for a tour and sustainability primer for students. The Centro has hosted professors from diverse disciplines that include Architecture, Psychology, Engineering, Science, English, Fine Arts, and International Studies to bring their classes to center to learn about energy, water conservation, landscaping, and green building. Additionally, Eco Centro encourages and assists students with research projects, including a solar-hydroponic project currently under development with the support of a Re-energize grant. Lastly, the students also have a chance to observe the energy generated by the building’s solar arrays compared to the energy taken from the grid.",

            "abstract": "The 2014-15 eruption from Bárðarbunga volcano produced ~1.6 km3 of lava and was the largest Icelandic eruption since the Laki eruption in 1783-84. Nevertheless the recent eruption was still an order of magnitude smaller than Laki and some previous eruptions of Bárðarbunga, which raises the question of whether Bárðarbunga currently has the potential for a larger eruption and, more generally, can we predict how large this type of eruption is going to be once it has started? The eruption was accompanied by a gradual caldera collapse, which provides a plausible mechanism for producing the largest flood basalts that have occurred in Iceland. Here we investigate the potential for larger eruptions through coupled modeling of the caldera collapse and eruption. Our model provides predictive capacity in terms of the end date and final volume of eruption; based on a simple model of piston collapse constrained by subsidence data from a continuously operating GPS station within the caldera, we made a prediction of the end date that was off by only 9 days. We have extended our modeling to consider the effects of episodic pressure change due to earthquakes on faults beneath the caldera, constrained by GPS and InSAR. Our model constrains the aerial extent and volume of the magma body and thus its potential to develop into a larger eruption. The model can be applied to future eruptions that are accompanied by caldera collapse, to forecast the duration and eventual erupted volume, which is critical information for civil authorities.",

The Arctic Glass project explored a variety of scenarios where innovative consumer-grade technology was leveraged as a lightweight, rapidly deployable, sustainable, alternatives to traditional large-scale Arctic cyberinfrastructure installations. Google Glass, cloud computing services, Internet of Things (IoT) microcontrollers, miniature LIDAR, co2 sensors designed for HVAC systems, and portable network kits are several of the components field-tested at the Toolik Field Station as part of this project. Region-specific software was also developed, including a multi featured, voice controlled Google Glass application named “Arctic Glass”. Additionally, real-time sensor monitoring and remote control capability was evaluated through the deployment of a small cluster of microcontroller devices. Network robustness was analyzed as the devices delivered streams of abiotic data to a web-based dashboard monitoring service in near real time. The same data was also uploaded synchronously by the devices to Amazon Web Services. A detailed overview of solutions deployed during the 2015 field season, results from experiments utilizing consumer sensors, and potential roles consumer technology could play in support of Arctic science will be discussed.",

Changes in physical and chemical forcing (light, wind, heat and nutrients) may increase the specific growth rate of phytoplankton. These changes may also shift the predator – prey relationships within the food web structure, which can alter the balance between plankton growth and loss rates. Biogeochemical profiling floats provide a means to observe the seasonal evolution of spring blooms from a physical, chemical and biological perspective in near real time. Floats equipped with optical sensors to measure nitrate, oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, and optical backscatter now have a presence in many ocean regions including the North Pacific, Subarctic Pacific, North Atlantic, South Atlantic and the Southern Ocean. Data from these regions are used to compare and contrast the evolution of spring blooms.

            "abstract": "In continental rift zones, the proportion of strain accommodated by tectonic and magmatic processes, as well as their spatial and temporal distribution, is highly variable. Magnetic, gravity, and seismic reflection data in Surprise Valley, CA, in the northwest Basin and Range, reveal an intra-basin, fault-controlled, ~10 m thick dike at a depth of ~150 m, providing a unique example of the interplay between faulting and magmatism in the process of continental rifting.\nThe dike, likely a composite structure representing multiple successive intrusions, is inferred from modeling a positive magnetic anomaly that extends ~35 km and parallels the basin-bounding Surprise Valley normal fault on the west side of the valley. A 2D high-resolution seismic reflection profile acquired across the magnetic high images a normal fault dipping 56°E with ~275 m of throw. Densely spaced gravity measurements reveal a <1 mGal gravity low consistent with the offset along the fault inferred from the seismic data.\nCo-location of the magnetic high and gravity low for ~6 km implies normal fault control of the dike along that length. The unusually shallow angle of the dike suggests that motion along the fault (perhaps aided by reduced friction along the dike) and associated block rotation resulted in post-intrusion tilting of the dike. The source of the dike is likely related to a shallow brittle-ductile transition zone that was elevated following rapid slip on the Surprise Valley fault post-3 Ma.\nPrior to this work, the Surprise Valley fault was assumed to accommodate the vast majority of extension across the region. Our results indicate that subsurface features, though no longer active, are significant contributors to the processes, timing, and total amount of extension observed in continental rift environments.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater reaction to earthquakes is well known and documented, mostly as changes in water levels or springs discharge, but also as changes in groundwater chemistry. During 2004 groundwater level undulations preceded a series of moderate (ML~5) earthquakes, which occurred along the Dead Sea Rift System (DSRS). In order to try and validate these preliminary observations monitoring of several observation wells was initiated. The monitoring and telemetry infrastructure as well as the wells were allocated specifically for the research by the Israeli National Water Company (Mekorot LTD.). Once several earthquake events were skipped due to insufficient sampling frequency and owing to insufficient storage capacity that caused loss of data, it was decided to establish an independent monitoring system. This current stage of research had commenced at 2011 and just recently became fully operative. At present there are four observation wells that are located along major faults, adjacent to the DSRS. The wells must be inactive and with a confined production layer. The wells are equipped with sensors for groundwter level, water conductivity and groundwater temperature measurements. The data acquisition and transfer resolution is of one minute and the dataset is being transferred through a GPRS network to a central database server. Since the start of the present research stage, most of the earthquakes recorded at the vicinity of the DSRS were smaller then ML 5, with groundwater response only after the ground movement. Nonetheless, distant earthquakes occurring as far as 300 km along a DSRS adjacent fault (ML~3), were noticed at the observation wells. A recent earthquake precursory reoccurrence was followed by a 5.5ML earthquake with an epicenter near the eastern shore of the Red Sea about 400km south to the wells that alerted the quake (see figure). In both wells anomalies is water levels and conductivity were found few hours before the quake, although any single anomaly cannot be regarded as a reliable precursor, cross-correlating several anomalies can indicate to an imminent earthquake, with high degree of certainty.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the sources and ages of stream sediment is important in developing conceptual models of landscape evolution, as well as in developing management strategies to reduce sediment flux. Atmospheric derived cosmogenic radionuclides (7Be and 210Pbex), along with bomb-fallout 137Cs, have been shown to differentiate between surface and non-surface derived sediment. Non-surface derived sediment includes streambanks and in-channel sediment storage. Two techniques were used: (1) Presence or absence of 210Pbex and 137Cs indicated surface and non-surface sources and (2) 7Be to 210Pbex ratios were used to date recent (surface) sediment. We have tested the use of 7Be, 210Pbex, and 137Cs to source and age fine-grained sediment (<0.063 mm) in small streams (<250 km2) draining regional areas of the United States (Midwest, Southeast, and Pacific Northwest) and in a small watershed of the Chesapeake Bay, Smith Creek (242 km2), Virginia, U.S.A. Land uses in the watersheds vary between agriculture, forest, and urban, and sampling included both suspended-sediment and bed material. Results indicate that non-surface derived sediment (e.g. streambanks) is an important source of sediment in all settings. For example, in 80% of 114 Midwest streams, non-surface derived sediment contributed greater than 70% of sediment. Age determination results indicate that many of the samples include a component of sediment that is 200 days old or younger. We discuss the assumptions associated with using radionuclides and whether rainfall or surface soil should be used as boundary conditions to date sediment. Management implications of these results are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Leaves vary in their habit, with some being short lived and possessing high intrinsic photosynthetic rates and others being long lived with lower photosynthetic capacity. Longer lived leaves will thus tend to cost more to produce and be able to assimilate carbon over a longer period of time. The timing and seasonality of forest canopies is a cost benefit strategy for the exploitation of favorable environmental conditions and avoidance of unfavorable conditions. Because of the selective pressure for plants to gather a return on leaf investment in relation to their leaf habit we propose that there is a relationship between plant functional traits and the timing and rate of canopy development. In a recent study it was shown that errors in predicted canopy dynamics could be reduced via a single parameter (τ) which modified the timing and rate of canopy development (Savoy & Mackay 2015). If τ is related to underlying mechanisms of plant physiology then it should vary predictably. To test this we will first examine the relationship between τ and observable biophysical variables which vary in ecologically meaningful ways. Then we will develop a model based on leaf traits which will regulate the timing and rate at which vegetation reaches peak rates of assimilation. The model will then be tested at eddy covariance sites which span a range environmental conditions. Preliminary results demonstrate a strong relationship (R2 = 0.58) between estimated values of τ and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio, which is important for representing the costs of leaf construction and nitrogen investment into photosynthetic machinery of leaves. By developing a canopy seasonality model based on plant functional traits and rooted in the framework of leaf economics it is possible to have a more flexible and generalized model. Such a model will be more adept at making predictions under novel environmental conditions than purely correlative empirical models.",

The interrelationships among the related anomaly fields are analyzed using hybrid coupled model (HCM) simulations to illustrate their combined roles in modulating the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The HCM-based supporting experiments are performed to isolate the related feedbacks, with interannually varying FWF and OBH being represented individually or collectively, which allows their effects to be examined in a clear way. It is demonstrated that the interannual freshwater forcing enhances ENSO variability and slightly prolongs the simulated ENSO period, while the interannual OBH reduces ENSO variability and slightly shortens the ENSO period, with their feedback effects tending to counteract each other.",

            "abstract": "Multiple sulfur isotope ratios in Archean sedimentary rocks provide powerful insights into the behavior of the ancient sulfur cycle, the redox state of fluid Earth, and the timing of the rise of atmospheric oxygen [1]. The Archean sulfur isotope record is marked by pronounced mass-independent fractionation (Δ33S≠0)—signatures widely interpreted as the result of SO2 photolysis from “short–wavelength” UV light resulting in a reduced phase carrying positive Δ33S values (ultimately recorded in pyrite) and an oxidized phase carrying negative Δ33S values carried by sulfate [2]. Support for this hypothesis rests on early laboratory experiments and observations of negative Δ33S from barite occurrences in mixed volcanic sedimentary strata in Mesoarchean greenstone terrains. Despite forming the framework for understanding Archean sulfur cycle processes, this hypothesis is still largely untested, notably due to the lack of sulfate minerals in Archean strata.\nUsing a new MC-ICP-MS approach combined with petrography and X-ray spectroscopy we have generated a growing S isotope dataset from CAS extracted from Archean carbonates from a range of sedimentary successions, including: the 2.6 to 2.521 Ga Campbellrand-Malmani carbonate platform (Transvaal Supergroup, South Africa), 2.7 Ga Cheshire Formation (Zimbabwe), and 2.9 Ga Steep Rock Formation (Canada). Importantly, we observe positive δ34S and Δ33S values across a range of different lithologies and depositional environments. These results demonstrate that dissolved sulfate in seawater was characterized by positive Δ33S values—a result that receives additional support from recent laboratory and theoretical experiments [e.g. 4, 5].\n[1] Farquhar et al., 2000, Science\n[2] Farquhar et al., 2001, Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets\n[3] Paris et al., 2014, Science.\n[4] Whitehill et al., 2013, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n[5] Claire et al., 2014 Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta",

            "abstract": "The inference of the subsurface earth structure and properties requires the integration of different types of data, information and knowledge, by combined processes of analysis and synthesis. To support the process of integrating information, the regular concept of data inversion is evolving to expand its application to models with multiple inner components (properties, scales, structural parameters) that explain multiple data (geophysical survey data, well-logs, core data). The probabilistic inference methods provide the natural framework for the formulation of these problems, considering a posterior probability density function (PDF) that combines the information from a prior information PDF and the new sets of observations. To formulate the posterior PDF in the context of multiple datasets, the data likelihood functions are factorized assuming independence of uncertainties for data originating across different surveys. A realistic description of the earth medium requires modeling several properties and structural parameters, which relate to each other according to dependency and independency notions. Thus, conditional probabilities across model components also factorize. A common setting proceeds by structuring the model parameter space in hierarchical layers. A primary layer (e.g. lithology) conditions a secondary layer (e.g. physical medium properties), which conditions a third layer (e.g. geophysical data). In general, less structured relations within model components and data emerge from the analysis of other inverse problems. They can be described with flexibility via direct acyclic graphs, which are graphs that map dependency relations between the model components. Examples of inverse problems in complex models can be shown at various scales. At local scale, for example, the distribution of gas saturation is inferred from pre-stack seismic data and a calibrated rock-physics model. At regional scale, joint inversion of gravity and magnetic data is applied for the estimation of lithological structure of the crust, with the lithotype body regions conditioning the mass density and magnetic susceptibility fields. At planetary scale, the Earth mantle temperature and element composition is inferred from seismic travel-time and geodetic data.",

            "abstract": "The scattering and diffusion of energetic charged particles is not only important for understanding phenomena such as diffusive shock acceleration but it also is a natural probe of the statistical characteristics of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Although Parker’s transport equation (Parker 1965) allows us to describe the propagation of charged particles, the transport coefficients needed in the equation must be determined. Using Quasi-Linear Theory (QLT, e.g. Jokipii (1966)), one finds that coefficients can be related to the correlation function or power spectrum of homogeneous magnetic turbulence. However, different turbulence models will generally have a different influence on particle’s scattering and diffusion. Among those models developed in MHD Turbulence, such as isotropic, Slab plus 2D (Tu & Marsch 1993; Gray et al 1996; Bieber et al 1996), etc. Here, using test-particle orbit simulations to calculate the transport coefficients, we study particle transport in synthesized asymmetric turbulence using the form first proposed by Goldreich & Sridhar (1995). We developed and introduce a systematic method to synthesize scale-dependent non-isotropic magnetic turbulences. We also developed and introduce a method to synthesize the 3d turbulent magnetic field from the observed solar wind time series dataset. We present the comparison of their effects on charge particle transport with previous theories and models.",

With advent of high throughput genomic sequencing we are beginning to appreciate the diversity of microbial community structure and function and its response to the rhythm of plant function. Through the lens of high-resolution mass spectrometry we are getting our first glimpses of the diversity of soil and pore water organic chemistry at the molecular level. In combination, these diverse data streams are revealing traces of chemical metabolic pathways. This approach promises to reveal many exciting future discoveries, shedding light into the “black box” that exists beneath our feet. In this talk we discuss our experience with the molecular characterization of soils from native prairie to restored prairie to active corn-soybean soils from the DOE funded CSiTE project in Batavia, Illinois. We focus on how common soil separation and fractionation techniques can affect the resulting molecular soil characterization by comparing whole soils to those that have been fractionated into micro- and macro-aggregates and their corresponding silt and clay fractions. When carefully utilized and interpreted these fractionation techniques can be utilized for deepening understanding of the biotic and abiotic chemical pathways effecting the organic chemistry in the different soil fractions. In highly fractionated soils we find significant differences in organic chemistry between silt and clay separates of corresponding hierarchical aggregate fractions. However the most biologically rich information resides in the whole soil. Here we see significant gradients in soil chemistry across to active agricultural to restored to native prairie soils. These results suggest a cautionary note, namely that soil fractionation prior to molecular characterization can reveal much about the “abiotic” interactions between organic molecules and soil minerals but the much of the “biotic” story resides in the whole soil.",

There is still no conclusive evidence, however, that electrostatic levitation occurs on either asteroids or the Moon. The OSIRIS-REx mission will visit the asteroid Bennu in 2018-2019. We have numerically modeled the plasma environment around the equator of Bennu, with the asteroid assumed to have a circular equatorial cross section. Our plasma model presents a significant improvement over previous semi-analytical models as it can seamlessly capture the transition from day-side plasma sheath to night-side plasma wake. Using the plasma model and assuming a uniform density for gravity calculations, we identify the altitudes, longitudinal locations, and the associated grain sizes at which electrostatic levitation is expected to occur. Our predictions of dust levitation at Bennu will enable assessments of the observability of levitating dust during the OSIRIS-REx mission and guide any observations.",

            "abstract": "Negative impacts to riverine species and ecosystems have often been observed when the hydrologic alteration following an abrupt impact to river flow, such as the construction of a dam, exceeds percent deviation thresholds. However, reported percent deviations for different pre- and post-impact flow statistics do not state the likelihood that percent deviations in excess of any threshold are due to an actual change and not sampling variability. Such probabilistic statements about the likelihood of an actual change exceeding a given percent deviation threshold are useful for guiding river restoration decisions, but are seldom available.\nWe introduce a hypothesis testing approach for making probabilistic statements about changes between pre- and post-impact flow regimes that exceed of ecological thresholds. We create ensembles of annual flow duration curves (AFDCs), which provide signatures describing within-year and between-year daily flow variability during pre- and post-impact periods. Pre-impact AFDC ensembles are used to identify exceedance probabilities that are statistically independent from each other and have distinct ecological impacts, e.g. high flows and low flows. The central tendency of pre- and post-impact flows for the selected AFDC exceedance probabilities are compared with a nonparametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. A field significance test is then employed to determine whether there has been a significant overall change in the flow regime.\nThrough a case study of hydropower-induced flow alteration, we demonstrate how this testing approach can screen flow restoration decisions. We weight the differences between the hydropower and ecological performance of baseline and alternative dam operation policies with Type I (over-protection) and Type II (under-protection) errors. We discuss how similar decision-oriented approaches can also be applied to sequential daily flow hydrographs, or even other ecologically relevant variables, such as water temperature.",

An eclipse map also provides detailed knowledge of eclipse circumstances superimposed on the highway system for optimal navigation, especially in the event that weather forces relocation. Eclipse maps are also a vital planning tool for solar physicists and astrophotographers capturing high-resolution imagery of the solar corona. Michael Zeiler will speak to the role of eclipse maps in educating the American public and inspiring people to make the effort to reach the path of totality for the sight of a lifetime. Michael will review the role of eclipse maps in astronomical research and discuss a project under development, the 2017 Eclipse Atlas for smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.",

            "abstract": "Studies on soil organic matter (SOM) began with alkaline solvents revealing a dark colored substance that could be isolated under low pH. Further studies revealed fulvic and humic acids and humin fractions leading to theories on functional groups and metal-clay bridging mechanisms. The fate of isotopes in these fractions revealed soil carbon pools with varying turnover rates with half the soil carbon (C) in humin and acid hydrolyzed fractions over 1000 years old. These results are the basis of the three pool conceptual framework used in many biogeochemical models. Theories on the role of functional groups and compound classes further elaborated concepts on physical (aggregates) and chemical mechanisms of C stabilization. With the advance of analytical instrumentation, the operational fractions were further defined to the compound and molecular levels. These studies confirmed the majority of soil C is microbially derived. Our observation that all microbial groups contributed nonselectively to soil C maintenance independent of mineralogy suggests that compound characteristics within integrated structures are more important than the source of individual compounds for stabilizing soil C. In dissolved organic C floccing studies using Near Edge X-ray Fine Structure analysis, we found that aromatic compounds interacted first with Fe, however, the majority of direct bonds to Fe were polysaccharides, reinforcing that an integrative chemical structure rather than direct bonds imparted stability in organo-metal interactions. Using a novel differential scanning calorimeter coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer setup, we confirmed that the presence of clays (independent of clay type) increased the microbial utilization of calcium stabilized high versus low temperature compounds, asserting that higher temperature compounds (i.e., phenolics) are likely less tightly bound by clay minerals. The integration of operational and defined fractions of SOM remains a legitimate approach to examine SOM structure and stabilization across scales of soil development and management.",

            "abstract": "Gidaa informal science camps have been held in various formats and emphases for over 10 years at Fond du Lac (FDL). These camps provided a safe place for young people to be “nerds” but did not have specific focus. In the last 5 years the camp themes became more focused on environmental issues facing the reservation. From 2009 to 2014 the camps focused on issues surrounding the health of wild rice plants. Since September 2014, we are focusing on climate literacy and how climate changes are affecting tribal environment. We learned from our wild rice themed activities that students are more focused and interested in topics that affect them and their reservation and traditional activities.\nEach camp has a presentation by a staff from the FDL Resource Management Division. These presentations are sometimes given on Friday evenings after dinner and yet students remain alert, respectful, and actively take notes. The presentation topic is known in advance and camp teachers (local middle and high school teachers who have been with us for 5 to 10 years) plan lessons around that topic. In addition, college students, some of them past camp participants, are on hand to assist the teachers and to provide role models. Students have investigated, for example, possible effects of climate change on the timing of rising of sugar maple sap and whether sugar maple tress will continue to thrive in their area, efforts to bring back sturgeon to local rivers and how the changes in water temperature may affect that effort, possible climate connection to decline of moose and walleye pike population at 5 weekend camps during the last academic year.\nWe have conducted 2 surveys by an outside evaluator and will have the results before the next round of camps starts in fall 2015 to help us tweak the format if necessary. Teachers and planners (PIs) are happy with the way camps are running this year; there is a good balance of camp activities that allow teachers to translate and adapt the presentation topics, which they then can use in their classrooms. The camps are jointly funded by a NASA award to FDL Tribal and Community College and an NSF award to University of Minnesota.",

            "abstract": "In a recent literature review of over 1,350 publications, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concluded that wetlands in floodplains are physically, chemically, and biologically integrated with rivers and can improve downstream water quality. However, current knowledge on the extent of floodplains is limited, with national-scale maps unavailable with the exception of coarse-scale Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). Recently, novel approaches to rapidly and inexpensively map floodplains using widely available soil survey data have been developed, as have approaches using hydrogeomorphic metrics. To better understand wetland connectivity to other aquatic systems, we contrasted FIRMs with soil-based, hydrogeomorphic, and simple distance-based metrics in watersheds of Indiana and North Dakota. Soil-based, hydrogeomorphic, and distance-based measures were particularly useful in determining connectivity. For example, in the White River of Indiana, these three measures connected 74-86% of the watershed’s wetland area while the FEMA FIRMs only connected 58% of the watershed’s wetland area, with omissions coming from stark demarcations of FIRMs at seemingly arbitrary locations. Overall, we found that FEMA FIRMs were generally unsuitable for use in determining watershed-scale floodplains, as FIRMs tended to focus on urban areas at the expense of agricultural (or non-urban) regions. Distance-based connectivity measures likely over-estimated floodplain extent through the “creation” of non-existent floodplains on low-order streams. As with any method, the accuracy of the hydrogeomorphic and soil-based measures was highly dependent on the resolution and quality of the input data. However, these two methods in particular appear to hold great promise for accurately extending our knowledge of floodplains throughout the conterminous United States.",

Logging, fire, and other disturbances can disrupt or even diminish the provision of these services. Although many map products and inventory data can be used to estimate the total forested area in the United States, it is not clear how much of the country’s forest remained undisturbed in recent decades. Through the North American Forest Dynamics (NAFD) study, we have mapped both disturbed and undisturbed forests over the conterminous United States (CONUS) using sub-annual time series of Landsat observations. The results revealed that 33.6% of the land area of CONUS had forest cover during some or all of the years between 1986 and 2010. About two thirds of the nation’s forests remained undisturbed during the 25-year period. Most of these undisturbed forests were distributed in western and northern parts of the eastern US. The percentage of undisturbed forest in the southeastern states were lower, about 50% or less. In these states, much of the undisturbed forest was distributed along riparian zones or in protected areas, including national parks and national forests. In the northeastern and western US, riparian zones did not have a significantly higher proportion of undisturbed forests than non-riparian areas. While most protected areas had a high percentage of undisturbed forests, some of them had lower percentages than the average values of their surrounding regions. Topography may also have played a role in keeping forests “undisturbed”. Many ecoregions in the western and northern US had a substantially higher percentage of undisturbed forests at high elevations than at low elevations.",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of current and future ocean conditions is framed by our ability to reconstruct past changes in ecosystem structure and function recorded in paleoarchives. One such archive, proteinaceous deep-sea corals, act as “living sediment traps” with the potential to greatly improve our ability to reconstruct long-term, high-resolution biogeochemical records of export production. Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of individual amino acids (AAs) in deep-sea corals has provided highly detailed new tools to reconstruct changes in both plankton community composition and sources of nitrogen. However, to realize the full potential of CSIA in deep-sea corals, it is critical to better understand the link between the biogeochemical signatures of deep-sea coral polyp tissue and diagenetically resistant proteinaceous skeletal material. We conducted the first detailed comparison of δ13C and δ15N values for individual AAs between tissue and skeleton for three deep-sea coral genera (Primnoa, Isidella, and Kulamanamana). For δ13C values, we found minimal offsets in both essential and non-essential AAs across genera, strongly supporting coral skeleton AA fingerprinting as a new tool to reconstruct plankton community structure. Similarly, there was no significant offset in source AA δ15N values between tissue and skeleton, supporting the use of Phe δ15N as a proxy for baseline nitrogen sources. However, and rather unexpectedly, we found that the d15N values of the trophic AA group were consistently 3-4‰ lighter in skeleton than polyp tissue for all three genera. We hypothesize that this may reflect a partitioning of either N flux or pathways associated with AA transamination between polyp and skeleton tissues. This offset leads to an underestimate of trophic position using current CSIA-based calculations. Overall, our work strongly supports the applicability of CSIA in proteinaceous deep-sea corals to reconstruct past changes in biogeochemical cycling and plankton community dynamics. However, it also indicates that a new correction factor will be required to reconstruct accurate records of change in plankton trophic structure.",

            "abstract": "A recent model by Brune et al. (2014) explains the asymmetrical, conjugate margins of the South Atlantic as the result of passive rift migration with sequential normal faulting during early continental breakup. The onset of continental rifting in the South Atlantic began in the Valanginian about 138 Ma. Flood basalts - originating from the eruption of the Tristan Da Cunha plume on both conjugate margins - have been dated between 138-128 Ma and indicating a transition from passive rifting controlled by plate motions to active rifting controlled by a mantle plume. Using seven 2D gravity transects ranging from 200-1000 km in length, we identify variations in crustal thickness and depth to Moho for conjugate margins in Brazil and Angola. Low pass filters applied to a regional satellite derived gravity grid reveal now inactive, sequential normal faults. The modeled gravity transects refine the extent of hyperextended continental crust and allow for the identification of hanging-wall/ footwall relationships. For the Santos-Namibe conjugate margin, we propose that the Santos basin is the footwall of an asymmetrical rift system spanning a 200-km-wide zone and that the Namibe basin is the hanging wall with a 125-km-wide rift. For the Campos-Benguela conjugate margin 400 km to the north, we propose the Campos basin is the hanging wall with a 150-km-wide rift zone. Well data shows that a thicker carbonate sag basin (135- 325 m) and overlying salt basin (up to 2 km) are associated with the footwall blocks of Kwanza and Santos while thinner carbonate sag basins (15-75 m) and overlying salt (up to 1.5 km) are associated with hanging wall blocks in accord with model predictions for early opening.",

This understanding is gained by comparing our mental model of the world with observations from the field. However, to properly understand the system we should look at dynamics of water, sediments, water quality, and ecology throughout the whole system from catchment to coast both at the surface and in the subsurface. Numerical models are indispensable in helping us understand the interactions of the overall system, but we need to be able to update and adjust them to improve our understanding and test our hypotheses. To support researchers around the world with this challenging task we started a few years ago with the development of a new open source modeling environment DeltaShell that integrates distributed hydrological models with 1D, 2D, and 3D hydraulic models including generic components for the tracking of sediment, water quality, and ecological quantities throughout the hydrological cycle composed of the aforementioned components. The open source approach combined with a modular approach based on open standards, which allow for easy adjustment and expansion as demands and knowledge grow, provides an ideal starting point for addressing challenging integrated environmental questions.",

            "abstract": "Solute transport studies in streams and rivers often begin with the introduction of conservative and reactive tracers into the water column. Information on the transport of these substances is then captured within tracer breakthrough curves (BTCs) and used to estimate, for instance, travel times and dissolved nutrient and carbon dynamics. Traditionally, these investigations have been limited to systems with small discharges (< 200 L/s) and with small reach lengths (< 500 m), partly due to the need for a priori information of the reach’s hydraulic characteristics (e.g., channel geometry, resistance and dispersion coefficients) to predict arrival times, times to peak concentrations of the solute and mean travel times. Current techniques to acquire these channel characteristics through preliminary tracer injections become cost prohibitive at higher stream orders and the use of semi-continuous water quality sensors for collecting real-time information may be affected from erroneous readings that are masked by high turbidity (e.g., nitrate signals with SUNA instruments or fluorescence measures) and/or high total dissolved solids (e.g., making prohibitively expensive the use of salt tracers such as NaCl) in larger systems. Additionally, a successful time-of-travel study is valuable for only a single discharge and river stage. We have developed a method to predict tracer BTCs to inform sampling frequencies at small and large stream orders using empirical relationships developed from multiple tracer injections spanning several orders of magnitude in discharge and reach length. This method was successfully tested in 1st to 8th order systems along the Middle Rio Grande River Basin in New Mexico, USA.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - RNP_AGU_2015_final_update1.pdf\nLandslides are a major global geohazard that are predicted to increase as anthropogenic climate change drives an increase in landslide-triggering storms. Humid mountains may be particularly important, as rainfall-induced shallow landsliding causes a significant proportion of global landslide fatalities. While precipitation is a significant driving force, future landslide susceptibility also depends on millennial-scale landslide history that limits the distribution of potential landslide material. However, the influence of landslide history on current and future landslide hazard is poorly understood.\nWe address this problem by first quantifying the distribution of shallow landslide potential across 1347 km2 of the southern Appalachian Mountains using an unprecedented empirical dataset of hillslope soil depths and strength parameters. By accounting for landslide history, estimates of future landslide potential are lowered significantly. Slope stability modelling demonstrates that under current conditions, only 38% of potential landslide sites across the landscape could fail, regardless of the size of the storm. Of susceptible slopes, most can only fail during the largest possible precipitation events. This is because once a landslide occurs it takes thousands of years to accumulate enough soil to make a site unstable during precipitation. In contrast, the return period of large storms is tens to hundreds of years. This result challenges whether increases in precipitation predicted by climate models will lead to measureable increases in landslide frequency.\nNext, we examine how the distribution of potential landslide material changes through time as storm-induced landslides periodically remove material, using a coupled hillslope stability and soil accumulation model applied to the Appalachian landscape. Our results reveal the spatial pattern of temporal variability in landslide potential, which represents a neglected source of uncertainty when assessing regional landslide susceptibility. Constraining landslide history through analysis of historical and paleo-climatic data, therefore provides a potential means of reducing this uncertainty, by making susceptibility assessments dynamic through time.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU.2015.geoid.v11.pdf\n100 years after Wegener’s pioneering work there is still considerable debate about the dynamics of present-day plate motions. A better understanding of present-day dynamics is key to a better understanding of the supercontinent cycle. The Earth’s gravity field is one of the primary data sets to help constrain horizontal density contrasts, and hence plate dynamic forces. Previous work has shown that the global average for the geoid step up from old oceanic lithosphere across passive continental margins to stable continental lithosphere is about 6-9m, and the global average for the geoid anomaly associated with cooling oceanic lithosphere (the so-called “ridge push”) is 10-12m. The ridge geoid anomaly corresponds to a net force of ~3x1012N/m (averaged over the thickness of the lithosphere) due to 'ridge push.' However, for individual continental margins and mid-ocean ridge systems, there is considerable variation in the geoid step and geoid anomaly and consequently the associated forces contributing to the stress field. We explore the variation in geoid step across passive continental margins looking for correlations with age of continental breakup (and hence place within the supercontinent cycle), hot spot tracks, continental plate velocities, long-wavelength geoid energy (that may be masking signal), and small scale convection. For mid-ocean ridges, we explore variations in geoid anomaly looking for correlations with plate spreading rates, hot spot tracks, long-wavelength geoid energy (that may be masking signal), and small scale convection. We use a band-pass spherical harmonic filter on the full geoid (e.g., EGM2008-WGS84, complete to spherical harmonic degree and order 2159) between orders 6 and 80.\nThe evaluation of the role of spatial variations in the geoid gradient for cooling oceanic lithosphere and across the continental margin in the dynamics of the intraplate stress field requires high spatial resolution modeling. We perform a high resolution finite element analysis (~35,000 elements for a spatial resolution of approximately 50 km) for the North American plate, where previous lower resolution modeling has shown the importance of the lithospheric cooling (ridge push) force to model the broad scale stress patterns observed from the middle of the continent to the Mid-Atlantic ridge.",

            "abstract": "Oil and gas development has occurred in Colorado for over 150 years. With the increasing use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, development of shale oil resources has increased significantly during the past ten years. One of the areas is the Denver-Julesburg (D-J) Basin in northeast Colorado, where there are now over 20,000 active wells. The North Front Range area of Colorado, including Denver, is a non-attainment area for ozone, where emissions from oil and gas development in the D-J Basin are a major concern. If a lower ozone standard is promulgated by EPA, other areas of Colorado will likely be designated as non-attainment as well. Colorado has instituted a number of regulations on the oil and gas industry over the past decade to help reduce emissions. The Denver metropolitan area has also grown significantly over the past decades to a population of over 2.6 million, which adds an urban component to the mix of ozone precursor emissions. Ambient monitoring of ozone precursors, including non-methane organic compounds and carbonyls, has been performed at a number of locations in the North Front Range area of Colorado over the past 12 years. Two of these sites have been in continuous operation since 2012; one site is located in the core of the city of Denver, while the other is located in the center of the oil and gas development area and has recorded high levels of ethane. Additionally, air monitoring sites operating on the western slope of Colorado that includes the Piceance Basin have data as far back as 2004. We present trends from the ozone precursor monitoring conducted in Colorado, and discuss how these precursors may contribute to ozone formation, particularly those related to oil and gas development. These data are valuable for emissions inventory work and model validation related to upcoming State Implementation Plans for ozone. The data will also be used in association with the 2014 Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE) for source apportionment to help determine future regulations to reduce ozone concentrations in the area.",

            "abstract": "Global peatlands currently store more than 650 Pg of carbon (C) that has accumulated over millennia, and contributed to a net climatic cooling. However, controls on spatial-temporal C dynamics may differ regionally. With at least 30 Pg C sequestered in the Hudson Bay Lowlands Canada (HBL), the vulnerability of this globally significant peat C reservoir remains uncertain under conditions of a changing climate and enhanced anthropogenic pressure. Here, we synthesize our current understanding of controls on C dynamics in the HBL using detailed peat records. Our data reveal that widespread bog-fen patterning across the HBL is related to the distribution of peat C in space and time, indicating that topographic and ecohydroclimatic controls are potentially important determinants of C mass accretion. We find that while peat age is closely related to timing of land emergence and peat depth in the HBL, considerable variation in the total C mass among sites of similar peat age suggests that additional factors may further explain trends in peat C dynamics. Among these factors, we find that temperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration in the HBL account for up to half of the variation in the distribution of the peat C mass, whereby regions with warmer and wetter conditions support larger peat C masses. Moreover, we find that the rate of C accumulation is greatest for young fen peatlands developing during warmer mid-Holocene climates; but that long-term C stores are greatest in association with bog peatlands. Although nearly two-thirds of HBL peat C is of late Holocene age, most of the reconstructed potential C losses also occurred during the late Holocene, as previously accrued peat decayed. Our findings support the hypothesis that both climate and ecohydrological factors are important drivers of peat C dynamics in the HBL, alongside geophysical controls on the timing of peat initiation. As the HBL peat complex continues to rapidly expand, it may remain a globally significant C reservoir. However, conservative climate scenarios predict warmer and wetter conditions in the next century, beyond the range of past climate variability. Ongoing elucidation of controls on peat C dynamics may further inform our understanding of the response of the HBL peat C reservoir to future climate and resource management scenarios.",

In this study we extend the work by Ochoa et al 2015 to include an in-depth analysis of intense convective events in the light of observational and simulated data. We use three independent observational data sets: 1) 24­hour accumulated precipitation from a very dense hydrological network in Mexico City, 2) cloud top temperature (CTT) from GOES satellite data and, 3) CAPE data from daily morning soundings. These 3 data sets help to define a measure of intense convective events during the month of September from 2002 to 2011. A subset of intense convection and precipitation events is obtained and its spatial statistics are analyzed. Preliminary results indicate intense precipitation events to be strongly dependent on orography where the upper decile of precipitation and CTT are found at the piedmont on the western side of the Valley. Analyses of daily CTT, for these events, reveal two patterns of convection: 1) initiating over the mountain top and descending over the Valley and, 2), convective systems entering the Valley from its north eastern end, forced by the easterlies. The observed spatial statistics of CTT is roughly matched in a cloud­resolving simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) for ten Septembers from 2002 to 2011, that uses the 1993 USGS Land Use/Land Cover (LULC). Additional simulations are performed with a reduced urban version of the 1993 USGS LULC. Preliminary results show important changes in the initiation of convection and on the spatial patterns of precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The development of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) with a variety of instrument packages enables in situ and proximal remote sensing measurements of volcanic plumes, even when the active conditions of the volcano do not allow volcanologists and emergency response personnel to get too close to the erupting crater. This has been demonstrated this year by flying a sUAS through the heavy ash driven erupting volcanic cloud of Turrialba Volcano, while conducting real time in situ measurement of gases over the crater summit. The event also achieved the collection of newly released ash samples from the erupting volcano. The interception of the Turrialba ash cloud occurred during the CARTA 2015 field campaign carried out as part of an ongoing program for remote sensing satellite calibration and validation purposes, using active volcanic plumes. These deployments are timed to support overflights of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) onboard the NASA Terra satellite on a bimonthly basis using airborne platforms such as tethered balloons, free-flying fixed wing small UAVs at altitudes up to 12.5Kft ASL within about a 5km radius of the summit crater. The onboard instrument includes the MiniGas payload which consists of an array of single electrochemical and infrared gas detectors (SO2, H2S CO2), temperature, pressure, relative humidity and GPS sensors, all connected to an Arduino-based board, with data collected at 1Hz. Data are both stored onboard and sent by telemetry to the ground operator within a 3 km range. The UAV can also carry visible and infrared cameras as well as other payloads, such as a UAV-MS payload that is currently under development for mass spectrometer-based in situ measurements. The presentation describes the ongoing UAV- based in situ remote sensing validation program at Turrialba Volcano, the results of a fly-through the eruptive cloud, as well as future plans to continue these efforts.

            "abstract": "Climate change in northern latitudes is expected to cause widespread permafrost thaw in Interior Alaska over the 21st century. Permafrost thaw may result in land subsidence and the formation of thermokarst bogs. In decades following thaw, previously forest floor (silvic) carbon (C) may be rapidly decomposed, likely due to accelerated microbial activities in young bog environments, resulting in a decadal to century scale positive feedback to climate warming. We examined rates and mechanisms of C loss from a thermokarst bog chronosequence (0-500 ybp) at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX), part of the Bonanza Creek LTER near Fairbanks, AK. Silvic C losses were within ranges observed at other thermokarst chronosequence studies. Incubation studies and modeling results indicate that there are accelerated rates of microbial activity within the deeper silvic and humic soil horizons of the youngest bog. We hypothesized two potential mechanisms of rapid C loss and higher microbial activity in young thermokarst bogs: 1) higher availability of electron acceptors from thawed permafrost that fuel microbial activity, and 2) increased availability of labile C from both soil organic matter and dissolved organic matter in young bogs fuel microbial activity. We tested these hypotheses using anaerobic soil incubations and assays of sulfate reduction, Fe reduction, humic substance (HS) reduction, and nitrate reduction, combined with quantitative PCR of microbial functional groups associated with those processes. Assay results indicated that although sulfate reduction and denitrification were detectable in several of the bogs, only HS reduction was unique to the deep layers of the young thermokarst bog. The most striking difference among different aged bogs was dissolved organic matter, which was elevated in the youngest bogs. These results support both of our hypotheses: microbial activity is stimulated by the availability of labile C in the young bog as both a source of C for decomposition and electron accepting materials. As thermokarst bogs age, the labile fraction of OM is consumed and silvic C decomposition slows. These data highlight the importance of microbial ecology and the biogeochemical processes they mediate to understand decadal scale changes in C storage in thawing permafrost environments.",

We present three case studies of dropouts that occurred under quiet geomagnetic conditions and examine the dynamics of the electron phase spece density, and flux, over a wide range of L using Van Allen Probes and other satellites.

            "abstract": "Traditional approaches to flood risk assessment are typically indexed to an instantaneous peak flow event at a specific recording gage on a river, and then extrapolated through hydraulic modeling of that peak flow to the potential area that is likely to be inundated. However, property losses tend to be determined as much by the duration and volume of flooding as by the depth and velocity of inundation. We argue that the existing notion of a flood risk assessment and consequent reservoir operations based on just the instantaneous peak flow rate at a stream gage needs to be revisited, especially for floods due to persistent rainfall (>30 day duration). In this study, a hydro-climatologic framework is presented to cluster the flood types based on peak, volume, duration and timing conditional on large-scale atmospheric teleconnections. A joint hierarchical clustering and wavelet spectrum analysis is proposed to identify similarities in spatial and temporal scales for large reservoirs of Missouri River Basin. The results demonstrate that the short and long duration floods occur in different times of the years and are connected separately to specific large scale atmospheric teleconnections processes.",

            "abstract": "Abandoned mines throughout the Appalachian region of the United States have been recognized as problematic. Resource extraction from these mines has long ceased and few, if any, documents pertaining to these operations exist. Over time support structures internal to the mines may collapse and lead to subsidence, potentially damaging surface structures. A non-invasive, surface deployed seismic method to detect undisclosed, abandoned near-surface mines would be beneficial as a first step to remediation. The use of seismic surface waves to analyze the upper several tens of meters of the subsurface has become an important technique for near-surface investigations and may provide a method for detection of near-surface, abandoned mine shafts.\nWhile there are many undocumented abandoned mines throughout the Appalachians one known example exists within Butler County, Pennsylvania. Although little is known about the overall operation there is limited documentation which provides information as to the location of the mine tunnels. Currently there is no recognized surface subsidence associated with the mine however documents indicate that the abandoned mining operations have an estimated depth ranging from twenty to fifty feet. To assist with acquisition a seismic land streamer was constructed. Use of a land streamer increases the speed, ease and efficiency required to perform a seismic survey. Additionally the land streamer allows for the acquisition of seismic surface waves which were analyzed using the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) method.\nData were acquired by conducting multiple, adjacent surveys perpendicular to the suspected location of abandoned mine tunnels. Throughout the survey area to a depth of approximately 15 meters, shear wave velocities range between approximately 200-1200 m/s. Based upon shear wave velocity changes within the profile anomalies have been identified corresponding to the contrast between the suspected mined, and unmined, areas.",

            "abstract": "Water uptake by black carbon (BC) containing aerosol has been quantified in wildfire plumes of varying age (from 1 to ~40 hr old) sampled in North America during the NASA SEAC4RS mission of 2013. Measurements were made in flight using parallel single-particle soot photometers (SP2) that simultaneously detected the BC component of the ambient aerosol ensemble under contrasting humidity conditions. The hygroscopicity parameter, κ, of material internally mixed with BC derived from this data set is consistent with previous estimates of bulk aerosol hygroscopicity from biomass burning sources. We explore the temporal evolution of κ during aging of the Yosemite Rim Fire plume to constrain the rate of conversion of BC-containing aerosol from hydrophobic to hydrophilic modes in these emissions. We also investigate the relationship between κ values for BC-containing particles and the oxidation state and hygroscopicity of the bulk aerosol. These observations have implications for BC transport and removal in biomass burning plumes and provide important constraints on model treatment of BC optical and microphysical properties from wildfire sources in ambient conditions.",

            "abstract": "Among the outstanding subsurface science challenges today is the translation of our improved understanding of pore-scale reactive transport and bench-scale geochemical rates of reaction to the prediction of long-term formation response to the sequestration of carbon dioxide. The emergent complexity of CO2-brine-rock interactions, on a large scale, over long periods of time (up to 1000 years) arises from a number of imperfectly understood factors. Of these, the accessibility of reactive surfaces distinguishes natural materials from powders commonly used in reaction rate studies, and geologic heterogeneity requires a workflow that connects samples, not to depths, but to material types that, combined, constitute a subsurface formation.\n To this end, core samples targeting every lithology type (quartz arenite, quartz-feldspar arenite, hematitic matrix-rich sandstone, clay-silt lens) observed in two bore holes through the Mt. Simon Sandstone of Ohio have been interrogated. Small- and ultra small-angle neutron scattering (SANS, USANS) and mercury and gas porosimetry (MICP, BET) have been used to quantify pore and pore throat distributions, and therefore pore volume accessibility at any given intrusion pressure. Mineral surface area is calculated using high-resolution SEM-BSE imagery combined with energy dispersive X-ray mineral mapping, and then extended beyond the limit of image-based techniques by using BET estimates for specific minerals. Combined, these datasets enable the quantification of mineral-specific, connected surface area as a function of pore/fracture scale. This is a defining feature of a pore-mineral assemblage, the microanalysis analogue of a macroscale lithology. The whole formation is then reconstructed by connecting pore-mineral assemblages to lithologies, defined by permeability/porosity and by mineralogy, and these in turn to the whole vertical extent of the formation using coarser-scale images of whole core. This effort therefore contributes both to the nanoscale analysis of accessible reactive surface area, and to the rapid application of such an analysis to the formation scale.",

            "abstract": "Olivine-rich troctolites or plagioclase dunites are a type of rock commonly found in oceanic crust and peridotite massifs that does not fit into a IUGS classification. Part of the reason is that their origin is poorly constrained, in particular whether these rocks are cumulates or residual mantle rocks. To avoid implications for origin or process Blackman et al. 2006 defined as olivine-rich troctolites rocks that contain > 70% olivine,with plagioclase, cpx and spinel.\nWe examined this type of rock in Krivaja peridotite massif in Bosnia-Herzegovina where it occurs as massive outcrops with an area of several tens of square kilometres. The plagioclase dunites are underlain by peridotites that contain plagioclase patches indicative of melt migration. These peridotites are progressively depleted of pyroxene and cross-cut by gabbro veins.\nThe plagioclase dunites have Mg# predominantly from 89 - 90 and Ni contents from 2500 - 3500 ppm, similar to the peridotites. EBSD mapping of whole thin sections shows orientation distribution functions (odf) that are unlike any of the fabric types observed in naturally or experimentally deformed rocks with a strong maximum in (001) near the foliation plane (although this plane is poorly defined) and weak girdles of the other two axes perpendicular to it. For comparison, we also mapped known cumulates from the Rum and Stillwater layered intrusions with somewhat lower Mg# of 84 - 86. The odf of these samples show a strong maximum of (010) perpendicular to the foliation plane and weak girdles of the other two axes in the plane. This fabric type has been explained by crystal settling and compaction in a magma chamber. Together these observations show that the plagioclase dunites from Krivaja, as well as rocks with similar characteristics e.g. from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Drouin et al. 2010) and Italy (Renna and Tribuzio, 2011) are not cumulates but are of mantle origin. An important characteristic of the plagioclase dunites is that the plagioclase, as well as more rare poikilitic cpx occurs interstitial to olivine. These interstitial phases mimic the geometry of melt observed in experiments with olivine and a basaltic melt. These observations confirm that the melt distribution at mantle grain sizes is similar to the experimental melt distribution at grain sizes of a few tens of microns.",

Changing climate and fire dynamics can mean that the species most suited to that area are different, leading new tree species to ‘invade’ the conservation areas. Pittosporum undulatum is an invasive tree native tree species with a natural range from southeast Queensland to Eastern Victoria, Australia. Soon after European settlement this species became a popular ornamental tree in gardens and was planted outside of its natural range across the continent and introduced to the USA (where it is known as Victorian Box), the Hawaiian Islands, Jamaica, southern Africa and the Azores. The reason this is important is because high density of P. undulatum lead to reduced biodiversity and often the complete suppression of regeneration of exiting forest trees. In Australia, changes in fire dynamics have played a major part in its in dominance. New strategies for forest management were proposed by Gleadow an Ashton in the 1980s, but lack of action has led us to predict that the entire Dandenong Ranges, near Melbourne, will be invaded within 25 years resulting in the loss of a major recreational and conservation area. This is a model of the type of problems that can be expected as the climate envelope for species changes in the coming century, challenging the very concept of a “native ”.",

Decision makers and scientists have different priorities, produce work at different rates, and often lack an understanding of each others’ institutional constraints. Boundary organizations, entities that facilitate collaboration and information flow across traditional boundaries such as that between scientists and decision makers, are in a unique position to improve the dialogue between disparate groups. The American Geosciences Institute (AGI), a nonprofit federation of 50 geoscience societies and organizations, is linking the geoscience and decision-making communities through its Critical Issues Program.\nAGI’s Critical Issues program has first-hand experience in improving the transfer of information across the science-decision making boundary, particularly in areas pertaining to water resources and hazards. This presentation will focus on how, by collaborating with organizations representing the decision making and geoscience communities to inform our program development, we have created our three main content types – website, webinar series, and research database – to better meet the needs of the decision-making process. The program presents existing geoscience information in a way that makes the interconnected nature of geoscience topics more easily understood, encourages discussion between the scientific and decision-making communities, and has established a trusted source of impartial geoscience information. These efforts have focused on state and local decision makers—groups that increasingly influence climate and risk-related decisions, yet often lack the resources to access and understand geoscience information.",

            "abstract": "The driving mechanism of long-term monsoon rainfall changes remains debated. Studies on deep sea sediments and on land archives, such as lake sediments and aeolian dusts, have traditionally suggested that monsoon records are characterized by a strong ~100,000-year cycle, similar to those in global ice volume, greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere. Hence, it has been postulated that monsoon rainfall should be largely modulated by changes of glacial boundary conditions. However, the relatively poor geochronology constrains in record age models often complicate a correct data evaluation.\nThe other school of thought proposed that monsoon rainfall changes should directly response to insolation. Oxygen isotopic records from speleothems, aided by precise U/Th age control have often shown a dominant ~20,000-year periodicity, while the ~100,000-year periodicity is rather weak or non-existent in the records. However, it has been argued that calcite speleothem δ18O may not simply represent monsoonal rainfall change.\nHere, we compare our newly reconstructed speleothem records with published data. These records are from the deep tropics, and their δ18O values are unequivocal indicators of regional rainfall changes. We found that very few speleothem δ18O records from the deep tropics follow rainy-season insolation changes. Instead, their δ18O values were mostly low during the last glacial period, and the values were high during the Holocene, which suggest that glacial boundary conditions can indeed play a key role in monsoon changes.",

The EMMREM+MAS coupling focuses on the details of particle acceleration due to CMEs initiated low in the corona (1Rs - 20Rs). The EMMREM+ENLIL coupling gives results for CMEs initiated at ~20Rs and is part of a predictive capability being developed in conjunction with the CCMC. The challenge in forming large solar energetic particle events in both the prompt scenario lower down or for a gradual CME further out is to have enhanced scattering within the acceleration regions while also allowing for efficient escape of accelerated particles downstream. We present here details of the MHD parameters and topology of a CME around the acceleration regions in the early evolution (below 2Rs), dose and flux predictions at 1AU, and how compression regions vs. shocks affect the evolution and spectrum of an SEP event.",

            "abstract": "The progressive closing of the Central American Seaway ~3-7 Ma substantially altered the surface ocean salinity, nutrient content, and biology of the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean. Data from fossil plankton, reef development and oceanographic models of the shoaling Central American Seaway suggest that there was a distinct change in Caribbean productivity with closure of the seaway, but there has not been a detailed comparison of export production between the two ocean basins. Here we show that export production gradually decreased in the Caribbean starting about 2.7 Ma while remaining relatively stable in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Data are derived from 0-5.3 Ma XRF records of Caribbean Site ODP 999 and Pacific Site ODP 846 at ~600-1000 year resolution. Caribbean export production falls during glacial phases in response to ventilation of the tropical thermocline by increasingly nutrient-starved Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water. In contrast, Caribbean production peaks during interglacials when nutrient-rich Antarctic Intermediate Water ventilates the tropical thermocline. Export production in both the eastern Pacific and Caribbean is governed mostly by high latitude nutrient sources as seen in the dominance of high latitude orbital forcing. The gradual intensification of Caribbean oligotrophy may be responsible for the well documented delay in extinction of Caribbean reef associated fauna relative to closure of the central American Seaway. The increasing nutrient starvation of the Caribbean during glacial events may also have rendered Caribbean reef corals unusually susceptible to anthropogenic nutrient loads in modern times.",

            "abstract": "The 1959 eruption at Kilauea Iki, Hawaii, was unusually violent for a near-summit extrusion and the sequence of processes leading up to it remain debated. The eruption might have resulted from the progressive emptying of a stratified magma chamber or from a new magma batch bypassing the base of the magma storage region and mixing with the differentiated magma at shallow depth. In this study, we test if the picritic scoria erupted during the 1959 eruption can shed light on the conditions in the magmatic plumbing system prior to eruption. Scoria from the 1959 eruption contain glomeroporphyritic aggregates of olivine crystals, primarily composed of 2-4 crystals but comprising as many as 16, which vary in composition and three-dimensional texture. The clustering of crystals from different environments and their preferential alignment along crystallographic axes suggest that the glomerocrysts may be the result of synneusis - the drifting together of crystals (Schwindinger and Anderson, 1989). Analogue laboratory experiments of clay crystals in Karo syrup (Schwindinger, 1999), however, show that two crystals settling in a still liquid will not reorient themselves into alignment. Here, we test the hypothesis that a shear-dominated flow field might have facilitated the synneusis of the Kilauea olivines. We investigate the fluid-dynamical conditions under which the glomerocrysts might have formed using direct numerical simulations at the scale of individual crystals. We have implemented an iterative numerical method for simulating the hydrodynamic interactions between olivine crystals and their feedback on the flow field in a magmatic liquid. We solve the Stokes equation in the fluid phase and include rigid, rectangular bodies representing the olivine crystals through distributed Lagrange multipliers. To allow crystals to stick together after collision, the numerical method includes a multibody collision scheme. Additionally, it uses an analytical quadrature scheme instead of discretizing the solid body into material volumes, increasing accuracy and reducing computational expense. Our simulations show that the Kilauea Iki glomerocrysts formed in a magmatic liquid with very low crystallinity (likely less than about 10%) and that shear might have facilitated preferential alignment.",

            "abstract": "The main driver of economic growth in East Africa is agriculture. However, climate change and the resulting intensification of the hydrologic cycle will increase water limitation in this already drought-burdened region, and the challenge of ensuring food security is bound to become critical. Efforts must, therefore, be made to develop appropriate adaptation strategies for agriculture in such regions. Assessing and predicting ecosystem responses to global environmental change can advance management and decision support systems that would improve food security and economic development.\nThe current study uses a plethora of multi-year remote sensing earth observations to study the hydro-ecological vulnerability of the various ecosystems in the water-stressed East African region to droughts. More specifically, we assess the hydrologic sensitivity and resilience of soil moisture and vegetation water content (derived from NRL’s WindSat radiometer), during dry spells, for different dry-period durations, and for various vegetation categories. Spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of the response of the two aforementioned variables to sustained precipitation deficits (derived from TRMM 3B42 V7), as well as their persistence in maintaining their stability are identified. We also assess changes, in space and time, in the normalized radar surface-backscattering cross-sections from NASA’s QuikSCAT Scatterometer, to obtain information on the vegetation regimes, as well as changes in vegetation phenometrics using the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from MODIS. Quantifying the response and characterizing the resilience of the two aforementioned major hydrological attributes using various remote sensing techniques that complement each other, can provide critical insight into the region’s vulnerability and adaptive capacity with respect to rainfall variability.",

            "abstract": "This abstract summarizes the preliminary results from groundwater recharge estimates at an inactive industrial research facility located in southern California: the Santa Susana Field Laboratory. The research activities, carried out at this site from 1949 to 2006, caused chemical contamination of the aquifer. For this reason, the correct assessment of groundwater recharge and fluxes is a key topic in order to better understand the mechanism controlling the rate of contaminant transport and fate toward offsite receptors. The study area is about 11.5 km2 and is formed by fractured sandstone with interbedded shale and siltstone on a topographic ridge approximately 300 m above adjacent valleys. The bedrock is mostly exposed at surface with irregularly covered by thin alluvial deposits and vegetation, mostly chaparral. The Chloride Mass Balance method was used to estimate the long term average annual site-wide recharge considering the hydrogeological features of the area, the availability of chloride concentration data and the inherent assumptions of the method. Daily data of precipitation and runoff from 2008 to 2011, chloride concentration data in precipitation, dry deposition, surface water and in hundreds of monitoring wells across the site were available. The average spatial and temporal recharge estimated for the site is 4.7% of the average annual precipitation (452 mm) with a range of variation between 2% and 7%. This result matches other values of recharge at the site and reported in the literature for arid and semi-arid environments in different areas of the world (Scanlon et alii, 2006; Sharda et alii, 2006). Furthermore, the annual average runoff constitutes a small percentage (8%) of total inflow volume and therefore, the main “loss” of water is represented by the evapotranspiration. This result is consistent with the climatic characteristics of California where annual evapotranspiration is reported to be greater than annual precipitation volume (Hidalgo et alii, 2005). These results represent a first step in the study of groundwater flow and contaminant fluxes to potential receptors from the site. Further quantitation of recharge and its spatial variability across the site will be assessed in the next several months by different independent approaches, such as physical and isotopic methods.",

            "abstract": "Knowing the temperature of emplacement of an ignimbrite can tell us how much cooling air it incorporated during eruption and transport. Currents that incorporate cool matter (air, water, cold clasts) cool more than those that do not. Lithic fragments record the maximum temperature they reached, up to their maximum unblocking temperature. Studies of large ignimbrites (e.g. Cerro Galan Ignimbrite) emplaced by dense currents show they do not cool very much, with emplacement temperatures often above 580 oC. Smaller currents, such as those from Vesuvius and Colima, lose significant heat in the eruption column, and then lose some, but less, heat as they travel laterally. The amount of atmosphere incorporated by large dilute currents is not known. The ~40 ka Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) erupted from the Campi Flegrei caldera near Naples, Italy, and extends to ~75 km from the caldera. The CI was emplaced from a density-stratified current with a dilute transport system and a denser depositional system that overtopped 1600-m-high ridges, with the depositional system re-forming on the far side. Modeling of dilute currents shows that they can pass over obstacles ~1.5 times their thickness without losing momentum, which implies the CI current was >1 km thick. Much of that dilute current was gas, but how much was atmospheric? Partial thermal demagnetization of lithic clasts allows the identification of the temperature of emplacement. We sampled lithic fragments from the CI in 13 locations from proximal to distal along several azimuths. The current passed over 30-35 km of sea to get to two sites. Partial thermal demagnetization of 10 specimens from each site show that they were heated and deposited above 580 oC, the unblocking temperature of magnetite, implying the temperature of emplacement was at or above this temperature. The CI is poor in lithic clasts (<1% in most places) and evidence of non-magmatic water in the outflow sheet is absent. We suggest the CI current was a large, continuous, and broadly distributed current and the body of the current had little contact with the atmosphere, except at the dilute and likely gradational top of the flow, so incorporated little air. This implies that the great expansion of the CI current was accomplished with magmatic gases or perhaps superheated hydrothermal fluids.",

            "abstract": "The world’s energy sector is experiencing a serious transition from reliance on fossil fuel energy sources to extensive reliance on renewable energies. Europe is leading the way in this transition to a low carbon economy in an attempt to keep climate change below 2oC. Member States have committed themselves to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% and increasing the share of renewables in the EU’s energy mix to 20% by 2020. The EU has now gone a step further with the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050. Nevertheless, the short-term focus of the European Commission is at “cost-efficient ways” to cut its greenhouse gas emissions which forgoes the unintended impacts of a large expansion of low-carbon energy technologies on major natural resources such as water and land.\nThis study uses the “System of Systems (SoS) Approach to Energy Sustainability Assessment” (Hadian and Madani, 2015) to evaluate the Relative Aggregate Footprint (RAF) of energy sources in different European Union (EU) member states. RAF reflects the overall resource-use efficiency of energy sources with respect to four criteria: carbon footprint, water footprint, land footprint, and economic cost. Weights are assigned to the four resource use efficiency criteria based on each member state’s varying natural and economic resources to examine the changes in the desirability of energy sources based on regional resource availability conditions, and to help evaluating the overall resource use efficiency of the EU’s energy portfolio.\nA longer-term strategy in Europe has been devised under the “Resource Efficient Europe” flagship imitative intended to put the EU on course to using resources in a sustainable way. This study will highlight the resource efficiency of the EU’s energy sector in order to assist in a sustainable transition to a low carbon economy in Europe.\n",

            "abstract": "HO2 and OH, also known as odd oxygen HOx, play an important role in middle atmospheric chemistry, in particular O3 destruction through catalytic HOx reaction cycles. Due to their photochemical production and short chemical lifetimes, HOx species are expected to show rapid responses to solar irradiance changes, resulting in variability in the corresponding O3 chemistry. While the OH response to solar cycles has been investigated, HO2 studies have been limited by the lack of reliable observations. The recently developed “offline” HO2 data product from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) makes it possible, for the first time, to investigate HO2 variability and the behavior of OH/HO2 partitioning, which plays an important role in O3-destroying HOx cycles. Here we present the first evidence of global mean HO2 variability during solar 27-day cycles by investigating the new MLS HO2 data. We focus on the most recent data from 2012 - 2015, when solar irradiance variability is strong near the peak of Solar Cycle 24. The features of mesospheric HO2 variability are found to correlate well with those of solar Lyman-α variability. The strongest HO2 solar cycle signals occur in the pressure range 0.01 – 0.068 hPa. When continuous MLS OH observations are not available, the new HO2 data could be a promising alternative for investigating HOx variability and the corresponding impacts on O3 and the climate.",

            "abstract": "Despite the rapidly growing interest in using 238U/235U measurements as a proxy for changes in oxygen abundance in surface and near-surface environments, the present theoretical understanding of uranium isotope fractionation is limited to a few simple gas-phase molecules and analogues of dissolved species (e.g., 1,2,3). Understanding uranium isotope fractionation behavior in more complicated species, such as crystals and adsorption complexes, will help in the design and interpretation of experiments and field studies, and may suggest other uses for 38U/235U measurements. In this study, a recently developed first-principles method for estimating the nuclear volume component of field shift fractionation in crystals and complex molecular species (4) is combined with mass-dependent fractionation theory to predict equilibrium 38U/235U fractionations in aqueous and crystalline uranium compounds, including uraninite (UO2).\nThe nuclear field shift effect, caused by the interaction of electrons with the finite volume of the positive charge distribution in uranium nuclei, is estimated using Density Functional Theory and the Projector Augmented Wave method (DFT-PAW). Tests against relativistic electronic structure calculations and Mössbauer isomer shift data indicate that the DFT-PAW method is reasonably accurate, while being much better suited to models of complex and crystalline species. Initial results confirm previous predictions that the nuclear volume effect overwhelms mass depdendent fractionation in U(VI)-U(IV) exchange reactions, leading to higher 238U/235U in U(IV) species (i.e., for UO2 xtal vs. UO22+aq, ln αNV ≈ +1.8‰ , ln αMD ≈ –0.8‰, ln αTotal ≈ +1.0‰ at 25ºC). UO2 and U(H2O)94+, are within ~0.4‰ of each other, while U(VI) species appear to be more variable. This suggests that speciation is likely to significantly affect natural uranium isotope fractionations, in addition to oxidation state. Tentatively, it appears that uranyl-type (UO22+-bearing) structures will tend to have higher 238U/235U than uranate-type structures that lack strong U=O bonds.\n",

We reported that the total energy consumption is 10% higher than the nationally published value. The investigated emission factors used in China are significantly (40%) different from the IPCC default values which were used in drawing up several previous emission inventories.

The U mineralized sand is composed of quartz (41-53%), calcite (15-30%), plagioclase (11-19%), microcline (2-9%), clinoptilolite (0.5-7%) with minor amounts of pyrite/marcasite (2-7%) and clays/micas (1-4%), and very little organic C (<0.1%). Ore zone samples contain minor amounts (<2%) of hematite, V-oxides/V-Ti-Fe-oxides and sulfidized Fe-Ti oxides with variable Fe, Ti and S ratios locally hosting low levels of U. The dominant sulfide mineral is marcasite. We observe a complex relationship between U-Ti minerals and sulfide/silicate phases where U minerals occur as inclusions, irregularly developed veins or intergrowths. Except for the U concentrations, the downgradient sediments are compositionally similar to the ore and contain abundant smectite/illite (7-45%).\nThe predominance of brannerite implies direct reduction of U(VI) on surfaces of reduced Fe-Ti oxides as a major ore-forming mechanism. Our results reveal an as yet unidentified mechanism of ore genesis that differs from the current model that presupposes the sulfidized Fe-Ti oxides as the main reductant of U(VI). Furthermore, previous research demonstrated formation of U-Ti phases structurally similar to brannerite during reduction of U(VI) by titanomagnetites. Abundant Fe-Ti oxides in the downgradient sediments suggest that the interaction between postmining residual U(VI) and Fe-Ti oxides may play a major role in natural remediation of U at Rosita and similar ISR sites.",

            "abstract": "Evidence indicates that inland waters play an important role in regional and global carbon budget through releasing a substantial carbon into the atmosphere. To better quantify how environmental variables affect CO2 exchange between inland waters and the atmosphere and its temporal variations, we have conducted direct, long-term measurements of CO2 fluxes across the water-atmosphere interface over a large southern open water of Ross Barnett Reservoir in central Mississippi. Our data indicate that large CO2 flux pulses occurred occasionally throughout the course of a year with the duration of a few days for each pulse. Here we analyzed and demonstrated that these CO2 flux pulses were associated with the passages of synoptic weather events. Our preliminary results indicated that these synoptic weather events (e.g., extratropical clones and cold air bursts) led to the enhanced mechanical mixing due to increasing wind speeds and the instability of the atmospheric surface layer due to the decreasing air temperature. As a consequence, in-water processes were also substantially altered accordingly. Due to the dramatic decrease in air temperature caused by the events, the temperature in the water surface layer was largely reduced, generating in-water convection conditions and thus leading to the increased depths of the mixing layer in the water, as reflected by the water temperature profiles. The enhanced mechanical mixing in the atmospheric surface layer may have further contributed to the deepened mixing layer in the water. Our suggestions suggest that high CO2 effluxes during the pulse events were largely attributed to changes in the water-side physical processes that are directly linked to rapid changes in atmospheric processes associated with synoptic weather events. Given its substantial contribution of CO2 flux pulses to carbon emission, such physical processes should be taken into account when carbon emissions from inland waters are quantified.",

            "abstract": "The first widely accepted evidence for oxidation of Earth’s atmosphere and oceans occurs ~2.45 Ga immediately prior to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). A major line of evidence for this transition includes the abundances and isotopic variations of redox-sensitive transition metals in marine sediments (e.g., Fe, Mo, Re, Cr, and U). It is often assumed that oxidative weathering is required to liberate these redox-sensitive elements from sulfide minerals in the crust, and hence that their presence in early Archean marine sediments signifies that oxidative weathering was stimulated by small and/or transient “whiffs” of O2 in the environment.1 However, studies of crustal sulfide reactivity have not been conducted at O2 concentrations as low as those that would have prevailed when O2 began its rise during the late Archean (estimated at <10-5 present atmospheric O2).2 As a result, it is difficult to quantify O2 concentrations implied by observed trace metal variations.\nAs a first step toward providing more quantitative constraints on late Archean pO2, we conducted laboratory studies of pyrite and molybdenite oxidation kinetics at the nanomolar O2 concentrations that are relevant to late Archean environments. These measurements were made using recently developed, highly sensitive optical O2 sensors to monitor the rates at which the powdered minerals consumed dissolved O2 in a range of pH-buffered solutions.3\nOur data extend the range of experimental pyrite oxidation rates in the literature by three orders of magnitude from ~10-3 present atmospheric O2 to ~10-6. We find that molybdenite and pyrite oxidation continues to <1 nM O2 (4 x 10-6 present atmospheric O2). This implies that oxidative weathering of sulfides could occur under conditions which preserve MIF S fractionation. Furthermore, our results indicate that the rate law and reaction order of pyrite oxidation kinetics change significantly at nanomolar concentrations of O2 when compared to previous compilations.2 Our results provide new empirical data that should allow for more precise quantitative constraints on atmospheric pO2 based on the sedimentary rock record.\n1Anbar, A.D. et al., 2007.

            "abstract": "In many hydrologic modeling applications, solar radiation has been parameterized using commonly available measures, such as the daily temperature range, due to scarce in situ solar radiation measurement network. However, these parameterized estimates often produce significant biases. Here we test hourly solar irradiance derived from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) visible albedo product, using several established algorithms. Focusing on the Sierra Nevada and White Mountain in California, we compared the GOES irradiance and that from a traditional temperature-based algorithm with incoming irradiance from pyranometers at 19 stations. The GOES based estimates yielded 21-27% reduction in root-mean-squared error (average over 19 sites). The derived irradiance is then prescribed as an input to Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS). We constrain our experiment to the Tuolumne River watershed and focus our attention on the winter and spring of 1996-2014. A root-mean-squared error reduction of 2-6% in daily inflow to Hetch Hetchy at the lower end of the Tuolumne catchment was achieved by incorporating the insolation estimates at only 8 out of 280 Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs) within the basin. Our ongoing work endeavors to apply satellite-derived irradiance at each individual HRU.",

            "abstract": "We present tomographic images of lithospheric structure along the Denali fault in central Alaska based on double-difference inversions of earthquake arrival times. We discretize the region with a uniform grid spacing of 3km within a 600km by 500km by 60km volume. We invert for VP, VS, and hypocenter location using data from 5634 earthquakes recorded at 326 stations, incorporating 715,000 P and 229,000 S wave phase arrivals. The use of this large dataset provides resolution throughout the crust and into the upper mantle, with diminishing resolution below 50km depth as determined with checkerboard tests and calculation of the inversion derivative weight sum. The tomographic results indicate that the Moho is offset by approximately 10km along the entire resolved length of the Denali fault, with the northern side having the shallower Moho depths around 30km. This indicates that the Denali fault is likely a deep lithospheric structure which penetrates into the upper mantle. The shallow crustal velocity structure of the Denali fault is more complicated with high-velocity plutonic bodies and low-velocity subsidiary fault zones, though the northern side of the fault generally has slightly lower velocities. In order to bolster the tomographic images we analyze more than 100 events recorded at 55 near-fault stations to find fault zone head waves, which offer a clear indication of a sharp across-fault velocity contrast. In addition to picking head waves manually using horizontal particle motion, we run an automated picker over the entire dataset using no assumptions about likely head wave distributions. Most of the head wave detections are located on the northern side of the fault fault near the town of Healy, though the source-receiver geometry may be suboptimal for detection in other portions of the fault zone. Taken together, the tomographic and head wave results have important implications for the shallow crust, deeper lithospheric structure, and tectonic history of the Denali fault and the Central Alaskan Interior.",

            "abstract": "Recurring Slope Lineae (RSLs) and other associated dark streaks appear in the southern mid-latitudes on the martian surface during the spring to summer months. Gullies commonly emerge from bedrock and form from volatile thawing and associated sediment transportation and deposition. All of these forms involve the movement of fluids and associated sediments on variable slopes. The objective of this research is to generate subsurface flows, resembling those of liquid brines, under regolith at slope angle ranges that represent those on which RSLs and gullies occur on Mars. RSLs are generally found on steeper slopes. The higher slopes ranged from 25°-30° and lower slopes 12°-18°.\nAs the slope increased, the total channel and apron length increased. There was a significant increase from the lower to higher slopes. The maximum width of the channel decreased as the slopes increased. Lower slopes produced a more dendritic channel pattern; an alcove, the main channel and an apron with two diverging branches. However, the higher slopes produced channels with more variability in the fluvial features. Lobes diverged from the main channel at varying distances from the water source. Channel walls were more distinct, along with formation of natural levees. Increases in fluid viscosity, produces a more singular channel.\nFrom these observations we conclude that lower slopes are more conducive to RSL formations from their basic geomorphology. Higher slopes produce more distinct morphologies associated with fluvial erosion that are more similar to gullies. The effect of viscosity also appears to alter the morphologies of the flow features. Understanding the origin of these fluvial features can lead to greater understanding of fluids on Mars.",

            "abstract": "Hygroscopic growth occurs when particles take up water vapor and grow when exposed to elevated relative humidity (RH), and is controlled largely by chemical composition. Previous laboratory studies of biomass burning and combustion particles observed particle size shrinkage as soot aerosols, especially those with coatings, were exposed to increasing RH levels, which resulted in sub-1.0 hygroscopicity parameter values (i.e., ratio of humidified-to-dry diameter g(RH) and ratio of humidified-to-dry scattering coefficients f(RH)). To investigate the potential for sub-1.0 hygroscopicity in ambient aerosol, we utilized data from (i) a ship-board HTDMA during E-PEACE 2011, (ii) multiple instruments on the DC8 during SEAC4RS-2013, as well as (iii) the DASH-SP during measurement intensives in Summer 2014 and Winter 2015 in Tucson, Arizona. Suppressed hygroscopicity, including sub-1.0 g(RH), was observed during smoke-influenced periods in SEAC4RS, episodic events in the winter season in Arizona, and smoke-influenced air during E-PEACE. Across the range of RH investigated (75-95%), sub-1.0 g(RH) was lowest at the highest RH values probed (~95%). These sub-1.0 g(RH) observations are consistent with elevated black carbon and organic aerosol concentration in both E-PEACE and SEAC4RS. Collocated measurements during SEAC4RS indicate elevated spikes in black carbon concentrations are coincident with both sub-1.0 f(RH) and g(RH) observations, as well as elevated organic aerosol- and gas-phase fire tracers such as AMS f60 and PTR-MS acetonitrile concentration. This is the first set of ambient observations of sub-1.0 hygroscopicity factors g(RH) and f(RH), with consistency across different instruments, regions, and platforms. Although particle restructuring has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments, field observations are complex as soot coating, secondary chemistry, and heterogeneous processing can occur on the same time scale as measurements. This work motivates continued field observations examining combustion aerosol-water interactions, and instrument modifications to investigate the mechanisms responsible for biomass burning and fresh combustion particle shrinkage upon hydration.",

            "abstract": "The Magnetotelluric Observations of Cascadia using a Huge Array (MOCHA) experiment was carried out to study the nature of the seismogenic locked zone and the down-dip transition zone where episodic tremor and slip (ETS) originates. This amphibious magnetotelluric (MT) data set consists of 8 offshore and 15 onshore profiles crossing from just seaward of the trench to the western front of the Cascades, with a north-south extent spanning from central Oregon to central Washington. The 71 offshore stations and the 75 onshore stations (red triangles in the image below) fit into the broader context of the more sparsely sampled EarthScope MT transportable array (black triangles) and other previous and pending MT surveys (other symbols). These data allows us to image variations in electrical conductivity along distinct segments of the Cascadia subduction zone defined by ETS recurrence intervals. Since bulk conductivity in this setting depends primarily on porosity, fluid content and temperature, the conductivity images created from the MOCHA data offer unique insights on fluid processes in the crust and mantle, and how the distribution of fluid along the plate interface relates to observed variations in ETS behavior.\nThis abstract explores the across- and along-strike variations in the incoming plate and the shallow offshore forearc. In particular we examine how conductivity variations, and the inferred fluid content and porosity variations, are related to tectonic segmentation, seismicity and deformation patterns, and arc magma variations along-strike. Porosity inferred in the forearc crust can be interpreted in conjunction with active and passive seismic imaging results and may provide new insights on the origin of recently observed extremely high heat flow values.\nA companion abstract (Parris et al.) examines the deeper conductivity structure of the locked and ETS zones along the plate interface in order to identify correlations between ETS occurrence rates and inferred fluid concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Survival and distribution of conifers across the globe will depend on their adaptive potential to the new climatic conditions (warmer, more droughts, heat waves). Recent studies predicting forest evolution have mainly focused on understanding tree mortality processes (hydraulic failure, carbon starvation, biotic stresses). These explicit causes of mortality are also the result of unsuccessful adaptation on a longer period. Using a 7 years drought-irrigation experiment in New Mexico, USA, we investigated the response to water availability on structure-function interactions at the tree level. Bridging dendrology and physiology on multiple individuals of local Pinion pine, we observe a structural dynamics in i) wood anatomy ii) evaporative anatomy and a resulting functional dynamics in i) leaf water potential and ii) water use efficiency on multiple time scales (daily to interannual). These results emphasize the tight coupling between carbon allocation and the surface hydrologic cycle on longer time scales and its impact on resilience and mortality, which is not included in current generation land-surface models.\nfigure: Wood anatomy obtained from a 5.2mm core of a Pinion Edulis from the experimental site - illustrating the variability of the water transport capacities accross years",

            "abstract": "The change in land cover and drought are currently among the largest issues affecting the world, so recognizing the environmental change and sustainable development issues are important. The purpose of this study is to determine the potential in using microwave brightness temperature and emissivity data to monitor previous land cover changes and droughts. Using microwave radiation at various frequencies from satellites sensor data such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) have been collected to formulate the emissivity around the globe for the last few decades. In this study, the lower frequencies are used because at such frequencies, the signal is more sensitive to surface properties such as soil moisture and vegetation. The Emissivity Microwave Polarization Difference Index (EMPDI) and Brightness Temperature Microwave Polarization Difference Index (BTMPDI) are computed by vertical and horizontal value. The global EMPDI and BTMPDI values from 20 years of data are then placed in contrast with independent drought indicators from the Global Integrated Drought Monitoring and Prediction System (GIDMaPS) based on precipitation and soil moisture data records. Moreover, a drought severity test is performed using techniques that previously were deployed on precipitation and soil moisture data to investigate the potential of using microwave emissivity values in drought monitoring, directly. Results reveal some sensitivity to surface property changes and in some places they are not consistent with drought indicators. Microwave emissivity provides a signal that simultaneously is affected by vegetation and soil moisture condition. Therefore, regions with more stable and resistant land-cover type do not necessarily indicate any drought even though the precipitation records prove otherwise.",

            "abstract": "Amidst nature’s great variability and complexity and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission aims to provide high resolution soil moisture products for earth sciences applications. One of the biggest challenges still faced by the remote sensing community are the uncertainties, heterogeneities and scaling exhibited by soil, land cover, topography, precipitation etc. At each spatial scale, there are different levels of uncertainties and heterogeneities. Also, each land surface variable derived from various satellite mission comes with their own error margins. As such, soil moisture retrieval accuracy is affected as radiative model sensitivity changes with space, time, and scale. In this paper, we explore the distributed sensitivity analysis of radiative model under different hydro-climates and spatial scales, 1.5 km, 3 km, 9km and 39km. This analysis is conducted in three different regions Iowa, U.S.A (SMEX02), Arizona, USA (SMEX04) and Winnipeg, Canada (SMAPVEX12). Distributed variables such as soil moisture, soil texture, vegetation and temperature are assumed to be uncertain and are conditionally simulated to obtain uncertain maps, whereas roughness data which is spatially limited are assumed a probability distribution. The relative contribution of the uncertain model inputs to the aggregated model output is also studied, using various aggregation techniques. We use global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to conduct this analysis across spatio-temporal scales.\nKeywords: Soil moisture, radiative transfer, remote sensing, sensitivity, SMEX02, SMAPVEX12.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this study is to develop a new predictive equation for bedload transport within an immobile boulder array and at high relative submergence conditions, which occur commonly in mountainous streams during snowmelt flows. Previous predictive methods have accounted for the effects of individual boulders comprising an array both by the stress they bear locally and by their presence as immobile area within the total bed; thereby, existing equations originally developed for unobstructed flows have been modified for use within a boulder array. However, comparison of these predictions with bedload data from laboratory flume tests conducted within an idealized boulder array show notable discrepancies.\nIn the last five years, new research has highlighted additional hydrodynamic complexities related to the presence of a boulder array that have important implications to bedload transport and may be contributing factors to this discrepancy. These include reach scale drag of the collective array, local bed shear stress variability, and wake eddy region flow deceleration. Based on these insights into flow characteristics, which drive bedload transport, we hypothesize that transport rates within a boulder array will be more accurately predicted after 1) improving estimates of the bed shear stress acting on mobile sediment, and 2) quantitatively accounting for the effects mobile sediment ‘hiding’ or depositing in the wake region behind individual boulders.",

            "abstract": "The hydrology of the western United States and many other semi-arid regions of the world is dominated by snowmelt runoff. An important question is the role of subsurface interactions with snowmelt runoff. Hydrologic mixing models have been used to answer this question at the hillslope and small basin scale. Here we present information on snowmelt/subsurface interactions for the 270-km2 Boulder Creek Watershed in the Colorado Front Range using isotopic, geochemical, and hydrometric data along with end-member mixing analysis (EMMA). We measured these parameters at several different elevations in weekly precipitation, the seasonal snowpack, snowmelt before contact with the ground, discharge, springs, soil solution, and groundwater.\nAt the watershed outlet Orodell, five tracers are selected: Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, ANC, and d18O. The first two principal components can explain about 98% of the chemical variance in stream water, and require three end members: groundwater, rain, and snowmelt. The r-squared values of measured and predicted values are higher than 0.95, suggesting that we have identified the correct end-members.\nIt is concluded that in summer months, contributions from groundwater to stream flow decreased from high to low elevations along the Boulder Creek main stem, while contributions from rain and snow increased. Whether this trend represents the general contributions for streamflow on a yearly basis is uncertain, and needs further investigation. On the contrary, contributions of snow to streamflow decreased from GL4 to GG in summer months (Cowie, 2014). Thus, in Boulder Creek Watershed at Orodell, the hydrochemical evolution at headwater catchments is different from that in the main stem.",

            "abstract": "Strainmeters and creepmeters have been operated along the San Andreas Fault, observing creep events for decades. In particular, the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) has added a significant number of borehole strainmeters along the San Andreas Fault (SAF) over the last decade. The geodetic data cover a significant temporal portion of the inferred earthquake cycle along this portion of the SAF. Creepmeters measure the surface displacement over time (creep) with short apertures and have the ability to capture slow slip, coseismic rupture, and afterslip. Modern creepmeters deployed by the authors have a resolution of 5 µm over a range of 10 mm and a dynamic sensor with a resolution 25 µm over a range 2.2 m. Borehole strainmeters measure local deformation some distance from the fault with a broader aperture. Borehole tensor strainmeters principally deployed as part of the PBO, measure the horizontal strain tensor at a depth of 100-200 m with a resolution of 10-11 strain and are located 4 – 10 km from the fault with the ability to image a 1 mm creep event acting on an area of ~500 m2 from over 4 km away (fault perpendicular). A single borehole tensor strainmeter is capable of providing broad constraints on the creep event asperity size, location, direction and depth of a single creep event. The synthesis of these data from all the available geodetic instruments proximal to the SAF presents a unique opportunity to constrain the partitioning between aseismic and seismic slip on the central SAF. We show that simple elastic half-space models allow us to loosely constrain the location and depth of any individual creep event on the fault, even with a single instrument, and to image the accumulation of creep with time.",

We selected the tree species as representatives of the different phenological ecotypes: evergreen, deciduous and stem succulent.\nThe deciduous group comprised N-fixing as well as non N-fixing Leguminosae. Over an entire vegetation period (dry and wet-season) we monitored their phenological behaviour, photosynthesis rates, stomata conductance and water potential, measured if leaves were present and we estimated seasonal variations in stable carbon and N15 content of the leaves.\nThe major results are:\nEvergreen species (e.g. Capparis) may compensate low carbon-fixing rates in the wet season with a much longer vegetation period as the deciduous species. Stem succulents (Jatropha) do not fulfill the expectations of being high productive species under drought stress conditions, while the N-fixing Mimosa performed in particular at the end and the beginning of the dry period better than the rest of the investigated species.\nIn general the results may help to understand different strategies of tree species in respect to extended dry periods of at least six months as in our study area and their role in carbon sequestration of tropical dry forests. The variety of observed strategies may contribute to the resilience of the ecosystem tropical dry forests.",

            "abstract": "The Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument onboard the Mars Curiosity rover has detected abundant amounts (approx. 25-30 wt. %) of X-ray amorphous materials in a windblown deposit (Rocknest) and in a sedimentary mudstone (Cumberland and John Klein) in Gale crater. On Earth, X-ray amorphous components are common in soils and sediments, but usually not as abundant as detected in Gale crater. One hypothesis for the abundant X-ray amorphous materials on Mars is limited interaction of liquid water with surface materials, kinetically inhibiting maturation to more crystalline phases.\nThe objective of this study was to characterize the chemistry and mineralogy of soils formed in the Antarctica Dry Valleys, one of the driest locations on Earth. Two soils were characterized from different elevations, including a low elevation, coastal, subxerous soil in Taylor Valley and a high elevation, ultraxerous soil in University Valley. A variety of techniques were used to characterize materials from each soil horizon, including Rietveld analysis of X-ray diffraction data. For Taylor Valley soil, the X-ray amorphous component ranged from about 4 wt. % in the upper horizon to as high as 15 wt. % in the lowest horizon just above the permafrost layer. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the presence of short-range ordered (SRO) smectite was the most likely candidate for the X-ray amorphous materials in the Taylor Valley soils. The SRO smectite is likely an aqueous alteration product of mica inherited from granitic materials during glaciation of Taylor Valley. The drier University Valley soil had lower X-ray amorphous contents of about 5 wt. % througout the profile. The X-ray amorphous materials in University Valley are attributed to nanoparticles of TiO2 and possibly amorphous SiO2.\nThe high abundance of X-ray amorphous materials in Taylor Valley is surprising for one of the driest places on Earth. These materials may have been physically and chemical altered during soil formation, however, the limited interaction with water and low temperatures may have resulted in the formation of “immature” X-ray amorphous or SRO materials. Perhaps, a similar process contributes to the formation of the high content of X-ray amorphous materials detected on Mars.",

            "abstract": "Passive and active solar collector farms are often located in relatively dry desert regions where cloudiness impacts are minimized. These farms may be susceptible to reduced performance due to routine or episodic aerosol deposition on collector surfaces. Intense episodes of wind blown dust deposition may negatively impact farm performance, and trigger need to clean collector surfaces. Aerosol deposition rate depends on size, morphology, and local meteorological conditions. We have developed a system for solar panel performance testing under real world conditions. Two identical 0.74 square meter solar panels are deployed, with one kept clean while the other receives various doses of aerosol deposition or other treatments. A variable load is used with automation to record solar panel maximum output power every 10 minutes. A collocated sonic anemometer measures wind at 10 Hz, allowing for both steady and turbulent characterization to establish a link between wind patterns and particle distribution on the cells. Multispectral photoacoustic instruments measure aerosol light scattering and absorption. An MFRSR quantifies incoming solar radiation. Solar panel albedo is measured along with the transmission spectra of particles collected on the panel surface. Key questions are: At what concentration does aerosol deposition become a problem for solar panel performance? What are the meteorological conditions that most strongly favor aerosol deposition, and are these predictable from current models? Is it feasible to use the outflow from an unmanned aerial vehicle hovering over solar panels to adequately clean their surface? Does aerosol deposition from episodes of nearby forest fires impact performance? The outlook of this research is to build a model that describes environmental effects on solar panel performance. Measurements from summer and fall 2015 will be presented along with insights gleaned from them.",

            "abstract": "This work develops a bottom-up, multi-stage planning framework for the sustainable development of river basin systems under deep climate uncertainty. The research focuses on whether and when it is desirable to invest for costly water infrastructure projects, and how to select among a set of project alternatives in order achieve the desired economic benefits with a relatively low level of risk. The proposed framework begins with identifying a set of climate conditions to represent the future vulnerability domain of the system using simulation analysis. The conditions identified in the simulation analysis are then used to develop a scenario-tree, to represent the manner in which the uncertainties may evolve over the course of the planning period. Next, optimal decisions are repeatedly explored through a multi-stage optimization model, by varying the probability weights employed in the scenario-tree. The resulting vector of optimal decisions are post-processed to identify robust choices that are least sensitive to the scenario probabilities.\nThe proposed planning framework is illustrated for the Niger Basin, over a 45-year planning period from 2015 to 2060. The Niger Basin is a transboundary system facing a series of challenges including endemic poverty, inadequate infrastructure and weak adaptive capacity to climate variability and change. The case study assesses long-term economic benefits from four new dam projects, and from a range of expansions across the eleven irrigation zones. The climate scenarios are obtained by first generating new climate variability realizations from a stochastic weather generator, and then placing climate change factors on the generated climate realizations. Basin runoff response to climate scenarios are simulated by a series of monthly, two-compartment water balance models. Long-term economic benefits are estimated from the sectors of irrigated agriculture, hydropower, navigation, fishing, and environmental protection, using a mixed-integer linear program (MILP).",

            "abstract": "ePoster - GEOPHYS205_FinalProject_4.5by6.pdf\nSoil deposits in hillside slopes often exhibit two dominant porosity scales, often referred to as the macropore and micropore scales. Fluid flow through this type of soils involves preferential flow through the macropore region and fluid storage in the micropore region. An explicit treatment of the two porosity scales, known as double porosity formulation, is necessary for a more realistic description of the hydromechanical behavior of this type of soils. In this work, we investigate how double porosity modeling of fluid flow and deformation could impact the ensuing hydromechanical responses of a hillslope under rainfall infiltration. For this purpose we use a hydromechanical continuum modeling approach developed in previous work by the authors and extend it to accommodate double porosity modeling by employing a recently developed hydromechanical framework along with a stabilized finite elements technique that allows the use of lower-order mixed finite elements for improved computationally efficiency. The numerical results demonstrate that preferential flow can be captured by the double porosity formulation, leading to a different slope failure mechanism than what is predicted by an equivalent single porosity formulation.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the source and role of lower energy electrons in the acceleration of radiation belt electrons. While many of the studies of outer radiation belt study focus on high energy relativistic (>1 MeV) electrons, the lower energy source (few keV) and seed (10s-100s keV) populations often control the generation of these higher energy electrons. This acceleration process begins with the source population generating the waves that can then accelerate the seed population up to relativistic energies. Previous studies\n[1]\nhave shown that if one of these pieces is missing, the entire acceleration process breaks down. For this study, using data from both the Van Allen Probes and geostationary sources (GOES, LANL-GEO) we identify several interesting events that have different levels of seed and source populations. For these events, we investigate both the spatial and temporal evolution of both of these populations. In particular, we investigate the origin of these populations to see whether these populations originate in the magnetotail or if there is any evidence of local acceleration source in the inner magnetosphere. Ultimately, we quantify how differing inputs of source and seed electrons lead to acceleration (or lack thereof) in the radiation belts.\n\n[1] Jaynes et al. (2015)",

The SDGs build on the apparent success in meeting many of the Millenium Development Goals, including those of reducing poverty, hunger and debt and providing access to water. The science needed to achieve and monitor most of these goals is social science - an area of scholarship that is traditionally undervalued, underfunded, underepresented misunderstood and lacking in detailed data.\nThis paper will provide an overview of the social science that is needed to support the Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus on the challenges of monitoring social data over time and within countries, the importance of research design, and of building capacity and credibility in the social sciences. As an example, the paper will discuss the social science that will be needed to achieve Goal 13: Take urgent actions to combat climate change and its impacts, and measuring targets such as strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity, and raising capacities of women, youth, and marginalized communities to manage and respond climate change.",

In more mature rifts, magmatism is frequently recognized as a driving factor in rift propagation; however, the amagmatic nature of the Malawi rift permits investigation into the relationship between pre-existing structures and current rift propagation, without the influence of magmatism. To map surface structures, we used Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and RADARSAT imagery over southern Malawi. To process the SRTM data, we applied edge enhancing filters and derivatives, and extracted topographic profiles to examine scarp height and minimum vertical exposed displacement. We mapped morphologically-defined structures by filtering the RADARSAT imagery using an enhanced lee filter to reduce noise and a Laplacian filter for edge enhancement. To examine Precambrian basement structures, we filtered aeromagnetic data using vertical and horizontal derivatives, tilt derivative, and analytic signal to create magnetic anomaly maps. Surface mapping indicated three primary trends in the southern Malawi rift: NW-SE (dominant), NE-SW, both of which are most likely the remnants of Mesozoic Karoo rifting, and a NNE-SSW trend seen in Neogene rifting. The Precambrian basement structural mapping also reveals three primary trends: WNW-ESE, NE-SW, and NW-SE. Ductile deformation causes the dominant basement fabric to change, switching polarity as the rift propagated southward from NE-SW orientation to NW-SE and WNW-ESE orientations, and back to a NE-SW orientation. In general, the surficial structures follow this trend. In some areas, however, the more recent rifting cut across pre-existing basement structures, possibly due to rheological heterogeneities or selective strain partitioning. Nonetheless, pre-existing basement structures played a critical role in strain localization and fault propagation in Malawi. However, sometimes other geological factors might have influenced structural orientation.",

Globally, soil uptake is one of main sinks of CO. On local scale, soil can be either a net sink or a net source of CO, due to the fact that both consumption and production of CO take place in soil concomitantly. These two phenomena are independent: while the uptake is microbial, the production is from abiotic oxidation of organic matter.\nIn order to determine the isotopic signature of the exchange of CO between soil and atmosphere, soil chamber experiments were performed at a forest site in the Netherlands. Flaks samples were filled from the soil chamber, and analyzed for the stable isotopes 13C and 18O using the high precision measurement facility at IMAU. We found that the uptake of CO by soil is associated with a small positive fractionation, i.e. the lighter CO is taken up faster. Although the soil at this site was a strong sink for CO, the isotopic data show that a small emission flux was also present in all cases. The isotopic composition of the emitted CO is depleted in 13C compared to atmospheric CO, and compatible with a source from plant and soil organic matter oxidation.",

Its complex system, including magma reservoirs and rift zones, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of magma transport and supply. The models explaining the system are yet limited to the first order analytical solutions with fixed geometry. To obtain a 4D map of the volume changes at the Kilauea summit magmatic system (KSMS), we implement a novel geometry-free time-dependent inverse modeling scheme, using a distribution of point center of dilatations (PCDs). The model is constrained using high resolution surface deformation data, which are obtained through InSAR time series analysis of well populated SAR data sets acquired at two overlapping tracks of Envisat satellite during 2003 and 2011. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the 4D maps of volume change identifies five major active reservoir beneath Kilauea caldera. The southern caldera reservoir (SCR) gains volume slowly till 2006 before its rapid inflation during 2006 – mid-2007, followed by deflation until the start of re-inflation in mid-2010. Other reservoirs show episodic temporal correlation and anti-correlation with SCR. We found that the top-down relation between reservoirs at the Kilauea summit is not necessarily valid at all time scales. Identifying statistically significant PCDs through Chi-square test, we develop and apply a boundary element modeling scheme to solve for the volume change time series and complex geometry of the summit magmatic system. Availability of such models allows realistic estimates of volume change and associated seismic hazard and enhance the forecast models.",

NYCMetNet is a network of weather stations, which report meteorological conditions in and around New York City, as part of the Optical Remote Sensing Laboratory of The City College of New York (ORSL). Of interest to this study is the data obtained from wind profiler station LSC01. The 915 MHz wind profiler is located 30m above the ground on the roof of the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, NJ. It is a Vaisala Wind Profiler LAP 3000 with a wavelength of ~34cm, which means that the instrument responds primarily to Bragg backscattering.\nCan a seasonal urban boundary layer climatology be extrapolated from the data obtained from the wind profiler? What is the timing of boundary layer evolution and collapse over Jersey City? How effective is the profiler under cloudy skies and even in light rain or snow? This study examines the entire time period covered by the wind profile (2007 to present) and selects a series of clear days and a series of cloudy days. The top of the urban boundary layer is subjectively located from each half hour time stamp of signal to noise values. The urban boundary layer heights are recorded for clear and then cloudy days. Then the days are sorted seasonally (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON). A seasonal mean is calculated for every half hour time step. Finally a time series of seasonal urban boundary layer heights is constructed, and the timing of the urban boundary layer height maximum and time evolution and collapse of the boundary layer are generalized. A comparison is made against urban boundary layer heights obtained from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis For Research And Applications (MERRA).",

It is a product of WIFIRE’s objective to build an end-to-end cyberinfrastructure for real-time and data-driven simulation, prediction and visualization of wildfire behavior. geoKepler includes a set of reusable GIS components, or actors, for the Kepler Scientific Workflow System (\nhttps://kepler-project.org\n). Actors exist for reading and writing GIS data in formats such as Shapefile, GeoJSON, KML, and using OGC web services such as WFS. The actors also allow for calling geoprocessing tools in other packages such as GDAL and GRASS. Kepler integrates functions from multiple platforms and file formats into one framework, thus enabling optimal GIS interoperability, model coupling, and scalability. Products of the GIS actors can be fed directly to models such as FARSITE and WRF. Kepler’s ability to schedule and scale processes using Hadoop and Spark also makes geoprocessing ultimately extensible and computationally scalable.\nThe reusable workflows in geoKepler can be made to run automatically when alerted by real-time environmental conditions. Here, we show breakthroughs in the speed of creating complex data for hazard assessments with this platform. We also demonstrate geoKepler workflows that use Data Assimilation to ingest real-time weather data into wildfire simulations, and for data mining techniques to gain insight into environmental conditions affecting fire behavior. Existing machine learning tools and libraries such as R and MLlib are being leveraged for this purpose in Kepler, as well as Kepler’s Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) capability to provide a framework for scalable processing.\ngeoKepler workflows can be executed via an iPython notebook as a part of a Jupyter hub at UC San Diego for sharing and reporting of the scientific analysis and results from various runs of geoKepler workflows. The communication between iPython and Kepler workflow executions is established through an iPython magic function for Kepler that we have implemented.\nIn summary, geoKepler is an ecosystem that makes geospatial processing and analysis of any kind programmable, reusable, scalable and sharable.",

            "abstract": "Nongravitational forces, including electrostatic forces and cohesion, can drive the behavior of regolith in low gravity environments such as the Moon and asteroids. Regolith is the ‘skin’ of solid planetary bodies: it is the outer coating that is observed by orbiters and the first material contacted by landers. Triboelectric charging, the phenomenon by which electrical charge accumulates during the collision or rubbing of two surfaces, has been found to occur in initially electrically neutral granular mixtures. Although charge transfer is often attributed to chemical differences between the different materials, charge separation has also been found to occur in mixtures containing grains of a single material, but with a variety of grain sizes. In such cases, the charge always separates according to grain size; typically the smaller grains acquire a more negative charge than the larger grains. Triboelectric charging may occur in a variety of planetary phenomena (including mass wasting and dust storms) as well as during spacecraft-surface interactions (including sample collection and wheel motion). Interactions between charged grains or with the solar wind plasma could produce regolith motion. However, a validated, predictive model of triboelectric charging between dielectric grains has not yet been developed. A model for such size-dependent charge separation will be presented, demonstrating how random collisions between initially electrically neutral grains lead to net migration of electrons toward the smaller grains. The model is applicable to a wide range of single-material granular mixtures, including those with unusual or wildly varying size distributions, and suggests a possible mechanism for the reversal of the usual size-dependent charge polarity described above. This is a significant improvement over existing charge exchange models, which are restricted to two discrete grains sizes and provide severely limited estimates for charge magnitude. We will also discuss the design of an experiment planned to test the charging estimates provided by the model presented and the potential implications for our understanding of regolith behavior.",

Thermodynamical quantities are defined and obtained by fitting model functions to the electron distributions sampled by the THEMIS spacecraft. We find that while the core is compressed, the halo is often deflated behind the shock. Both are isotropically heated on a timescale of less than three seconds, and the ratio of the downstream to upstream temperature is a factor five to six for both populations.\nThe partial pressure ratio between the solar wind core and halo populations is of the order of 10 both upstream and downstream. The\nκ\nof the halo Kappa distribution goes from an upstream value of\nκ\nup\n=2.5\nto a downstream value\nκ\ndown\n=4.5\n, taking the halo from a critically balanced non-equilibrium thermodynamical state in the solar wind to a state in thermal near-equilibrium behind the shock.\nWe find that there is an inverse dependence of the core and halo temperature, density,\nκ\nand energy density upon the Mach number. Slower shocks are more effective at compressing and heating the core and the halo.\nThe difference in electron energy density normalized to incident proton kinetic energy density is inversely dependent on Mach number. At Earth's bow shock, the core electron heating accounts for around 10\\% of the available incident ram energy, while the halo only 1\\%. This quantitiy depends on Mach number but does not seem to depend on the shock\nθ\nBn\nangle.",

            "abstract": "VIIRS Nightfire (VNF) had been proved being able to effectively detect gas flares at night, and characterize their temperature and source size. [1] However, limited access to generally confidential gas flare operation measurements made it difficult to verify the output. Although flared gas volume is occasionally available, it is not common to log the temperature and flames size which directly links to VNF output.\nTo understand the mechanism of gas flare and how VIIRS perceives the event, a platform is proposed to simulate the gas flare being observed by VIIRS. The methodology can be described in three steps. (1) Use CFD simulation software ISIS-3D to simulate a simple gas flare. [2] Scalar fields of temperature and species concentration related to combustion are extracted from the simulation. The instantaneous scalar can be determined from time-averaging or guess by stochastic time and space series (TASS) from single-point statistics [3]. (2) Model spectral radiance intensity of simulated gas flare using RADCAL. [4] RADCAL developed by NIST can accurately model the spectral radiance emitted on the direction of lineof-sight given the spatial profile of temperature and concentration of species. (3) Use radiative transfer modeling to calculate the energy propagated to VIIRS. The modeled radiation will then be weighted by the MODTRAN [5] modeled transmissivity over predefined atmosphere to the satellite, with geometrical effects considered.\nSuch platform can help understanding how exactly VNF is measuring gas flares, and thus lead to more precise characterization of combustion events.\n[1] C.

            "abstract": "Recent studies of ductile peridotite shear zones in the Josephine Peridotite in SW Oregon find higher helium concentrations in whole rock samples located where total strain is greatest and recrystallized grain sizes are smallest. Based upon these results, previous workers suggest that dynamic recrystallization may lead to increased storage of He on grain boundaries. To assess the feasibility of this mechanism for enhanced He storage, we utilize a combined set of new and previous data from Shear Zone A (SZA) and B (SZB) of the Fresno Bench of the Josephine Peridotite to constrain a 1D numerical model of a ductile shear zone; the combined data set includes both He concentrations as well as measured total strain across the shear zone. Existing data within the region of highest strain (0 to ~2.5 m from the center of each shear zone) are sparse and, thus, we strategically sampled locations within this zone to maximize data resolution across a range of total strain. In each sample, we measure helium concentrations in unserpentinized harzburgite bulk rock using mass spectrometry. Analysis of the orientation of pyroxene foliation planes compared to shear planes provides an estimation of shear strain during deformation. Numerically, our model is discretized using finite differences and incorporates a non-linear, temperature-dependent viscosity, shear heating, and dynamic recrystallization. Here, we present our newly compiled collection of helium concentrations relative to total strain within SZA and SZB and measured grain sizes, which are used to constrain the modeled equilibrium grain size and quantitatively test dynamic recrystallization as a mechanism for concentrating He within peridotite shear zones.",

            "abstract": "The southern La Plata Basin, located in southeastern South America (SESA), a region of great importance because of its hydrological characteristics, the fact that it has the largest population density and is one of the most productive regions in terms of agriculture, cattle raising and industry of the continent, has been identified as a strong hotspot between soil moisture (SM) and the atmosphere by different regional studies.\nAmong them, Ruscica et al. (2014, Atmos. Sci. Let, Int. J. Climatol.), and Spennemann et al. (2015, Int. J. Climatol.) show, through different modeling approaches, the presence of strong soil moisture-precipitation and evapotranspiration interactions during austral summer in SESA, revealing similar hotspots. Nevertheless these studies have diverse limitations related to model assumptions and to vegetation parameterizations, as well as the lack of observational data for the evaluation of models performance (Ferguson and Wood, 2011, J. of Hydrometeorology).\nOn the other hand, in the last decade several instruments on board satellites are providing soil moisture products globally and in a continuous way. A recent work by Grings et al. (2015, IEEE JSTARS, in press), done over the Pampas Plains in SESA showed characteristic soil moisture patterns that follow the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) under extreme wet and dry conditions\nIn order to deepen and overcome some of the mentioned model limitations, this work adds satellite soil moisture and vegetation products in the spatio-temporal analysis of the regions of strong soil moisture-atmosphere interactions. The main objectives and related outcomes are: the verification of already identified regions where soil moisture anomalies may have an influence on subsequent precipitation, evapotranspiration and temperature anomalies, and the study of their seasonal characteristics and land cover influences.",

            "abstract": "As atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide levels continue to increase, it is critical that terrestrial ecosystem models can accurately predict ecological responses to the changing environment. Current predictions of net primary productivity (NPP) in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations are highly variable and contain a considerable amount of uncertainty. It is necessary that we understand which factors are driving this uncertainty. The Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments have equipped us with a rich data source that can be used to calibrate and validate these model predictions.\nTo identify and evaluate the assumptions causing inter-model differences we performed model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis across ambient and elevated CO2 treatments using the Data Assimilation Linked Ecosystem Carbon (DALEC) model and the Ecosystem Demography Model (ED2), two process-based models ranging from low to high complexity respectively. These modeled process responses were compared to experimental data from the Kennedy Space Center Open Top Chamber Experiment, the Nevada Desert Free Air CO2 Enrichment Facility, the Rhinelander FACE experiment, the Wyoming Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment Experiment, the Duke Forest Face experiment and the Oak Ridge Experiment on CO2 Enrichment.\nBy leveraging data access proxy and data tilling services provided by the BrownDog data curation project alongside analysis modules available in the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn), we produced automated, repeatable benchmarking workflows that are generalized to incorporate different sites and ecological models. Combining the observed patterns of uncertainty between the two models with results of the recent FACE-model data synthesis project (FACE-MDS) can help identify which processes need further study and additional data constraints. These findings can be used to inform future experimental design and in turn can provide informative starting point for data assimilation.",

            "abstract": "Disruptive events, both natural and man-made, can have widespread impacts on both natural systems and lifeline infrastructure networks leading to the loss of biodiversity and essential functionality, respectively. Projected sea-level rise and climate change can further increase the frequency and severity of large-scale floods on urban-coastal megacities. Nevertheless, Failure in infrastructure systems can trigger cascading impacts on dependent ecosystems, and vice-versa. An important consideration in the behavior of the isolated networks and inter-connected networks following disruptive events is their resilience, or the ability of the network to “bounce back” to a pre-disaster state. Conventional risk analysis and subsequent risk management frameworks have focused on identifying the components’ vulnerability and strengthening of the isolated components to withstand these disruptions. But high interconnectedness of these systems, and evolving nature of hazards, particularly in the context of climate extremes, make the component level analysis unrealistic. In this study, we discuss the complex network-based resilience framework to understand fragility and recovery strategies for infrastructure systems impacted by climate-related hazards. We extend the proposed framework to assess the response of ecological networks to multiple species loss and design the restoration management framework to identify the most efficient restoration sequence of species, which can potentially lead to disproportionate gains in biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "The effect of fractures on the physical properties of porous media is of considerable interest to oil and gas exploration as well as enhanced geothermal systems and carbon capture and storage. This work represents an attempt to study the effect fractures have on multiple physical properties of rocks. An experimental technique to make simultaneous electric and ultrasonic measurements on cylindrical core plugs is developed. Aluminum end caps are mounted with ultrasonic transducers to transmit pules along the axis of the cylinder while non-polarizing electrodes are mounted on the sides of the core to make complex conductivity measurements perpendicular to the cylinder axis. Electrical measurements are made by applying a sinusoidal voltage across the measurement circuit that consist of a resister and the sample in series. The magnitude and phase of the signal across the sample is recorded relative to the input signal across a range of frequencies.\nSynthetic rock analogs are constructed using sintered glass beads with fractures imbedded in them. The fracture location, size and orientation are controlled and each fractured specimen has an unfractured counterpart. Porosity, Permeability, electrical conductivity and ultrasonic velocity measurements are conducted on each sample with the complex electrical conductivities recorded at frequencies from 10hz to 1 Mhz. These measurements allow us to examine the changes induced by these mesoscale fractures on the embedding porous medium. Of particular interest is the effect of fracture orientation on electrical conductivity of the rock. Seismic anisotropy caused by fractures is a well understood phenomenon with many rock physics models dedicated to its understanding. The effect of fractures on electrical conductivity is less well understood with electrical anisotropy scarcely investigated in the literature. None the less, using electrical conductivity to characterize fractures can add an extra constraint to characterization based on seismic response. As well, the formal similarity between electrical conductivity and permeability can be utilized to help optimize injection and production strategies.",

We determined risk to natural hazards in the community of Motozintla located in southern Mexico in the state of Chiapas (15.37ºN, 92.25ºW. Due to its geographical and geological location, this community is continuously exposed mainly to earthquakes, landslides and floods. We developed integrated studies and analysis of seismic zonation, landslides and flood susceptibility using standard methodologies. Vulnerability was quantified from data collected from local families interviews considering five social variables: characteristics of housing construction, availability of basic public services, family economic conditions, existing community plans for disaster preparedness, and risk perception. Local families surveyed were randomly selected considering a sample statistically significant. Our results were spatially represented using a Geographical Information System (GIS). Structural vulnerability curves were generated for typical housing constructions. Our integrated risk analysis demonstrates that the community of Motozintla has a high level of structural and socio-economical risk to floods and earthquakes. More than half of the population does not know any existing Civil Protection Plan and perceive that they are in high risk to landslides and floods. Although the community is located in a high seismic risk zone, most of the local people believe that cannot be impacted by a large earthquake. These natural and social conditions indicate that the community of Motozintla has a very high level of risk to natural hazards. This research will support local decision makers in developing an integrated comprehensive natural hazards mitigation and prevention program.",

Working with Taking Neighborhood Health to Heart (TNH2H), a Denver-based neighborhood group with significant experience doing community-based participatory research (CBPR) related to improving individual and community health, we designed a project to help residents test their homes for two contaminants of interest: radon and perchloroethylene. Radon is naturally occurring and commonly found across Colorado. Perchloroethylene contamination has been discovered in other parts of Denver and residents of Northeast Denver would like to learn more about its possible presence in their neighborhood. Additionally while radon is simple to test for, the same cannot be said for perchloroethylene. This project provides an opportunity to pilot a low-cost sampling method for perchloroethylene, apply TNH2H’s CBPR model to an environmental health issue, adapt it for the geosciences, and engage the community in education around air quality issues. Data collected during the project will be shared with participating homes and the larger community. Community members will also participate in understanding and interpreting the data, and together community members and scientists will plan possible next steps, which may involve conducting further research, taking community action, or recommending changes in policy and practice.\nBeyond the local impacts, we are testing an air quality sampling method that could make sampling more accessible to a broader range of communities. We are also learning more about how communities and scientists can best work together and what additional resources can help facilitate and ensure successful implementation of these types of projects. Our partner, the Thriving Earth Exchange, will use what we learn to facilitate scientist-community partnerships like this in other communities around the world. We need to understand how to effectively engage in these partnerships because this model will allow us to collect and utilize much more data, particularly at the local level. This model of scientist-community collaboration is an important strategy for maximizing the public good that comes from geoscience research.\n  ",

It accomplishes this by using feedforward neural networks to automatically infer the upper hybrid resonance frequency, 𝑓𝑢h𝑟, from plasma wave measurement, which is then used to determine the electron number density. In previous missions, the plasma resonance bands were manually identified, and there have been few attempts to do robust, routine automated detection (Kurth et al. [JGR, 2014]). We describe the design and implementation of the algorithm, as well as the resulting electron number density distribution. Resulting densities are compared with the densities obtained by Kurth et al.

The analysis of the conditions, under which densities obtained by the proposed method differ significantly from the model of Sheeley et al. [JGR, 2001], is presented. Finally, we discuss the dependence of the electron number density on magnetic activity (Kp) and magnetic local time.",

            "abstract": "Recent observational studies highlighted the need to include explicit treatment of the soil microbial processes into the next generation of Earth System Models (ESMs). These processes shape most soil biogeochemical cycles and control releases of the most potent greenhouses gases carbon dioxide and methane. Currently global ecosystem models usually parameterize methane production as a fraction of soil heterotrophic respiration. This lumps the pathways of several different functional groups of microbes into one production rate, possibly modified by a number of environmental factor multipliers. Methane oxidation is usually more explicitly modeled by Michaelis–Menten kinetics, but if the maximum rate, before environmental multipliers, is a constant parameter, this essentially implies a constant methanotrophic microbe population size. We present an explicit model for wetland soil microbial processes in an ESM context. We introduce a growth and decomposition model for four functional groups of microbes involved in methane production and oxidation, so microbial populations can grow when conditions are favorable and substrate is available. When soil conditions are anoxic, fermenting microbes transform available soil carbon into intermediate substrates, and two different kinds of methanogenic microbes live on their preferred substrates producing methane. Methane is transported through aerobic layers of the soil column, where methanotrophic microbes oxidize part of the methane, and the rest escapes to the atmosphere. We present initial simulations using the new model in the context of existing measurements of methane emissions and microbial populations at the site level, and discuss the implications of including these processes in an ESM. This explicit process model establishes a foundation for improving dynamic ecosystem-climate feedbacks in ESM simulations, and facilitates more detailed experimental verification of wetland biogeochemical processes.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the relationship between observed maximum extremes of ozone, PM2.5, temperature over eastern North America during 15 extended summer seasons (April-September, 1999-2013). We use an objective mapping algorithm to calculate a 1° x 1° grid-cell averaged product of (1) the maximum daily 8-hour average of surface ozone abundance and (2) the daily average PM2.5 abundance from surface monitoring networks in the US and Canada. In addition, we use ECMWF reanalysis data to generate a 1° x 1° grid-cell averaged product of (3) the maximum temperature at 2-meter height. The extreme maxima for these 3 data sets are defined at each grid cell as the 50 days with the highest value in three 5-year windows (~94.5 percentile of all Apr-Sep days). These extremes for ozone, particles and temperature are denoted OX, PX, and TX, respectively.\nExtreme ozone and PM2.5 most often occur together (35% of OX and PX events in a cell occur simultaneously), followed by PM2.5 and temperature (29%), ozone and temperature (27%), and all three (15%). In all cases, the greatest co-occurrence is found in the northeast US (>50% for two co-occurring events). We find that the day after any extreme is also likely to be an extreme of any kind (p > 75%) and that the most likely follow-on extreme is of the same type (p = 20-40%). The northeast US is an exception where OX are more likely to be followed by PX.\nExtreme episodes (defined as multi-day, spatially connected events) typically originate as an OX event, followed by PX and then TX. This ordering is also evident in the generalized spatial structure of episodes: OX occur at the center and the eastern leading edge, PX are found to the immediate northwest, and TX surround the OX and PX events. The largest OX and PX episodes are similar in size, but TX episodes are usually larger and longer lasting. In general, extremes are more likely to co-occur for larger episodes.\nThe intensity of OX, PX, and TX events is measured as the % above the 5-year mean. It is greatest for any of these 3 extremes when it co-occurs with another extreme, and greatest when all three extremes occur together.",

Called SIPS (Scanning Ionospheric Photometer System), it integrates a photometer with a scanning mirror providing almost continuous monitoring of the night-side ionosphere. SIPS will be able to monitor features such as plasma irregularities, which can have deleterious effects on satellite positioning and HF communications. SIPS will help understand the nature of geospace perturbations as well as predict space weather. Requiring minimal power and volume, SIPS enables a number of research and science missions for NSF and NASA, as well as space situational awareness operational missions for the Air Force, that can be conducted from low cost to access to space platforms. In this paper we review the novel sensor observation technique and the modular design which makes SIPS compatible with nano and μsatellites, enabling big missions from small packages.",

            "abstract": "Mantle plumes are generally implicated for flood basalt generation in both continental and oceanic environments by impact of large plume heads beneath or within the lithosphere. The Deccan and Siberian flood basalt eruptions, synchronous with the Cretaceous-Paleogene and end-Permian extinctions, respectively, continue to fascinate geoscientists in search for the “kill-mechanisms” by impacts, volcanisms or both. Recently, Richards et al. (2015) proposed that bulk of the Deccan eruption was triggered by the Chicxulub impact.\nWe showed (Basu et al., 1993) that early (68.5 Ma) and late (65 Ma) alkalic pulses of the Deccan were before and after the impact event at 66 Ma. Here, we focus on an extensive volcano-stratigraphic study of Pb isotopic systematics of 69 basaltic samples from 3 subgroups and 12 formations of the Deccan, each sampled from bottom to top along the stratigraphic section, covering the 3km thick 12 Deccan formations. Pb is sensitive to crustal contamination of mantle plume-derived magmas as both the upper and lower mantle are low in Pb (0.02 – 0.15 ppm) compared to ~ 4 ppm in continental crust. The lower Deccan formations of Kalsubai and Lonavala have initial 206Pb/204Pb with a widely varying range (16.543 – 22.823) indicating continental crustal contamination. In contrast, the upper formations of the Wai subgroup show a narrow range of 16.883 to 18.956, reflecting the plume signature. In addition, the 206Pb/204Pb and 207Pb/204Pb data of the Kalsubai subgroup lavas give an isochron age of 2603±140 Ma (single-stage, µ = 8). The Wai subgroup shows a narrow and restricted Pb isotopic range plotting closer to the Geochron. We interpret these data to infer that the basement rocks of the Deccan, the Archean Indian craton, were assimilated by the upwelling melt, ultimately clearing the conduit passages for the lavas sourced from direct melting of the plume head.",

            "abstract": "This research uses with stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) as a tool to reveal economic information about managed water resources. An application to the operation of an example hydropower reservoir is presented. SDP explicitly balances the marginal value of water for immediate use and its expected opportunity cost of not having more water available for future use. The result of an SDP analysis is a steady state policy, which gives the optimal decision as a function of the state. A commonly applied form gives the optimal release as a function of the month, current reservoir level and current inflow to the reservoir. The steady state policy can be complemented with a real-time management strategy, that can depend on more real-time information. An information-theoretical perspective is given on how this information influences the value of water, and how to deal with that influence in hydropower reservoir optimization. This results in some conjectures about how the information gain from real-time operation could affect the optimal long term policy. Another issue is the sharing of increased benefits that result from this information gain in a multi-objective setting. It is argued that this should be accounted for in negotiations about an operation policy.",

            "abstract": "Shear flows long observed in solar active regions are now understood to be a consequence of the Lorentz force that develops from a complex interaction between magnetic fields and the thermal pressure of the Sun's gravitationally stratified atmosphere. The shearing motions transport magnetic flux and energy from the submerged portion of the field to the corona providing the necessary energy for flares, filament eruptions and CMEs. To further examine this shearing process, we simulate flux emergence on the scale of active regions with a large-scale model of the near surface convection zone constructed on an adaptive spherical grid. This model is designed to simulate flux emerging on the scale of active regions from a depth of 30 Mm. Here, we show results of a twisted flux rope emerging through the hierarchy of granular convection, and examine the flow patterns that arise as the flux approaches the photosphere. We show how these organized flows driven by the Lorentz force cause the coronal field evolve to a highly non-potential configuration capable of driving solar eruptions such as CMEs and flares.",

            "abstract": "Large scale river basin management has long been a challenging task. Stakeholder involvement has often been posited as a means to provide a broad base of input and support for management decisions. This has been successful in some situations and not in others.\nThe Desert Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) has proposed a novel approach to large scale watershed management for conservation purposes by stakeholders. This approach involves conducting a multi-day stakeholder forum to gather interested parties, provide them science-based information about the watershed, and solicit their input regarding the research and management needs within the basin. Included within this forum is a Water Tournament patterned after those being developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Institute for Water Resources. These tournaments bring stakeholders (such as the various water users, agencies, conservation organizations, and others) in small teams that develop watershed management scenarios (within appropriate constraints) that are then judged based on their merit for addressing the various issues within the basin. These tournaments serve to educate participants and to sensitize them to the perspectives of other participants. Another goal of the forum is to recruit a representative group of stakeholders who will provide guidance for further research to meet the basins management needs.\nThe South Central Climate Science Center (SC CSC) has partnered with the Desert, Southern Rockies, Gulf Coast Prairie, Great Plains, and Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCCs to implement this approach in the Rio Grande and the Red River Basins. The LCCs are well positioned to convene stakeholders from across political boundaries and throughout these basins. The SC CSC’s roles will be providing leadership, funding climate science for the effort, and evaluating the effectiveness of the forum-centered approach.",

Rocks are heterogeneous at a wide range of length scales, and investigating how these non-uniformities affect the propagation and extent of fractures is vital to improving both the safety and efficiency of hydraulic fracturing operations. To study these effects we have developed a model system using brittle, heavily cross-linked hydrogels that we can fracture with fluids and observe with a fast camera (Livne et al. 2004). By embedding tracer particles within the gel and using laser sheet microscopy, we obtain three dimensional stress and strain maps of the zone surrounding a hydraulic fracture tip. Gels can also be set in layers or interfaces with tunable strengths or with designed heterogeneities, allowing us to understand the fundamental science of hydraulic fractures and investigate the dynamics of controllably complex materials.",

It is a collaborative effort that aims to be an honest broker in the shale gas conversation by involving multiple entities (including universities, government agencies, industry groups, nonprofits, etc.) to collect, analyze, and disseminate data that describe the past and current conditions of water in the Marcellus shale region. A critical component of this project has been to engage multiple types of stakeholders – academia, government agencies, industry, and citizen science groups – in annual workshops to present and discuss how to ensure the integrity of water resources in light of the challenges that natural gas extraction can present. Each workshop has included a hands-on activity that allows participants to access water quality data using the tools provided by the CUAHSI Water Data Center. One of these tools is HydroDesktop, which is an open source GIS application that can be used in formal and informal education settings as a geoscience research tool. In addition to being a GIS, HydroDesktop accesses CUAHSI’s large catalog of water data thus enabling students, professional researchers, and citizen scientists to discover data that can expand the understanding of water quality issues in one’s local environment and beyond. This presentation will highlight the goals of the Shale Network project and the stakeholders involved in addition to how cyberinfrastructure is being used to create a democratic, data-driven conversation about the relationship between energy production from shale gas and our water resources.",

Some of these samples had been exposed to circumneutral to slightly acidic alteration conditions from exposure to fog/rain, and acidic fog/rain, while others had been exposed to more acidic conditions due to proximity to fumaroles. The samples consisted of basalts with coatings, sands and soils, and ash, and were collected using organically clean protocols to enable investigation of organic chemistry and organic-mineral associations, in addition to mineralogy.\nThe Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover has analyzed basaltic materials inferred to have been altered under conditions ranging from circumneutral to acidic, but several aspects of the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite results are still being investigated and analyses of relevant terrestrial analogs can play an important role in interpretation of the data. For example, all materials analyzed to date have a significant amorphous component. Comparisons of the mineralogy obtained with the MSL CheMin instrument and volatiles evolved during SAM analyses indicate that, by mass balance, some portion of the volatiles, such as SO2 and H2O, are likely associated with this component. Many of the RIS4E samples also have a significant amorphous component, and field x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) data indicate differences in the chemistry of this material in samples exposed to different alteration conditions. Preliminary SAM-like analyses indicate that the amorphous materials in some of these samples evolve volatiles such as H2O and SO2 during heating. Here we will discuss these results, and others, obtained through SAM-like analyses of selected samples.",

            "abstract": "South-central Kansas has experienced an unprecedented increase in seismic activity since 2013. The spatial and temporal relationship of the seismicity with brine disposal operations has renewed interest in the role of fluids in fault reactivation. This study focuses on determining the suitability of CO2 injection into a Cambro-Ordovician reservoir for long-term storage and a Mississippian reservoir for enhanced oil recovery in Wellington Field, Sumner County, Kansas. Our approach for determining the potential for induced seismicity has been to (1) map subsurface faults and estimate in-situ stresses, (2) perform slip and dilation tendency analysis to identify optimally-oriented faults relative to the estimated stress field, and (3) monitor surface deformation through cGPS data and InSAR imaging. Through the use of 3D seismic reflection data, 60 near vertical, NNE-striking faults have been identified. The faults range in length from 140-410 m and have vertical separations of 3-32m. A number of faults appear to be restricted to shallow intervals, while others clearly cut the top basement reflector. Drilling-induced tensile fractures (N=78) identified from image logs and inversion of earthquake focal mechanism solutions (N=54) are consistent with the maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) oriented ~E-W. Both strike-slip and normal-slip fault plane solutions for earthquakes near the study area suggest that SHmax and Sv may be similar in magnitude. Estimates of stress magnitudes using step rate tests (Shmin = 2666 psi), density logs (Sv = 5308 psi), and calculations from wells with drilling induced tensile fractures (SHmax = 4547-6655 psi) are determined at the gauge depth of 4869ft. Preliminary slip and dilation tendency analysis indicates that faults striking 0°-20° are stable, whereas faults striking 26°-44° may have a moderate risk for reactivation with increasing pore-fluid pressure.",

Scans of vertical faces of vegetation and rock outcrops were made close to the campus of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in an abandoned mine near Fairbanks, and on exposures of Orange Hill in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. Atmospherically corrected integrated VNIR_SWIR spectra were extracted which helped to study varying nitrogen content in the vegetation, and helped to distinguish the various micas. Processed imagery helped to pull out carbonates, clays, sulfates, and alteration-related minerals. The same instrument was also mounted in airborne configuration on two different aircrafts, a DeHavilland Beaver and a Found Bush Hawk. Test flights were flown over urban and wilderness areas that presented a variety of landcover types. Processed imagery shows promise in mapping man-made surfaces, phytoplankton, and dissolved materials in inland water bodies.

            "abstract": "The science goal of the Europa multiple flyby mission is to “explore Europa to investigate its habitability”. One of the primary instruments selected for the scientific payload is a multi-frequency, multi-channel ice penetrating radar system. This “Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON)” would revolutionize our understanding of Europa’s ice shell by providing the first direct measurements of its surface character and subsurface structure. REASON addresses key questions regarding Europa’s habitability, including the existence of any liquid water, through the innovative use of radar sounding, altimetry, reflectometry, and plasma/particles analyses. These investigations require a dual-frequency radar (HF and VHF frequencies) instrument with concurrent shallow and deep sounding that is designed for performance robustness in the challenging environment of Europa. The flyby-centric mission configuration is an opportunity to collect and transmit minimally processed data back to Earth and exploit advanced processing approaches developed for terrestrial airborne data sets. The observation and characterization of subsurface features beneath Europa’s chaotic surface require discriminating abundant surface clutter from a relatively weak subsurface signal. Finally, the mission plan also includes using REASON as a nadir altimeter capable of measuring tides to test ice shell and ocean hypotheses as well as characterizing roughness across the surface statistically to identify potential follow-on landing sites. We will present a variety of measurement concepts for addressing these challenges.",

            "abstract": "Snow cover on Antarctic sea ice plays a key role in the evolution of ice thickness, its estimation from space-borne altimeters, and structuring of sea ice ecosystems. Yet until recently, there have been very few continuous observations of the seasonal evolution of snow cover on Antarctic sea ice. We present observations of the seasonal evolution of the snow cover from ice mass balance buoys (IMBs) deployed between 2009 and 2013 in the Weddell, Bellingshausen, and Amundsen Seas and the East Antarctic sector. In addition, automatic weather stations that provided direct observations of precipitation, accumulation, and blowing snow were deployed alongside IMBs in October, 2012 in the East Antarctic during the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment II (SIPEX II), and in July and August, 2013 in the Weddell Sea during the Antarctic Winter Ecosystem and Climate Study (AWECS). These buoys show markedly different snow accumulation regimes in each sector, although accumulation is also strongly controlled by the local morphology of the ice cover through snow erosion and deposition during blowing snow and precipitations events. Comparisons of snow accumulation from these buoys with estimates from atmospheric reanalysis and the direct measurements of precipitation and blowing snow show that precipitation is generally not a good estimator of snow accumulation. Improved treatment of blowing snow is needed if sea ice models are to accurately simulate Antarctic snow and sea ice mass balance. In summer, melting of the snow pack is relatively modest in most cases. Nevertheless, it appears to play an important role in governing sea ice hydrology and sea ice surface properties, and hence may play an important role in modulating sea ice primary productivity.",

            "abstract": "The first orbital bistatic radar (BSR) observations of a small body have been conducted opportunistically by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft at Asteroid Vesta using the telecommunications antenna aboard Dawn to transmit and the Deep Space Network 70-meter antennas on Earth to receive. Dawn’s high-gain communications antenna continuously transmitted right-hand circularly polarized radio waves (4-cm wavelength), and due to the opportunistic nature of the experiment, remained in a fixed orientation pointed toward Earth throughout each BSR observation. As a consequence, Dawn’s transmitted radio waves scattered from Vesta’s surface just before and after each occultation of the Dawn spacecraft behind Vesta, resulting in surface echoes at highly oblique incidence angles of greater than 85 degrees, and a small Doppler shift of ~2 Hz between the carrier signal and surface echoes from Vesta. We analyze the power and Doppler spreading of Vesta's surface echoes to assess surface roughness, and find that Vesta's area-normalized radar cross section ranges from -8 to -17 dB, which is notably much stronger than backscatter radar cross section values reported for the Moon's limbs (-20 to -35 dB). However, our measurements correspond to the forward scattering regime--such that at high incidence, radar waves are expected to scatter more weakly from a rough surface in the backscatter direction than that which is scattered forward. Using scattering models of rough surfaces observed at high incidence, we report on the relative roughness of Vesta's surface as compared to the Moon and icy Galilean satellites. Through this, we assess the dominant processes that have influenced Vesta’s surface roughness at centimeter and decimeter scales, which are in turn applicable to assisting future landing, sampling and orbital missions of other small bodies.",

            "abstract": "Most modeling studies of subduction under early Earth conditions have focused on the effect of higher mantle potential temperatures reducing mantle viscosity and affecting slab behavior. Very few, however, have adequately considered the fact that higher mantle temperatures should also result in thicker, more mafic oceanic crust entering subduction systems. Here we investigate this \"compositional effect\" by means of petrologic and geodynamic modeling.\nFirst, we construct the density profiles of sinking slabs under modern and early Earth conditions. To do so, we input a large set (>1200) of real mafic crust and mantle compositions into the thermodynamic modeling program Perple_X to estimate the density of predicted mineral assemblages stable in a slab within the upper 1000 km of the mantle. Upon combining these calculations with an analytical model for the thermal structure of subducted slabs, we find that unlike modern MORB compositions that are less dense than ambient mantle within the transition zone, predicted early earth MORB compositions are denser than ambient mantle at all depths.\nSecond, we investigate the geodynamical consequences of this effect with a finite-difference/particle-in-cell model of a subducted slab system. We find that, in addition to the previously identified influence of mantle temperature on viscosity, the key control on subducted slab behavior is the viscosity increase imposed at the base of the transition zone. However, the negative buoyancy resulting from an early Earth-like thick mafic crust may also play an important role under certain conditions. This compositional effect, previously underappreciated, results in slabs that more readily penetrate the transition zone, thereby promoting single-layered convection and effective mantle mixing.",

            "abstract": "Surface ocean absorption of anthropogenic CO2 emissions resulting in ocean acidification may interfere with the ability of calcifying marine organisms to biomineralize, since the drop in pH is accompanied by reductions in CaCO3 saturation state. However, recent experiments show that net calcification rates of cultured benthic invertebrate taxa exhibit diverse responses to pCO2-induced changes in saturation state (Ries et al., 2009). Advancement of geochemical tools as biomineralization indicators will enable us to better understand these results and therefore help predict the impacts of ongoing and future decrease in seawater pH on marine organisms. Here we build upon previous work on these specimens by measuring the elemental composition of biogenic calcite and aragonite precipitated in four pCO2 treatments (400; 600; 900; and 2850 ppm). Element ratios (including Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, B/Ca, U/Ca, Ba/Ca, Cd/Ca, and Zn/Ca) were analyzed in 18 macro-invertebrate species representing seven phyla (crustacea, cnidaria, echinoidea, rhodophyta, chlorophyta, gastropoda, bivalvia, annelida), then compared to growth rate data and experimental seawater carbonate system parameters: [CO32-], [HCO3-], pH, saturation state, and DIC. Correlations between calcite or aragonite composition and seawater carbonate chemistry are highly taxa-specific, but do not resemble trends observed in growth rate for all species. Apparent carbonate system sensitivities vary widely by element, ranging from strongly correlated to no significant response. Interpretation of these results is guided by mounting evidence for the capacity of individual species to modulate pH and/or saturation state at the site of calcification in response to ambient seawater chemistry. Such biomineralization pathways and strategies in turn likely influence elemental fractionation during CaCO3 precipitation.\nRies, J.B., A.L. Cohen, A.L., and D.C. McCorkle (2009), Marine calcifiers exhibit mixed responses to CO2-induced ocean acidification, Geology, 37(12), 1131-1134.",

            "abstract": "Many of the world’s multi-reservoir water resource systems are being considered for further development of hydropower and irrigation aiming to meet economic, political and ecological goals. Complex river basins serve many needs so how should the different proposed groupings of reservoirs and their operations be evaluated? How should uncertainty about future supply and demand conditions be factored in? What reservoir designs can meet multiple goals and perform robustly in a context of global change? We propose an optimized multi-criteria screening approach to identify best performing designs, i.e., the selection, size and operating rules of new reservoirs within multi-reservoir systems in a context of deeply uncertain change. Reservoir release operating rules and storage sizes are optimized concurrently for each separate infrastructure design under consideration across many scenarios representing plausible future conditions. Outputs reveal system trade-offs using multi-dimensional scatter plots where each point represents an approximately Pareto-optimal design. The method is applied to proposed Blue Nile River reservoirs in Ethiopia, where trade-offs between capital costs, total and firm energy output, aggregate storage and downstream irrigation and energy provision for the best performing designs are evaluated. The impact of filling period for large reservoirs is considered in a context of hydrological uncertainty. The approach is also applied to the Koshi basin in Nepal where combinations of hydropower storage and run-of-river dams are being considered for investment. We show searching for investment portfolios that meet multiple objectives provides stakeholders with a rich view on the trade-offs inherent in the nexus and how different investment bundles perform differently under plausible futures. Both case-studies show how the proposed approach helps explore and understand the implications of investing in new dams in a global change context.",

The presented study addresses optimization of system consisting of a limited number of observational platforms with respect to reduction of the uncertainties in monitoring the volume/freshwater/heat transports through a set of key sections in the Chukchi Sea and Bering Strait. Variational algorithms for optimization of observational arrays are verified in the test bed of the set of 4Dvar optimized summer-fall circulations in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean.

            "abstract": " Fe(II)-oxidizing microbes (FeOM) are thought to be key players in marine Fe cycling, particularly at hydrothermal vents. However, we do not have tools to track their activity, largely because we do not know the genes involved in neutrophilic chemolithotrophic Fe oxidation. Researchers have used gene homology between FeOM isolates to suggest several genes that may be involved in Fe(II) oxidation, including the Fe oxidase cyc2 found in the Zetaproteobacteria type strain Mariprofundus ferrooxydans, as well as all other known neutrophilic microaerophilic FeOM. Although many Zetaproteobacteria are found within natural Fe mats, close relatives of Fe(II)-oxidizing isolates are rarely present. Therefore, one goal of this study was to determine the activity of putative Fe(II) oxidation genes in dominant OTUs found in natural environments. We collected Fe mats from hydrothermal vents at Loihi Seamount, Hawaii, preserving RNA in situ. By analyzing metatranscriptomes of different Fe mat niches, we were able to determine the OTUs involved and the gene expression patterns associated with Fe(II) oxidation in the marine environment.\n  Analysis of metatranscriptomic data confirms that the Zetaproteobacteria express the various genes necessary to support the Fe mat community through chemoautotrophic growth. Globally ubiquitous and even some rare species of the Zetaproteobacteria were active, with different relative abundances depending on Fe mat niches defined by fluid flow and geochemistry. Initial results show that genes thought to be involved in the electron transport pathway from Fe(II) to O2, including cyc2, are some of the most highly expressed genes in marine Fe microbial mats. Species-specific variants of these genes suggest that many of the Zetaproteobacteria species, spanning the breadth of the diversity of the class, are expressing genes necessary for Fe(II) oxidation within natural Fe mat niches. Understanding the differential expression of these genes in different niches will enable us to quantify the activity of marine FeOM and their effect on Fe and associated element cycling within deep and coastal marine systems.",

The Gaseous Compounds team of the University of Houston Undergraduate Student Instrument Project (USIP) selected the parts and the students of the team are assembling the payload. The payload will launch on a latex balloon in Houston and Fairbanks, Alaska. The instrument will gather data on the concentration of certain gases in the atmosphere as well as a meteorological profile of the atmosphere. The students plan to have the instrument collect and transmit data on carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, as well as temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure. The data will also be stored on an SD card as a backup in case transmission fails. These payloads will fly at night and day to get an accurate vertical profile of the atmosphere and these results will be tested against the results of commercial hardware with the same capabilities.",

            "abstract": "The strong free tropospheric subsidence and the cool sea surface temperatures over the subtropical eastern Pacific Ocean often lead to a shallow and cloudy planetary boundary layer (PBL) capped by a strong inversion. These low PBL clouds are crucial for understanding the ocean-atmosphere interaction and the cloud-radiation feedback processes. However, accurate identification/representation of these clouds remains a key challenge in both satellite observations and global climate model simulations. Specifically, the cloud transition from the near-shore stratocumulus to trade-cumulus remains a huge challenge in climate models and warrants high-quality PBL observations from space.\nThe MODIS collection 6 cloud top height vastly improves the global PBL cloud top heights (CTH) compared to collection 5. However, the MODIS collection 6 CTH still shows systematic higher CTH than CALIPSO in the subtropical subsidence region, which is likely due to the underestimation of lapse rate. This study presents the seasonal climatology of PBL lapse rate derived from multi-year CALIPSO with co-incident MODIS CTT and AMSR-E SST measurements. The lapse rate climatology is validated by the high-resolution radiosonde observations and then used to derive the CTH from MODIS measurements. Comparison of the new lapse rate based MODIS CTH with CALIPSO CTH will be presented. The PBL height derived from the COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) GPS radio occultation (RO) will be used to evaluate the MODIS CTH as an independent dataset. The discrepancies over the transition from stratus to trade-cumuli regions (broken clouds) will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Wetland conversion (or reclamation) has been practiced since the dawn of civilization to this day, transforming biogeochemical cycles and threatening biodiversity, but record of wetland conversion are sparse and unreliable. A figure that “half of the world’s wetlands have been lost since the year 1900” is commonly cited despite its origin as an inadequate extrapolation from the US-Midwest in the 1950s. Recently, earth observation technologies have facilitated measurement of wetland cover but are limited temporally. Alternatively, meta-analyses of historical reclamation records suggest conversion rates exceeding 50% since 1900 but may be biased by the records coming mostly from highly-converted sites in recent times. Large reclamation projects during the early historical period are well known but not reliably quantified, shedding uncertainty on the natural wetland baseline relative to which conversion rates should be measured. Rates of loss based on relatively recent baselines (industrial/pre-settlement) cannot account for conversion prior to the baseline date, and may reinforce the perception of humans have substantially altered natural processes only recently.\nI estimate global wetland conversion with a geospatial approach based on maps of potential wetland cover and historical land cover (and irrigation) reconstructions, then compare estimates with historical records, thus bringing together the two main lines of evidence. Conversion is estimated as potential wetland areas undergoing change to ‘non-natural’ land cover, and estimates are contextualized relative to a Holocene natural wetland cover baseline. Potential wetland maps from vegetation and hydrological models that exclude drainage and water abstraction processes are used as they are the closest existing to natural wetland cover, despite being based on current-day climatology. To distinguish more types of reclamation practices than existing land cover classes, the GIS estimates are ‘calibrated’ regionally to match the historical records, and then used for an adjusted extrapolated estimate. Moreover, I distinguish a few broad wetland categories to estimate conversion rates specific to each one to test the hypothesis that certain types (e.g. riparian floodplain) have been more converted than others.",

Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data are the most accurate means to data to determine the grounding line on a large scale. The analysis of InSAR data from 1996 and 2011 shows a significant retreat of the grounding line in the Amundsen Sea Sector of West Antarctica along a retrograde bed. A new generation of spaceborne SAR sensors (Sentinel-1a, ALOS2) was launched in 2014 and has begun operational data collection since. Sentinel-1a collects data over ice sheets in a novel TOPSAR mode to provide large area coverage at relatively high resolution. Working closely with the ice sheet science community, ESA has implemented a data acquisition plan that ensures at least one ice sheet wide coverage per year and ongoing coverage in key coastal regions. The new mode, however does lead to some challenges in data processing.\nWith focus on glaciers in West Antarctica (in particular we look at Smith, Pope and Kohler Glaciers), we show the potential of Sentinel-1a for grounding line mapping. Combining data from several currently available missions, we provide a 2015 update for the grounding line in the region.",

            "abstract": "Rock within the upper crust appears to deform according to elasto-plastic constitutive rules, but structural geologists often employ kinematic descriptions that prescribe particle motions irrespective of these physical properties. In this contribution, we examine the range of constitutive properties that are approximately implied by kinematic models by comparing predicted deformations between mechanical and kinematic models for identical fault geometric configurations. Specifically, we use the ABAQUS finite-element package to model a fault-bend-fold geometry using an elasto-plastic constitutive rule (the elastic component is linear and the plastic failure occurs according to a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion). We varied physical properties in the mechanical model (i.e., Young’s modulus, Poisson ratio, cohesion yield strength, internal friction angle, sliding friction angle) to determine the impact of each on the observed deformations, which were then compared to predictions of kinematic models parameterized with identical geometries. We found that a limited sub-set of physical properties were required to produce deformations that were similar to those predicted by the kinematic models. Specifically, mechanical models with low cohesion are required to allow the kink at the bottom of the flat-ramp geometry to remain stationary over time. Additionally, deformations produced by steep ramp geometries (30 degrees) are difficult to reconcile between the two types of models, while lower slope gradients better conform to the geometric assumptions. These physical properties may fall within the range of those observed in laboratory experiments, suggesting that particle motions predicted by kinematic models may provide an approximate representation of those produced by a physically consistent model under some circumstances.",

The platforms supported and variables acquired are diverse, ranging from current sensing high frequency (HF) radar to autonomous gliders. The system incorporates data produced by other networks and experimental systems, further increasing the breadth of the collection. Strategies promoted by the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) ensure these data are not lost at sea. Every data set deserves a description. ISO and FGDC compliant metadata enables catalog interoperability and record-sharing. Extensive use of netCDF with the Climate and Forecast convention (identifying both metadata and a structured format) is shown to be a powerful strategy to promote discovery, interoperability, and re-use of the data. To integrate specialized data which are often obscure, quality control protocols are being developed to homogenize the QC and make these data more integrate-able. Data Assembly Centers have been established to integrate some specialized streams including gliders, animal telemetry, and HF radar. Subsets of data that are ingested into the National Data Buoy Center are also routed to the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) of the World Meteorological Organization to assure wide international distribution. From the GTS, data are assimilated into now-cast and forecast models, fed to other observing systems, and used to support observation-based decision making such as forecasts, warnings, and alerts. For a few years apps were a popular way to deliver these real-time data streams to phones and tablets. Responsive and adaptive web sites are an emerging flexible strategy to provide access to the regional coastal ocean observations.",

            "abstract": "Current theory does not adequately explain diverging patterns of future drought stress predicted by Earth system models (ESMs) across tropical South America, Africa, and equatorial Asia. By 2100 for the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) many models predict significant decreases in precipitation across northeastern South America and Central America. In contrast, most models predict increasing levels of precipitation across tropical Africa and equatorial Asia. Using the Community Earth System Model v1.0 with RCP8.5 simulations to 2300, we found that this longitudinal precipitation asymmetry intensified over time and as a consequence, terrestrial carbon losses from the neotropics were considerably higher than those in Africa and Asia. Carbon losses in some areas of the Amazon in a fully coupled simulation exceeded 15 kg C per m2 by 2300, relative to estimates from a biogeochemically-forced simulation in which atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases did not influence the atmospheric radiation budget. Variations in the amount of neotropical drying varied considerably among CMIP5 ESMs, and we used several types of analysis to identify driving mechanisms and to reduce uncertainties associated with these projections. CMIP5 models in general underestimated North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Models that more accurately simulated North Atlantic SSTs during the historical era had smaller mean precipitation biases and predicted greater neotropical forest drying than other models. This suggests that future drought stress in northern South America and Central America may be larger than estimates derived from the multi-model mean. Analysis of idealized radiatively coupled, biogeochemically coupled and fully coupled CMIP5 model simulations indicated that the direct effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide on plant physiology also was an important factor driving asymmetric precipitation change across the tropics, and had a similar pattern as changes induced solely from greenhouse gas effects on atmospheric radiation. We conclude by discussing the implications of the continental drought asymmetry for the vulnerability of tropical forests to fire, agriculture, and tree mortality.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_Anex_1file.pdf\nIsotopomer ratios of N2O and especially intramolecular 15N site preference (SP) have been proposed as indicators of the sources of N2O and for providing insight into the contributions of different microbial processes. Current knowledge, however, is mainly based on pure culture studies and laboratory flask studies using mass spectrometric analysis. Recent development of laser spectroscopic methods has made possible high-precision, in situ measurements. We present results from a maize production field in Columbia County, Wisconsin, USA. Data were collected from the fertilized maize phase of a maize-soybean rotation. N2O mole fractions and isotopic composition were determined using an automatic gas flux measurement system comprising a set of custom-designed automatic chambers, circulating gas paths and an OA-ICOS N2O Isotope Analyzer (Los Gatos Research, Inc., Model 914-0027). The instrument system allows for up to 15 user programmable soil gas chambers. Wide dynamic range and parts-per-billion precision of OA-ICOS laser absorption instrument allows for extremely rapid estimation of N2O fluxes. Current operational settings provide measurements of N2O and its isotopes every 20 seconds with a precision of 0.1 ± 0.050 PPB. Comparison of measurements from four chambers (two between row and two in-row) show very different aggregate N2O flux, but SP values suggest similar sources from nitrifier denitrification and incomplete bacterial denitrification. SP values reported are being measured throughout the current growing season. To date, the majority of values are consistent with an origin from bacterial denitrification and coincide with periods of high water filled pore space.",

            "abstract": "The focus on soil C dynamics is currently relevant as researchers and policymakers strive to understand the feedbacks between ecosystem stress and climate change. Successful development of molecular profiles that link soil microbiology with soil carbon (C) dynamics to ascertain soil vulnerability and resilience to climate change would have great impact on assessments of soil ecosystems in response to climate change. Additionally, a better understanding of the soil C dynamics would improve climate modeling, and fate and transport of carbon across terrestrial, subsurface and atmospheric interfaces. Unravelling the wide range of possible interactions between and within the microbial communities, with minerals and organic compounds in the terrestrial ecosystem requires a multimodal, molecular approach. Here we report on the use of a combination of several molecular ‘omics’ approaches: metabolomics, metallomics, lipidomics, and proteomics coupled with a suite of high resolution imaging, and X-ray diffraction crystallographic techniques, as a novel methodology to understand SOM composition, and its interaction with microbial communities in different ecosystems, including C associated with mineral surfaces. The findings of these studies provide insights into the SOM persistence and microbial stabilization of carbon in ecosystems and reveal the powerful coupling of a multi-scale of techniques. Examples of this approach will be presented from field studies of simulated climate change, and laboratory column-grown Pinus resinosa mesocosms.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of deposits hosted by carbonaceous materials-rich metasediments is widespread. Therefore, we aims in this study to investigate the potential of the Raman Spectroscopy of Carbonaceous Material (RSCM) geothermometry to detect thermal anomalies in hydrothermal ore deposits environment and to demonstrate the ability of warm fluids, migrating through the sedimentary sequence to locally disturb the thermal gradient and associated peak temperatures. For this purpose, we have chosen the Lucia subterrane in the Franciscan Complex (California, USA), which includes gold-bearing quartz veins that witness a hydrothermal overprint (Underwood et al., 1995).The sediments in this zone essentially comprise greywacke and shale-matrix mélange (e.g. Frey and Robinson, 1999), which have undergone high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphism. The thermal history of the Lucia subterrane has been previously proposed by Underwood et al. (1995), essentially using vitrinite reflectance method (Rm). Rm values increase from the south to the north; they vary between 0.9 and 3.7 % (~150-280°C). All these results suggest that the Lucia subterrane underwent a regional increase of thermal gradient toward the north. Anomalous Rm values from 4.5% to 4.9% (~305-315°C) are recorded near Cape San Martin. These highest temperatures estimated are likely, associated with a late hydrothermal event (Underwood et al., 1995).\nEstimated Raman temperatures 1) confirmed the increase in the metamorphic grade towards the north already shown by Underwood et al. (1995), using classical methods like mineralogy and vitrinite reflectance and 2) exhibit anomalous values (temperatures reach 350°C). These anomalies are probably due to the later hydrothermal event. This result suggests that RSCM could be used as a reliable tool to determine thermal anomalies caused by hot fluid-flow.",

Their features may be captured by multiple satellites. To process and extract information from the large-scale satellite data, one needs a data-intensive architecture for distributed storage and computation resources. Such architecture allows end users such as scientists to effectively run their computation tasks with sharing computational resources and intermediate results, but without data replication.\nThe satellite data is most conveniently represented using arrays, exploiting its multidimensional nature. For our investigation, we use the open-source distributed, array-based SciDB as a platform for our spatiotemporal framework. SciDB conforms with the data-intensive architecture, providing a highly effectively computational and data storage platform. Moreover, it provides standard extension points, i.e., user defined data types, operators and functions.\nOur current work focuses on more sophisticated indices including cartesian-coordinate indices, hierarchical triangular mesh and hybrid indices with data statistics and indexing. Furthermore, we introduce a spatiotemporal framework that allows us to generate and maintain indices according to given criteria and perform spatial and temporal operators and predicates. This framework overcomes weaknesses in SciDB where standard underlying array operations are less effective. We will demonstrate some examples (e.g., hurricane research using satellite data) of the functionalities in the proposed spatiotemporal framework.",

These equations describe the behavior and interactions of the cometary heavy ions, the solar wind protons, the electrons, and the neutrals. This model incorporates different mass loading processes, including photo and electron impact ionization, charge exchange, dissociative ion-electron recombination, and collisional interactions between different fluids.

            "abstract": "Climate change is widely considered one of the greatest challenges to global sustainability, with extreme events being the most immediate way that people experience this phenomenon. Urban areas are particularly vulnerable to these events given their location, concentration of people, and increasingly complex and interdependent infrastructure. We are developing a conceptual framework for urban social-ecological-technological systems (SETS) that will allow researchers and practitioners to assess how infrastructure can be resilient, provide ecosystem services, improve social well being, and exploit new technologies in ways that benefit urban populations. The framework integrates the three domains of social and equity issues, environmental quality and protection, and technical/engineering aspects, to form a concept of infrastructure that occurs at the intersection of the domains. Examples show how the more common socioecological systems and socially sensitive engineering approaches that fail to incorporate the third dimension may elevate vulnerability to climate-related disaster.\nThe SETS conceptual framework bridges currently siloed social science, environmental science, and engineering approaches to significantly advance research into the structure, function, and emergent properties of SETS. Extreme events like heat waves in Phoenix; coastal and urban flooding in the wake of superstorm Sandy and following hurricanes in Miami, FL; drought in Mexico; and urban flooding in Baltimore, Portland, San Juan PR, Syracuse, and Valdivia, Chile provide examples of the impacts of and vulnerability to extreme events that demand a new approach. The infrastructure of the future must be resilient, leverage ecosystem services, improve social well being, and exploit new technologies in ways that benefit all segments of urban populations and are appropriate to the particular urban contexts. These contexts are defined not only by the biophysical environment but also by culture and institutions of each place. We apply the SETS conceptual framework to nine western hemisphere cities in diverse settings, presenting hypotheses about the relative efficacy of strategies for resilient SETS infrastructure in cities contrasting in event type, biophysical setting, and cultural and institutional contexts.",

            "abstract": "Volcanoes are common on all terrestrial planets and their morphology is influenced by eruption mechanisms, volumes, and compositions and temperatures of the magmas; these are in turn influenced by the tectonic setting. In an attempt to better understand the relationship between morphometry and volcanic processes, we compared low-shield volcanoes on Syria Planum, Mars, with basaltic shields of the eastern Snake River Plain (eSRP).We used 133 volcanoes on Syria Planum that are covered by MOLA and HRSC elevation data and 246 eSRP shields covered by the NED. Shields on Syria Planum average 191 +/- 88 m tall, 12 +/- 6 km in diameter, 16 +/- 28 km3 in volume, and have 1.7° +/- 0.8 flank slopes. eSRP shields average 83 +/- 44 m tall, 4 +/- 3 km in diameter, 0.8 +/- 2 km3 in volume, and have 2.5° +/- 1 flank slopes.\nBivariate plots of morphometric characteristics show that Syria Planum and eSRP low shields form the extremes of the same morphospace shared with some Icelandic olivine tholeiite shields, but is generally distinct from other terrestrial volcanoes. Cluster analysis of SP and eSRP shields with other terrestrial volcanoes separates these volcanoes into one cluster and the majority of them into the same sub-cluster that is distinct from other terrestrial volcanoes. Principal component and cluster analysis of Syria Planum and eSRP shields using height, area, volume, slope, and eccentricity shows that Syria Planum and eSRP low-shields are similar in shape (slope and eccentricity). Apparently, these low shields formed by similar processes involving Hawaiian-type eruptions of low viscosity (mafic) lavas with fissure controlled eruptions, narrowing to central vents. Initially high eruption rates and long, tube-fed lava flows shifted to the development of small lava lakes that repeatedly overflowed, and on some with late fountaining to form steeper spatter ramparts. However, Syria Planum shields are systematically larger than those on the eastern Snake River Plain. The larger size of Syria Planum shields is likely due to the smaller gravity of Mars, requiring larger magma batches to generate sufficient buoyant force to overcome the strength of rocks in the lithosphere and rise to the surface. Thus, Syria Planum lavas erupt at and higher rates generating larger volcanoes with slightly smaller slopes.",

These requests were addressed by the Human Science Objectives Science Analysis Group, or HSO-SAG 2015, consisting of members of the Mars science and human exploration communities.\nA set of candidate scientific objectives was identified by the SAG considering intrinsic scientific merit, magnitude of the benefit of a proximal human, opportunities to make simultaneous observations from different vantage points, and opportunities to deliver scientific payloads of higher mass/complexity. These science objectives were then used to construct a set of landing site criteria that can be used to identify potential human landing sites on Mars with high potential for substantial scientific discovery.\nA future human landing site will lie in the center of a 100 km radius ‘exploration zone’ and scientific regions of interest within this exploration zone can be considered candidate sites for human exploration. HSO-SAG determined that potential landing sites on Mars should have access to the following: 1) deposits with a high preservation potential for evidence of past habitability and/or sites that are promising for present habitability; 2) Noachian and/or Hesperian rocks that can be used to understand past atmospheres; 3) exposures of at least two crustal units that are suitable for radiometric dating; 4) access to outcrops with signatures indicative of aqueous processes; 5) identifiable stratigraphic contacts and cross-cutting relationships from which relative ages can be determined.\nThese criteria will be used along with other criteria developed from engineering and exploration objectives to help prioritize candidate landing sites for future human missions to Mars. The first landing site workshop will occur on October 27–30, 2015 in Houston, TX. Please visit http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/explorationzone2015/ for more information.",

            "abstract": "The Organ caldera in southern New Mexico formed ~36 Ma from a series of three explosive, voluminous eruptions. The volcanic deposits are now exposed in the Organ Mountains and have a combined thickness of nearly 3 km and an estimated volume between 500 and1000 km3 (Seager & McCurry, 1988). This research uses analyses of quartz-hosted melt inclusions from the first- and last-erupted units to study the storage and differentiation of the magma body prior-to and during the initial eruption, as well as changes in the magma chamber over time as the eruptions progressed and ultimately ceased.\nPrevious work suggests the Organ magma chamber was compositionally stratified (Seager, 1981) erupting top-down and tapping less-evolved magmas over time. However, preliminary results suggest a more complex system; possibly a convecting, homogenized magma chamber or a series of dykes and sills. Results obtained using FTIR analyses of H2O and CO2 in melt inclusions have shown variable volatile contents from the first erupted unit (~2.3 to 6.8 weight percent H2O, 0-118 ppm CO2). Using these values, saturation pressures of 45 to 266 MPa were calculated, indicating a minimum pressure at which the melt inclusion was trapped. These pressures suggest magma storage depths for the first erupted magmas of ~2 to 9 km (with most inclusions trapped between 4 and 8 km) which is inconsistent with the initial eruption coming from the top of a normally stratified chamber. The large variation in volatile contents and storage depths can have many explanations, such as degassing and shallow crystallization during ascent, or perhaps a more complex, elongate magma storage system. These possibilities, and whether or not magma mixing/rejuvenation triggered the initial eruption, will be explored with the acquisition of major and trace element compositions of melt inclusions. Additionally, analyses of melt inclusions from the last erupted ignimbrite, which erupted ~0.5 Ma after the first eruption, will enable us to compare and contrast volatile contents, depths, and evolution of the magma chamber over time.",

            "abstract": "When modeling hydraulic fractures, it is often necessary to include tightly coupled interaction between fluid-filled fractures and the porous host rock. Further, the numerical scheme must accurately discretize processes taking place both in the rock volume and along growing fracture surfaces. This work presents a three-dimensional scheme for handling these challenging numerical issues. Solid deformation and fluid pressure in the host rock are modeled using a mixed finite-element/finite-volume scheme. The continuum formulation is enriched with an assumed enhanced strain (AES) method to represent discontinuities in the displacement field due to fractures. Fractures can be arbitrarily oriented and located with respect to the underlying mesh, and no re-meshing is necessary during fracture propagation. Flow along the fracture is modeled using a locally conservative finite volume scheme. Leak-off coupling allows for fluid exchange between the porous matrix and the fracture. We describe an efficient and scalable preconditioning process that leads to rapid convergence of the resulting discrete system. The scheme is validated using analytical examples and monitoring data from a real fractured reservoir.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - A41A_0021_Lerner.pdf\nAccurate measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the troposphere is critical for the understanding of emissions and physical and chemical processes that can impact both air quality and climate. Airborne VOC measurements have proven challenging due to the requirements of short sample collection times (=10 s) to maximize spatial resolution and sampling frequency and high sensitivity (pptv) to chemically diverse hydrocarbons, halocarbons, oxygen- and nitrogen-containing VOCs. NOAA ESRL CSD has built an improved whole air sampler (iWAS) which collects compressed ambient air samples in electropolished stainless steel canisters, based on the NCAR HAIS Advanced Whole Air Sampler [Atlas and Blake]. Post-flight chemical analysis is performed with a custom-built gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer system that pre-concentrates analyte cryostatically via a Stirling cooler, an electromechanical chiller which precludes the need for liquid nitrogen to reach trapping temperatures.\nFor the 2015 Shale Oil and Natural Gas Nexus Study (SONGNEX), CSD conducted iWAS measurements on 19 flights aboard the NOAA WP-3D aircraft between March 19th and April 27th. Nine oil and natural gas production regions were surveyed during SONGNEX and more than 1500 air samples were collected and analyzed. For the first time, we employed real-time mapping of sample collection combined with live data from fast time-response measurements (e.g. ethane) for more uniform surveying and improved target plume sampling. Automated sample handling allowed for more than 90% of iWAS canisters to be analyzed within 96 hours of collection – for the second half of the campaign improved efficiencies reduced the median sample age at analysis to 36 hours. A new chromatography peak-fitting software package was developed to minimize data reduction time by an order of magnitude without a loss of precision or accuracy.\nHere we report mixing ratios for aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (C2-C8) along with select oxygenated species (alcohols and ketones) and cycloalkanes. We present an intercomparison of the GC-MS analysis system and iWAS samples from SONGNEX with a new H3O+ CIMS-TOF and a spectroscopic ethane measurement that also flew aboard the NOAA WP-3D aircraft during SONGNEX. We also consider the effect of sample age on observed mixing ratio.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster_jding.pdf\nIn CALIPSO Level 2 aerosol data, dust particles are classified into two subtypes, namely, pure dust and polluted dust based on lidar backscatter, depolarization ratio and surface types. In this research, the polluted dust subtype is found to have two distinct modes in terms of integrated depolarization ratio (IDR) and integrated total color ratio (ICR). Dust with smaller IDR and ICR occurs mainly over areas with strong smoke emissions such as industrial cities. This kind of polluted dust originating from East Asia is also found over the Pacific Ocean. In contrast, the other type originating from the Saharan desert with larger IDR and ICR occurs mainly over the Atlantic Ocean. The disparities of IDR and ICR may result from different pollutants. The polluted dust with smaller ICR and IDR should have stronger absorption of light and may contain black carbon. Other chemical compounds such as sea salts may account for polluted dust with larger ICR and IDR. To further separate the types of polluted dust, cluster analysis is applied to determine the centroid of each type in terms of IDR and ICR. Furthermore, scattering models of dust mixed with various pollutants are constructed to be included in a CALIPSO simulator. The simulated IDR and ICR values are compared with data to retrieve the chemical compositions of polluted dust. The difference of polluted dust over the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean provides new evidence about long-range transport of Asian dust to North America. The distribution of dust polluted by black carbon is determined, which can improve knowledge about the effect of black carbon on the earth’s radiation budget.",

            "abstract": "Small amounts of water in Earth’s mantle, coupled with mantle convection and subduction zone processes, may be responsible for explaining much of the geochemical diversity of Hot Spot basalts and mid-ocean ridge (MOR) basalts. One of the inconsistencies in modeling mantle evolution is that the average trace element composition of the MOR mantle suggests it has been affected by past melt extraction events involving only small melt fractions – less than about 1%. However, petrological studies indicate that most basalt magmas (or their more olivine-rich precursors) are formed by larger degrees of melting, in the range of 5-20%. A possible explanation for this inconsistency is that the mantle we associate with MOR’s has been produced not in the main melting regions where basalt is produced, but in the fringes of those melt zones, where the presence of water causes a large volume of mantle to be only incipiently melted. Mid-ocean ridges may be where the largest volume of incipiently depleted lherzolite (IDL) is produced; the presence of 500-700 ppm H2O results in a large volume of mantle passing through the incipient melt regime. IDL is also produced at intraplate hotpots, where higher temperatures induce deeper melting and the melting zone contains a large proportion of IDL because of radial geometry and higher water contents. Mid-ocean ridge ‘cold spots’ may also produce a large proportion of IDL. In general, IDL produced in melt zone fringes at MOR’s does not become part of the cold upper oceanic lithosphere. Consequently, the IDL may not be deeply subducted and could be preferentially retained in the upper mantle, producing a form of steady-state geochemical layering in the mantle over billions of years. The expected layering would be more MOR-like in the upper mantle and more OIB-like in the deeper mantle that is more strongly affected by the accumulated addition of the heterogeneous and moderately “enriched” oceanic crust and upper lithosphere. Regardless of the geometry of mantle heterogeneity, any model for the origin, location, size, and history of the MOR source must include the creation and fate of low-melt fraction regions that are inexorably linked to magmatism on a planet with a moderate water-content mantle.",

            "abstract": "More than 40 years ago it was known that calving glaciers in Alaska created unmistakable seismic signals that could be recorded tens and hundreds of kilometers away. Their long monochromatic signals invited studies that foreshadowed the more recent surge in glacier seismology. Beyond a handful of targeted studies, these signals have remained a seismic novelty. No systematic attempt has been made to catalog and track glacier seismicity across the years. Recent advances in understanding glacier sources, combined with the climate significance of tidewater glaciers, have renewed calls for comprehensive tracking of glacier seismicity in coastal Alaska. The Alaska Earthquake Center has included glacier events in its production earthquake catalog for decades. Until recently, these were best thought of as bycatch—accidental finds in the process of tracking earthquakes. Processing improvements a decade ago, combined with network improvements in the past five years, have turned this into a rich data stream capturing hundreds of events per year across 600 km of the coastal mountain range. Though the source of these signals is generally found to be iceberg calving, there are vast differences in behavior between different glacier termini. Some glaciers have strong peaks in activity during the spring, while others peak in the late summer or fall. These patterns are consistent over years pointing to fundamental differences in calving behavior. In several cases, changes in seismic activity correspond to specific process changes observed through other means at particular glacier. These observations demonstrate that the current network is providing a faithful record of the dynamic behavior of several glaciers in coastal Alaska. With this as a starting point, we examine what is possible (and not possible) going forward with dedicated detection schemes.",

The Washington State University (WSU) Regional Atmospheric Chemistry: State-of-the-art Measurement and Modeling in the Pacific Northwest REU Site employs a mixed method approach to determine what is working well and what can use improvement (formative evaluation) and to determine impact and effectiveness of the project in reaching the stated goals (summative evaluation). Quantitative data is collected via a pre-/post-test measuring participants’ research self-efficacy (RSE), motivation, background information, extent of socialization, and their interpretation of the value of the REU experience. Qualitative data is gathered through individual interviews with the REU students (at the beginning and end of the program) and faculty mentors (at the end). Beginning interviews focus on expectations for the REU program and student backgrounds. End interviews focus on student RSE development, interpretations of their experience, and the value of the experience. Faculty mentors are interviewed to gather insight on student performance in the program and perspectives on the overall success of the program in meeting the proposed goals. Students are provided an opportunity to comment on the strengths and weaknesses of workshops, providing critical feedback to the particular instructor and enabling the faculty to modify the workshop content and activities in future years. Finally, research results are evaluated during the final poster presentation, and faculty are interviewed to report on their perception of how each student learned and gained knowledge during the program. To evaluate the retention of students in engineering and science and identify chosen career paths, a longitudinal survey was created and it is administered via email each year.\nMany REU programs also employ the Undergraduate Research Students Self-Assessment (URSSA) online tool designed for evaluating REU experiences (University of Colorado at Boulder). Information presented in this presentation will include a discussion of the current tools used as described above as well as a discussion of the pros/cons of using URSSA. One of the concerns with using URSSA in conjunction with the other assessment tools is “survey fatigue”.",

            "abstract": "Despite recent progress in hurricane track forecasts, we still lack understanding of the multi-scale interactions that sometimes lead to cylogenesis or rapid intesification and other times do not. To improve hurricane forecasts we need to understand the physical processes that control hurricane evolution and to evaluate whether the models represent them properly. This is where we face Big Data challenges in three different ways: dealing with a multitude of observations; extracting relevant information from voluminous model forecast; and performing carefully designed diagnostics to evaluate the models.\nSatellite observations provide invaluable information. However, needed are long-term observations of multiple parameters, from a multitude of instruments. These data come from disparate sources, in different formats, with varying latency. Bringing all these observations to bear on addressing the hurricane problem presents the observational side of the Big Data challenges.\nHurricane evolution is sensitive to the storm internal dynamics as well as environmental characteristics. This is why accurate forecasting requires the use of regional models, with higher resolution and better parameterizations, as well as the use of global models that better depict the large-scale environment, necessary for properly capturing the important scale interactions. Extracting relevant information from the extremely voluminous model forecasts, we face the model-related side of the Big Data challenges.\nTo properly evaluate the models we need to go beyond the comparison of the geophysical fields and use instrument simulators to compute synthetic observations from the model fields for a more direct comparison. Producing realistic synthetic data requires the use of complex, computationally intensive, instrument simulators. This demand, in addition to developing on-line analytics to support model evaluation, is where we face the analytics side of the Big Data challenges.\nWe are now developing a system – http://tropicalcyclone.jpl.nasa.gov- that addresses the issues of model evaluation and processes understanding with the goal of improving the accuracy of hurricane forecasts.\nIn this presentation we will use our framework to describe, define and illustrate the three faces of the Big Data challenges we confront today.",

FDLs consist of soil, rock, debris, and potentially ice, although only preliminary surface investigations have been conducted on these features thus far. Within the corridor of the 667 km Dalton Highway in Alaska’s Brooks Range, we have identified 43 FDLs, with 23 occurring less than one mile upslope of the Dalton Highway and the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline (TAP), which runs parallel to the Dalton Highway.\nDue to their proximity to the highway and pipeline, FDLs pose significant risks to these key infrastructure assets. The closest FDL to the highway, FDL-A, is less than 41.5 m from the embankment when measured in August 2014, and could encroach upon the Dalton Highway/TAP within one year. Upon reaching the highway, FDLs could significantly impede the flow of essential goods and services to the oil and gas fields on the North Slope, creating severe economic losses.\nThis study addresses the following two research goals: In an initial step, we assessed the performance of InSAR for FDL analysis as a function of data resolution, season, and vegetation cover. We were able to conclude that moderate resolution SAR systems are sufficient for monitoring FDLs during winter, when top surfaces are frozen and slopes are moving more consistently. In summer, however, surface flows show stronger spatial variation, and higher resolution sensors are required to preserve coherence and examine details.\nSubsequently, we began a long-term analysis of FDL behavior using SAR acquisitions over the last 20 years, expanded to include more recent data from the high-resolution TerraSAR-X sensor. We calculated flow parameters from the InSAR data and combined them with geological information from field measurements to perform a geophysical analysis of FDLs and assess their hazard potential.\nOur preliminary results show that (1) FDLs have been progressively moving down slope since the 1990s; (2) the down slope movement rates of FDLs vary significantly (up to a factor of 4) throughout the seasons with fastest flow typically occurring in late fall, and slowest motion being observed in the February – March timeframe; and (3) the surface motion of FDLs also varies significantly in space, with stronger spatial variation in summer than in winter.",

First, future climate change projections from five global climate models (GCMs) are downscaled dynamically. The warming signal exhibits a strong elevation dependence that is not captured by common statistical downscaling methods. Variations in the warming are attributed to snow albedo feedback and the blocking effect of the Sierra Nevada, which creates a sharp warming gradient between marine and continental air masses. These two physical processes are incorporated into a simple statistical model that mimics the dynamical model’s warming patterns given GCM input. This statistical model is used to produce warming and snow cover loss projections for an ensemble of 35 GCMs. Capturing the elevation dependence is important for many applications of climate change, including surface hydrology, water resources, and ecosystems.",

In this project, the transport behavior of radiocaesium through seven water systems located in coastal areas of Fukushima was investigated to establish predictive modeling tools for distribution of radiocaesium and to estimate future effective dose of the residents. This paper provides understanding of transport behavior of radiocaesium extracted by comparison among focused rivers and quantitative evaluation of mass flow in the water system based on the results of field observations. Especially, behavior and factors defining the concentrations of particulate and dissolved radiocaesium in the water systems will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster-AGUFM15-ePOSTER.pdf\nThe Farley-Buneman (FB) and gradient drift (GD) instabilities are plasma instabilities that occur at roughly 100 km in the equatorial E-region ionosphere. They develop when ion-neutral collisions dominate ion motion while electron motion is affected by both electron-neutral collisions and the background magnetic field. GD drift waves grow when the background density gradient and electric field are aligned; FB waves grow when the background electric field causes electrons to E × B drift with a speed slightly larger than the ion acoustic speed. Theory predicts that FB and GD turbulence should develop in the same plasma volume when GD waves create a perturbation electric field that exceeds the threshold value for FB turbulence. However, ionospheric radars, which regularly observe meter-scale irregularities associated with FB turbulence, must infer kilometer-scale GD dynamics rather than observe them directly. Numerical simulations have been unable to simultaneously resolve GD and FB structure. We present results from a parallelized hybrid simulation that uses a particle-in-cell (PIC) method for ions while modeling electrons as an inertialess, quasi-neutral fluid. This approach allows us to reach length scales of hundreds of meters to kilometers with sub-meter resolution, but requires solving a large linear system derived from an elliptic PDE that depends on plasma density, ion flux, and electron parameters. We solve the resultant linear system at each time step via the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computing (PETSc). We compare results of simulated FB turbulence from this model to results from a thoroughly tested PIC code and describe progress toward the first simultaneous simulations of FB and GD instabilities. This model has immediate applications to radar observations of the E-region ionosphere, as well as potential applications to the F-region ionosphere and the chromosphere of the Sun.",

Here we take that concept one step further and propose a passive measurement of the sub-surface dielectric profile of Mars by taking advantage of the multipath interference between reflections off the surface and subsurface dielectric discontinuities. Previous studies have shown that this technique is capable of detecting changes in the sub-surface dielectric constant, but here we present the first experimental data showing that it can detect multilayer subsurface profiles. We have measured layered beds of sand and concrete and compared these experimental results to a numerical model of the signal reflections; showing that dielectric discontinuities in the subsurface can be measured using this passive sensing technique. The exciting thing about this technique is the ability to conduct ground penetrating radar measurements in the shallow subsurface of planetary bodies without active radar transmitters.",

Results indicate ages in the range 20-14 ka and complement our previous findings that the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream (NCIS) had retreated some 400 km as early as ~20 ka (Svendsen et al., 2015) and further corroborate that this was followed by a second pulse of deglaciation at ~16 ka. After the immediate coast was rendered an ice-free corridor at ~20 ka, our new suite of ages identifies ~16 ka as a period of a possible culmination of re-advance, and almost certainly the onset of a subsequent period of retreat. These findings are promising for the possibility of long lake sediment archives from areas around the mouth of Boknafjorden. Additionally, by coupling our new 10Be ages of erratic boulders from sea level and from summits bordering Boknafjorden with topographic profiles and rudimentary ice-sheet profile calculations (Benn and Hulton, 2010), we are able to estimate spatial and temporal Scandinavian Ice Sheet history along both vertical and horizontal transects. Our results not only fill chronological gaps and add to a growing database of ages of deglaciation from the southwest Norway, but also provide new constraints for a three-dimensional reconstruction of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during deglaciation.",

Space weather events occur regularly, but extreme events occur less frequently with only several historical examples over the last 160 years. During the past decade, published works have (1) forensically examined the physical characteristics of the extreme historical events; and (2) discussed the probability or return rate of select extreme geomagnetic disturbances, including the 1859 Carrington event.\nHere we present an analysis of several of these studies. We created a unified statistical framework to visualize previous analyses, and developed a model from an ensemble using statistical methods. We look at geomagnetic disturbance probability across multiple return periods. We discuss what the most likely 100-year extreme event (a parameter of interest to policy makers and planners) and the return period for other extreme historical events. We discuss the current state of these analyses, their utility to policy makers and planners, the current limitations (in data and understanding) when compared to other hazards, and the gaps that need to be filled to enhance space weather risk assessments.",

            "abstract": "Permeability-enhancing treatments such as hydraulic fracturing induce microseismic events with reported magnitudes in the range of -3.0 to -0.5, although significantly larger induced earthquakes up to ML 4.4 have been reported. The primary controlling mechanism is thought to be diffusion of pore pressure away from the hydraulic fracture system, which leads to activation of fractures that are close to optimal orientation a critical state of stress. Understanding the specific primary and secondary triggering mechanisms during hydraulic fracturing is expected to furnish new insights regarding stress, strength of faults and rupture initiation and propagation. Here, we present evidence for the existence of earthquake-earthquake triggering cascades in microseismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing using novel methods from statistical seismology. While background seismicity dominates, we find that these triggering cascades exhibit features that also characterize tectonic aftershock sequences such as the empirical Omori-Utsu law and the productivity law. While this suggests that the underlying physical triggering mechanisms are similar in both cases, there are also pronounced differences. Specifically, we find that the magnitudes of earthquakes in microseismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing are not random but tend to cluster – independent of whether one considers background events or triggered events. We attribute this to the specific geometry associated with tight shale gas and oil reservoirs, which may lead to the occurrence of fracture arrest at bedding boundaries and gives rise to stratabound fracture networks. This has important implications for seismic hazard assessment and forecasting related to hydraulic fracturing.",

We developed a numerical time-of-flight calculation to determine the dispersion at the ionosphere of electrons precipitated from a given location along the field line, then feed the result into an electron transport code to determine an emission intensity profile. Using source location and plasma temperature as adjustable parameters, we then step through the parameter space, building up an index of outer-bound estimates of the location for modulation, correlated to various observed auroral pulsation periods. Both weak diffusion and strong diffusion cases are considered.

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is one of the main factors for the study of drought, climate and vegetation. In the case of drought, this is a regional phenomenon and affects food security more than any other natural disaster. Therefore, monitoring of different types of drought has been based on indexes that standardize on temporal and spatial scales. Currently, the monitoring of different types of drought is based on indexes that attempt to encapsulate on temporal and regional levels allowing thereby the comparison of water conditions in different areas. Therefore, in order to assess the impact of soil moisture during periods of drought, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) was estimated for the entire Brazilian territory, using meteorological (precipitation and evapotranspiration) and soil (field capacity, permanent wilting point and water storage in the soil) data. The data field capacity and permanent wilting point were obtained from the physical properties of the soil, while the water storage in the soil was calculated considering the water balance model. Analyses were made for the years 2000 through 2014, which includes periods with and without occurrence of drought, respectively. The results showed that the PDSI had higher negative indices for the years 2003, 2012, 2013 and 2014 in Brazil's Northeast region, and this region was strongly affected by drought during those years. These indices can serve as a basis for assessing future drought projections, considering different scenarios. The results also show that soil moisture constitutes one of the limiting factors for obtaining high agricultural productivity, in order to reduce the effects caused by drought. Therefore, these indices can serve as a basis for assessing future drought projections, considering different scenarios. It would be desirable to assist decision makers in action plans with more effective strategies, allowing farmers to live with drought without losing their livelihood.",

            "abstract": "Plant species distributions and community shifts after fire are affected by burn severity, elevation, aspect, and climate. However, little empirical data exists on long-term (decadal) recovery after fire across these interacting factors, limiting understanding of fire regime characteristics and climate in post-fire community trajectories. We examined plant species and community responses a decade after fire across five fires in ponderosa pine, dry mixed coniferous, and moist mixed coniferous forests across the western USA. Using field data, we determined changes in plant communities one and ten years post-fire across gradients of burn severity, elevation, and aspect. Existing published work has shown that plant species distributions can be accurately predicted from physiologically relevant climate variables using non-parametric Random Forests models; such models have also been linked to projected climate profiles in 2030, 2060, and 2090 generated from three commonly used general circulation models (GCMs). We explore the possibility that fire and climate are coupled drivers affecting plant species distributions. Climate change may not manifest as a slow shift in plant species distributions, but as sudden, localized events tied to changing fire and other disturbance regimes.",

            "abstract": "Distributary networks are formed by channels which bifurcate downstream in a river delta. Sediment and water fluxes are often split unequally in delta bifurcations. Understanding flux asymmetry in distributary networks is important for predicting how a delta will respond to sea-level rise. We present results of a quasi-1D model of a delta bifurcation. Consistent with previous results, in the absence of deposition, stable bifurcations may be either symmetric or asymmetric, depending on flow conditions. However, in a depositional setting, a stable asymmetric flow partitioning is no longer possible, as the dominant branch becomes less and less steep relative to the other branch. This feedback eventually causes the second branch to become favored. For the depositional case, we identify three regimes of bifurcation behavior: 1) stable symmetric bifurcation, 2) “soft” avulsions where the dominant branch switches without complete abandonment of the previous channel, and 3) complete avulsions where one branch is completely abandoned. In each case, the bifurcation is symmetric in the long-term average, but the latter two allow for short-term asymmetry. We find that keeping upstream sediment and water discharges fixed, as downstream channel length increases the regime shifts from symmetric to soft avulsions to complete avulsions. In the two avulsion regimes we examine the effect of upstream sediment and water discharges and downstream channel length on avulsion period and maximum discharge ratio. Finally, we compare numerical modeling results to a fixed-wall bifurcation experiment. As in the numerical model, the presence or absence of a downstream sink exerts a strong control on system behavior. If a sink is present, a bifurcation may be asymmetric indefinitely. Conversely, without a sink the system is depositional, and the feedback between sediment discharge asymmetry and slope causes the bifurcation to remain symmetric in the long-term average.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU poster 2015 LD Final v2.pdf\nThe East Coast Basin (ECB) of the North Island, New Zealand, is an active forearc basin that features bathymetric sub-basins segregated by low-angle reverse faults. Understanding the spatial and temporal contribution of sediment from distinct source terranes to Neogene deep-water deposits in the ECB may constrain the degree of basin segregation during evolution of the modern tectonic regime. Furthermore, the study of Neogene dispersal patterns may permit delineation of active source areas and source-to-sink boundaries between terrestrial and marine deposition.\nDetrital zircon U-Pb dating was used to evaluate thirteen Neogene sandstones from two transects (in the Raukumara and Wairarapa regions) that are hypothesized to represent paleo-sub-basins of the ECB. Age spectra from this suite of Miocene–Pliocene sandstones are interpreted in the context of ongoing and published work. All samples have robust Permian-Triassic and Cretaceous age peaks, except for two lower Miocene samples from the Wairarapa sub-basin which have minor Cretaceous peaks. Middle-upper Miocene Raukumara samples contain contemporary age peaks, and the lower Pliocene sample has a late Miocene age peak. Kaweka terrane likely contributed to both sub-basins by early Miocene time, but Pahau sediment did not appear in the Wairarapa sub-basin until middle Miocene time. Active volcanic arc sources contributed to the Raukumara sub-basin during middle-late Miocene time. Furthermore, no Wairarapa samples contain contemporary age peaks, suggesting that 1) flow of sediments between these sub-basins was not straightforward and there was likely a barrier to sediment dispersal, or 2) the volcanic source was geographically restricted and did not contribute sediment to the southern ECB. Ultimately, presence of a Pahau age signature in both sub-basins, and younger contemporary ages in only the Raukumara sub-basin to the north, indicate independent sediment dispersal pathways contributing Pahau sediment to both basins, with the northern basin receiving additional input from a volcanic source.",

            "abstract": "Fluxes of energy and water between the atmosphere and the land surface influence weather and climate. These fluxes depend on the state of the landscape, which contributes to differences in land-atmosphere coupling strength over space and time. One region with potentially strong land-atmosphere coupling is the Southern Great Plains (SGP) in North America. In this region, managed vegetation plays a key role in moderating the surface energy through effects on surface albedo, transpiration, precipitation interception, and other surface properties. However accurately modeling these effects is challenging because the vegetation in this region is very heterogeneous. Winter wheat is the dominant crop, but pasture, hayfields, corn, and recently introduced crops such as canola cover significant portions of the landscape as well. Winter wheat has a unique phenology with fall planting, maximum leaf area in late spring, and harvest in early summer. This phenology contrasts significantly with most other crops and with pastures and hayfields in the region, which have more typical spring-fall growing seasons. Therefore, to sufficiently model and assess land–atmosphere interactions in this region accurate characterization of differences in the seasonality of water and energy fluxes between vegetation types are necessary. We used observations including eddy covariance flux estimates, soil moisture data, state-of-the-art longwave and shortwave radiation measurements, and other observations available for several facilities within the SGP Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site in north-central Oklahoma and southern Kansas. We compared the timing and variations in fluxes of water and energy between winter wheat and other land cover types, focusing on vegetation influences on rates of soil dry-down following precipitation events. We found distinct differences in fluxes between winter wheat and other land types. These flux differences had a nonlinear dependency on disparities in leaf area index, and were particularly pronounced in the period following the summertime wheat harvest when differences in latent heat flux greater than 50 Wm-2 were commonly observed.",

Since that time, Rosetta’s Ion and Electron Sensor (IES) has made near continuous measurements of the ions and electrons between 4.1 eV/q to 18.3 keV/q. Electron observations are of particular interest, because the electron distributions are highly variable in both temperature and density. At the comet, the thermal and non-thermal electron populations are non-Maxwellian, and the low-energy population has been previously described as a flat-top distribution. Here, we characterize the electrons near the comet as two kappa distributions. The kappa distribution improves upon previous work because it relates the distribution back to statistical properties such as density and temperature. Additionally, the kappa distribution allows us to determine the electron population’s departure from thermal equilibrium, which has never been studied at a comet. We find that both the low-energy and high-energy electron populations are well characterized by a kappa distribution. Moreover, the low-energy population varies on the time scale of minutes, which suggest a rapidly changing magnetic connection of the spacecraft to the low-energy electron source region.",

Non-linear eddies have the ability to trap and transport water as they propagate, which make them a potential source of cross-shelf transport. Long Bay, SC, just downstream of the Charleston Bump is the area of highest eddy activity in the SAB. Surface currents in Long Bay have been observed since 2012 using HF radars. The accuracy of three eddy detection methods (Okubo-Weiss, Vector-geometry, Winding-angle) are compared in this area of high shear on the shoreward front of the GS. The Okubo-Weiss parameter does not perform well in this area due to the high shear environment where eddies propagate. The Vector-Geometry method has good successful detection rates but suffers in shape analysis from inaccurate Stream Function contours in this area due to divergent surface currents. The Winding-Angle method performs well and was used to detect eddies and their propagation paths in Long Bay for years 2013 and 2014. Detected eddies propagate predominantly along-shelf, with cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddies propagating downstream (upstream) with respect the GS. Few eddies with the ability to trap and transport water propagating in the across-shelf direction were observed, leading to the conclusion that most of the influence of these eddies is confined to the shoreward front of the GS, near the shelf break.",

To verify that pressurized air pockets can effectively produce geysers, laboratory experiments were conducted. However, past experiments were conducted in relatively small-scale apparatus (i.e. maximum φ2” vertical shaft). This study conducted a set of experiments in a larger apparatus. The experimental setup consists of an upstream head tank, a downstream head tank, a horizontal pipe (46.5ft long, φ6”) and a vertical pipe (10ft long, φ6”). The initial condition for the experiments is constant flow discharge through the horizontal pipe. The experiments are initiated by injecting an air pocket with pre-determined volume and pressure at the upstream end of the horizontal pipe. The air pocket propagates through the horizontal pipe until it arrives to the vertical shaft, where it is released producing a geyser-like flow. Three flow rates in the horizontal pipe and three injected air pressures were tested. The variables measured were pressure at two locations in the horizontal pipe and two locations in the vertical pipe. High resolution videos at two regions in the vertical shaft were also recorded. To gain further insights in the physics of air-water interaction, the laboratory experiments were complemented with numerical simulations conducted using a commercial 3D CFD model, previously validated with experiments.",

In Colombia, the regional boundary between a Paleozoic continental domain to the east and Cretaceous accreted terrenes to the west is well exposed in several E-W sections near Medellin City and along the Cauca River, which occupies a major depression located between the Central and Western cordilleras. The area is dominated by the N-S trending Romeral Fault System (RFS) that can be traced to southern Ecuador. Relationships between the RFS and W-SW verging thrust system are unknown, although they represent key components of a transpressional orogeny. To understand timing of accretion and associated mountain building processes, we performed (U-Th)/He and fission track dating on samples derived from vertical profiles in cordilleran massifs.\nSamples were collected along four vertical profiles on two distinct litho-tectonic units: (1) three vertical profiles in the older eastern realm corresponding to metamorphic basement rocks of the Paleozoic Paleo-continental margin and associated Cretaceous intrusives, and (2) one vertical profile in the Mande batholith, Eocene in age at the eastern portion of the Panama Chocó Block (PCB) .\nThe resulting zircon (U-Th)/He (ZHe) ages show a clear contrast between the ancient eastern realm (~50-60 Ma) and the Mande Batholith (~30-40 Ma). Apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) ages also show a strong contrast with 23-42 Ma for the eastern realm and a well defined cluster at ~4 Ma for the Mande Batholith. These preliminary results suggest distinctive cooling histories for the two litho-tectonic blocks. The Mande batholith (western block) records both the late Eocene and Pliocene events whereas the ancient eastern block does not preserve any of these events. The Paleocene events recorded by the eastern block are probably related to the Laramic orogenetic phase. Finally, elevation-invariable ZHe ages from the ancient eastern block suggest a pulse of rapid exhumation during the Paleogene.",

However, while SOCCR detailed the significance of North American coastal wetlands, it was not until recently that leading governments began to fully recognized these ecosystems for their carbon sequestration and storage capacity and hence the significant role coastal ecosystems can play in GHG emission reductions strategies, offset mechanisms, coastal management strategies and climate mitigation policy.\nThe new attention on coastal carbon systems has exposed limitations in terms of data availability and data quality, as well as insufficient knowledge of coastal carbon distributions, characteristics and coastal carbon cycle processes. In addition to restricting scientific progress, lack of comprehensive, comparable, and quality-controlled coastal carbon data is hindering progress towards carbon based conservation and coastal management.\nTo directly address those limitations, we are developing a Global Science and Data Network for Coastal “Blue” Carbon, with support from the Carbon Cycle Interagency Working Group. Goals include:\n• Improving basic and applied science on carbon and GHG cycling in vegetated coastal ecosystems;\n• Supporting a coastal carbon and associated GHG data archive for use by the science community, coastal and climate practitioners and other data users;\n• Building the capacity of coastal carbon stakeholders globally to collect and interpret high quality coastal carbon science and data;\n• Providing a forum and mechanism to promote exchange and collaboration between scientists and coastal carbon data users globally; and\n• Outreach activities to ensure the best available data are globally accessible and that science is responsive to the needs of coastal managers and policy-makers.",

            "abstract": "A movement in which meteorite deccelerated during its atmosphere entry is often a mystery. We are solving this topic using guns and magnetic properties of projectiles. Meteorite is experimentally replaced by bullet.We use magnetic remanence as a tool to reconstruct at least part of the history of moving bodies. We are trying to characterize magnetic acquisition/loss of the bullets and than use acquired knowledge for bullet and meteorite tracing. The bullet is heated to high temperature by hot gases during firing. As it cools it gets its unique remanent magnetization signature. A similar process applies to meteorites, which are heated after entry into the atmosphere. A unique signature is made out of multiple magnetic vectors, which are related to both direction of the geomagnetic field and direction of the trajectory of the projectile. Measurement results from bullets are being used for understanding the final history of meteorite descend. The information provided by remanent magnetization can be used to retrieve at least some characteristics of the trajectory of the projectile. Our research is carried out experimentally. We made system for bullet magnetic modification that we use to track specific process of magnetic acquisition/loss. We have found significant potential in their magnetic remanence acquisition by choosing specific magnetic carriers and their grain size as part of the bullet composition.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric oxygen provides one of the most powerful tracers to study the carbon cycle through its close interaction with carbon dioxide. Keeling and co-workers demonstrated this at the global scale by using small variations in atmospheric oxygen content to disentangle oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks. It would be very exciting to apply similar ideas at the ecosystem level to improve our understanding of biosphere-atmosphere exchange and our ability to predict the response of the biosphere and atmosphere to climate change. The eddy covariance technique is perhaps the most effective approach available to quantify the exchange of gases between these spheres. Therefore, eddy covariance flux measurements of oxygen would be extremely valuable. However, this requires a fast response (0.1 seconds), high relative precision (0.001% or 10 per meg) oxygen sensor.\nWe report recent progress in developing such a sensor using a high resolution visible laser to probe the oxygen A-band electronic transition. This sensor will enable oxygen flux measurements using eddy covariance. In addition, we will incorporate a second laser in this instrument to simultaneously determine the fluxes of oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapor within the same sampling cell. This will provide a direct, real time measurement of the ratio of the flux of oxygen to that of carbon dioxide. This ratio is expected to vary on short time scales and small spatial scales due to the differing stoichiometry of processes producing and consuming carbon dioxide. Thus measuring the variations in the ratio of oxygen and carbon dioxide fluxes will provide mechanistic information to improve our understanding of the crucial exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and biosphere.",

However, the vulnerability of this deep SOC and, in particular mineral-associated SOC, to warming, and its potential to amplify the effects of climate change is highly uncertain. To gain insight into the bio-accessibility and temperature sensitivity of mineral-associated organic C, we conducted a series of incubations using soils collected from three depths (0-10, 50-60, and 80-90 cm) under coniferous forest. The soils are moderately acidic (mean pH=6.5) sandy, mixed, mesic Ultic Haploxeralfs.\nTo understand how mechanisms controlling SOC bio-accessibilty or temperature sensitivity differ with depth and with the properties of Fe-organo complexes (i.e.,degree of crystallinity, amount of reactive surface area, or surface saturation), we used a 13C labeled glucose substrate to prepare synthetic Fe-organo complexes spanning a range of crystallinity and mineral surface saturation. The synthetic Fe-organo complexes were then added to soil from three depths. The soils containing the 13C labeled Fe-organo adduct were incubated at two temperatures (ambient and +4°C) and respired 13CO2 was measured and used to estimate flux rates. Differences in measured 13CO2 fluxes as a function of depth, surface loading, and mineral properties are discussed in terms of their implications for the temperature sensitivity of mineral protected organic carbon in subsurface soils.",

In collaboration with 17 research agencies, project locations are displayed in a visually enhanced web mapping application. Key information about each project is presented along with links to web pages that provide additional information. The mapping application includes new reference data layers and an updated ship tracks layer. Visual enhancements are achieved by redeveloping the front-end from FLEX to HTML5 and JavaScript, which now provide access to mobile users utilizing tablets and cell phone devices. New tools have been added that allow users to navigate, select, draw, measure, print, use a time slider, and more. Other module additions include a back-end Apache SOLR search platform that provides users with the capability to perform advance searches throughout the ARMAP database. Furthermore, a new query builder interface has been developed in order to provide more intuitive controls to generate complex queries. These improvements have been made to increase awareness of projects funded by numerous entities in the Arctic, enhance coordination for logistics support, help identify geographic gaps in research efforts and potentially foster more collaboration amongst researchers working in the region. Additionally, ARMAP can be used to demonstrate past, present, and future research efforts supported by the U.S. Government.",

In extreme cases PyroCU transition to deeper Pyrocumulonimbus (PyroCB), which are capable of generating precipitation, downdrafts, and lightning. Both PyroCU and PyroCB have important implications for smoke injection depth, cloud microphysics, and fire behavior. However, despite their importance, these pyroconvective clouds remain incompletely understood and are seldom observed. For example, key questions remain as to what processes control the condensation level and maximum plume height.\nTo address these questions, we present two cases studies of pyroCU and pyroCB associated with large wildfires in northern California in 2014 and 2015. The condensation level in these plumes is directly measured using a scanning Doppler lidar, which discriminates between smoke and condensed water. Lidar data, and additional data from nearby WSR-88D radars, are also used to measure the maximum plume height, which in one case reaches ~12km MSL. These observed plume heights and condensation levels are subsequently examined in the context of atmospheric profiles obtained from radiosonde data near each fire. From these data we discuss the comparative importance of latent heat release from combustion, environmental moisture, and atmospheric stratification on determining condensation level and plume height.",

            "abstract": "Numerical 2-D whole-body simulations of the evolution of Ceres’ internal dynamics and thermal structure over its history indicate that hydrothermal activity is very strong throughout the first half of Ceres’ history, gradually weakening thereafter, but still active even today (Travis et al, 2015, 46th LPSC). Large-scale upwelling plumes of muddy water extend from the porous, permeable rocky core through an ocean layer and impinge on the bottom of the ice shell. These upwellings are very long-lasting. In addition, small scale, shorter-lived plumes frequently develop on the upper regions of the large plumes. The large-scale plumes occur at roughly +/- 25 o latitude. Recently, 3-D simulations of a sector of Ceres shows that the upwellings are indeed plumes and not sheets. In the 3-D model, plume diameters in the model are as small as 15-20 km in diameter, up to several 10s of km or more.\nRelating internal dynamics to surface features is challenging. Linkage to mounds seen on the surface may be possible. There appear to be two classes of mounds: Large domes (10s of km diameter) and small (<15 km diameter). Morphological evidence such as embayment relations imply that large mounds may be extrusive. The source of the small domes is less clear. They could be extrusive, or they could be pingo-like structures that form when large areas of melt are extruded or produced by impact, although they are larger than terrestrial or martian structures. Mound heights are typically no more than 1 - 5 km. One mechanism for generation of these mounds suggested by our modeling is extrusion of mud through fractures in the icy crust. Over-pressuring of upwelling plumes at the base of the icy crust from freezing of neighboring downwellings could generate fractures in a frozen mud crust. As plumes and icy crust cool, a significant volume expansion occurs due to freezing of water to ice. This pressurization is not uniform in space; the still-liquid upwellings will experience overpressure in our model that may be comparable to or greater than the tensile strength of ice and could create fractures, paths through which plume material could reach the surface. The over-pressure in hydrothermal plumes could be comparable to the overburden pressure at the base of multi-km mounds on the surface of Ceres.",

            "abstract": "The kinematic model of the Caribbean plate presented by DeMets et al. (2007) is based on velocities from 6 continuous and 14 campaign GPS sites. COCONet is a multi-hazard GPS-Met observatory, which extends the existing infrastructure of the PBO in North America into the Caribbean basin. In 2010, UNAVCO in collaboration with UCAR, was funded by NSF to design, build, and initially maintain a network of 50 new cGPS/Met sites and include data from another 50 existing sites in the Caribbean region. The COCONet siting plan is for 46 new stations, 21 refurbished stations, and 77 existing stations across 26 nations in the Caribbean region. Data from all COCONet sites flow into the UNAVCO archive and are processed by the PBO analysis centers and are also processed independently by the UTA Geodesy Lab using GIPSY-OASISII (v.6.3) using an APP strategy and final, precise orbits, clocks, and EOP from JPL in the IGS08r frame.\nWe present a refined estimate of Caribbean plate motion by evaluating data from an expanded number of stations with an improved spatial distribution. In order to better constrain the eastern margin of the plate near the Lesser Antilles subduction interface, campaign GPS observations have been collected on the island of Dominica over the last decade. These are combined with additional campaign observations from the western Caribbean, specifically from Honduras and Nicaragua. We have analyzed a total of 117 sites from the Caribbean region, including campaign data and the data from the cGPS stations that comprise COCONet. An updated velocity field for the Caribbean plate is presented and an inversion of the velocities for 24 sites yields a plate angular velocity that differs from previously published models. Our best fitting inversion to GPS velocities from these 24 sites suggests that 2-plate model for the Caribbean is required to fit the GPS observations, which implies that the Caribbean is undergoing modest (1-3 mm/yr) deformation within its interior. Some sites in the western Caribbean included in our analysis may be biased by small, but significant coseismic deformation, which has not been removed from the site velocities used in our inversion to define Caribbean motion and rigidity. Scenarios for possible east-west deformation accommodated across the Lower Nicaraguan Rise and Beata Ridge will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical input of models that improve predictive understanding of ecology, hydrology, and climate change. Multiple techniques exist to quantify LAI, most of which are labor intensive, and all often fail to converge on similar estimates. . Recent large-scale bark beetle induced mortality greatly altered LAI, which is now dominated by younger and more metabolically active trees compared to the pre-beetle forest. Tree mortality increases error in optical LAI estimates due to the lack of differentiation between live and dead branches in dense canopy. Our study aims to quantify LAI using three different LAI methods, and then to compare the techniques to each other and topographic drivers to develop an effective predictive model of LAI. This study focuses on quantifying LAI within a small (~120 ha) beetle infested watershed in Wyoming’s Snowy Range Mountains. The first technique estimated LAI using in-situ hemispherical canopy photographs that were then analyzed with Hemisfer software. The second LAI estimation technique was use of the Kaufmann 1982 allometrerics from forest inventories conducted throughout the watershed, accounting for stand basal area, species composition, and the extent of bark beetle driven mortality. The final technique used airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) first DMS returns, which were used to estimating canopy heights and crown area. LIDAR final returns provided topographical information and were then ground-truthed during forest inventories. Once data was collected, a fractural analysis was conducted comparing the three methods. Species composition was driven by slope position and elevation Ultimately the three different techniques provided very different estimations of LAI, but each had their advantage: estimates from hemisphere photos were well correlated with SWE and snow depth measurements, forest inventories provided insight into stand health and composition, and LIDAR were able to quickly and efficiently cover a very large area.",

            "abstract": "The overdue earthquake on the Coachella section, San Andreas fault (SAF), the model ShakeOut earthquake, and the conflict between cross-fault models involving the Extra fault array and mapped shortening in the Durmid Hill area motivate new analyses at the southern SAF tip. Geologic mapping, LiDAR, seismic reflection, magnetic and gravity datasets, and aerial photography confirm the existence of the East Shoreline strand (ESS) of the SAF southwest of the main trace of the SAF. We mapped the 15 km long ESS, in a band northeast side of the Salton Sea. Other data suggest that the ESS continues N to the latitude of the Mecca Hills, and is >35 km long. The ESS cuts and folds upper Holocene beds and appears to creep, based on discovery of large NW-striking cracks in modern beach deposits. The two traces of the SAF are parallel and ~0.5 to ~2.5 km apart. Groups of east, SE, and ENE-striking strike-slip cross-faults connect the master dextral faults of the SAF. There are few sinistral-normal faults that could be part of the Extra fault array.\nThe 1-km wide ESS contains short, discontinuous traces of NW-striking dextral-oblique faults. These en-echelon faults bound steeply dipping Pleistocene beds, cut out section, parallel tight NW-trending folds, and produced growth folds. Beds commonly dip toward the ESS on both sides, in accord with persistent NE-SW shortening across the ESS. The dispersed fault-fold structural style of the ESS is due to decollements in faulted mud-rich Pliocene to Holocene sediment and ramps and flats along the strike-slip faults.\nA sheared ladder-like geometric model of the two master dextral strands of the SAF and their intervening cross-faults, best explains the field relationships and geophysical datasets. Contraction across >40 km2 of the southernmost SAF zone in the Durmid Hills suggest that interaction of active structures in the SAF zone may inhibit the nucleation of large earthquakes in this region.\nThe ESS may cross the northern Coachella Valley to join the blind Palm Spring dextral fault- a source of microearthquakes and differential subsidence. The ESS may also continue north parallel to the margin of the Salton Trough or have both a NW and NE branch. The risk of a future large earthquake directly beneath the greater Palm Springs metropolitan area may be larger if the first or last options are correct.",

Using kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we show that this heating reduction is due to the presence of large scale parallel electric fields creating an effective field aligned potential which reduces the velocities of counter streaming ions created by Fermi reflection. This potential arises to contain hot exhaust electrons, and an analytic form suitable for observations is derived. The field aligned potential is shown to be critical for understanding both ion and electron heating and so the formation and characteristics of this potential are discussed as well.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - 2015agu_poster.pdf\nThere is ample geological and geochemical evidence that precipitation in the tropics is largely different from today at the mid-Holocene, an era roughly 6,000 years ago when the Northern Hemisphere summer (winter) insolation was stronger (weaker) than today. These insolation differences are caused mainly by the precession of the earth's rotational axis, or called \"precessional forcing”. Using the mid-Holocene experiments of PMIP3, we studied changes in the zonal mean tropical precipitation, and its associated change in cross-equatorial energy transport. A northward movement of the zonal mean precipitation in the mid-Holocene is seen in 10 out of 13 PMIP3 models, with a correspondingly anomalous southward atmospheric heat transport across the equator. The slope is 3.0º per PW, close to the estimate given by Donohoe et al. (2013). The changes in cross-equatorial atmospheric heat transport are dictated by changes in the hemispheric asymmetry of heating from the surface, which in turn are associated with changes in the cross-equatorial oceanic heat transport: an anomalous northward oceanic heat transport at the equator is seen in all of the PMIP3 models. Analysis on this anomalous oceanic heat transport reveals that changes in the wind-driven gyre in the Pacific Ocean are primarily responsible for the changes in cross-equatorial ocean heat transport. Specifically, stronger easterly anomalies north of the equator in the western Pacific drives an anomalous northward mass transport, and therefore accomplishes an anomalous northward heat transport across the equator by acting on the asymmetric mean-state zonal temperature. The wind anomalies responsible for this anomalous ocean heat transport are seen in every PMIP3 model, as well as an ECHAM4-slab ocean model, indicating that it is atmospherically driven and independent of the changes in ocean heat transport. It also explains the consistency of ocean heat transport change, and eventually the relative consistency of zonal mean precipitation change across the PMIP3 models. Although we focus on the change of the zonal mean precipitation, it is important to note that the dominant changes in climate associated with precessional forcing are zonally asymmetric and associated with changes in the monsoon and independent of changes in ocean circulation.",

One such consequence of land use change in the tropics is the propagation of invasive plant species. The Galapagos Islands, an ecosystem subject to significant anthropogenic pressure by both increasing tourism and a growing native population, are especially threatened by invasive plant species. More than 800 plant species have been introduced in Galapagos, comprising over 60% of the total flora. San Cristobal Island in particular has been impacted by the introduction of non-native species; the combined pressures of invasive species and land use change have fundamentally altered 70% of the landscape of the island. We performed stable isotope analysis of fog water, surface water and plant xylem water to examine water use by both native and invasive plant species across different microclimatic zones. We conducted these measurements starting at the end of the rainy season and through the middle of the dry season. Our results represent an initial effort to characterize the effects of a changing vegetative cover on the water cycling of tropical islands and provide insight into the interactions between plants, surface water and groundwater at various spatial and temporal scales.",

            "abstract": "A significant uncertainty in future land-surface carbon budgets is the response of wetlands to climate change. A related question is the future net climate (radiative) forcing impact due to ecosystem and environmental change in wetlands. Active wetlands emit both CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere. CH4 is, over a few decades, a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 whereas as a consequence of a much longer atmospheric lifetime, CO2 has a longer ‘tail’ to its influence. Whether wetlands are a net source or sink of atmospheric carbon under future climate change will depend on the response of the ecosystem to rising temperatures and elevated CO2. The largest uncertainty in future wetland budgets, and its climate forcing, is the stability of the large belowground carbon stocks, often in the form of peat, and the partitioning of CO2 and CH4released via ecosystem respiration.\nWe have characterized the isotopic signatures (14,13C of CO2 and CH4, D-CH4) of the respired carbon used for the production of CO2 and CH4 from the DOE Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change (SPRUCE) site in the Marcell Experimental Forest, which contains replicated mesocosm manipulations including above/below ground warming and elevated CO2. Deep warming (1-2 m) was initiated in July of 2014 and above ground heating will be initiated in July 2015. Comparison of the respired CO2 and CH4with recently fixed photosynthate, below-ground peat (up to 11,000 years old), and dissolved organic carbon allow us to determine the primary substrates used by the microbial community.\nControl and pre-perturbed plots are characterized by the consumption and respiration of recently fixed photosynthate and recent (few years to 15 yr) carbon. Although CH4 fluxes have begun to respond to deep-heating, the source of carbon remains similar in the control and perturbed plots. Respired CO2 remains consistent with being sourced from carbon only a few years old. We will present additional data collected in July, August, and September 2015 which will include the combined influence of above and belowground heating.",

            "abstract": "The time of flight technique is widely used for composition analysis of space plasma instruments. The foil – MCP/CEM combination is commonly used for E x TOF mass analysis at the cost of energy threshold, scattering, and direct particle interaction which ultimately affect performance. An alternative method especially effective at low energies is gated time of flight where the start foil is replaced with electric gating. There are several advantages of electric gating, including elimination of heavy HVPS required for pre-reacceleration to overcome foil thresholds, non- destructive interaction with atomic and molecular ions before analysis, and electronic controllability including geometric factor adjustment for flux dynamic range, FOV optimization, electronic filtering of most abundant elements in favor of minor species, and other properties affecting directly the scientific and engineering performance of the instruments. In addition special secondary emission surfaces can be used for triple coincidence when needed. The combination of electric gating and special surfaces works in an extensive energy range from 0 to tens of KeV without the need of start foil/HVPS making thus the use attractive to small satellites and cubesats. Those characteristics will be elaborated in the context of a gated time of flight wide field of view and energy range ion spectrometer combined with a neutral mass spectrometer (WINMS) developed at GSFC. The instrument prototypes have mass resolution adequate to separate N, O, OH, OH2; also static from ram moving H allowing thus separation of outgassing from ambient gases. A first implementation INMS with a mass <600 grams and size <1.5U is the main payload of the EXOCUBE Cubesat mission launched in January 2015 and already produced flight data; a second upgraded implementation is on onboard the GSFC Dellingr 6U CubeSat scheduled for launch in late 2015; and ongoing developments are baselined for other satellite missions.",

Equally important for performance is the energy cost of providing water for irrigation. Sahel irrigation schemes are dependent on pumping water from rivers into a network of gravity operated channels. In the Senegal River valley in Senegal the cost of pumping water and for irrigation has been estimated to be 20-25% of total rice production costs. Irrigation schemes in the valley are characterized by low water productivity. We analysed rice production, irrigation water use and energy use for supplying irrigation water at Pont Gendarme, Ndiawar and Ngallenka MCA irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley. For the 2013 rainfall season the mean yield ranged between 6 and 8t ha-1. Dry season yield ranged between 1.7 and 6.8t ha-1. Energy use for irrigation in the Ndiawar irrigation scheme was 8kg MJ-1 and 6.4kg MJ-1 in the 2013 and 2014 rainfall seasons respectively. In 2014 (rainfall season) energy productivity of irrigation water was 8.5, 8.0 and 16.4 kg MJ-1 at Ngallenka MCA, Ndiawar and Pont Gendarme respectively. Dry season (2014) energy productivity at Ndiawar and Pont Gendarme was 3.4 and 11.2kg MJ-1 respectively. Productivity of irrigation water was similar for all schemes (0.37kg m-3 at Pont Gendarme, 0.42kg m-3 at Ngallenka MCA, and 0.41kg m-3 Ndiawar). Energy use for the supply of irrigation water in the rainfall season ranged from 403 to 1,002MJ ha-1. Dry season irrigation energy use was 589MJ ha-1 Pont Gendarme and 331MJ ha-1 at Ndiawar. Reducing water use in these schemes through better water management will result in lower production costs and increased margins for the farmers. The observations from 2013 – 2014 highlight the importance of using both water and energy productivity to assess performance of irrigation schemes.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic alteration resulting from watershed urbanization is a common cause of aquatic ecosystem degradation. Developing environmental flow criteria for urbanizing watersheds requires quantitative flow-ecology relationships that describe biological responses to streamflow alteration. Ideally, gaged flow data are used to develop flow-ecology relationships; however, biological monitoring sites are frequently ungaged. For these ungaged locations, hydrologic models must be used to predict streamflow characteristics through calibration and testing at gaged sites, followed by extrapolation to ungaged sites. Physically-based modeling of rainfall-runoff response has frequently utilized “best overall fit” calibration criteria, such as the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), that do not necessarily focus on specific aspects of the flow regime relevant to biota of interest. This study investigates the utility of employing flow characteristics known a priori to influence regional biological endpoints as “ecologically-focused” calibration criteria compared to traditional, “best overall fit” criteria. For this study, 19 continuous HEC-HMS 4.0 models were created in coastal southern California and calibrated to hourly USGS streamflow gages with nearby biological monitoring sites using one “best overall fit” and three “ecologically-focused” criteria: NSE, Richards-Baker Flashiness Index (RBI), percent of time when the flow is < 1 cfs (%<1), and a Combined Calibration (RBI and %<1). Calibrated models were compared using calibration accuracy, environmental flow metric reproducibility, and the strength of flow-ecology relationships. Results indicate that “ecologically-focused” criteria can be calibrated with high accuracy and may provide stronger flow-ecology relationships than “best overall fit” criteria, especially when multiple “ecologically-focused” criteria are used in concert, despite inabilities to accurately reproduce additional types of ecological flow metrics to which the models are not explicitly calibrated.",

The current future projections based on IPCC models, for example as documented in the recent Climate Change Assessment for the Southwest, indicate a declining trend in precipitation with a warming climate, with associated dramatic reductions in streamflow in the Colorado River basin. However, inconsistent precipitation trends are projected by individual IPCC global climate models (i.e. Sheffield et al. 2013, Bukovsky et al., 2013). The North American Monsoon interannual variability is partly controlled by warm season atmospheric teleconnections emanating from the western tropical Pacific, related to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV). Departure from the ensemble mean approach for long-term climate projection analysis, a physics-based methodology is designed to analyze the relationship between climate extremes and the large scale forcing (Chang et al. 2015). Analysis from the observational record and downscaled CMIP3 regional climate runs has shown intensifying warm season precipitation and temperature extremes following the natural variability of large scale forcing.\nWe will utilize the ongoing community effort in dynamically downscaling the CMIP5 climate projection datasets, part of the North American Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX), and compare with the previous generation of CMIP3 downscaled products for future climate assessment. We aim to examine the difference in large scale forcing from different generations of the CMIP models, and the related impact on regional scale climate extreme characteristics.",

Determining how the SPCZ responded to climate variations before the instrumental record requires the use of indirect indicators of rainfall. The link between the hydrogen isotopic composition of fluxes of water though the hydrologic cycle, lake water, and molecular fossil 2H/1H ratios make hydrogen isotopes a promising tool for improving our understanding of this important climate feature. An analysis of coretop sediment from freshwater lakes in the SPCZ region indicates that there is a strong spatial relationship between δ2Hdinosterol and mean annual precipitation rate. The objectives of this research are to use 2H/1H ratios of the biomarker dinosterol to develop an empirical relationship between δ2Hdinosterol and modern environmental rainfall rates so that we may quantitatively reconstruct several aspects of the SPCZ’s hydrological system during the late Holocene. The analysis includes lake sediment coretops from the Solomon Islands, Wallis Island, Vanuatu, Tahiti, Samoa, New Caledonia, and the Cook Islands. These islands span range of average modern precipitation rates from 3 to 7 mm/day and the coretop sediment δ2Hdinosterol values range from -240‰ to -320‰. Applying this regional coretop calibration to dated sediment cores reveals that the mean annual position and/or intensity of the SPCZ has not been static during the past 2000 years.",

In particular, we separated the Asian region into several sub-region based on the primary limiting factor – water, food and energy. We then quantified how changes in environmental factors have altered the water and food resources during the past century.

            "abstract": "Ecosystem scale measurements of evaporation (E) from intensively managed pasture systems are scarce and are important for informing water resource decision making, drought forecasting, and validation of Earth system models and remote sensing. We measured E from intensively grazed, unirrigated, ryegrass and clover pasture in New Zealand using eddy covariance (EC) for three years (2012 – 2014). Spatial variation in E was less than 3% during the initial study period when up to three sites were operating simultaneously. Inter-annual variability was also less than 3% over the three consecutive years (710 – 730 mm) at one site. The absence of spatial and inter-annul variation largely occurred because E was strongly controlled by net radiation (daytime half-hourly data r2 = 0.83, p < 0.01) which was relatively consistent between sites and years. However, soil moisture decreased surface conductance during seasonal drought constraining E relative to net radiation. Variation in drought severity between years caused variation in seasonal E between years, for example, a relatively severe autumn drought in 2013 reduced E over autumn by 13% compared to 2012. Coincidentally, two unusually large spring and early summer rainfall events during warm conditions later in 2013 increased summer E by 12% compared to 2012 and therefore similar annual totals were measured between years. The FAO56 Penman-Monteith model was able to accurately predict daily E over an annual cycle (r2 = 0.81) to within 5 % of measured cumulative E with a crop factor of 0.96 (determined under non water-limiting conditions) and a water stress coefficient to account for soil moisture restrictions. Intensive grazing events, that remove a large fraction of standing pasture biomass, were found to have no effect on evaporation. The absence of a grazing effect suggests that leaf area was not an important control of E, likely because increases in soil E were able to compensate for decreased transpiration.",

Lava flows sampled from this region yield Quaternary 40Ar/39Ar ages and have distinct geochemical and isotopic (Sr, Nd, and Pb) compositions, but all the rock samples are consistent with juvenile mantle sources. Most of the volcanism is basaltic, including that in the Karasu rift, which occurs between the Dead Sea fault zone and the East Anatolian fault. Distinctly more alkaline (basanite-tephrite) volcanism is recorded in late-Pleistocene lavas of Delihalil, a volcano situated in close proximity to the East Anatolian fault. The mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic data observed in these lava samples are consistent with small differences in mantle source areas controlled in part by the complex plate boundary configurations defining this area.

Recently, their calcification potential has been tested in an emerging technology-- bioconcrete. This study is to explore the calcification by three cyanobacteria strains under different environmental conditions. Experiment A was carried out in 2mM NaHCO3 and 5mM CaCl2, with a cell concentration of 107 cells L-1. In experiment B, one side of the concrete surface was treated with bacteria and then immersed in the solution containing 0.4 mM NaHCO3 and 300 mM CaCl2.\nIn experiment A, the pH of the abiotic condition remained constant around 8.55, while that of biotic conditions increased by 0.15 units in the presence of LS0519, and by 0.3 units in the presence of PCC8806 or PCC6803 within 8 hours. Over a period of 30 hours, PCC8806, LS0519 and PCC6803 removed 0.1, 0.12 and 0.2 mM calcium from the solution respectively. After 30 hours, the alkalinity of the solution decreased by 30 mg/L, 10 mg/L and 5 mg/L respectively in the presence of PCC6803, LS0519 and PCC8806. Under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), no precipitate was found in the abiotic condition, while calcium carbonate was associated by all the three strains. Among them, PCC6803 precipitated more carbonates.\nIn experiment B, LS0519 and PCC8806 increased the pH with a value of 0.25, while PCC6803 increased the pH by 0.33 units. SEM shows LS0519 was less likely attached to the concrete surface. Neither did the precipitates on concrete surface differ from that in the abiotic condition. In comparison, PCC8806 and PCC6803 were closely associated with 8-µm porous precipitates. Cells were either found enclosed in precipitates or connecting two precipitates.\nIn conclusion, all the three strains triggered the calcium carbonate precipitation. LS0519 has a little impact on the carbonate precipitation in the solution, but negligent influence on the concrete surface. Although PCC8806 has little influence on the precipitation process in the solution, their impact on the concrete surface is comparable to PCC6803. PCC6803 exhibit a better precipitation potential compared with other two strains in both environment.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions contribute to ~10-12% of global anthropogenic emissions. While agriculture is a major source of GHG emissions, there is also great potential for mitigation, as emissions can be reduced by utilizing specific field management and fertilization strategies. This study closely monitors hay and corn fields in Vermont in two paired-watershed sites. Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane emissions were measured weekly using static chambers and a Photoacoustic Gas Sensor (PAS) across both field management treatments: conventional and mitigation.\nAccurately quantifying emissions from agricultural landscapes is crucial to develop and implement optimal mitigation strategies, but quantifying landscape-wide emissions is challenging. In this study, we show that both field management treatments and environmental conditions (such as field flooding from rain events) significantly affect GHG emissions, and both can be highly spatially variable even on the field-scale.\nMonitoring this kind of complexity across a watershed is difficult, as most current emissions quantification techniques, such as static chambers, are localized, point specific and costly. Remote sensing provides an opportunity to monitor landscapes more efficiently and cost effectively. High resolution imagery from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can also provide opportunities for more accurate watershed-wide estimates of GHG emission rates based on observable agricultural field conditions and management signals, such as field flooding, fertilizer application method, and cover cropping. Satellite imagery, and even the higher resolution aerial imagery used for agricultural monitoring, do not provide the spatial or temporal resolution needed to monitor the on-field complexities that affect GHG emissions.\nThis study combines and compares environmental and management observations from UAV imagery and in-situ field GHG emissions measurements to determine the effectiveness of UAV imagery in capturing data from environmental and management events. We then employ this UAV imagery to bridge the scale between field-monitoring of emissions to a landscape-wide monitoring of emissions, a technique which we hope can be utilized for more robust landscape-wide GHG emissions in the future.",

Work is structured around the learning management system making it a teaching space, rather than a filing system. To ensure focus, topics are clustered into themes with a ‘question of the week’. Collaboration tools are used to promote peer-2-peer learning, knowledge building and communication. For one assignment, students analyse a media article and compare it to the original scientific paper. On-campus students do this collaboratively using electron whiteboards while Distance Education students create blog. All online activity is monitored and inappropriate behaviour dealt with quickly. The ranking of the unit by students has increased significantly with the incorporation of the new approaches. While there is inherent value in exposing students to the latest digital tools, technologies come and go.

In the auroral zone the derivative magnitude observed by 5-second fluxgate magnetometers often has a lognormal distribution. Parameter estimates corresponding to intensity (log-mean) and variability (log-variance) are nearly independent and have very different statistical properties. Variability is essentially a random variable, while intensity autocorrelation times are on the order of tens of minutes. Observed intensities are highly correlated with AE, and increase with solar wind speed and the magnitude of $B_z<0$. Both variability and intensity have local-time maxima before and after midnight, but with different patterns that combine to produce a larger post-midnight peak. Post-midnight variability is almost completely determined by latitude, with largest values at subauroral sites and smallest values in the polar cap. Intensity depends on latitude, but also has a site-specific element which may be due to local conductivity.",

In both of these tree species, mortality results from hydraulic failure within the xylem, due to blue stain fungal infection associated with beetle attack. However, the impacts of these disturbances on ecosystem-scale water fluxes can be complex, owing to their variable and transient nature. In this work, xylem scaling factors that reduced whole-tree conductance were initially incorporated into a forest ecohydrological model (TREES) to simulate the impact of beetle mortality on evapotranspiration (ET) in both pine and spruce forests. For both forests, simulated ET was compared to observed ET fluxes recorded using eddy covariance techniques. Using xylem scaling factors, the model overestimated the impact of beetle mortality, and observed ET fluxes were approximately two-fold higher than model predictions in both forests. The discrepancy between simulated and observed ET following the onset of beetle mortality may be the result of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of plant communities within the foot prints of the eddy covariance towers. Since simulated ET fluxes following beetle mortality in both forests only accounted for approximately 50% of those observed in the field, it is possible that newly established understory vegetation in recently killed tree stands may play a role in stabilizing ecosystem ET fluxes. Here, we further investigate the unaccounted for ET fluxes in the model by breaking it down into multiple cohorts that represent live trees, dying trees, and understory vegetation that establishes following tree mortality.",

Carbon and nitrogen isotopes have traditionally been used to study OM cycling in soils, even though above- and below- ground OM pools are not always isotopically distinct. Stable isotope ratios of hydrogen (δ2H) in roots and soil OM have recently been shown to provide an additional tracer for soil OM cycling (Ruppenthal et al., 2015). The δ2H values of roots are not influenced significantly by evaporative transpiration and therefore are more closely correlated to climate and precipitation δ2H values as compared to shoot OM. We found that the δ2H values of roots from near the surface were more negative by 8-40‰ relative to the δ2H values of fresh leaf tissues and surface litter. In soils, we combined physical density separation and isotopic (δ2H, δ13C, δ15N) analyses to understand how root-derived OM contributes to the OM stored in soils. The δ2H and δ13C of soil OM from 1) free, 2) occluded, and/or 3) mineral associated soil fractions in upper soil horizons (up to 1 m) will be presented and compared from a suite of soils collected from a CZO (Critical Zone Observatory) climosequence in the southern Sierra Nevada range (USA). Whether or not the δ2H of these soil fractions relates to climate and precipitation patterns will also be discussed.",

We tested a novel, low-cost terrestrial laser scanner for its capacity to provide reliable and successive assessments of canopy PAI in an evergreen eucalypt forest. Daily scans were made by three scanners at one forest site over a three-year period, providing mostly consecutive estimates of PAI, and of vertical structure profiles (as Plant Area Volume Density, PAVD). Data filtering, involving objective statistical methods to identify outliers, indicated that scan quality was adversely affected by moist weather and moderate wind speeds (>4 m s-1), suggesting limited utility in some forest environments. We found strong agreement between lidar-derived PAI estimates, and those from monthly hemispherical images (±0.1 PAI); with both methods indicating mostly stable PAI over multiple seasons. The PAVD profiles from the laser scanner indicated that leaf flush in the upper canopy concomitantly balanced leaf loss from the middle canopy in summer, which was consistent with measured summer peaks in litter fall. This clearly illustrated the advantages of three-dimensional lidar data over traditional two-dimensional PAI estimates in monitoring tree phenology, and in interpreting changes in canopy reflectance as detected by air- and space-borne remotely sensed data.",

            "abstract": "We examine the structure and composition of several subsidiary NE-trending faults of the Southern San Andreas Fault (SSAF) within the Mecca Hills, southern California. The Hidden Springs, Platform, Eagle Canyon and related smaller faults are part of a positive flower structure that forms a broad zone of fault-related damage within the northeastern block of the SSAF. Here active creep is localized along the main trace of SSAF during the interseismic period. Exhumed exposures span a wide-range of rock types and fault-related rocks and juxtapose Tertiary to Quaternary sedimentary rocks against variable aged crystalline and meta-sedimentary rocks.\nDetailed characterization of the textural, compositional, and geochemical aspects of the fault-related rocks, and analyses of variations across the 2 faults and related damage zones use a combination of field, microstructural, XRD, XRF, SEM, and isotope methods. Evidence for multiple episodes of slip and fluid flow with a wide range of orientations and amounts of slip is recorded by the geometry and distribution of slip surfaces, cataclasite, reworked cataclasite, deformed and reworked veins, multiple generations of breccia, iron oxide stained gouge, and hematite coated fracture and slip surfaces. Alteration phases vary between fault surfaces and may include chlorite-serpentine, clays (±illite, ±palygorskite), quartz, calcite, ankerite, zeolites, iron oxides, and/or sulfides, or some combination thereof, suggestive of complex fluid-rock reactions. Millimeter-thin slip surfaces within the crystalline rocks consist of plastically deformed and highly sheared calcite. Major vein systems include a predominately north-northwest striking quartz set, a north-south striking calcite set, and an east-west striking calcite set, where locally these sets are complexly interwoven, finely interlayered with other minerals, and/or brecciated rocks. Slip lineations on fault surfaces 1-5 m2 with calcite±clay coated surfaces exhibit multiple orientations, or are continuous around 90° fault bends, indicating heterogeneous stresses at the fault surface scale.\nThe scale of variations in structural complexity and rock properties of the SSAF are important input parameters for developing realistic models for the attenuation of near fault wave amplification.",

            "abstract": "The formation of authigenic carbonate (AC) in marine sediments provides a plausible explanation for large, long-lasting marine δ13C excursions that does not require extreme swings in atmospheric O2 or CO2. AC precipitation during diagenesis is driven by alkalinity production during anaerobic organic matter oxidation and is coupled to sulfate reduction. To evaluate the extent to which this process contributes to global carbon cycling, we need to relate AC production to the geochemical and geomicrobiological processes and ocean chemical conditions that control it. We present a method to estimate modern rates of AC precipitation using an inversion approach based on the diffusion-advection-reaction equation and sediment pore fluid chemistry profiles as a function of depth. SEM images and semi-quantitative elemental map analyses provide further constraints. Our initial focus is on ODP sites 807 and 1082.\nWe sum the diffusive, advective, and reactive terms that describe changes in pore fluid Ca and Mg concentrations due to precipitation of secondary carbonate. We calculate the advective and diffusive terms from the first and second derivatives of the Ca and Mg pore fluid concentrations using a spline fit to the data. Assuming steady-state behavior we derive net AC precipitation rates of up to 8 x 10-4 mmol m-2 y-1 for Site 807 and 0.6 mmol m-2 y-1 for Site 1082. Site 1082 sediments contain pyrite, which increases in amount down-section towards the estimated peak carbonate precipitation rate, consistent with sulfate-reduction-induced AC precipitation. However, the presence of gypsum and barite throughout the sediment column implies incomplete sulfate reduction and merits further investigation of the biogeochemical reactions controlling authigenesis. Further adjustments to our method could account for the small but non-negligible fraction of groundmass with a CaSO4 signature. Our estimates demonstrate that AC formation may represent a sizeable flux in the modern global carbon cycle, on order of 1013 g C y-1. Further, it is likely to have played an even more impactful role in the Paleozoic and Precambrian, when lower surface O2 concentrations created reducing conditions favoring increased carbon burial and alkalinity production during diagenesis.",

The prediction of uranium(VI) adsorption and diffusion in clay-rich media, however, is complicated by (1) the complexity of the mineralogical structure of montmorillonite, in terms of its pore-size distributions and available surface site types, and (2) the complex uranium(VI) solution speciation, which can include cationic, uncharged, and anionic complexes, depending on solution conditions. For instance, a partial or full exclusion of anions from negatively charged clay interlayer spaces could change the effective ‘anion-accessible’ porosity and decrease the diffusive flux of these solutes under steady state conditions. In contrast, weak cation exchange reactions can result in ‘surface diffusion’ of adsorbed cations, such as UO2OH+, in addition to diffusion in the liquid phase, resulting in greater diffusive fluxes at steady state.\nIn order to investigate these complex interactions, we performed two, lab-scale uranium(VI) through-diffusion experiments in lightly compacted Na-montmorillonite at slightly different, alkaline pH conditions (average pH values of 8.69 and 8.87). Observed uranium(VI) diffusive fluxes were decreased by approximately an order of magnitude in comparison to a tritium tracer. This indicates a relevance of ‘anion exclusion’ effects, the full or partial exclusion of anionic U(VI)-carbonato species from clay interlayer spaces. In addition, uranium(VI) sorption reactions were shown to be relevant in the diffusion experiments, even at alkaline pH values of around 8.7 and 8.9, where uranium(VI) sorption is low compared to other pH conditions. Despite the similarity of pH conditions, different degrees of uranium(VI) retardation were determined for the two systems. Additionally, we observed apparent kinetic limitations for uranium(VI) sorption as a function of pH, which was indicated by different varying times required to reach steady-state conditions for diffusive fluxes.",

The resulting sediment-rich floods caused dozens of deaths and/or disappearances, over $1 billion in estimated damage, and widespread geomorphic change. Here we describe the hydrologic and geomorphic drivers and responses to the 2015 Atacama floods, including characterization of the hydrologic forcing, water and sediment routing from source areas in the upper watershed to the outlet at the Pacific Ocean, and urban flooding impacts of this event. In a region where few direct measurements of precipitation and discharge during these events are available, we combined hydrologic and hydraulic modeling with field and aerial photograph interpretation of sediment sources and geomorphic change. A remarkable element of the flood, particularly with respect to its effects on urban areas, was its high sediment load. Despite widespread hillslope erosion in the form of rilling and gullying initiated by overland flow, sediment from these sources typically did not reach valley bottoms, and only limited, small-scale mass wasting was observed. Field observations indicated that the sediment load was primarily derived from dramatic erosion of channel bed, bank, and floodplain material (i.e., valley fill). In the coastal city of Chañaral, flooding of the Salado River produced maximum water depths over 6 m, meters-thick mud deposition in buildings and along city streets, flow velocities larger than 8 m/s, and coastal erosion. Broader implications of studying the Atacama flooding include hazard reduction, the history of copper mining and more than five decades of contamination in many of the affected watersheds, and the Atacama’s status as a terrestrial analog for Mars.",

A large fraction of these mineral resources are located in Amazon region, which is known for its large biodiversity and world climate importance. As the policies that control the Amazon preservation are relatively new, several mining activities have been exploring the Amazon territory, promoting a large process of degradation. Once the mining activities have a high potential of environmental changes the government created polices to restrain the mining in Amazon forests and obligate mining companies to reclaim theirs minded areas. However, the measurement of reclamation development still is a challenging task for the Professionals involved. The volume and complexity of the variables, allied to the difficulty in identifying the reclamation of ecosystem functionalities are still lack to ensure the reclamation success. In this sense this work aims to investigate the representativeness of morphometric soil aggregates parameters in the understanding of reclamation development. The study area is located in the National Forest of Jamari, State of Rondônia. In the past mining companies explored the region producing eight closed mines that are now in reclamation process. The soil aggregates morphometric measurements: geometric mean diameter (GMD), aggregate circularity index, and aggregate roundness, were choose based in its obtaining facility, and their association to biological activity. To achieve the proposed objective the aggregates of eight sites in reclamation, from different closed mines, where chosen and compared to Amazon forest and open mine soil aggregates. The results were analyzed to one way ANOVA to identifying differences between areas in reclamation, natural ecosystem, and open mine. It was obtained differences for GMD and circularity index. However, only the circularity index allowed to identifying differences between the reclamation sites. The results allowed concluding: (1) Morphometric aggregates measurements can represent the reclamation process in Amazon territory; (2) To validate the results more areas in reclamation process in different ecosystems must be investigated; (3) Roundness didn’t represented any differences.\nKey words: circularity index, ecosystem, geometric mean diameter.",

Ensuring that the users are receiving the most accurate data is a high priority at ONC, requiring quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) procedures to be developed for all data types. While some data types have relatively straightforward QAQC tests, such as scalar data range limits that are based on expected observed values or measurement limits of the instrument, for other data types the QAQC tests are more comprehensive. Long time series of ocean currents from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP), stitched together from multiple deployments over many years is one such data type where systematic data biases are more difficult to identify and correct. Data specialists at ONC are working to quantify systematic compass heading uncertainty in long-term ADCP records at each of the major study sites using the internal compass, remotely operated vehicle bearings, and more analytical tools such as principal component analysis (PCA) to estimate the optimal instrument alignments. In addition to using PCA, some work has been done to estimate the main components of the current at each site using tidal harmonic analysis.

This buttressing process typically defines a ‘compressive arch’ in the strain rate-field of the ice shelf, where the smallest principal component transitions from compressive inland of the arch to extensive seaward of the arch. If the compressive arch is breached due to iceberg calving at the ice front or thinning at the shear margins, the ice shelf will retreat irreversibly to a new stable configuration or collapse entirely. This retreat can compromise ice shelf buttressing, resulting in sea-level rise and ocean freshening as grounded ice flows unrestricted into the ocean. Here, we investigate the dynamics of compressive arch failure using Larsen C ice shelf as a test case for a larger study that will include several other ice shelves and projections for sea-level rise. We use satellite observations to develop a steady state model of Larsen C in Elmer/ICE, a finite element ice sheet/ice flow software package. We run calving and thinning simulations to determine the conditions needed to trigger ice shelf retreat via compressive arch failure and discuss the likelihood of these scenarios occurring in relation to extrapolations of current melt profiles and calving trends.",

            "abstract": "Philosophers of science discuss how multiple modes of measurement can generate evidence for the existence and character of a phenomenon (Horwich 1982; Hacking 1983; Franklin and Howson 1984; Collins 1985; Sober 1989; Trout 1993; Culp 1995; Keeley 2002; Staley 2004; Weber 2005; Keyser 2012). But how can this work systematically in climate change measurement? Additionally, what conclusions can scientists and policy-makers draw when different modes of measurement fail to be robust by producing contradictory results? First, I present a new technical account of robust measurement (RAMP) that focuses on the physical independence of measurement processes. I detail how physically independent measurement processes “check each other’s results.” (This account is in contrast to philosophical accounts of robustness analysis that focus on independent model assumptions or independent measurement products or results.) Second, I present a puzzle about contradictory and divergent climate change measures, which has consistently re-emerged in climate measurement. This discussion will focus on land, drilling, troposphere, and computer simulation measures. Third, to systematically solve this climate measurement puzzle, I use RAMP in the context of drought measurement in order to generate a classification of measurement processes. Here, I discuss how multimodal precipitation measures—e.g., measures of precipitation deficit like the Standard Precipitation Index vs. air humidity measures like the Standardized Relative Humidity Index--can help with the classification scheme of climate change measurement processes. Finally, I discuss how this classification of measures can help scientists and policy-makers draw effective conclusions in contradictory multimodal climate change measurement contexts.",

Such information is extremely valuable for understanding various terrestrial hydrologic processes and their implications on human life. At the same time, soil moisture is a joint consequence of numerous physical processes (precipitation, temperature, radiation, topography, crop/vegetation dynamics, soil properties, etc.) that happen at a wide range of scales from tens of kilometers down to tens of meters. Therefore, a full and thorough analysis/exploration of SMAP data products calls for investigations at multiple spatial scales - from regional, to catchment, and to field scales.\nHere we first compare the SMAP retrievals to the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macro-scale land surface model simulations over the continental U. S. region at 3-km resolution. The forcing inputs to the model are merged/downscaled from a suite of best available data products including the NLDAS-2 forcing, Stage IV and Stage II precipitation, GOES Solar Insolation Product, and fine elevation data. The near real time VIC simulation is intended to provide a source of large scale comparisons at the active sensor resolution. Beyond the VIC model scale, we perform comparisons at 30-m resolution against the recently developed HydroBloks hyper-resolution land surface model over several densely gauged USDA experimental watersheds. Comparisons are also made against in-situ point-scale observations from various SMAP Cal/Val sites.",

            "abstract": "While cratons are stable features based on their ages, they apparently can be disturbed by flattened slabs and hidden hotspots. When these slabs break up they provide a host of volatiles which interact with the old lithosphere producing complicated structures. These have been imaged by a host of techniques involving modeling regional waveforms and an assortment of tomography models. Here we test these models against a deep March 25th, 2013 Guatemala event at a depth of 190 km, which produced an excellent set of TA record sections that provide dense sampling of the structure, spanning the ranges from 15 to 35 degrees. Because the structure in the southern Gulf of Mexico is uncertain, we first concentrated on deriving a pure-path model for this region. Both P and SH triplication data is well sampled by stations located in Florida from 13 degrees and beyond. The best fitting model is modified from the SH model ATL (Grand and Helmberger, 1984) with a P-model in Zhao and Helmberger (1993). These models contain a high-velocity lid structure along with a low-velocity gradient at depth. This allows the up-going S wave (direct) to remain the first arrival traveling in the fast lid to beyond 180 degrees. The modeling of the direct S along with the diving phases and depth phase triplications, pP, sP, sS allows for a well constrained model. This model ATLm and the earlier craton model CR along with mixture of the two are tested with the Cut-and-Paste (CAP) code on whole 3 component records. Over large paths of data produced by the southern US support the so-called X-phase arrivals which are produced by a 300 km transition. This feature breas down at large distance (>25 degree) along a northwest-southeast boundary. Data at larger distances indicate a complexity in the 660 transition which appears to be caused by a fast slab located at the top of the lower mantle. Variation in the EF-CD branches of pP and sP display changes of up to 5 s and sS up to 10 s, associated with the transition from CR to ATLm on the east coast.",

Such calibration data for Ginkgo biloba are available for the ongoing rise in atmospheric CO2 and for high levels of CO2 anticipated in the future, but lacking for low CO2 levels of preindustrial and glacial ages. The oldest modern specimen that we have been able to obtain consists of leaf fragments collected in 1829 and provided by Arne Anderberg from the Swedish Natural History Museum. The specimen was labeled “Argentina”, but also “Hortus Botanicus Augustinus”, a garden founded in 1638 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Ginkgo has a very thin cuticle that is difficult to prepare, but images very similar to cuticular preparation can be obtained by backscatter SEM imagery. We also obtained secondary SEM images of the same areas and counted 13 images with 6,184 cells from five leaf fragments. Our analyses yield a stomatal index of 10.9 ± 0.9 % for an atmospheric CO2 of 286 ppm, as determined by ice core data from Ciais and Sabine for IPCC-2013. This value is lower than from previous calibration curves for this level of CO2 and changes their curvature. With additional late nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first century leaves, we can improve both the precision and lower limits of the transfer function for atmospheric CO2 from Ginkgo stomatal index last revised in 2009.",

            "abstract": "Interpreting surface deformation patterns in terms of deeper processes in regions of active magmatism is challenging and inherently non-unique. This study focuses on interpreting the unusual sombrero-shaped pattern of surface deformation in the Altiplano Puna region of South America, which has previously been modeled as the effect of an upwelling diapir of material in the lower crust. Our goal is to investigate other possible interpretations of the surface deformation feature using a suite of viscoelastic models with varying material heterogeneity. We use the finite-element code PyLith to study surface deformation due to a buried time-varying (periodic) overpressure source, a magma body, at depth within a viscoelastic half-space. In our models, the magma-body is a penny-shaped crack, with a cylindrical region above the crack that is weak relative to the surrounding material. We initially consider a magma body within a homogeneous viscoelastic half-space to determine the effect of the free surface upon deformation above and beneath the source region. We observe a complex depth-dependent phase relationship between stress and strain for elements that fall between the ground surface and the roof of the magma body. Next, we consider a volume of weak material (faster relaxation time relative to background) that is distributed with varying geometry around the magma body. We investigate how surface deformation is governed by the spatial distribution of the weak material and its rheologic parameters. We are able to reproduce a \"sombrero\" pattern of surface velocities for a range of models with material heterogeneity. The wavelength of the sombrero pattern is primarily controlled by the extent of the heterogeneous region, modulated by flexural effects. Our results also suggest an \"optimum overpressure forcing frequency\" where the lifetime of the sombrero pattern (a transient phenomenon due to the periodic nature of the overpressure forcing) reaches a maximum. Through further research we hope to better understand how the parameter space of our forward model controls the distribution of surface deformation and eventually develop a better understanding of the observed pattern of surface deformation in the Altiplano Puna.",

We consider many types of human conflict, ranging from interpersonal conflict -- domestic violence, road rage, assault, murder, and rape -- to intergroup conflict -- riots, coups, ethnic violence, land invasions, gang violence, and civil war. After harmonizing statistical specifications and standardizing estimated effect sizes within each conflict category, we implement a meta-analysis that allows us to estimate the mean effect of climate variation on conflict outcomes as well as quantify the degree of variability in this effect size across studies. Looking across more than 50 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation patterns systematically increase the risk of conflict, often substantially, with average effects that are highly statistically significant. We find that contemporaneous temperature has the largest average effect by far, with each 1 standard deviation increase toward warmer temperatures increasing the frequency of contemporaneous interpersonal conflict by 2% and of intergroup conflict by more than 10%. We also quantify substantial heterogeneity in these effect estimates across settings.",

            "abstract": "The Santa Barbara and Ventura Fold Belts have very different uplift rates: ~1-2 m/ky and ~6-8 m/ky, respectively. Differences are probably related to the position of the two belts relative to the big bend of the San Andreas fault. The onshore transition between these fold belts occurs at Rincon Creek, near Carpinteria. We use a combination of geomorphology and geochronology to describe patterns and rates of crustal deformation near Rincon Creek and test whether the known change in uplift rate is spatially discrete or distributed across the transition zone.\nFive sediment samples from the first emergent marine terrace between Carpinteria and Rincon Creek are being processed for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. We expect the age of this terrace to be either MIS 3 or MIS 5. An age of MIS 3 will suggest that the terrace is continuous with the Punta Gorda terrace across Rincon Creek. An age of MIS 5 will suggest that a geologic discontinuity exists across Rincon Creek, supporting the existence of a cross-fault at Rincon Creek. Terrace chronology will also help constrain the growth rate of the Rincon Creek anticline and the slip rates of several faults that vertically displace the marine terrace.\nUplift patterns may be inferred from stream profile analysis via digital topography. Preliminary analysis of normalized stream steepness indices and stream concavities from Carpinteria to La Conchita indicate a gradational change in uplift rate rather than a sharp transition at Rincon Creek. Chi analysis and knickpoint identification are in progress and will also help delineate patterns of uplift.",

In particular we constrain the comet dust type and ratios to the ice mass in the nucleus body. Additionally we estimat the subsurface density and porosity from CONSERT dielectric inversion and compare it to the values estimated for the upper crust from the Philae landing dynamics. Our preliminary results suggest that the comet dielectric properties are consistent with carbonated chondrites dust and water crystalline ice mixtures with very low dust concentration in the comet deep subsurface. Additionally we develop an empirical model that correlates the surface and subsurface compressive strengths to the dielectric properties. The compressive strength of both the surface and the subsurface are explored using this model using the dielectric properties inverted from the CONSERT observations. Our preliminary results suggest that the average surface compressive strength at 67P surface range from 2 kPa to 1 MPa, for a mean surface temperature of -70° C. We also analyzed the OSIRIS images of the Philae lander first impact footprints which are suggested to be ~15 cm deep into the upper regolith and hence suggesting a low surface compressive strength close to 2 kPa. The comet subsurface compressive strength of subsurface is estimated to be < 1kPa.

            "abstract": "Cable bacteria are long filamentous bacteria that capable for long distance electron transport: transporting electrons derived from oxidizing sulfide in anoxic layers, to oxygen at the sediment surface, over a distance of centimeters. Cable bacteria are found in many types of freshwater and marine sediment all over the world, with density of approximately thousands of kilometers per square meter. These long filaments are composed by individual cells closely related to Desulfobulbaceae, connected with a shared outer membrane inside which the strings structure are presumed to be highly conductive. The observed doubling time of cells within the filament is about 20 min, which is among the shortest compare to other bacteria. In these cable cells, we constantly observed polyphosphate granules (poly-P), regardless of cell dimension and shape. This is very interesting since it has long been recognized that the microbial polyP content is low during rapid growth and increases under unfavorable conditions, for example, increasing sulfide concentration and anoxia resulted in a decomposition of poly-P in Beggiatoa. Here, we investigated marine cable bacteria from Netherland and Aarhus Bay, focusing on the poly-P dynamics under various redox conditions. In poly-P stained cells, typically there are two big poly-P granules locate at each polar. In dividing cells, however, the morphology of poly-P changed to six small granules precisely arranged to two row. Moreover, the cells seem be able to continuously divide more than one time without elongation step. These varied poly-P morphologies demonstrate that poly-P is closely related to the cell growth and cell division, by an unknown mechanism. Individual cable filaments were picked up and were exposed to different redox conditions; our primary data indicated the cable cells could suffer anoxic condition better than oxic condition. We also detected decomposition of poly-P under anoxia. These results call for an in-depth examination for the function of the poly-P granules inside cable bacteria, and indicate poly-P may reflect different physiological and environmental conditions rather than genetic differences.",

            "abstract": "Complex models with large number of parameters are commonly used to estimate sediment yields and predict changes in sediment loads as a result of changes in management or conservation practice at large watershed (>2000 km2) scales. As sediment yield is a strongly non-linear function that responds to channel (peak or mean) velocity or flow depth, it is critical to accurately represent flows. The process of calibration in such models (e.g., SWAT) generally involves the adjustment of several parameters to obtain better estimates of goodness of fit metrics such as Nash Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE). However, such indicators only provide a global view of model performance, potentially obscuring accuracy of the timing or magnitude of specific flows of interest. We describe an approach for streamflow calibration that will greatly reduce the black-box nature of calibration, when response from a parameter adjustment is not clearly known. Fourier Transform or the Short Term Fourier Transform could be used to characterize model performance in the frequency domain as well, however, the ambiguity of a Fourier transform with regards to time localization renders its implementation in a model calibration setting rather useless. Brief and sudden changes (e.g. stream flow peaks) in signals carry the most interesting information from parameter adjustments, which are completely lost in the transform without time localization. Wavelet transform captures the frequency component in the signal without compromising time and is applied to contrast changes in signal response to parameter adjustments. Here we employ the mother wavelet called the Mexican hat wavelet and apply a Continuous Wavelet Transform to understand the signal in the frequency domain. Further, with the use of the cross-wavelet spectrum we examine the relationship between the two signals (prior or post parameter adjustment) in the time-scale plane (e.g., lower scales correspond to higher frequencies). The non-stationarity of the streamflow signal does not hinder this assessment and regions of change called boundaries of influence (seasons or time when such change occurs in the hydrograph) for each parameter are delineated. In addition, we can discover the structural component of the signal (e.g., shifts or amplitude change) that has changed.",

            "abstract": "Conceptual climate models are useful for testing hypotheses regarding the processes underlying observations; but they generally can only qualitatively match the empirical records. Models based on substantially different underlying physics can have comparable correlations with any given observation, thus robust model validation procedures are needed. The Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) is an ideal test case for the development of such procedures because the character and cause of the transition from a dominant 41 kyr cycle in the early Pleistocene to a dominant 100 kyr cycle in the late Pleistocene is poorly understood. Using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition, we analyze multiple conceptual models for the MPT which are based on differing physical hypotheses and show how modern time-series-analysis techniques can improve climate-model validation by extracting and comparing subtler features of both the observations and models.",

            "abstract": "Citizen science includes networks of ordinary people acting as sensors, observing and recording information for science. OpenStreetMap is one such sensor network which empowers citizens to collaboratively produce a global picture from free geographic information. The success of this open source software is extended by the development of freely used open databases for the user community. Participating citizens do not require a high level of skill. Final results are processed by professionals following quality assurance protocols before map information is released. OpenStreetMap is not only the cheapest source of timely maps in many cases but also often the only source. This is particularly true in developing countries. Emergency responses to the recent earthquake in Nepal illustrates the value for rapidly updated geographical information. This includes emergency management, damage assessment, post-disaster response, and future risk mitigation. Local disaster conditions (landslides, road closings, bridge failures, etc.) were documented for local aid workers by citizen scientists working remotely. Satellites and drones provide digital imagery of the disaster zone and OpenStreetMap participants shared the data from locations around the globe. For the Nepal earthquake, OpenStreetMap provided a team of volunteers on the ground through their Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) which contribute data to the disaster response through smartphones and laptops. This, combined with global citizen science efforts, provided immediate geographically useful maps to assist aid workers, including the Red Cross and Canadian DART Team, and the Nepalese government. As of August 2014, almost 1.7 million users provided over 2.5 billion edits to the OpenStreetMap map database. Due to the increased usage of smartphones, GPS-enabled devices, and the growing participation in citizen science projects, data gathering is proving an effective way to contribute as a global citizen. This paper aims to describe the significance of citizen participation in the case of the Nepal earthquake using OpenStreetMap to respond to disasters as well as its role in future risk mitigation.",

            "abstract": "Particle-based numerical simulations of cohesive contractional wedges are used to explore the controls of decollement strength and roughness on deformation and mechanical evolution of the upper plate at convergent margins. Particle assemblages, consolidated under gravity and bonded to impart cohesion, are displaced above a weak decollement. Forward propagation of decollement slip occurs in discrete pulses, modulated by heterogeneous stress conditions along the fault. Over time, slip along the basal decollement induces upper plate contraction. When upper plate stresses reach critical strength conditions, new thrust faults break through the upper plate, relieving stresses and accommodating horizontal shortening. Decollement activity retreats back to the newly formed thrust fault. The cessation of upper plate fault slip causes gradual increases in upper plate stresses, rebuilding shear stresses along the base and enabling renewed pulses of decollement slip. Thus, upper plate deformation occurs out of phase with decollement propagation. Decollement roughness, e.g., due to the presence of a seamount, can have profound effects on the evolution of the margin, for example, inducing locally intense deformation near the base of the wedge and delaying forward propagation of the deformation front. As different parts of the wedge are affected by the impinging roughness, both thrust faults and normal faults may form, overprinting each other in time and space and leading to complicated structural geometries. The mechanical evolution monitored throughout the simulation yields local stress paths, which are shown to correlate directly with the final upper plate deformation. Numerically-obtained predictions of the stress and strain histories within deforming upper plates may help to explain the origins of distinctive structures and domains along natural convergent margins.",

            "abstract": "Precise estimates of sea level change from tide gauges require precise knowledge of the vertical land motion at the tide gauges, as these signals can be comparable in magnitude. This is also true for estimates from satellite altimeters because the tide gauge data are needed to assess the temporal stability of the altimetric heights. The presentation will begin with a very brief review of early efforts to apply GNSS data to this problem. We will then present the current status of efforts (with some emphasis on the TIGA program) aimed at monitoring vertical motions at the global GLOSS sea level network and at the set of gauges that are deemed most useful for estimating the stability of satellite altimeters. This summary will document a tremendous amount of progress over the past decade or so, and continued progress seems likely. There are, however, two current challenges that we argue need to be addressed. First, completing the global network means expanding the network into much more challenging parts of the world. The GLOSS program has long experience with this problem while trying to complete the tide gauge network, and that experience should be very useful to the groups attempting to complete the GNSS network. Second, we will present an analysis based on the calculations used to estimate satellite altimeter stability that indicates that the uncertainties in the reference frame used for the GNSS data are possibly the dominant error when attempting to measure global sea level change. The scale rate error is of primary concern, with the error in the z-rate being a minor, but not insignificant, contributor. We will make this point via a set of simulations using varying levels of the scale rate and z-rate uncertainties; i.e., by doing a sensitivity analysis.",

            "abstract": "The continental lithosphere beneath the Central Anatolian Volcanic Province has experienced a complex tectonic history with periods of convergence during closure of the Tethys Ocean followed by post-Miocene extension. The current environment reflects WSW movement of Anatolia in response to collision between the Afro-Arabian and Eurasian plates. Modern extensional basins bounded by oblique-slip faults provide the setting for mafic volcanism along the CAFZ and offer a window into the regional asthenosphere. We focus on Hasandag stratovolcano whose 13 Ma history includes three stages of edifice construction across which the erupted magmas have progressed from tholeiitic to calc-alkaline (Aydar and Gourgaud, 1998); the most recent lavas are of mildly alkaline affinity. Late Miocene to Quaternary Hasandag lavas have been interpreted as arc volcanism related to the Afro-Arabian and Eurasian collision, presenting a challenge as the calc-alkaline volcanism occurred within the modern extensional environment. Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic and major and trace element data on Hasandag alkaline basalts through dacites show that contributions from lithosphere previously enriched by subduction events have become less pronounced through time. Sr-Nd isotopic data indicate this temporal evolution, with older Hasandag lavas having higher values (~0.7050) than younger products (0.7041-0.7046) (Deniel et al. 1998, Alici Sen et al. 2004, this study). Geochemical data also reveal spatial differences along the Central Anatolian Volcanic Zone, e.g., 206Pb/204Pb and 143Nd/144Nd isotopic signatures vary consistently with latitude. The pronounced enrichment (Ba, Th, U) and depletion (Nb, Zr, Ta and Ti) patterns observed in primitive-mantle normalized element abundances at Hasandag are more prominent in southwestern volcanic complexes and less evident within northern centers. For example, Ba/Nb ratios increase from north to south along the CAFZ whereas Ba/Th ratios decrease. These data imply an overall increase in contribution from subduction-related materials from north to south along the CAFZ in post-Pliocene lavas. Evidence from Hasandag suggests that the signature may also decrease over time; perhaps as highly fusible metasomatized materials are exhausted during progressive melting.",

Therefore, evaluation of model performances with respect to AOD is a critical step to improve the model simulations and, thus, reduce the diversities.\nIn this study, multi-year AOD data (2004-2012) from ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite retrievals are used to evaluate the performance of a global model, GEOS-Chem-APM, one of global models involved in AeroCom phase II aerosol module inter-comparison project. Comparisons of the modeled AOD with satellite data on spatial distribution, seasonal and inter-annual variations are quantitatively analyzed. In addition, several regions representative of various aerosol dominant species are chose for the detailed evaluations of AOD between the simulation and AERONET observations. The capability and weakness of the model to capture seasonal variation and chemical species is also discussed for further improvement in the future.",

However, determining the partitioning within and transfer between different carbon stores is a major challenge, particularly where there are multiple sources and controls on carbon utilisation. Dissolved oxygen, DO, provides a proxy for investigating the dynamics of carbon utilisation in aquatic systems. High temporal resolution monitoring of DO at multiple site on the Hampshire Avon, a chalk dominated permeable catchment in southern England, UK, has been investigated using a dynamic DO model in order to investigate the biochemical cycling of carbon. Gross primary production, governed by photosynthetically active radiation, is determined through inverse modelling. Model simplification though parameter reduction is achieved through investigating controls on aeration (the transfer of oxygen across the atmosphere-river interface) and respiration. Seasonal changes in biomass affect long term oxygen dynamics, which are compounded by episodic hydrological events that control the partitioning of surface water and groundwater in the stream channel and consequently the sources of carbon and DO in the river channel. Using variations in surface geology across the catchment the impacts of varying baseflow characteristics on carbon cycling within the catchment is demonstrated.",

The CubeSat platform is used in combination with incoherent scatter radar and optical ground stations distributed throughout the Americas. ExoCube seeks to obtain the first in situ measurement of neutral exospheric hydrogen and will measure in situ atomic oxygen for the first time in decades. The compact Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) developed by GSFC uses the gated Time of Flight technique for in situ measurements of ions and neutrals (H, He, N, O, N2, O2) with M/dM of approximately 10. The compact sensor has a dual symmetric configuration with ion and neutral sensor heads. Neutral particles are ionized by electron impact using a thermionic emitter. In situ measurements of neutral hydrogen are notoriously difficult as historically the signal has been contaminated by hydrogen outgassing which persists even years after commissioning. In order to obtain neutral atmospheric hydrogen fluxes, either the atmospheric peak and outgassing peak must be well resolved, or the outgassing component subtracted off. The ExoCube INMS employs a separate mode, specifically for measuring neutral Hydrogen. The details of this mode and lessons learned will be presented as well as in flight instrument validation data for the neutral channel and preliminary flight ion spectra. At the time of abstract submission, the ExoCube spacecraft is currently undergoing attitude control maneuvers to orient INMS in the ram direction for science operations.",

            "abstract": "We present a 3D numerical MHD simulation of the 2008 Jun 2 gradual streamer blowout CME that had virtually no identifiable low coronal signatures. We energize the field by simple footpoint shearing along the source region’s polarity inversion line and model the background solar wind structure using an ~2MK isothermal wind and a low-order potential field source surface representation of the CR2070 synoptic magnetogram. Our results show that the CME “initiation” is obtained by slowly disrupting the quasi-steady-state configuration of the helmet streamer, resulting in the standard eruptive flare picture that ejects the sheared/twisted fields -- very slowly and on a relatively large scale -- with virtually no decrease in the global magnetic energy. We obtain a relatively slow CME eruption of order the background solar wind speed (Vcme ~ 300 km/s by 15 Rs). We argue that these very slow, expansion-driven “eruptions” are merely the natural and gradual response of the large-scale corona to the accumulation of global-scale stress (e.g. differential rotation). We present comparisons of the CME propagation through the corona (≤15Rs) in synthetic white-light images derived from the simulation density structure with multi-spacecraft coronagraph data from STEREO/SECCHI and SOHO/LASCO. We show a favorable comparison between the simulation’s ICME flux rope structure with the in situ STEREO observations.",

            "abstract": "Short-lived, anthropogenically produced chlorinated gases historically have not been controlled by the Montreal Protocol; their contribution to stratospheric halogen loading has been relatively small and constant. Since 2000, however, tropospheric mole fractions of dichloromethane (mean lifetime of 5 months) have increased by a factor of 2 at remote sites throughout the globe. Dichloromethane currently adds more chlorine to the atmosphere (~80 ppt) than either HCFC-141b or HCFC-142b, and the implied resulting increase in stratospheric chlorine in recent years is comparable to the increase in total Cl from HCFCs. Emissions driving this global increase have been estimated at 800 Gg/yr in 2012, which is more than half of the chlorine emitted from the three main CFCs during their peak emissions in the late 1980s. Although dichloromethane is used typically as a cleaning agent, solvent, and feedstock in the production of other chemicals, the cause of the recent atmospheric increase is not well understood. Here we will show that the substantial increase in emissions does not appear to be coming from the U.S., as our ongoing observations from tall towers and aircraft profiles over North America since 2005 show a decreasing trend in measured mole fractions in the continental boundary layer relative to the background atmosphere during this period. Instead, our data from remote sites across the Northern Hemisphere reveal a shift in the atmospheric distribution of dichloromethane since 2000 that implies increased emissions from lower latitudes in the northern hemisphere. These changing distributions will be presented and discussed, along with an exploration of the potential causes for the large inter-annual variations observed in the rate of increase and what the results suggest about the main loss mechanism for dichloromethane: oxidation by the hydroxyl radical.",

            "abstract": "Urine patches from grazing ruminant animals are a significant source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and irrigation is increasingly used to improve forage quality and yield for grazing cattle. The objective of this study was to test whether irrigation frequency influenced N2O emissions from urine patches on a free-draining grazed pasture soil. It was hypothesized that greater irrigation frequency would increase soil moisture thereby lowering soil oxygen (O2), and that these O2-limited conditions would increase the potential for N2O to be reduced to nitrogen gas (N2), resulting in lower N2O emissions. A field trial tested the effects of two irrigation frequencies and urine deposition on N2O fluxes measured daily for 35 days. Denitrification potential measurements using the acetylene inhibition technique were completed to infer N2O/(N2O+N2) ratios, and soil O2 concentrations were measured continuously at three depths within the soil profile. While a more frequent irrigation treatment resulted in a lower N2O/(N2O+N2) ratio, this did not give rise to lower N2O emissions. Nitrous oxide fluxes were not influenced by irrigation frequency, and approximately 0.09% of the nitrogen applied as urine was emitted as N2O from both irrigation treatments. Neither N2O nor soil O2 varied with individual irrigation events. Soil O2 ranged from 17 to 20% expect following urine deposition, where it temporarily decreased to 13%. Soil O2 measurements failed to explain N2O emissions, but a relationship was derived between N2O fluxes and estimates of soil gas diffusivity (Dp/Do). This work is the first to show how soil O2 concentrations vary under a urine patch and under different irrigation treatments, and supports Dp/Do as robust predictor of N2O emissions in situ.",

            "abstract": "Natural gas production from multiple shale formations has increased significantly in the last decade. More particularly, a growing number of unconventional wells is the result of intense drilling in the Marcellus shale area. The Marcellus shale production represents a third of the production of natural gas in the entire US. This unprecedented increase could lead to additional fugitive methane (CH4) emissions at a level that remains highly uncertain. If natural gas is to replace less energy-efficient fossil fuels, the emissions during the production phase ought to be relatively small. However, the magnitude and the spatial distribution of CH4 emissions from unconventional wells in the Marcellus shale remains poorly documented.\nThe novelty of this research consists in coupling various sources of information to map accurately the methane emissions, combining Geographical Information System (GIS) data, atmospheric measurements of greenhouse gases, and atmospheric modeling tools. We first collected various GIS data to estimate CH4 emissions caused by the shale gas industry, such as wells, facilities, and pipelines, with the other major contributors such as wetlands, farming activities, and soils. We present our projection methods to generate model input in gridded format while preserving the distribution and magnitude of the emissions and assembling a diverse database.\nThe projection tools for GIS data are generalized to the use of GIS data in atmospheric modeling systems. We then present the atmospheric concentrations simulated by the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, used to represent the transport and the dispersion of CH4 emissions. We compare the WRF model results to aircraft measurements collected during a 3-week campaign to identify missing sources in our initial inventory. We finally propose a new approach to identify the area at the surface that could potentially influence the aircraft measurements using spatial analysis of particle footprints. This technique aims at identifying undocumented sources and unreported large emitters to quantify more rigorously the emissions of CH4 over the Marcellus shale.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Wilson_ATrain_Fusion_in_Cloud_poster_AGU2015.pdf\nNASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) is an ambitious facility for studying global climate change. The mandate now is to combine measurements from the instruments on the “A-Train” platforms (AIRS, MODIS, MLS, and CloudSat) and other Earth probes to enable large-scale studies of climate change over decades. Moving to multi-sensor, long-duration presents serious challenges for large-scale data mining and fusion. For example, one might want to compare temperature and water vapor retrievals from one instrument (AIRS) to another (MODIS), and to a model (ECMWF), stratify the comparisons using a classification of the “cloud scenes” from CloudSat, and repeat the entire analysis over 10 years of data.\nHySDS is a Hybrid-Cloud Science Data System that has been developed and applied under NASA AIST, MEaSUREs, and ACCESS grants. HySDS uses the SciFlow workflow engine to partition analysis workflows into parallel tasks (e.g. segmenting by time or space) that are pushed into a durable job queue. The tasks are “pulled” from the queue by worker Virtual Machines (VM’s) and executed in an on-premise Cloud (Eucalyptus or OpenStack) or at Amazon in the public Cloud or govCloud. In this way, years of data (millions of files) can be processed in a massively parallel way. Input variables (arrays) are pulled on-demand into the Cloud using OPeNDAP URLs or other subsetting services, thereby minimizing the size of the transferred data.\nWe are using HySDS to automate the production of multiple versions of a ten-year A-Train water vapor climatology under a MEASURES grant. We will present the architecture of HySDS, describe the achieved “clock time” speedups in fusing datasets on our own nodes and in the Amazon Cloud, and discuss the Cloud cost tradeoffs for storage, compute, and data transfer. Our system demonstrates how one can pull A-Train variables (Levels 2 & 3) on-demand into the Amazon Cloud, and cache only those variables that are heavily used, so that any number of compute jobs can be executed “near” the multi-sensor data. Decade-long, multi-sensor studies can be performed without pre-staging data, with the researcher paying only his own Cloud compute bill.",

This is often more effective when the information is decomposed into faceted components that can be sliced and diced during faceted navigation. We apply this approach to the representation of PROV for Earth Science (PROV-ES) to facilitate more atomic units of provenance for discovery. Traditional bundles of PROV are then decomposed to enable finer-grain discovery of provenance. Linkages across provenance components can then be explored across seemingly disparate bundles. We will show how mappings into this provenance approach can be used to explore more data life-cycle relationships from observation to data to findings. We will also show examples of how this approach can be used to improve the discovery, access, and transparency of NASA datasets and the science data systems that were used to capture, manage, and produce the provenance information.",

Due to the observational nature of geoscience, researchers often take photos and video footage to document fieldwork or to record laboratory experiments. Here we present how researchers can become more effective storytellers by collaborating with filmmakers to produce short documentary films of their research. We will focus on the use of traditional high-definition (HD) camcorders and HD DSLR cameras to record the scientific story while our research topic focuses on the use of remote sensing techniques, specifically thermal infrared imaging that is often used to analyze time varying natural processes such as volcanic hazards. By capturing the story in the thermal infrared wavelength range, in addition to traditional red-green-blue (RGB) color space, the audience is able to experience the world differently. We will develop a short film specifically designed using thermal infrared cameras that illustrates how visual storytellers can use these new tools to capture unique and important aspects of their research, convey their passion for earth systems science, as well as engage and captive the viewer.",

Nonetheless, online learning brings challenges as well as a fresh opportunityfor exploring practices not present in traditional higher education programs, particularly in the sciences. We are in a unique position to empower students to make strategic academic and professional decisions in global terms. Online learning, supportedwith hands-on and minds-on activities, actively engages student with critical thinking skills and higher level learning. This presentation will showcase examples from a series of geoscience and environmental science courses currently offered fully online at SUNY Empire State College (ESC).\nTaking advantage of the proliferation of tools currently available for online learning management systems, we will explore how we approach course developent to create an interactive learning environment. Students learn through case studies, group projects and understanding real-world issues while learning concepts. Particular focus will be given to an international collaboration with the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Chihuahua Campus. This collaboration took place during the Spring of 2015 with students from the fully-online, lower-level Geology and the Environment course at ESC and the upper-level, face-to-face Mobile Programming course in Mexico.

            "abstract": "Many groundwater aquifers in important agricultural areas are exploited beyond their sustainable limits. Groundwater overuse can reduce streamflow across political boundaries, leading to transboundary management challenges. Although conflicts over transboundary water resources do arise, these conflicts can also prompt improved aquifer management. Portions of the Republican River Basin, which overlies the High Plains Aquifer in the central United States, have been under court-ordered groundwater restrictions to meet interstate streamflow requirements since 2004, following the 2002 Kansas v. Nebraska and Colorado Supreme Court case. We examined the impacts of these restrictions on groundwater levels, pumping volume, agricultural productivity, and streamflow in the Nebraska portion of the basin to assess how transboundary agreements can affect groundwater sustainability in agricultural systems. We synthesized available data for 1990-2014 to analyze trends before and after restrictions went into effect in 2004. After controlling for climate covariates, we found that restrictions reduced pumping volumes in the study area, resulting in increased streamflow across the Nebraska-Kansas border. Furthermore, restrictions appear to have reversed the declining trend in groundwater storage. Notably, this reversal contrasts with continuing decline in the unrestricted Kansas portion of the basin, suggesting the court-ordered restrictions have altered the sustainability trajectory of this region. The impacts of pumping restrictions on regional agricultural yields and productivity are examined. Our analysis of this system suggests that by setting external limits on resource use, enforceable transboundary water agreements can stimulate sustainable groundwater management and counter local incentives for overextraction.",

            "abstract": "Long-lived, persistently active lava lakes expose the top of a convecting magma column to direct observation and offer a unique window into the cryptic magmatic plumbing system at depth. In this paper, we focus on the lava lake at Mount Erebus, a large intraplate stratovolcano at Ross Island, Antarctica, to gain new insights into the multi-phase interactions between gas bubbles, crystals and magmatic liquid in basaltic volcanoes.\nEarly studies of magmatic convection have considered multi-phase magmas as perfectly homogeneous mixtures. The high proportion of erupted gas relative to magma, however, suggests that gas separates from the flow and drives eruptive activity. Similarly, the large size (up to 10cm) of the megacrysts that make up 97% of the crystal cargo at Erebus begs the question whether these crystals are likely to remain entrained and how crystal segregation in the lava lakes and conduit alters eruptive behavior.\nWe study the multiphase behavior of magmatic convection at Mount Erebus through two dimensional numerical simulations. Our model was developed with Mount Erebus in mind, but we argue that it could also serve as a virtual laboratory for studying multiphase flow in other basaltic systems. To accurately capture the deformability, breakup and coalescence of large gas bubbles, we track the gas-liquid interfaces with level-set functions. The crystal phase is incorporated using distributed Lagrange multipliers. We discretize the multiphase Stokes and energy equation through an iterative finite difference method that captures the potentially discontinuous jumps in the pressure, stresses, density and viscosity through a Ghost-Fluid approach. We have benchmarked and validated our numerical approach against analytical results and laboratory experiments.\nWe synthesize observations of thermal flux, seismic behavior, geodesy and geochemistry to deduce constraints on the mass flux, conduit dimensions, reservoir size, and crystal growth as a basis for our numerical experiments. We then compare our model results against surface observations of convective speed and eruptive bursts. We find that phase separation and the dynamic interaction between the phases play an important role in reproducing surface observations.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture - evapotranspiration interactions have been studied in several regions characterized by distinct soil properties, land cover types, and climate. Such interactions are usually assessed with measurements representing different spatial footprint. For example, soil moisture measurements obtained from point-scale sensors or with remote sensing products are typically compared with evapotranspiration measurements obtained with eddy covariance systems. With efforts to develop hydrometeorological models capable of simulating processes at hyper-resolution (i.e., 1 sq-km), novel approaches for intermediate-scale soil moisture measurements give us new opportunities to evaluate the representation of soil moisture and evapotranspiration processes at similar spatial scales. Here, we evaluate the performance of the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) in which key parameters are determined effectively based on both soil moisture and evapotranspiration measurements obtained with similar horizontal footprint. We use soil moisture data from selected sites in the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) network in combination with co-located Ameriflux eddy covariance towers to constrain key parameters in JULES assuming their similar horizontal footprint of hundreds of meters. The COSMOS-Ameriflux sites are characterized by distinct soils, land cover types, and climate. In addition, point-scale soil moisture at each site is also used in combination with eddy covariance measurements to constrain JULES parameters, while recognizing its much smaller support volume. Each individual site is ranked based on differences in soil moisture dynamics from both point-scale and intermediate-scale measurements. Model calibration is carried out by optimizing JULES performance against (1) point-scale soil moisture only, (2) cosmic-ray soil moisture only, (3) point-scale soil moisture and surface fluxes, and (4) cosmic-ray soil moisture and surface fluxes. We then evaluate how “informative” each measurement type or combination is when constraining model parameters, and consequently, its potential impact on simultaneously simulating soil moisture dynamics and energy partitioning at sub-kilometer scale.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentary roll-front uranium (U) ore deposits are the principal source of U for nuclear fuel in the USA and an important part of the current all-of-the-above energy strategy. Mining of roll-front U ore in the USA is primarily by in situ alkaline oxidative dissolution of U minerals. There are significant environmental benefits to in situ mining including no mine tailings or radioactive dust, however, the long-term immobilization of U in the aquifer after the completion of mining remains uncertain. We have utilized the metal stable isotopes U, Se and Mo in groundwater from roll-front mines in Texas and Wyoming to quantify the aquifer redox conditions and predict the onset of U reduction after post mining aquifer restoration. Supporting information from the geochemistry of groundwater and aquifer sediments are used to understand the transport of U prior to and after in situ mining.\nGroundwater was collected across 4 mining units at the Rosita mine in the Texas coastal plain and 2 mining units at the Smith Ranch mine in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming. In general, the sampled waters are moderately reducing and ore zone wells contain the highest aqueous U concentrations. The lowest U concentrations occur in monitoring wells downgradient of the ore zone. 238U/235U is lowest in downgradient wells and is correlated with aqueous U concentrations. Rayleigh distillation models of the 238U/235U are consistent with U isotope fractionation factors of 1.0004-1.001, similar to lab-based studies. Based on these results we conclude that redox reactions continue to affect U distribution in the ore zone and downgradient regions.\nWe also measured aqueous selenium isotope (δ82Se) and molybdenum isotope (δ98Mo) compositions in the Rosita groundwater. Se(VI) primarily occurs in the upgradient wells and is absent in most ore zone and downgradient wells. Rayleigh distillation models suggest reduction of Se(VI) along the groundwater flow path and when superimposed on the U isotope data Se reduction is favored over U reduction. The δ98Mo of Rosita groundwater is significantly elevated compared to the U ore and is negatively correlated with the groundwater Eh, which suggests localized strong reducing conditions capable of Mo reduction. Ongoing work will determine the Mo isotope systematics of U ores and groundwater from roll-front deposits.",

            "abstract": "Hapke’s radiative transfer theory provides a complete framework for modeling reflectance spectra of minerals and intimate mixtures of minerals, as those forming asteroidal regoliths. Deconvolving reflectance spectra of intimate mineral mixtures to determine grain size and abundance of each component mineral is crucial to study the mineralogy of asteroids. According to Hapke’s theory, reflectance can be calculated provided measurement geometry, phase function, grain size, internal scattering coefficient and the wavelength-dependent optical constants (real and imaginary parts of refraction index) are known. In practice, however, this information is barely known and/or cannot be independently obtained with sufficient accuracy. Backward modeling of mineral radiative transfer properties from reflectance spectra of single mineral assemblages can be a solution to this problem. In this work, we performed simulated annealing fits to visible/near-infrared reflectance spectra of single-mineral assemblages of varying nominal grain sizes to retrieve optical constants, phase function, internal scattering coefficient and grain size. Our results show that considering a grain size distribution has a major impact in improving fit quality. Other factors affecting fit results will also be identified and discussed.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 4-Methylcyclohexanemethanol (MCHM) spill in the Elk River of West Virginia highlighted existing gaps in emergency planning for, and response to, large-scale chemical releases in the United States. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires that facilities with hazardous substances provide Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs), which contain health and safety information on the hazardous substances. The MSDS produced by Eastman Chemical Company, the manufacturer of MCHM, listed “no data available” for various human toxicity subcategories, such as reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity. As a result of incomplete toxicity data, the public and media received conflicting messages on the safety of the contaminated water from government officials, industry, and the public health community. Two days after the governor lifted the ban on water use, the health department partially retracted the ban by warning pregnant women to continue avoiding the contaminated water, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deemed safe three weeks later. The response in West Virginia represents a failure in risk communication and calls to question if government officials have sufficient information to support evidence-based decisions during future incidents. Research capabilities, like the National Science Foundation RAPID funding, can provide a solution to some of the data gaps, such as information on environmental fate in the case of the MCHM spill. In order to inform policy discussions on this issue, a methodology for assessing the outcomes of RAPID and similar National Institutes of Health grants in the context of emergency response is employed to examine the efficacy of research-based capabilities in enhancing public health decision making capacity. The results of this assessment highlight potential roles rapid scientific research can fill in ensuring adequate health and safety data is readily available for decision makers during large-scale chemical releases.",

            "abstract": "During the 2014 FRAPPE/DISCOVER-AQ sampling campaigns a network of next-generation, low-cost air quality monitors were placed throughout the Colorado Front Range area. The network covered areas ranging from high saturation of oil and gas development to no development. We are leveraging the monitors’ multiple ‘off-the-shelf’ sensors to collect and analyze continuous data on volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The monitors were developed at the University of Colorado Boulder and include different VOC sensor models, as well as sensors for other gas-phase pollutants (e.g., carbon dioxide and ozone). Using high-quality methane and non-methane hydrocarbon data collected by the Penn State Native Trailer research team and Armin Wisthaler’s research team (University of Oslo) as a reference we can calibrate data for one of our monitors. Additionally, through the use of various quantification models we can characterize sensor responses to specific VOCs and groups of VOCs. The primary monitor was located at the Native Trailer in Platteville throughout the study. By using this monitor for secondary field normalization, we can apply our quantification methods to the remaining monitors in the network. The sensor network data provides greater spatial resolution than would be possible with fewer, more expensive instruments. In addition to discussing the quantification of low-cost sensors, we will examine how the spatial and temporal variability of hydrocarbon concentrations throughout the area relates to sources, specifically oil and gas development and its impacts on air quality. Although more research is needed, low-cost sensor arrays have the potential to support reference-quality measurements and expand our capacity in future oil and gas related research.",

            "abstract": "In this study, one year of ground-based observations of aerosol optical properties from a site impacted by urban emissions in Central Amazon of Brazil are assessed as part of results from GoAmazon2014/5 experiment. The aerosol absorption (σa) and scattering (σs) coefficients, as well as single scattering albedo (SSA) are analyzed to aid in characterizing Manaus' urban aerosol at GoAmazon T2 site. There is a distinct diurnal variation for (σa) it was mainly attributed to the severe emission of particulate pollutants and black carbon during the morning and evening traffic rush hours. The decrease of (σa) nearly at noon (12:00-14:00 LT) was a result of strong atmospheric mixing and dilution due to the elevated height of atmospheric planetary boundary layer (PBL). After sunset (18:00 LT), the formation of stable nocturnal PBL even in atmospheric inversion led to a low atmospheric diffusion ability to aerosols and thus relatively high (σa) and (σs) throughout the night. Indeed, it was observed a strong dependence on local wind confirmed by simulated back trajectories in all two seasons. Overall, the wind dependence results provide valuable information about the locations of aerosol pollution sources and suggest that the air pollution in dry season is a regional problem but in the wet season it is mainly affected by local urban emissions. We have also seen an interesting difference in variability of (σs) and (σa) during 8:00-13:00 LT in wet season. A clear decrease was observed for (σa), while a smooth increase during 11:00–13:00 LT was presented for (σs). This is possibly a consequence of secondary aerosol production. (σa) is controlled to a large degree by primary aerosols such as black carbon that are emitted directly from pollution sources like vehicles, while (σs) is related to secondary aerosols such as sulfate and nitrate that contribute the most to light scattering. SSA was relatively low around 7:00-08:00 LT, which reflected that (σa) increased more than (σs) during traffic rush hours. The peak at noon (around 13:00 LT) could be explained by a large number of secondary aerosols born out of photochemistry.The results shown that while (σa) decreased during 8:00–12:00 LT, SSA increased, indicating that light absorbing aerosols like BC diluted at a greater speed than scattering-related particles.",

            "abstract": "The geoid has been well explained in mantle flow models with the buoyancy inferred from seismic models that in turn place constraints on mantle viscosity structure (e.g., Hager & Richards, 1989). These models often assume a whole-mantle convection with uniform composition and 1-D viscosity. However, seismic and geochemical observations suggest possible existence of chemically distinct piles under Africa and Pacific which extends hundreds of kilometers above the CMB (i.e., LLSVPs). As compositional heterogeneity would significantly alter the interpretation of seismic anomalies as buoyancy structure, important questions are whether a thermochemical mantle model based on seismic velocity anomalies can reconcile the geoid and how this may impact inference of mantle viscosity structure.\nIn this study, we formulate mantle flow models that use buoyancy derived from seismic model S40RTS (Ritsema et al., 2011), assuming that the LLSVPs are stable with negative buoyancy. The models use temperature-, depth- and composition-dependent viscosity and are computed for the geoid, dynamic topography and flow velocity using CitcomS. Seismic anomalies are converted to buoyancy using thermal conversion factor cT for the whole mantle materials and composition conversion factor cc for the chemical piles defined as the domains with seismic slow anomaly <-0.5% and a maximum height of 500 km. The temperature-dependence viscosity gives rise to 3 orders of magnitude variations in viscosity, and horizontally averaged viscosity profile is consistent with the inferred 1-D viscosity from the geoid. The viscosity in the chemical piles is further reduced by a factor of Cvisc to represent the compositional effect. We measure the stability of the chemical piles by the RMS vertical velocities on the piles boundary. Our preferred thermochemical models with stable chemical piles reach similar variance reduction of geoid at ~64% to that for the uniform composition models. In the preferred model, cT is ~0.25 which is similar to that inverted from whole mantle models, cC is about -0.7, and Cvisc=30. Compared with models with 1-D viscosity profile, the temperature- and composition-dependence of viscosity plays a key role in enhancing the stability of chemical piles and fits to the observed geoid and surface and CMB dynamic topography.",

            "abstract": "The selective perturbation of complex microbial ecosystems to predictably influence outcomes in engineered and industrial environments remains a grand challenge for geomicrobiology. In some industrial ecosystems, such as oil reservoirs, sulfate reducing microorganisms (SRM) produce hydrogen sulfide which is toxic, explosive and corrosive. Current strategies to selectively inhibit sulfidogenesis are based on non-specific biocide treatments, bio-competitive exclusion by alternative electron acceptors or sulfate-analogs which are competitive inhibitors or futile/alternative substrates of the sulfate reduction pathway. Despite the economic cost of sulfidogenesis, there has been minimal exploration of the chemical space of possible inhibitory compounds, and very little work has quantitatively assessed the selectivity of putative souring treatments. We have developed a high-throughput screening strategy to target SRM, quantitatively ranked the selectivity and potency of hundreds of compounds and identified previously unrecognized SRM selective inhibitors and synergistic interactions between inhibitors. Once inhibitor selectivity is defined, high-throughput characterization of microbial community structure across compound gradients and identification of fitness determinants using isolate bar-coded transposon mutant libraries can give insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby compounds structure microbial communities. The high-throughput (HT) approach we present can be readily applied to target SRM in diverse environments and more broadly, could be used to identify and quantify the potency and selectivity of inhibitors of a variety of microbial metabolisms. Our findings and approach are relevant for engineering environmental ecosystems and also to understand the role of natural gradients in shaping microbial niche space.",

Student participation in UR contributes to measurable gains in content knowledge and skills/methodology, oral and written communication skills, problem solving and critical thinking, self-confidence, autonomy, among others. First-generation college students and students from underrepresented minorities that participate in UR are more likely to remain in STEM majors, persist to graduation, and pursue graduate degrees. While engagement in the research process contributes to these outcomes, the impact of the interaction with the faculty mentor is critical. A number of studies provide evidence that it is the relationship that forms with the faculty mentor that is most valued by students and strongly contributes to their career development. Faculty mentors play an important role in student development and the relationship between mentor and student evolves from teacher to coach to colleague. Effective mentoring is not an inherent skill and is generally not taught in graduate school and generally differs from mentoring of graduate students. Each UR mentoring relationship is unique and there are many effective mentoring models and practices documented in the literature. The Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) has a long history of supporting faculty who engage in research with undergraduates and offers resources for establishing UR programs at individual, departmental, and institutional levels. The Geosciences Division of CUR leads faculty development workshops at professional meetings and provides extensive resources to support geosciences faculty as UR mentors (\nhttp://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/undergraduate_research/index.html\n).

            "abstract": "Lidar has become an established tool for estimating forest structure attributes from observations of forest canopy height and variability. These attributes include ones relevant to fire behavior and effects, but due to the sparse availability of lidar data, it is unlikely to be available to document pre-fire conditions. In contrast, aerial photography is regularly collected in many countries and advances in stereo image matching have improved the accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds. As part of a study of the physical and ecological impacts of the 2012 High Park Fire, we generated a photogrammetric point cloud from pre-fire aerial imagery collected in 2008 and combined it with a digital terrain model generated from a 2013 post-fire lidar collection. We then generated a suite of canopy height and density indices from the pre-fire photogrammetry and post-fire lidar point clouds and compared them to each other and to forest structure attributes measured in the field immediately post-fire.\nFor unburned areas, indices from the photogrammetric point cloud tended to be higher for height percentiles, lower for height variability, and higher for canopy density when compared to the corresponding lidar indices. However, in regression analyses combining canopy height and density indices derived from photo and lidar sources, a single equation could estimate field measured forest structure attributes without significant bias from the source of the indices. Models of attributes such as aboveground biomass on unburned plots had similar root mean square errors for lidar (27.5%), photogrammetry (28.2%), and both data sources (RMSE = 29.4% and source bias = -0.69). Similar results were obtained for Lorey’s height, basal area, and canopy bulk density. In the context of wildfire, pre-fire forest structure information could aid assessments of contributing factors such as canopy fuels and fire effects such as loss of biomass. The wide spatial and temporal coverage of aerial photos and growing coverage of lidar could enable many other applications of lidar-photogrammetry fusion, including assessments of changes in forest carbon storage.",

            "abstract": "The southwestern U.S. is predicted to experience increasing temperatures and longer periods of inter-storm drought. High temperature and water deficit restrict plant productivity and ecosystem functioning, but the influence of future climate is predicted to be highly heterogeneous because of the complex terrain characteristic of much of the Critical Zone (CZ). Within our Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) in the Southwestern US, we monitor ecosystem-scale carbon and water fluxes using eddy covariance. This whole-ecosystem metric is a powerful integrating measure of ecosystem function over time, but details on spatial heterogeneity resulting from topographic features of the landscape are not captured, nor are interactions among below- and aboveground processes. We supplement eddy covariance monitoring with distributed measures of carbon flux from soil and vegetation across different aspects to quantify the causes and consequences of spatial heterogeneity through time.\nGiven that (i) aspect influences how incoming energy drives evaporative water loss and (ii) seasonality drives temporal patterns of soil moisture recharge, we were able to examine the influence of these processes on CO2 efflux by investigating variation across aspect. We found that aspect was a significant source of spatial heterogeneity in soil CO2 efflux, but the influence varied across seasonal periods. Snow on South-facing aspects melted earlier and yielded higher efflux rates in the spring. However, during summer, North- and South-facing aspects had similar amounts of soil moisture, but soil temperatures were warmer on the North-facing aspect, yielding greater rates of CO2 efflux. Interestingly, aspect did not influence photosynthetic rates. Taken together, we found that physical features of the landscape yielded predictable patterns of levels and phenologies of soil moisture and temperature, but these drivers differentially influenced below- and aboveground sources of carbon exchange. Conducting these spatially distributed measurements are time consuming. Looking forward, we have begun using unmanned aerial vehicles outfitted with thermal and multi-spectral cameras to quantify patterns of water flux, NDVI, needle browning due to moisture stress, and overall phenology in the CZ.",

We can identify field line resonances using cross-phase spectra and power spectral densities, and the equatorial mass density distribution can be extracted from the frequency assuming an axisymmetric and power law distribution along dipolar field lines. Here we report the use of arrays of virtual ground-based magnetometers in two simulations ran in the SWMF global magnetospheric model to remotely sense equatorial mass density. First we confirm that SWMF reproduces a multi-harmonic distribution of FLRs in the dayside magnetospheric cavity, and then we determine the time-dependent resonant frequency from an analysis of the short-time power spectral density and cross-phase spectra of the magnetic vector fields from meridianal chains of virtual ground-based magnetometers. We show that this technique can accurately measure the spatiotemporal evolution of mass density within the simulations by comparing the FLR inferred densities with the in situ data. This is the first such attempt at using virtual ground-based magnetometers in a self-consistent, three-dimensional, coupled global magnetospheric and ionospheric model to remote sense the equatorial mass density.",

            "abstract": "Sediment-associated natural organic matter (NOM) is an extremely complex assemblage of organic molecules with a wide range of sizes, functional groups, and structures, which is intricately associated with mineral particles. The chemical nature of NOM may control its’ reactivity towards metals, minerals, enzymes, and bacteria. Organic carbon concentrations in subsurface sediments are typically much lower than in surface soils, posing a distinct challenge for characterization. In this study, we investigated NOM associated with shallow alluvial aquifer sediments in a floodplain of the Colorado River. Total organic carbon (TOC) contents in these subsurface sediments are typically around 0.1%, but can range from 0.03% up to approximately 1.5%. Even at the typical TOC values of 0.1%, the mass of sediment-associated OC is approximately 5000 times higher than the mass of dissolved OC, representing a large pool of carbon that may potentially be mobilized or degraded under changing environmental conditions. Sediment-associated OC is much older than both the depositional age of the alluvial sediments and dissolved OC in the groundwater, indicating that the vast majority of NOM was sequestered by the sediment long before it was deposited in the floodplain.\nWe have characterized the sediment-bound NOM from two locations within the floodplain with differing physical and geochemical properties. One location has relatively low organic carbon (<0.2%) and is considered suboxic [dissolved oxygen is low or absent, but no dissolved Fe(II) observed], while the other is a naturally reducing zone with higher organic carbon (0.2-1.5%) and Fe(II)-reducing conditions. An extraction scheme was developed using a combination of sequential extraction [water and sodium pyrophosphate (pH 10)] and purification in order to isolate different fractions of sediment-associated NOM. Analysis of these different NOM fractions was then carried out by FTIR and ESI-FTICR-MS to allow for comparison of NOM structure and composition both across sites and across fractions for a single location. Using this combination of analytical techniques we can probe the variation in NOM chemical composition and mineral association across different biogeochemical regimes and assess the potential reactivity of various NOM pools.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing and stimulation of fracture networks are widely used by the energy industry (e.g., shale gas extraction, enhanced geothermal systems) to increase permeability of geological formations. Numerous analytical and numerical models have been developed to help understand and predict the behavior of hydraulically induced fractures. However, many existing models assume simple fracturing scenarios with highly idealized fracture geometries (e.g., propagation of a single fracture with assumed shapes in a homogeneous medium). Modeling hydraulic fracture propagation in the presence of natural fractures and homogeneities can be very challenging because of the complex interactions between fluid, rock matrix, and rock interfaces, as well as the interactions between propagating fractures and pre-existing natural fractures. In this study, the TOUGH-RBSN code for coupled hydro-mechanical modeling is utilized to simulate hydraulic fracture propagation and its interaction with pre-existing fracture networks. The simulation tool combines TOUGH2, a simulator of subsurface multiphase flow and mass transport based on the finite volume approach, with the implementation of a lattice modeling approach for geomechanical and fracture-damage behavior, named Rigid-Body-Spring Network (RBSN). The discrete fracture network (DFN) approach is facilitated in the Voronoi discretization via a fully automated modeling procedure. The numerical program is verified through a simple simulation for single fracture propagation, in which the resulting fracture geometry is compared to an analytical solution for given fracture length and aperture. Subsequently, predictive simulations are conducted for planned laboratory experiments using rock-analogue (soda-lime glass) samples containing a designed, pre-existing fracture network. The results of a preliminary simulation demonstrate selective fracturing and fluid infiltration along the pre-existing fractures, with additional fracturing in part within the intact matrix. Qualitative comparison with the visualization of hydraulic fractures in the experiments will be made for validation of the numerical model.",

The role of these features is increasingly being integrated into hydrological simulation models, such as the USGS Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) and the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and applied to landscapes where wetlands are dominating features. Because the extent of these features varies widely through time, many modeling applications rely on delineations of the maximum possible extent to define total capacity of a model’s spatial response unit. This poster presents an evaluation of several wetland map delineations for the Pipestem River basin in the North Dakota Prairie-pothole region. The featured data sets include the US Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), surface water bodies extracted from the US Geological Survey National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), and elevation depressions extracted from 1 meter LiDAR data for the area. In addition to characterizing differences in the quality of these datasets, the poster will assess the impact of these differences when parameters are derived from them for the spatial response units of the PRMS model.",

As it passes offshore, the Alpine Fault becomes segmented, with the formation of several rapidly deforming pull-apart basins. Here we focus on the detailed quantification of the 3 northern-most basins, all located <8 km from the Fiordland coastline. High-resolution 30 kHz multibeam bathymetric data and 30 sediment cores are used to determine Late Holocene (<2 ka) sedimentary delivery pathways and processes. A quantitative geomorphic analysis of each basin using ESRI ArcMap version 10.2 and associated spatial analyst tools, reveal huge complexity along the Fiordland continental margin. The margin is shaped largely by Late Pleistocene glacio-marine sedimentary processes, ongoing tectonic deformation, and localized enhanced deposition of Late Holocene gravity flows in nearshore pull-apart basins. Excellent core coverage over the study area allow us to interpret gravity flow types and behaviours. We use these interpretations along with basin geomorphological boundary conditions to model turbidity current flow behaviours.",

A great deal of attention has recently focused on the so-called \"hiatus\" period of the past ~15 years, when estimates of recent surface temperature evolution fall at the lower end of climate model projections. This work quantifies a systematic bias in model-observation comparisons arising from differential warming rates between sea surface temperatures and surface air temperatures over oceans. Global mean temperatures from climate model simulations are typically calculated using surface air temperatures, while the corresponding observations are based on a blend of air and sea surface temperatures. A further bias arises from the treatment of temperatures in regions where the sea ice boundary has changed. We discuss the magnitude of these biases, and their implications for the evaluation of climate model performance over the \"hiatus\" period and the full instrumental record.",

It is unrealistic to expect starting undergraduate students to define transformative research projects. However, with the proper training and guidance student-driven transformative research is possible for upper division students. We have instituted a student research paradigm with focus on the development of student research skills in coordination with their course progress.\nWe present here a specific student project that engage students in aeronomy research activities and provide them with a solid base to establish their own research projects for senior year.\nThe core of the project is an imaging spectrograph, which is constructed, tested, and calibrated by the students.

            "abstract": "Catastrophic wildfires have increased worldwide due in part to previous fire suppression efforts, but also climate change. These wildfires dramatically alter ecosystem structure resulting in lasting changes to hydrological characteristics including surface runoff and subsurface water storage. Most notably fire results in the removal of forest ground cover as well as much, if not all, of the forest vegetation that is responsible for precipitation interception and transpiration from the soil. The presence of ground cover is associated with high porosity, surface roughness and infiltration rates, which can contribute to greater soil water recharge. Modeling the hydrological changes due to fire requires representation of the vegetation changes along with near surface soil characteristics, particularly ground cover. Moreover, the coupled nature of surface and subsurface flow necessitates an integrated representation of variably saturated subsurface flow and overland flow to capture infiltration-limited runoff. Here pre- and post-catastrophic fire data collected from Bandelier National Monument is used to characterize ground cover and vegetation conditions used in coupled surface subsurface hydrologic models. This data is also used to develop appropriate representations of litter layers in the models. Changes in hydrologic regimes at the hillslope and catchment scale are simulated in response to measured precipitation events. Differences in both runoff generation and soil water storage are then described along a continuum of burn severity.",

            "abstract": "Circulation in the marine stratocumulus-topped boundary layer, and vertical transport of moisture between the ocean surface and the inversion are primarily driven by buoyant production of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE). Buoyant production of TKE arises from cloud top longwave cooling, latent heat release in cloud updrafts, latent heat uptake in cloud downdrafts, and from the surface heat flux. TKE is, however, also produced by shear in the interaction of geostrophic wind with the ocean surface. The associated shear-driven circulation interferes with buoyancy-driven circulation in the sub-cloud layer, and thereby changes the efficiency of vertical moisture transport between the surface and cloud base. An inefficient vertical moisture transport in the sub-cloud layer manifests itself in boundary layer decoupling. We have conducted cloud-system resolving simulations of non-drizzling marine stratocumulus clouds to investigate the effect of shear due to geostrophic wind on decoupling. We find that shear-driven dynamics due to geostrophic wind modulates boundary layer decoupling in two ways: At nighttime, and at low wind speed during daytime, shear-driven circulation in the sub-cloud layer hampers vertical moisture transport in the sub-cloud layer and thereby increases decoupling. In contrast, during daytime, at high wind speed, and at strong decoupling, shear-driven circulation takes over from buoyancy-driven circulation in transporting moisture between the surface and cloud base, and thereby reduces decoupling and assists in maintaining cloud liquid water path.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s human population has risen over the last century from less than 2 billion to over 7 billion people. The current “Anthropocene Era” has brought changes in Earth’s landforms, climate, biodiversity, atmosphere, and hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles, as well as the expansion and intensification of human land use. As the emerging nexus of the physical, biological, and social sciences, measurements of Earth’s natural and anthropogenic land cover are needed to understand and manage the coupled dynamics of human and natural systems. In recent years, NASA-sponsored efforts have produced global, time-serial estimates of tree cover using the MOderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the world’s first global, Landsat-based datasets representing tree and forest cover change from 1990 to 2010. These data are fueling global and national estimates of the rate and acceleration of deforestation as well as international commitments to conserve forest ecosystems. Likewise, Landsat-based datasets documenting Earth’s inland surface waters are enabling the world’s first global, high-resolution estimates of water cover based on repeatable satellite measurements. Meanwhile, long-term, time-serial estimates of impervious surface cover are being used to model the effect of urbanization on storm-water runoff, watershed health, and stream biodiversity. MODIS-based records of plant phenology are depicting the vulnerability and resilience of ecosystems to drought and are informing land managers of the sensitivity of wildlife to climate and plant phenology. Natural ecosystems are complex and potentially chaotic even in the absence of anthropogenic influence, and so understanding these interactions between physical, biological, and social systems is increasingly crucial under escalating human impacts. Globally consistent, locally accurate, and publicly available records spanning multiple decades at high frequency are the living legacy of the NASA Earth Science Programs. Satellite-based monitoring of ecosystem dynamics has improved the objectivity, precision, and sustainability of ecosystem management, which is paramount not only for conserving ecosystem function, but also for adapting socio-economic systems to their changing biophysical environment.",

            "abstract": "Fossil pollen records from lakes, bogs, and small hollows offer the main source of information about vegetation responses to climate change and land use over timescales of decades to millennia. Millions of pollen grains are released from individual trees each year, and are transported by wind before settling out of the atmosphere. Reconstructing past vegetation from sedimentary pollen records, however, requires careful modeling of pollen production, transport, and deposition. The atmosphere is turbulent, and regional wind patterns shift from day to day. In accordance with this, it is necessary for pollen transport models to adequately account for variable, non-uniform wind patterns and vegetation heterogeneity.\nUsing a simulation approach, with both simulated vegetation patterns and vegetation gradients, as well as simulated wind fields, we show the inconsistency in pollen loading proportions and local vegetation proportions when non-uniform wind patterns are incorporated. Vegetation upwind from the lake is over-represented due to the increased prevalence of winds transporting pollen from that area. The inclusion of North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) wind records affirms this finding. Of the lake sites explored in this study, none had uniform wind patterns.\nThe use of a settlement-era gridded vegetation dataset, compiled by the PalEON project and based on Public Land Survey System (PLSS) records allows us to model pollen source area with realistic vegetation heterogeneity. Due to differences in productivity, pollen fall speeds, and neighboring vegetation, there exist patterns of vegetation that may be poorly characterized due to over/under representation of different taxa. Better understanding these differences in representation allows for more accurate reconstruction of historical vegetation, and pollen-vegetation relationships.",

To accomplish these goals, NanoSWARM targets scientifically rich features on the Moon known as swirls. Swirls are high-albedo features correlated with strong magnetic fields and low surface-water. NanoSWARM cubesats will make the first near-surface (<1 km altitude) measurements of solar wind flux and magnetic fields at swirls. NanoSWARM cubesats will also perform low-altitude neutron measurements to provide key constraints on the distribution of polar hydrogen concentrations, which are important volatile sinks in the lunar water cycle. To release its cubesats, NanoSWARM uses a high-heritage mother ship in a low altitude, polar, circular orbit. NanoSWARM's results will have direct applications to the geophysics, volatile distribution, and plasma physics of numerous other bodies, in particular asteroids and the terrestrial planets. The technologies and methods used by NanoSWARM will enable many new cubesat missions in the next decade. NanoSWARM was proposed as a NASA Discovery mission in February 2015.",

A 1-D conductivity model of the Earth and a 2-D conductivity model of the oceans and continents are used to separate the primary ionospheric field from its induced counterpart. In this presentation we’ll report on various models obtained using the DIFI algorithm from the most recent Swarm data available. In particular, we’ll focus on how these models compare to earlier models such as CM4 derived from previous satellite missions, and to independent ground data not used in the inversion. We’ll also address the question of the magnitude of the Sq field on the night-side, which is of practical interest to the core field modeling community, as was apparent during the preparation of the last IGRF.",

Further, double BSRs clearly identified in the Tuaheni Basin were hypothesized to result from differences in gas composition and fluid migration. During a cruise on the RV Tangaroa in June 2015 (TAN 1508) additional seismic data were collected and used to identify piston coring targets. Coring locations were selected to sample around BSR pinch-outs and possible fluid migration pathways to determine gas composition and flux.\nShallow sediments collected in June 2015 in the Tuaheni Basin had relatively low sediment headspace CH4 concentrations (<LD – 7 ppm). In contrast, sediment headspace CH4 concentrations in other sediment cores collected on the Hikurangi Margin during the same cruise were >6000ppm. Higher molecular weight alkanes were not detected in the sediment headspace gas at any location. Sediment porewater sulfate, chloride and sulfide concentrations will be presented with CH4concentration profiles and geophysical data.",

            "abstract": "After 33 years of quiescence, Wolf volcano, located in the northernmost tip of Isabela Island (Galápagos Islands, Ecuador), started a new eruption on May 25, 2015. The first signs of activity were recorded at 5:50 UTC (23:50 on May 24, Local Time in Galápagos) by a seismic station installed on Fernandina island. The first visual observation was reported at 7:38 UTC (1:38 LT). Based on amateur film footage, the vent was a >800 m-long circumferential fissure that produced a >100 m-high lava curtain. The eruption also released a 15 km-high gas plume with a large amount of SO2 and minimal ash content. Lightning was observed in the plume but not near the vent. Due to complex wind directions at high altitude, the gas cloud drifted in all directions eventually coming toward the continent and producing an extremely small ashfall in Quito that was detected only through the use of homemade ashmeters. The ash sample included lava droplets, scoria, and one small fragment of reticulite, indicating high lava fountaining during the first days of the eruption. The active vents on the circumferential fissure, initially located on the SE side of the caldera outer rim, moved progressively northward, eventually extending for a total of 2 km. One week later on June 02, satellite imagery (OMI, GOME, MODIS) documented decreased volcanic activity, leaving two new lava fields covering over 17 km2 on the SE (10 km-long and up to 2 km-wide) and E (7 km-long and up to 1 km-wide, reaching the sea) flanks of the volcano. Volcanic activity resumed on June 11, and on June 13 it shifted into the caldera, apparently emerging from a fissure close to the vent from the 1982 eruption, about 4 km W of the circumferential fissure. This new lava flow covered approximately 3.5 km2 of the caldera floor. Finally, volcanic activity waned at the end of June and appeared to have ended by July 11, accounting for one of the largest eruptions in the Galápagos since 1968 based on remote sensing.",

The results show that photochemical model underestimates OH and HO2 concentrations in the mesosphere and overestimates the OH concentration in the stratosphere. To fix the discrepancies, we use the MLS OH and HO2 measurements as benchmark to adjust a few key reaction rate constants and O2 cross section at Lyman-alpha wavelength using an optimal estimation algorithm. Model simulation with the adjusted parameters shows significantly better agreements with both OH and HO2 measurements. This study indicates that accurate measurements of photochemical reaction rates and molecular cross sections are crucial in simulating stratospheric and mesospheric HOx chemistry. High quality satellite observations can be used to constrain photochemical reaction rate uncertainties.",

            "abstract": "The study describes recent improvements in the processing of the complex radar echoes acquired over continental water bodies for both “conventional” and delay-doppler altimetry.\nThe accuracy of “conventional” altimetry is at the centimeter level, but only over flat and homogeneous surfaces such as the ocean’s surface, for which this technique was originally designed and optimized. But when the altimeter footprint encompasses various terrains, the measurement accuracy is frequently degraded to several tens of centimeters. While the improvement of the altimeter corrections over continental water areas seems today rather well mastered, it is not the same for the analysis and exploitation of radar echoes. The main reason is the presence of polluting reflectors within the footprint (emerged terrain, vegetation, buildings, ...) Thus, the resulting echo is a vertical composition, sometimes very complex, of a lot of reflections from various reflective facets with variable properties (geometry, backscatter and dynamics). The retracking algorithms currently used (derived from algorithms used over the ocean or sea ice) do not fit to multi-peaks echoes and show difficulties to return the true altitude of the water body. We illustrate the variety of waveforms on various continental hydrological examples and describe the errors made by using the current retracking algorithms. But above all, we demonstrate that the useful information in the waveform is often present but poorly exploited. Secondly, we describe our two approaches used to deal with multi-peaks echoes. The first strategy is to use an a priori estimate of the water height to restrict the retracking to a subset of the echo. The second approach is based on the identification and systematic analysis of all the peaks, for which the associated water levels are analysed in terms of consistency in a second time. We show a clear improvement of the resulting water level time series, especially during low water season. In a third part, these approaches are applied to delay-doppler measurements from Cryosat-2, which higher along-track spatial resolution may enable the measurement of high-resolution water level transects across rivers and other water basins where conventional altimeters echoes are impacted by land contamination due to their larger footprint size.",

Modelling these processes would illuminate system morphodynamics, fluxes, and 'complexity' in response to base level change, yet such problems are computationally formidable. Environmental systems are characterized by strong interconnectivity, yet traditional supercomputers have slow inter-node communication -- whereas rapidly advancing Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) technology offers vastly higher (>100x) bandwidths. \nGULLEM (GpU-accelerated Lowland Landscape Evolution Model) employs massively parallel code to simulate coupled fluvial-landscape evolution for complex lowland river systems over large temporal and spatial scales. GULLEM models the accommodation space carved/infilled by representing a range of geomorphic processes, including: river & tributary incision within a multi-directional flow regime, non-linear diffusion, glacial-isostatic flexure, hydraulic geometry, tectonic deformation, sediment production, transport & deposition, and full 3D tracking of all resulting stratigraphy. \nModel results concur with the Holocene dynamics of the Fly River, PNG -- as documented with dated cores, sonar imaging of floodbasin stratigraphy, and the observations of topographic remnants from LGM conditions. Other supporting research was conducted along the Mekong River, the largest fluvial system of the Sunda Shelf. These and other field data provide tantalizing empirical glimpses into the lowland landscapes of large rivers during glacial-interglacial transitions, observations that can be explored with this powerful numerical model. \n\nGULLEM affords estimates for the timing and flux budgets within the Fly and Sunda Systems, illustrating complex internal system responses to the external forcing of sea level and climate. Furthermore, GULLEM can be applied to most ANY fluvial system to explore processes across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. The presentation will provide insights (& many animations) illustrating river morphodynamics & resulting landscapes formed as a result of sea level oscillations.\n[Image: The incised 3.2e6 km^2 Sundaland domain @ 431ka]",

Previous isotope studies have suggested a primary Paleoproterozoic depletion age, a second partial melting event in the early Cambrian, and a Variscan metasomatic overprint. Textural and Sr-Nd isotopic observations further suggest two episodes of melt infiltration of early Cretaceous and Quaternary age. We have investigated anhydrous, vein-free lherzolites from this region, focusing on the Dreiser Weiher and Meerfelder Maar localities. Hand separated spinel, olivine, ortho- and clinopryoxene, along with host and bulk rocks were dissolved and purified for Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and Lu-Hf analysis on the Cologne/Bonn Neptune MC-ICP-MS. We find an unexpected discontinuity between mineral separates and whole rocks. While the latter have significantly more radiogenic εNd and εHf, mineral separates imply close-to chondritic compositions. Our Lu-Hf data imply resetting of the Lu-Hf systematic after 200 Ma. Given the vein-free nature of the lherzolites, this appears to date to the second youngest metasomatic episode. We suggest that markedly radiogenic Nd and Hf were introduced during the Quarternary metasomatic episode and most likely reside on grain boundaries.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying soil production and transport rates and processes is a key aspect of most critical zone studies. Methodologies range from relatively straightforward, low cost studies like sediment traps and basin volume estimates to sophisticated and expensive studies using chemical and physical tracers and isotope geochemistry. Inherent in all methodologies are assumptions and simplifications that enable any measurement to be translated to a rate and interpreted in terms of process mechanics. For example, quantifying soil production using in situ cosmogenic nuclides measured in the parent material beneath an upland mobile regolith mantle depends on assuming a locally steady state soil thickness (i.e. neither thinning or thickening with time). Similarly, utilizing hillslope-scale sediment traps or landscape-scale basin analyses depends on assumptions of steady state processes and constraining the timescales represented by the captured sediment. As our analyses of landscapes have expanded into the details of how spatial and temporal gradients of all driving variables (lithology, climate, tectonics, distribution of biota, etc.) influence landscape evolution, our adherence to the assumptions and simplifications necessitated by our methods becomes questionable. Here we provide content analyses of recent and ongoing studies quantifying soil production and transport processes across a range of climatic, geologic and tectonic regimes. We code the studies for their inclusion and use of assumptions and simplifications necessary to ensure that the methodologies apply to their intended use. These analyses provide an important perspective on the use of quantitative methods and offer both a complimentary and cautionary views on critical zone studies in general.",

In addition to the observed failures, pervasive ground cracking has been widely reported in Nepal. This is indicative of hillslope ‘damage’ (weakening) and, hence, the onset of shear surface development in as-yet unfailed slopes  – a phenomenon previously observed in areas subjected to high-magnitude earthquake ground shaking and subsequent ongoing landsliding. Recent work on the efficacy of earthquakes in triggering landslides has proposed that the occurrence of failures is a function of damage accumulated in the slope.\nWe present a unique field monitoring dataset on continuing slope deformation from hillslopes damaged during the 2015 Nepal EQS, in response to precipitation and continuing seismicity. Our study site is the Upper Bhote Koshi (UBK), with sites chosen from a chronology of landslide inventories captured from remotely sensed imagery since the Gorkha earthquake. Instruments were deployed during the monsoon on new and pre-existing landslides, and across cracked ground to monitoring precipitation inputs, slope-scale (micro-)seismicity, and slope displacements. Using our dataset, we draw preliminary conclusions on how the spatially-variable legacy of damage accumulated during high-magnitude earthquake-induced ground shaking events is manifest in patterns, rates and styles of post-seismic slope deformation.",

            "abstract": "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) operates the North-East Corridor (NEC) project and the Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) in order to develop measurement methods to quantify sources of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions as well as their uncertainties in urban domains using a top down inversion method. Top down inversion updates prior knowledge using observations in a Bayesian way. One primary consideration in a Bayesian inversion framework is the covariance structure of (1) the emission prior residuals and (2) the observation residuals (i.e. the difference between observations and model predicted observations). These covariance matrices are respectively referred to as the prior covariance matrix and the model-data mismatch covariance matrix. It is known that the choice of these covariances can have large effect on estimates.\nThe main objective of this work is to determine the impact of different covariance models on inversion estimates and their associated uncertainties in urban domains. We use a pseudo-data Bayesian inversion framework using footprints (i.e. sensitivities of tower measurements of GHGs to surface emissions) and emission priors (based on Hestia project to quantify fossil-fuel emissions) to estimate posterior emissions using different covariance schemes. The posterior emission estimates and uncertainties are compared to the hypothetical truth. We find that, if we correctly specify spatial variability and spatio-temporal variability in prior and model-data mismatch covariances respectively, then we can compute more accurate posterior estimates. We discuss few covariance models to introduce space-time interacting mismatches along with estimation of the involved parameters. We then compare several candidate prior spatial covariance models from the Matern covariance class and estimate their parameters with specified mismatches. We find that best-fitted prior covariances are not always best in recovering the truth. To achieve accuracy, we perform a sensitivity study to further tune covariance parameters. Finally, we introduce a shrinkage based sample covariance estimation technique for both prior and mismatch covariances. This technique allows us to achieve similar accuracy nonparametrically in a more efficient and automated way.",

            "abstract": "Heald Bank is a Gulf of Mexico sand bank located ~50 km off the coast of east Texas on the inner continental shelf. The bank is proposed to be a remnant of barrier islands drowned and thus preserved during an episode of rapid sea level rise. For this hypothesis to be true, the transgressive ravinement that marks the erosion by the shoreline moving from shelf edge towards the modern location would by definition postdate and thus be stratigraphically above the bank. To test this hypothesis we present ~90 km of Compressed High Intensity Radar Pulse (CHIRP) and Multi-channel seismic (MCS) data collected from the University of Texas Geophysics marine field course during 2008, 2013, and 2014. In these data, there are several visible underlying channels beneath Heald Bank. These channels have channel fill which are truncated by an overlying erosional surface, which we interpret to be the transgressive ravinement from sea level rise. However, this interpretation places the ravinement below the sand bank, meaning it could not have been drowned and buried by a rapid sea level rise event. Thus, Heald Bank and potentially the related inner shelf banks (Thomas, Shepard, and Sabine) from eastern Texas to western Louisiana cannot be used as an example of coastal response to climate change and sea level rise. We examine alternate origins for the banks and their sand using published cores as well as age models and integrating them with our seismic data. One possibility is that the sand was sourced from the nearby Sabine River system immediately following local transgression or the sand was remobilized from sediment fill within underlying paleo-river channels imaged below the Heald Bank. In either case Heald Bank appears not to serve as an indicator for rapid sea-level rise, yet could be an important analog for sand transport mechanisms offshore.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric black carbon (BC) aerosols play a key role in Earth’s climate through direct and indirect effects. Due to a lack of long-term BC data, climate models are used to estimate BC based on fuel inventories, which have large uncertainties. Hence, long term BC data is needed to verify global models. We report here the first measurements of atmospheric BC concentrations, [BC]atm, from ~1700 to 2013 using sediments from Finnish lakes, Saanajarvi (SJ)(690 44’ N, 200 52’ E), and Vuoskojarvi (VJ)(69044’N, 26057’E). The cores were collected from the deepest parts of the lakes using a HTH gravity corer, sliced in 0.25 cm sections; freeze dried, and ages determined using 210Pb dating method. The BC was chemically separated, and [BC] determined by the thermal optical method. The [BC] varied from 50 to 1140µg/gdry weight in SJ; and 20 to 130µg/gdry weight in VJ. Husain et al.,(JGR, vol 113, D13102,doi:10.1029/2007JD009398, 2008) showed that the atmospheric deposition of BC into lake sediments depends on the characteristic of individual lakes, BC washout ratios, precipitation intensity, and sedimentation rates. The deposition rate, K, for a lake is defined by, [BC]sed = K[BC]atm where [BC]sed, is the concentration of BC in the sediment. We have measured [BC]atm from 1970 to 2010 in Kevo, Finland, where VJ and SJ are located. The [BC]atm from Kevo, and [BC]sed from VJ, and SJ were used to determine K for each of the lake. Owing to the availability of the long term atmospheric BC data from 1970 to 2010 multiple measurements of K were made, and provided a high measure of precision. The mean values of K for VJ, and SJ were 226 ± 60, and 830 ± 290 (m3air/ gdry weight). The K values were used to determine [BC]atm for the years before 1970. The [BC]atm from 2013 to 2006 was 82ng/m3. It increased slowly reaching a peak value of about 947 ± 322 ng/m3.The concentrations decreased subsequently to 244 ± 83ng/m3 in 1920, and changed little ~ 1774.The lowest concentration, 77 ± 26 ng/m3, was observed ~ 1700. The high atmospheric concentrations beyond 1850, perhaps, suggest a proportionally larger component from wood burning for heating. We plan to estimate [BC]atm using OsloCTM3 model, and inventory of fossil fuel, and biomass burning, and compare it with our measurements.",

            "abstract": "The \"next generation\" of hydrologic prediction systems - targeting unified, process-based, real-time prediction of the total water cycle - bring with them an increased need for real-time land surface characterization. Climatologically-derived estimates may perform well under stationary conditions, however disturbance can significantly alter hydrologic behavior and may be poorly represented by mean historical conditions. Fortunately, remote sensing and on-the-ground observation networks are collecting snapshots of these land characteristics over an increasing fraction of the globe. Given the computing constraints of operating a large-domain, real-time prediction system, to take advantage of these data streams we need a way to prioritize which landscape characteristics are most important to hydrologic prediction post-disturbance.\nTo address this need, we setup a model experiment over the contiguous US using the community WRF-Hydro system with the NoahMP land surface model to assess the value of incorporating various aspects of disturbed landscapes into a real-time streamflow prediction model. WRF-Hydro will serve as the initial operational model for the US National Weather Service's new national water prediction effort, so use of WRF-Hydro allows us to leverage both an existing CONUS-scale model implementation and a short research-to-operations path. We first identify USGS GAGES-II basins that experienced more than 25% forest loss between 2000 and 2013. Based on basin disturbance type, geophysical setting, and climate regime, we formulate a conceptual model of which \"disturbed\" landscape characteristics we expect to dominate streamflow response. We test our conceptual model using WRF-Hydro by modeling a baseline (no disturbance) case, and then bringing in empirically-derived model state shifts representing key disturbance characteristics (e.g., leaf area index, rooting depth, overland roughness, surface detention). For each state update and each basin, we quantify prediction skill improvement across a range of hydrologic timescales. Finally, we compare our model findings to our original conceptual model of dominant controls based on basin attributes. The results allow us to identify opportunities and gaps in real-time products to support post-disturbance streamflow prediction.",

            "abstract": "This work explores new pathways toward a better representation of the multi-scale physics that drive climate variability. We are analysing the key upscaling processes by which small-scale localized errors have a knock-on effect onto global climate. We focus on the Peru-Chilli coastal upwelling, an area known to hold among the strongest models biases in the Tropics.\nOur approach is based on the development of a multiscale coupling interface allowing us to couple WRF with the NEMO oceanic model in a configuration including 2-way nested zooms in the oceanic and/or the atmospheric component of the coupled model. Upscalling processes are evidenced and quantified by comparing three 20-year long simulations of a tropical channel (45°S-45°N), which differ by their horizontal resolution: 0.75° everywhere, 0.75°+0.25° zoom in the southeastern Pacific or 0.25° everywhere. This set of three 20-year long simulations was repeated with 3 different sets of parameterizations to assess the robustness of our results.\nOur results show that adding an embedded zoom over the southeastern Pacific only in the atmosphere cools down the SST along the Peru-Chili coast, which is a clear improvement. This change is associated with a displacement of the low-level cloud cover, which moves closer to the coast cooling further the coastal area SST. Offshore, we observe the opposite effect with a reduction of the cloud cover with higher resolution, which increases solar radiation and warms the SST. Increasing the resolution in the oceanic component show contrasting results according to the different set parameterization used in the experiments. Some experiment shows a coastal cooling as expected, whereas, in other cases, we observe a counterintuitive response with a warming of the coastal SST. Using at the same time an oceanic and an atmospheric zoom mostly combines the results obtained when using the 2-way nesting in only one component of the coupled model. In the best case, we archive by this means a reduction of the coastal SST of several degrees in agreement with the observations.\nOur work also showed that upscalling effects (modification of the simulations out of the zoom area) are insignificant when using WRF forced by a prescribed SST. Air-Sea coupling is the only way to see upscalling effects, even if the embedded zoom is applied only in the atmosphere.",

I am still in the early stages of my career as an academic and information scientist. But before starting my doctoral program, I worked as a geologist for 7 years. During that time I’ve worked on a drill rig and collected data in the field. I’ve described cores and cuttings in order to map aquifers. I wrote grants and worked on teams. Now, as an information scientist I look at how researchers access, discover and reuse existing data sets. It involves understanding how data is used, created, and how scientists think about finding data. It hasn’t been an easy change, but lately the two domains are converging in the form of data scientists.\nThe change in my career happened organically. The needs of my organization dictated the skills I developed. I thought these needs were just issues in my organization but then I found many other organizations asking the same question. Through the United States Geological Survey’s National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program (NGGDPP), I met other geologists working with physical data, and dealing with access, discoverability, and data usage. I found a number of member communities within groups such as the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP), the Research Data Alliance (RDA), EarthCube, and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) working to on similar questions related to earth science data.\nMost importantly, I have found that ideas and concepts from my experience with data curation, archives, reference, metadata, organization of information and other library science topics have prepared me to help find solutions to these questions. As the concept of libraries change, so too must the role of the librarian. With this presentation I will discuss my unique career path and how I believe domain sciences and information science can benefit from each other.",

Due to the highly accidental nature of forest fires, satellite remote sensing could be a promising method to develop regional and global fire emission inventories on a real-time basis. Reliable fire radiative power (FRP)-based fuel consumption and emission factors are critical in this approach. In an attempt to obtain the information, laboratory combustion experiments were conducted to simultaneously monitor FRP, fuel consumption, and emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), and reactive nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2). FRP were quantified using temperature-resolved values from a thermal imager instead of conventionally used average temperature, as the former provides more realistic estimates. For dry Ponderosa pine branches, a common fuel in the Sierra Nevada, a strong correlation (r2 ~ 0.8) between FRP and the mass reduction rate (MRR) was found. This led to a radiative energy yield (REY) of 8.5 ± 1.2 MJ/kg, assuming blackbody radiation and a flame emissivity of 0.5. Mass-based emission factors were determined with the carbon balance approach. Considering the ratio of mass-based emission factors and the REY, FRP-based emission factors: PM2.5: 11 g/MJ, CO: 8.0 g/MJ, NO: 0.33 g/MJ, and NO2: 0.07 g/MJ were quantified. The application of this approach to other fuel types and uncertainties in the measurements will be discussed.",

We performed a cascade-filtration (at 1.2μm, 0.4μm, and 0.025μm) of stream water samples collected during a monsoon storm event at the Marshall Gulch site of the Santa Catalina Mountains-Jemez River Basin Critical Zone Observatory and used standard stream water analytical techniques to determine concentration-discharge relationships. This yielded positive concentration-discharge relationships for Al, transition metals, and rare earth elements. Additionally, using the ratio of 0.025um-filtered samples to 0.4um-filtered samples, we find that these species (Al, transition metals, rare earth elements) were not completely dissolved in stream water. This partial dissolution, in conjunction with the positive concentration-discharge relationship, implies the complexation of these species to colloids or dissolved organic matter during stream-water transport.",

In the first approach, we implemented traditional SLEUTH urban simulation model by using publicly available and locally-developed land cover and transportation data. Historical land cover data from 1992, 2001, 2006, and 2011 were used to calibrate the SLEUTH model and predict urban growth from 2011 to 2070. The SLEUTH model achieved 94.8% overall accuracy for validation year 2014. For the second modelling approach, we used a future population projection for 2050, aided by a strong population-imperviousness statistical relationship (R2 ~ 0.95), to predict impervious surface density for each county. These population-predicted impervious surface density values were compared to SLEUTH model output, at the county spatial scale. R2 of 0.84 suggested general agreement of overall pattern, although SLEUTH generated higher impervious surface density values for 36 out of 40 counties. For population-predicted impervious surface density, we further developed a lookup table approach to integrate SLEUTH output and generated a spatially explicit urban map for 2050. This lookup table approach has high potential to integrate population-predicted and SLEUTH-predicted urban landscape, especially when future population can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.",

The trigger mechanisms, tendency to occur and relationship of these phenomena to global climate will be clarified.\nTo clarify that relationship between the RCP scenarios and tipping elements, we identified which year tipping elements in case of “Arctic summer sea ice” and “Greenland ice sheet” are appeared using the increase of global average temperature in 5 GCMs under RCP (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) from Zickfeld et al.

In case of “Greenland ice sheet” (Tipping point takes a value within the range of 1.0oC and 4.0oC), we found that “Greenland ice sheet” may melt down when the tipping point is 1.0oC as lowest value. On the other hand, when tipping point sets as 4.0oC, it may not melt down except for RCP 8.5. As above, we show the uncertainty of tipping point itself. In future, it is necessary how to reflect such uncertainty in risk analysis in hydrology.",

            "abstract": "Visible Multifilter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR) data were collected at Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL), a mountain top facility in northwest Colorado, from 1999-2011 and in 2013. From 2011-2014, in-situ measurements of aerosol light scattering were also obtained. Using these datasets together, the seasonal impact of dust and biomass burning is considered for the western United States. Analysis indicates that the median contributions to spring and summer aerosol optical depth (AOD) from dust and biomass-burning aerosols across the dataset are comparable. The Ångström exponent showed a significant increase in the summer for both the in situ and MFRSR data, indicating an increase in combustion aerosols. Spring dust events are less distinguishable in the in-situ data than the column measurement, suggesting that a significant amount of dust may be found above the elevation of SPL, 3220 m asl. Twenty-two known case studies of intercontinental dust, regional dust, and biomass burning events were investigated. These events were found to follow a similar pattern, in both aerosol loading and Ångström exponent, as the seasonal mean signal in both the MFRSR and ground-based nephelometer. This dataset highlights the wide scale implications of a warmer, drier climate on visibility in the Western U.S.",

            "abstract": "Scottbreen is a small alpine glacier on the west coast of Spitsbergen, Svalbard\n(77°33'1.51\"N, 14°21'50.21\"E), whose terminal moraine abuts a 64 m a.s.l. high\nmarine terrace dated to an average (n=4) reservoir corrected radiocarbon age of\n11,256 ± 63 14C yr BP at 57 m a.s.l. (Mangerud and Landvik, 2007, Boreas 36, 278-\n285). Outboard of the right lateral moraine is an outcrop of glacially polished\nquartz-rich metaconglomerate that we dated to 14.8± 0.7 ka at 142 m a.s.l. and\n15.3± 0.7 ka at 104 m a.s.l. using 10Be dating. Scottbreen’s terminal moraine\nformation is attributed to a serge event that occurred in the 1880’s that was\nhypothesized to have overridden all older deposits (Mangerud and Landvik, 2007,\nBoreas 36, 278-285). However, new high-resolution aerial photographs obtained\nduring the Norwegian Polar Institute’s 2012 mapping campaign reveal a series of\ndistinctive ridge crests on the moraine. Furthermore, field observations of these\ncrests show substantial variation in the degree of weathering from the most ice\ndistal to the proximal crests. The multiple crests may represent several cycles of\nadvance and retreat of the glacier that date to significantly older than the 1880’s\nadvance. To test this hypothesis we have collected nineteen moraine boulders on\nfour distinctive ridges of the terminal moraine complex for 10Be dating. The pending\nresults of this study will aid in bridging the time gap of this glacier’s evolution\nduring the course of the Holocene. The results will also reveal if Scotbreen’s\nterminal moraine represents a single event or multiple advances of the glacier that\nmay act in or out of phase with known climatic events.",

            "abstract": "The prospect of climatic change and its impacts have brought spatial statistics of extreme events into sharper focus. The so-called “water bombs” are predicted to become more frequent in the extra-tropical regions, and, actually, they raise serious concerns in some regions of the Mediterranean area. However, quantitative statistical methods to properly account for the probability of occurrence of these super-extreme events are still lacking, due to their rare occurrence and to the limited spatial scale at which these events occur.\nIn order to overcome the lack of data, we propose at first to exploit the information derived from remote sensed datasets. Despite the coarser resolution, these databases are able to provide information continuous in space and time, overcoming the problems related to the discontinuous nature of rainfall measurements. We propose to apply such a kind of approach with the adoption of a Bayesian framework, aimed at combining local measurements with climatic regional information, conditioning the exceedance probability on the large and mesoscale characteristics of the system.\nThe case study refers to an area located in the North-West of Italy, historically affected by extraordinary precipitation events. We use a dataset of daily at-gauge rainfall measurements extracted from the NOAA GHCN-Daily dataset, combined with the ones provided by some local Environmental Agencies. Daily estimations from the TRMM are adopted too.\nFirst, we identify the most intense events occurred in the area, combining the information from the different datasets. Analysing the related synoptic conditions with the reanalysis of the ECMWF, we then define the conditional variables and the hierarchical relationships between the events and their type. Different climatic configurations that combined with the local morphology and the seasonal condition of the Mediterranean Sea can triggers very intense precipitation events are identified.\nThe results, compared with those obtained with the classic techniques of frequency analysis and spatial interpolation, demonstrate an increased knowledge coming from satellite, climate and local factors, ensuring more reliable and accurate spatial assessment of extreme thunderstorm probability.",

A data archive such as the one at the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF), one of NASA's twelve interlinked Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs), used to be searched solely via user interfaces that were specifically developed for its particular archive and data sets. ASF then moved to using an application programming interface (API) that defined a set of routines, protocols, and tools for distributing the geospatial information stored in the database in real time. This provided a more flexible access to the geospatial data. Yet, it was up to user to develop the tools to get a more tailored access to the data they needed.\nWe present two new approaches for serving data to users. In response to the recent Nepal earthquake we developed a data feed for distributing ESA's Sentinel data. Users can subscribe to the data feed and are provided with the relevant metadata the moment a new data set is available for download. The second approach was an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) web feature service (WFS). The WFS hosts the metadata along with a direct link from which the data can be downloaded. It uses the open-source GeoServer software (Youngblood and Iacovella, 2013) and provides an interface to include the geospatial information in the archive directly into the user's geographic information system (GIS) as an additional data layer. Both services are run on top of a geospatial PostGIS database, an open-source geographic extension for the PostgreSQL object-relational database (Marquez, 2015).\nMarquez, A., 2015.

This study simulated future flows in the Cache Creek watershed in California, over the 21st century using a hydro-climate model (WEHY-HCM) forced by future climate projections. The future climate projections, based on four emission scenarios simulated by two GCMs (ECHAM5 and CCSM3) under several initial conditions, were dynamically downscaled using MM5, a regional climate model. The downscaled future precipitation data were bias-corrected before being input into the WEHY model to simulate the detailed flow at hourly intervals along the main Cache Creek branch and its tributaries during 2010-2099. The results suggest an increasing trend in flood magnitudes and their intensities at the outlet of the study region throughout the 21st century. Similarly, estimates of the 100 and 200-year floods increased throughout the study period. The observed differences in the estimated future flood frequencies between the first half and the second half of 21st century may be an evidence of the non-stationarity in the 21st century hydrological regime over the study region.",

            "abstract": "Bank filtration has proven to be a sustainable, cost-effective method of removing cyanobacteria and their harmful toxins from surface water during filtration through bottom and aquifer sediments. The biologically active layer of sediments immediately beneath the sediment–water interface (colmation layer) is believed to be particularly important in this process. An in situ experiment was conducted that involved assessing the transport behaviors of bromide (conservative tracer), Synechococcus sp. IU625 (cyanobacterium, 2.6 ± 0.2 µm), AS-1 (tailed cyanophages, 110 nm long), MS2 (coliphages, 26 nm diameter), and carboxylate-modified microspheres (1.7 µm diameter) introduced to the colmation layer using a bag-and-barrel (Lee-type) seepage meter. The constituents were monitored as they advected through the colmation layer and underlying aquifer sediments at Ashumet Pond in Cape Cod, MA, a mesotrophic kettle pond that recharges a portion of a sole-source, drinking water aquifer. Because the pond DOC includes the various cyanotoxins produced during harmful algal bloom senescence, the DOC and aforementioned colloids were tracked concomitantly. The tracer test constituents were monitored as they advected across the pond water–groundwater interface and through the underlying aquifer sediments under natural-gradient conditions past push-points samplers placed at ~30-cm intervals along a 1.2-m-long, diagonally downward flow path. More than 99% of the microspheres, IU625, MS2, AS-1, and ~42% of the pond DOC were removed in the colmation layer (upper 25 cm of poorly sorted bottom sediments) at two test locations characterized by dissimilar seepage rates (1.7 vs. 0.26 m d-1). Retention profiles in recovered core material indicated that >82% of the attached IU625 were in the top 3 cm of bottom sediments. The colmation layer was also responsible for rapid changes in the character of the DOC and was more effective (by 3 orders of magnitude) at removing microspheres than was the underlying 30-cm-long segment of sediment. A follow-up study conducted the following year at the same location demonstrated that removal of the top 5 cm of sediment resulted in a six-fold decrease in the efficiency of the near-surface bottom sediments for filtering out Synechococcus, cyanophage, and well-characterized microspheres.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake-triggered landslides are thought to play a major role in the erosion budget of mountainous topography in tectonically active regions, but the long-term topographic effects of seismically-driven denudation over multiple seismic cycles remain to be fully explored. In this work, we focus on the Longmen Shan range along the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, where the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake triggered tens of thousands of landslides. We assess regional erosion rates from decadal to millennial to Myr timescales, using pre-Wenchuan and post-Wenchuan hydrological gauging data, cosmogenic ages, and thermal cooling rates, respectively. We use these data to evaluate the magnitude and proportion of erosion associated with the Wenchuan event, and we then use this case study along with earthquake Mw-frequency relations to consider earthquake-driven erosion over multiple earthquake cycles. We find that, as long as rivers are capable of removing landslide debris within the timescale of earthquake return times, focused denudation along an orogenic margin such as the eastern edge of the Tibetan plateau can be explained by repeated earthquake events, without explicit need for a strong climatic driver of focused erosion. We develop a generalized 2-D model that accounts for both seismically-induced denudation and uplift (co-seismic uplift, visco-elastic relaxation and flexural-isostatic responses). This model can explain, through repeated seismic events, the development and maintenance of high topography as seen along the eastern Tibetan plateau. We consider the implications of this model for simulating mountain growth in various tectonic settings, contributing to better understanding of the role of earthquakes in mountain building.",

            "abstract": "River channels exchange sediment, carbon, and other matter with hillslopes and floodplains. An ongoing challenge is to quantify the time and length scales of these lateral interactions, and to establish physical controls on direction of transfer. Here we investigate whether downstream changes in stream power (Ω) can predict near-channel sources or sinks of matter on decadal time scales in a case study of Mink Brook, a 50 km2 watershed in New Hampshire, USA. Building on the Exner equation, we hypothesize that reaches with downstream increases in stream power (Ω↑) exhibit near-channel deposition and accumulation of organic matter, and reaches of downstream decreases in stream power (Ω↓) exhibit near-channel erosion and stripping of organic matter. We measured 210Pbex inventory (an indicator of erosion versus deposition), organic matter inventory, grain size, and depth of alluvium/colluvium in 29 soil pits at 6 cross sections along the brook. Sites had equivalent total Ω for a given storm event. However, 3 cross sections exhibited Ω↑, and 3 exhibited Ω↓. All cross sections showed a general trend of stripping of organic matter and fine sediment particles in the channel, paired with loading of matter at the ~2-year flood elevation. From the ~2- to ~25-year flood elevation, a marked difference appeared between sites. The Ω↑ cross sections exhibited several locations of erosion and stripping of organic matter, as evidenced by low 210Pbex inventories (70 to 1,000 bq m-2), low organic matter inventories (17 to 219 kg m-2), and thin alluvial cover (average 23 cm). The low 210Pbex inventories, below the characteristic 6,000 bq m-2 of stable soil profiles in this region, suggest no areas had consistent deposition over the last century. In contrast, the Ω↓ cross sections exhibited deposition of fine particles and organic matter from the ~2- to ~25-year flood elevation, as evidenced by elevated 210Pbex inventories (up to 9,100 bq m-2), elevated organic matter inventories (up to 3,300 kg m-2), and thicker alluvial cover (average 41 cm). This analysis has direct management implications for predicting sources and sinks of sediment, carbon, and likely other nutrients and pollutants along rivers—with broader implications for riparian ecology and restoration practices.",

Cold content determines snowmelt timing and is an important component of the annual energy budget of mountain sites with seasonal snowpacks. However, little is understood about seasonal snowpack cold content dynamics as calculating cold content requires depth-weighted snowpack temperature and snow water equivalent (SWE) measurements, which are scarce. A spatially distributed network of snow pits has been sampled since 1993 at the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site on the eastern slope of the Continental Divide in Colorado’s Front Range mountains. This study uses data from 3 pit sites that have at least 8 years of observations and represent alpine and sub-alpine environments. For these pits, cold content is strongly related to SWE during the cold content accumulation phase, here defined as December, January, and February. Average peak cold content ranges between -2.5 MJ m-2 and -9.2 MJ m-2 for the three sites and is strongly related to peak SWE. On average, cold content reaches its maximum on February 26, which is 61 days before the average date of peak SWE (i.e., the snowpack’s cold content is satisfied over an average of 61 days). At the alpine site, later peak cold content and SWE was observed relative to the lower elevation sub-alpine sites. Interestingly, the alpine site had a smaller gap between peak cold content and SWE (55 days versus 67 days for the alpine and sub-alpine sites, respectively). The gap between peak cold content and peak SWE is primarily a function of the increase in SWE between the two dates. Hence, persistent snowfall after the date of peak cold content can delay the onset of snowmelt even if peak cold content was relatively low. Improving our understanding of seasonal cold content dynamics in mountain environments will enable us to better model the future effects of climate change on snowmelt timing and associated hydrologic response.",

            "abstract": "Modifications to the land surface that alter surface albedo consequently change the radiation balance of the planet, and therefore have the potential to modify climate. To quantify this “radiative forcing”, researchers in the land use/ land cover change community must calculate the change in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave radiative flux associated with measured or modeled changes in surface albedo. Conventional solutions to this problem include application of radiative transfer models that require detailed inputs of vertical profiles of cloud properties and atmospheric gas and particle concentrations. Performing these calculations can be logistically complex and computationally intensive. As biogeophysical effects of land use change are increasingly included into climate mitigation strategies, a need has arisen for efficient means of making these calculations. “Radiative kernels”, which are essentially climatologies of the sensitivity of TOA fluxes to changes in surface albedo, as developed using offline calculations of the radiative transfer code inside a global climate model, have become popular options. However, satellite observations of TOA radiative fluxes may be applied with simple models to provide an attractive measurement-based alternative to radiative kernels. The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments provide approximately 15 years (and growing) of remotely-sensed observations of TOA fluxes. Here we evaluate popular radiative kernels with CERES observations, and provide an empirical alternative for calculating TOA radiative forcing from surface albedo change using CERES data.",

            "abstract": "Distinguishing the local and non-local watershed characteristics that influence the spatial and temporal response of shallow subsurface flow within hillslopes is requisite for quantifying streamflow quantity, timing, and quality. We evaluated local and non-local (upslope) topographic influences on shallow water table duration, magnitude, spatial extent (32 shallow groundwater recording wells) and compared these to incremental changes in stream discharge across 3 hillslopes in the Lubrecht Experimental Forest, MT. Our results corroborate prior findings of the role upslope accumulated area (UAA) and local slope (as combined in the topographic wetness index) for shallow groundwater response, but emphasize the importance of considering the two variables independently. Increasing UAA resulted in greater durations of saturation across each well position (R2= 0.78; p < .05). Local slope was a significant predictor of mean water table height (R2= -0.86; p < .05). We used our empirical findings to inform a distributed hydrologic model (EcH2O) and quantify the spatio-temporal variability of hydrologically connected contributing area. The spatial extent and timing of hydrologically connected contributing area was synchronized with changes in stream reach discharge adjacent to each hillslope. These relationships suggest that the organization of hillslope topography is a necessary context for predicting runoff source contributions to streams in space and time.",

N deposition has the potential to affect photosynthesis, plant and soil respiration, and thus vegetation and soil C storages. Accurate estimation of the change in plant uptake of carbon dioxide due to N deposition is essential to dealing with the climate change. Among the 11 earth system models which provide climate projection for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, only the community land model (CLM-CN) used in two of them includes a dynamic terrestrial nitrogen cycle. However, the responses of carbon and nitrogen dynamics to nitrogen deposition in CLM-CN have not been well evaluated. In this study, we examine the performance of CLM-CN (version 4.0) in simulating how leaf N content, leaf area index (LAI), aboveground biomass, soil respiration, and soil organic C and N respond to low-level N addition (40 kg N m-2 yr-1) using observations at an alpine meadow on the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau. CLM-CN well reproduced the positive responses of LAI and soil respiration (+13% and +8%) to the N addition, compared to observed increases (+14% and +12%). However, the CLM-CN leaf N content response to N addition (+13%) was larger than observed (+5%), and modeled response of aboveground biomass C (+5%) was smaller than observed (+12%). Moreover, modeled slight positive response (+0.2%) of soil organic C to N addition was inconsistent with observed decrease of 8.8%. Additional manipulation experimental data are required for evaluating and improving models in simulating responses of plant N uptake, C and N allocation, litter and soil organic matter decomposition to N deposition.",

            "abstract": "The NW region of the Baja California peninsula in México is dominated by the California Current System (CCS). Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a key variable in water bodies because it is considered as a health in biological processes. Hypoxic conditions (DO 60 to 120 µmol kg-1) occur naturally in large areas of the ocean. In the Eastern Pacific, the DO can be altered by eutrophication, derived from anthropogenic activity, especially in shallow and enclosed seas. Fluctuations in the conditions of hypoxia zones may have significant ecological and economic impact. It is of interest in assessing whether hypoxic conditions in the vicinity of Bahia de Todos Santos (BTS) and Coronado Islands in México are altered by anthropogenic activity (Figs. 1 and 2 respectively). For the present study, we worked with data collected from oceanographic expeditions during the period October 2010 to June 2015. The DO was determined using a CTD (SBE Model 25) and by sea water collection with hydrographic bottles using a modification of the Winkler method. The signs of hypoxia are evident in the area near BTS and in the vicinity of Coronado´s Islands, mainly on locations between the Todos Santos Islands and the peninsula of Punta Banda, which shows that the hypoxic zone begins to occur in shallow water between 50-200 m depth. This particular area corresponds to the point where the Mexican Navy determined as a site for dredging materials from the ports of Ensenada and El Sauzal, it is possible that the anthropogenic activity alters the natural conditions of hypoxia in the area to enlarge. In June 2012 for the first time in that region we obtained sediment samples below 700 m depth, which are mixed terrigenous clastic and oceanic sediments.",

The series has 25 episodes so far, and more than 80,000 views on YouTube. We are reaching our target audience of high-school-age and adult viewers in the United States (94% of viewers are known to fit this demographic).\nDon't Just Sit There - Do Something! uses a strategic model for breaking through the fear and dread around climate change in the general population. It uses humor, positivity and brevity to frame the issue, and gives the audience simple actions designed to empower in each self-contained episode. We approach each piece of the climate puzzle with scientific rigor, and cite all our sources. Our approach is light-hearted and fun, because it is a more productive way to have a conversation about tough issues than scolding and guilt. The series is ongoing, and we are always focused on climate change.\nTo determine the efficacy of our approach and efforts, we measure video views and other metrics through our YouTube channel, compile feedback and comments through YouTube and other social media outlets, and track actions taken through web metrics (click-through rates).\nWe are also currently working with the Behavioral and Community Health Sciences Department at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health to evaluate the videos’ impact. From August-October 2015, we are using an online survey to evaluate the Don’t Just Sit There - Do Something! series. We will assess viewers’ climate change education and awareness, commitment to support action steps that alleviate climate change, and inclination to support policy action before and after watching. Where possible, we have aligned survey questions with those of other groups, such as the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, to better assess our survey population vs. the general population.\nWe will share data about the benefits of using this novel approach for climate change communication.",

Unique to this region is the preservation of this tectonic collage, largely unmodified by subsequent tectonic events, which permits examination of if and how such events are preserved in the continental lithosphere.\nI will present a three-dimensional lithospheric-scale resistivity model derived from EarthScope magnetotelluric data. I will discuss details of the resistivity model in relation to lithospheric sutures, defined primarily from aeromagnetic and geochronologic data, which record the southward growth of the Laurentian margin in the Precambrian. I will examine in detail the resistivity signature of the 1.1 Ga Mid-Continent Rift System as relates to rift geometry, extent, and segmentation. I further speculate that axial drainage along the southwest rift arm created an unrecognized expanse of (concealed) Precambrian deltaic deposits in Kansas akin to the Rio Grande delta that today drains multiple sub-basins within the Rio Grande Rift.\nThe resistivity model also reveals the distribution of highly conductive Paleoproterozoic metasediments in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The high conductivity is attributed to metallic sulfides and in some cases graphite. The former is considered a potential source of sulfur for multiple types of mineral deposits found in the region.\nFinally, I consider the imprint left within the mantle following the 1.1 Ga rifting event. Throughout the mid-continent, variations in lithospheric mantle conductivity are revealed, most likely reflecting variations in hydration (depleted versus metasomatized mantle). The spatial pattern of conductivity variations bears little resemblance to past tectonic events or to the direction of North American absolute plate motion.",

Spectroscopic measurements of SP taken by the New Horizons LEISA instrument also indicate that SP is a region containing (among others) a significant amount of N2 [2]. Taken together these observations suggest the possibility that the high albedo material on SP is glacial N2 ice atop a bedrock-like substrate and the notable lack of craters on SP means that these processes are acting on relatively fast geologic timescales.

            "abstract": "Precipitation in the southwestern United States falls primarily in areas of higher elevation. Drought conditions over the past five years have limited snowpack and rainfall, increasing the vulnerability to and frequency of forest fires in these montane regions. In June 2012, the Little Bear fire burned approximately 69 square miles (44,200 acres) in high-elevation forests of the Rio Hondo headwater catchments, south-central New Mexico. Burn severity was high or moderate on 53 percent of the burn area. The Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) is a publically-available watershed model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). PRMS data are spatially distributed using a ‘Geospatial Fabric’ developed at a national scale to define Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs), based on topography and points of interest (such as confluences and streamgages). The Little Bear PRMS study area is comprised of 22 HRUs over a 587 square-mile area contributing to the Rio Hondo above Chavez Canyon streamgage (USGS ID 08390020), in operation from 2008 to 2014. Model input data include spatially-distributed climate data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) DayMet and land cover (such as vegetation and soil properties) data from the USGS Geo Data Portal. Remote sensing of vegetation over time has provided a spatial distribution of recovery and has been applied using dynamic parameters within PRMS on the daily timestep over the study area. Investigation into the source and timing of water budget components in the Rio Hondo watershed may assist water planners and managers in determining how the surface-water and groundwater systems will react to future land use/land cover changes. Further application of PRMS in additional areas will allow for comparison of streamflow before and following wildfire conditions, and may lead to better understanding of the changes in watershed-scale hydrologic processes in the Southwest through post-fire watershed recovery.

            "abstract": "Due to its toxic, explosive, and corrosive nature, inadvertent biological H2S production by sulfate reducing microorganisms (SRM) poses significant health and industrial operational risks. Anthropogenic sources are dominated by the oil industry where H2S in reservoir gases and fluids has an associated annual cost estimated at $90 billion globally. Our previous studies have identified perchlorate (ClO4-) as a selective and potent inhibitor of SRM in pure culture and complex microbial ecosystems. However, constant addition of inhibitors like perchlorate to natural ecosystems may result in a new adaptive selective pressure on SRM populations. With this in mind we investigated the ability of Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20, a model oil reservoir SRM, to adapt to perchlorate and develop a resistance. Serial transfers of three parallel cultures with increasing concentrations of perchlorate up to 100 mM were generated and compared to wild-type strains that were transferred for same number of generations in absence of perchlorate. Genome sequencing revealed that all three adapted strains had single non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the same gene, Dde_2265, the sulfate adenylytransferase (ATP sulfurylase (ATPS)) (EC 2.7.7.4). ATPS catalyzes the first committed step in sulfate reduction and is essential in all SRM. IC50s against growth for these evolved strains demonstrated a three-fold increased resistance to perchlorate compared to wild-type controls. These evolved strains also had ~5x higher transcriptional abundance of Dde_2265 compared to the wild-type strain. Biochemical characterization of the purified ATPS enzyme from both wild-type and the evolved strain showed that the mutant ATPS from the evolved strain was resistant to perchlorate inhibition of ATP turnover with a KI for perchlorate that was ~3x greater relative to the wild-type ATPS. These results demonstrate that a single-base pair mutation in ATPS can have a significant impact on developing resistance to perchlorate and suggest that adaptive evolution is a valuable tool to understand potential responses of microorganism to any environmental perturbations imposed during oil production.",

            "abstract": "The rate of sea level change relative to the land along the West Coast of the U.S. varies over a range of +5 to -2 mm/yr, as observed across the set of long-running tide gauges. We analyze tide gauge data in a network approach that accounts for temporal and spatial correlations in the time series of water levels observed at the stations. This analysis yields a set of rate estimates and realistic uncertainties that are minimally affected by varying durations of observations. The analysis has the greatest impact for tide gauges with short records, as the adjusted rate uncertainties for 2 to 3 decade duration tide gauges approach those estimated from unadjusted century-scale time series. We explore the sources of the wide range of observed relative sea level rates through comparison with: 1) estimated vertical deformation rates derived from repeated leveling and GPS, 2) relative sea level change predicted from models of glacial isostatic adjustment, and 3) geocentric sea level rates estimated from satellite altimetry and century-scale reconstructions. Tectonic deformation is the dominant signal in the relative sea level rates along the Cascadia portion of the coast, and is consistent with along-strike variation in locking behavior on the plate interface. Rates of vertical motion are lower along the transform portion of the plate boundary and include anthropogenic effects, but there are significant tectonic signals, particularly in the western Transverse Ranges of California where the crust is shortening across reverse faults. Preliminary analysis of different strategies of estimating the magnitude of geocentric sea level rise suggest significant discrepancies between approaches. We will examine the implications of these discrepancies for understanding the process of regional geocentric sea level rise in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and associated projected impacts.",

            "abstract": "Video provides a rich source of data for geophysical analysis, often supplying detailed information about the environment when other instruments may not. This is especially true of deep-sea environments, where direct visual observations cannot be made. As computer vision techniques improve and volumes of video data increase, automated video analysis is emerging as a practical alternative to labor-intensive manual analysis. Automated techniques can be much more sensitive to video quality than their manual counterparts, so performing quality assessment before doing full analysis is critical to producing valid results.\nOcean Networks Canada (ONC), an initiative of the University of Victoria, operates cabled ocean observatories that supply continuous power and Internet connectivity to a broad suite of subsea instruments from the coast to the deep sea, including video and still cameras. This network of ocean observatories has produced almost 20,000 hours of video (about 38 hours are recorded each day) and an additional 8,000 hours of logs from remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives.\nWe begin by surveying some ways in which deep-sea video poses challenges for automated analysis, including: 1. Non-uniform lighting: Single, directional, light sources produce uneven luminance distributions and shadows; remotely operated lighting equipment are also susceptible to technical failures. 2. Particulate noise: Turbidity and marine snow are often present in underwater video; particles in the water column can have sharper focus and higher contrast than the objects of interest due to their proximity to the light source and can also influence the camera's autofocus and auto white-balance routines. 3. Color distortion (low contrast): The rate of absorption of light in water varies by wavelength, and is higher overall than in air, altering apparent colors and lowering the contrast of objects at a distance.\nWe also describe measures under development at ONC for detecting and mitigating these effects. These steps include filtering out unusable data, color and luminance balancing, and choosing the most appropriate image descriptors. We apply these techniques to generate automated quality assessment of video data and illustrate their utility with an example application where we perform vision-based substrate classification.",

            "abstract": "Both paleoclimate data and climate model simulations demonstrate that the Indian monsoon system responds to remote coolings in the North Atlantic. The textbook examples are the stadial events associated with the last deglaciation — the Younger Dryas and Heinrich Stadial 1 — when the monsoon weakened dramatically and caused drying throughout the Indian Ocean rim. The mechanism by which the North Atlantic influences the monsoon system is not completely clear: locally cool SSTs, increases in continental albedo, and southward migration of the intertropical convergence zone have all been raised as possibilities.\nHere we synthesize biomarker and foraminiferal estimates of temperature to study the evolution of the Arabian Sea water column during the deglaciation and test hypotheses of monsoon failure during stadials. Alkenone and Mg/Ca data clearly indicate that the Arabian Sea cools during the YD and H1, although H1 cooling is partly obscured by the overall warming trend associated with orbital forcing and rising greenhouse gases. In contrast, TEX86 data record warmings during the YD and H1. The stark difference between the TEX86 response and the alkenone and foraminiferal data, as well as comparison with climate model simulations, indicates that TEX86 is most likely acting as a subsurface temperature proxy in the Arabian Sea over these timescales.\nTaken together, the paleoclimate data describe a pattern of surface cooling and subsurface warming in response to North Atlantic cooling. This oceanographic response is in excellent agreement with both timeslice and transient model simulations spanning the last deglaciation, and strongly supports the hypothesis that locally cool SSTs are a requisite for monsoon failure. Furthermore, subsurface warming causes a destratification of the Arabian Sea water column and provides a mechanism for previously observed reductions in productivity during stadial events.",

Because established SAV oxygenate the rhizosphere of underlying sediments, declines in SAV and increases in sediment organic matter may result in highly reduced conditions in river bottom sediments. These reduced sediments may contain phytotoxic compounds which inhibit the establishment and early growth of SAV. In this study we measured sediment redox potential in three subtropical spring-fed rivers. For each river we compared redox potential in sediments high in organic matter with redox potential in mineral sediments and in sediments underlying SAV beds (n=9). Additionally, we collected plant biomass and sediment samples to investigate relationships between sediment redox potential and its potential drivers. Preliminary results show that sediments underlying SAV beds high in belowground biomass had higher relative redox potential than unvegetated organic and mineral sediments. These results have strong implications for SAV restoration plantings. Reducing conditions in unvegetated sites dominated by filamentous algae may cause widespread plant senescence when sediments are not properly prepared for planting.",

            "abstract": "The growing possibility of inexpensive airborne observations of electric fields using one or more small UAVs increases the importance of understanding what can be determined about cloud electrification and associated electric fields outside cloud boundaries. If important information can be inferred from carefully selected flight paths outside of a cloud, then the aircraft and its instrumentation will be much cheaper to develop and much safer to operate. These facts have led us to revisit this long-standing topic using quasi-static, finite-element modeling inside and outside arbitrarily shaped clouds with a variety of internal charge distributions. In particular, we examine the effect of screening layers on electric fields outside of electrified clouds by comparing modeling results for charged clouds having electrical conductivities that are both equal to and lower than the surrounding clear air. The comparisons indicate that the spatial structure of the electric field is approximately the same regardless of the difference in the conductivities between the cloud and clear air and the formation of a screening layer, even for altitude-dependent electrical conductivities. This result is consistent with the numerical modeling results reported by Driscoll et al [1992]. The similarity of the spatial structure of the electric field outside of clouds with and without a screening layer suggests that “bulk” properties related to cloud electrification might be determined using measurements of the electric field at multiple locations in space outside the cloud, particularly at altitude. Finally, for this somewhat simplified model, the reduction in electric field magnitude outside the cloud due to the presence of a screening layer exhibits a simple dependence on the difference in conductivity between the cloud and clear air. These results are particularly relevant for studying clouds that are not producing lightning, such as developing thunderstorms and decaying anvils associated with mature storm systems.\n\nDriscoll K.T., R.J.

The data structure is sample-centered with a shared registry for assigning unique identifiers to all samples including International Geo-Sample Numbers. Both raw and derived data produced by instruments and post-processing workflows are automatically uploaded to online storage and linked via the unique identifiers.

            "abstract": "The functional importance of low molecular weight organic compounds (LMWOC) is in disproportion to their abundance within soil organic carbon (SOC) pools. They are critical in driving microbial metabolism, though microbial utilization of LMWOC is likely dependent on C chemistry. Studies of C turnover in soils tend to focus in shallower horizons despite that for many ecosystems a substantial fraction of SOC resides below 1 m. In this study, we examined the fate of two important components of soluble SOC, sugars and carboxylic acids, through a soil profile extending to 150 cm. Our objective was to evaluate the turnover of LMWOC under varying physical, biological, and chemical conditions through the soil column. Our study area is part of a soil chronosequence near Santa Cruz, CA. From the side wall of a soil pit we installed intact soil collars and injected 13C-labeled glucose (GLU), 13C-labeled oxalic acid (OA), or deionized water (control) into the A, B (argillic) , and B/C (mottled) horizons at depths of 25, 75, and 125 cm, respectively. We sampled soil gas for 13CO2 intensively at graduated sampling intervals (6 hours to 2 weeks). The entire experiment was also replicated in the laboratory. We measured dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass C (MBC), and calculated total recovery of 13C in atmospheric and soil pools. Measures of DOC indicated a significant priming effect in the deepest (mottled) horizon and an increase in MBC in the argillic and mottled horizons. In all instances residence time was significantly lower for GLU than OA and increased with depth for both substrates. Mass balance calculations from the laboratory component indicated stronger retention for GLU than OA for the upper soils; however, this trend reversed below the argillic horizon. We hypothesize the greater retention of OA in the deepest (mottled) soil horizon may result from enhanced organo-metal complexation (e.g., between OA and dissolved Fe or Al). This hypothesis is consistent with modeled depth profiles of dissolved Al3+, which forms strong aqueous complexes with OA, and may limit the availability of OA at depth compared to shallower soils. Similarly, OA could act to displace native C from mineral surfaces in deep vs. shallow soils, a process, which evidence suggests, could result in a greater priming effect from the turnover of native C.",

            "abstract": "It is currently suggested that climate change on the Tibetan Plateau has influenced alternately by the monsoon and the Westerlies at glacial-interglacial scale to decadal scale. However, the mechanisms driving climate change in the Tibetan Plateau remain unclear, since the extent of individual atmospheric systems has not yet been clearly defined because of the lack of a sufficient number of high quality paleoclimatic records with implicit proxies. This is especially true in the northern Tibetan Plateau where only a few short ice core and paleolimnological records are available. Here we present records of precipitation hydrogen isotopes (δDP) based on compound specific hydrogen isotope ratios of sedimentary leaf waxes at three lakes, Lake Qinghai, Lingge Co and Bangong Co on the northern Tibetan Plateau to investigate how the monsoon and the Westerlies influenced climate change since the Late Pleistocene. The δDP records at Lake Qinghai on the Northeastern TP and Bangong Co at the Northwestern TP show general monsoon influence during the Holocene. The δDP record at Lingge Co in the central northern TP show different patterns, implying that the lake was mostly influenced by the local water vapor recycling or the Westerlies.\nStatistical analysis on modern precipitation isotope data, river water isotope data support that the isotope variability at Lingge Co reflects the Westerlies influence.\nThe δDP records at the three lakes suggest that the Westerlies prevailed in the central North TP, while the monsoon dominated in the eastern and western TP since the Late Pleistocene. More records are required to delineate the extent of the monsoon and the Westerlies on the TP during the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Pulsating aurora normally occurs after a substorm breakup in the midnight sector, often observed to persist through the morning sector and beyond. Indeed, it has also been observed on the dayside; however, the characteristics of the dayside pulsating aurora are poorly known. A handful of observational studies have been reported, but the results are somewhat disputable because most of the studies had non-uniform sampling of the dark dayside region. Furthermore, the previous studies used photometer data, with which the spatial characteristics of the pulsating aurora cannot be examined. To determine both temporal and spatial characteristics of the pulsating aurora, we have studied three years of all-sky image data obtained at the South Pole station. Because of its unique geographical location, the station has 24 hours of darkness during the austral winter from April to August, providing an ideal platform for studying dayside aurora. In a preliminary survey of the data, we have identified the pulsating auroras in 198 days out of 365 days of observations. The magnetic local time (MLT) distribution of the occurrence peaks between 9:00 and 11:00, but shows no or little dependence on the geomagnetic activity. In many events, pulsating patches initially appear as east-west aligned arc segments and later in the afternoon sector develop into large, diffuse patches, which occasionally fill a large part of the field of view. Using the long-term data, we will statistically examine both temporal (occurrence rate, duration and pulsation period) and spatial (sizes and shapes) characteristics of the dayside pulsating aurora.",

            "abstract": "Spatial patterns of coupling on global subduction zones can be used to guide seismic hazard assessment, but estimates of coupling are often constrained using a limited temporal range of geodetic data. Here we analyze 19 years of observations from the GEONET network to assess time-dependent variations in the spatial distribution of coupling on the subduction zones offshore Japan. We divide the position time series into five, 3.75-year epochs each decomposed into best-fit velocity, periodic signals, coseismic offsets, and postseismic effects following five major earthquakes. Nominally interseismic velocities are interpreted in terms of combined tectonic block motions and earthquake cycle activity. Our derived velocity fields reveal significant consistency since 1996 in the spatial distribution of coupling on the Nankai subduction zone, with variation limited primarily to Tokai, where long-term slow slip events have occurred, and persistently coupled regions coincident with areas that slipped in historic great earthquakes, including estimates of the 1707 Hoei earthquake based on tsunami deposits. On the Sagami subduction zone south of Tokyo, we estimate relatively stable coupling through time, though the area of coupling is reduced by the occurrence of a slow-slip event in 2002. On the Japan Trench, we image significant coupling variations owing to effects of the 1994 Sanriku-oki, 2003 Tokachi-oki, and 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquakes. In particular, strong coupling becomes more spatially extensive following the 1994 event until 2011, and a decrease in coupling and occurrence of coseismic-sense slip precede the Tohoku-oki event. Despite occurrence of the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake, coupling offshore Hokkaido suggests ongoing seismic hazard, possibly similar to past Mw 9-class earthquakes interpreted from coastal paleoseismic records. This time-dependent analysis of interseismic deformation illuminates rich diversity in the distribution of subduction zone processes, including spatiotemporal stability in coupling, effective reduction in strongly coupled regions due to aseismic, thrust-sense slip events, and broad changes in the distribution of coupling following major earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Enduring challenges in understanding soil organic matter (SOM) stability and emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from soil stem from complexities of soil processes, many of which occur at micro-scales. The goal of this study is to evaluate the interactive effects soil pore characteristics, soil moisture levels, inherent SOM levels and properties, and substrate quality, on GHGs emission, and accelerated decomposition of native SOM following addition of fresh substrate i.e. priming. Our core hypothesis is that soil pore characteristics play a major role as a mediator in (i) the decomposition of organic matter regardless of its source (i.e. litter vs. native SOM) or substrate quality, as well as in (ii) GHGs emissions. Samples with prevalence of small (<10 µm) vs. large (>30 µm) pores were prepared from soils with similar properties but under long-term contrasting management. The samples were incubated (110 d) at low and optimum soil moisture conditions after addition of high quality (13C-soybean) and low quality (13C-corn) substrate. Headspace gas was analyzed for 13C-CO2 and GHGs on a regularly basis (day 1, 3, 7, 14, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 90, and 110). Selected samples were scanned at the early stage of decomposition (7, 14, 24 d) at 2-6 µm resolutions using X-ray computed µ tomography in order to: (1) quantify soil pore characteristics; (2) visualize and quantify distribution of soil moisture within samples of different pore characteristics; and (3) to visualize and measure losses of decomposing plant residue. Initial findings indicate that, consistent with our hypotheses, pore characteristics influenced GHGs emission, and intensity and pattern of plant residue decomposition. The importance of pores was highly pronounced in presence of added plant residue where greater N2O emission occurred in samples with dominant large pores, in contrast to CO2. Further findings will be discussed upon completion of the study and analysis of the results.",

Geospatial schemes based on topoclimatology were used to scale down the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) temperature forecasts to the local scale (~30 m) across a rural catchment. Local temperatures were estimated at 14 validation sites at 0600 and 1500 LST in 2013/2014 using these schemes and were compared with observations. A substantial reduction in the estimation error was found for both 0600 and 1500 temperatures compared with uncorrected KMA products. Improvement was most remarkable at low lying locations for the 0600 temperature and at the locations on west- and south-facing slopes for the 1500 temperature. Using the downscaled real-time temperature data, a pilot service has started to provide field-specific weather information tailored to meet the requirements of small-scale farms. For example, the service system makes a daily outlook on the phenology of crop species grown in a given field using the field-specific temperature data. When the temperature forecast is given for tomorrow morning, a frost risk index is calculated according to a known phenology–frost injury relationship. If the calculated index is higher than a pre-defined threshold, a warning is issued and delivered to the grower's cellular phone with relevant countermeasures to help protect crops against frost damage. The system was implemented for a topographically complex catchment of 350km2with diverse agricultural activities, and more than 400 volunteer farmers are participating in this pilot service to access user-specific weather information.",

To fully realise the diagnostic potential of these lipids, we must first understand their structural diversity, biological sources, physiological functions, and pathways of preservation.\nParticular environmental conditions likely prompt the production of different membrane lipid structures. Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys host numerous ice-covered lakes with sharp chemical gradients that vary in illumination, geochemical structure, and benthic mat morphologies that are structured by nutrient availability and water chemistry. The lipid contents of these benthic mats have not received extensive study nor have the communities yet been thoroughly characterized. Accordingly, a combination of lipid biomarker and nucleic acid sequence data provides the means of assessing species diversity and environmental controls on the composition and diversity of membrane lipid assemblages.\nWe investigated the richness and diversity of benthic microbial communities and accumulated organic matter in Lake Vanda of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. We have identified diverse glycolipids, aminolipids, and phospholipids in addition to many unknown compounds that may be specific to these particular environments. Light levels fluctuate seasonally, favoring low-light-tolerant cyanobacteria and specific lipid assemblages. Adaptations to nutrient limitations are reflected in contrasting intact polar lipid assemblages. For example, under P-limiting conditions, phospholipids are subsidiary to membrane-forming lipids that do not contain P (i.e. ornithine, betaine, and sulfolipids). The bacteriohopanepolyol (BHP) composition is dominated by bacteriohopanetetrol (BHT), a ubiquitous BHP, and 2-methylhopanoids. The relative abundance of 2-methylhopanoids is unprecedented and may reflect the unusual seasonal light regime of this polar environment. By establishing correlations between environmental conditions, microbial community composition and the lipid assemblages of microbial structures in ice-covered lakes of Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys, our data provides important ecological and evolutionary insights into these unusual environments.",

The seasonally evolving macro and micro spatial variability of transmitted spectral irradiance observed in the Chukchi Sea from May 18 to June 17, 2014 can be primarily attributed to variations in snow depth, ice thickness, and bottom ice algae concentrations. This study characterizes the interactions among these dominant variables using observed optical properties at each sampling site. We employ a normalized difference index to compute estimates of Chlorophyll a concentrations and analyze the increased attenuation of incident irradiance due to absorption by biomass. On a kilometer spatial scale, the presence of bottom ice algae reduced the maximum transmitted irradiance by about 1.5 orders of magnitude when comparing floes of similar snow and ice thicknesses. On a meter spatial scale, the combined effects of disparities in the depth and distribution of the overlying snow cover along with algae concentrations caused maximum transmittances to vary between 0.0577 and 0.282 at a single site. Temporal variability was also observed as the average integrated transmitted photosynthetically active radiation increased by one order of magnitude to 3.4% for the last eight measurement days compared to the first nine. Results provide insight on how interrelated physical and ecological parameters of sea ice in varying time and space may impact new trends in Arctic sea ice extent and the progression of melt.",

Observations of how clouds, their radiative effects, and large-scale dynamics mutually covary on interannual time scales may help gain insight into the nature and mechanisms of that feedback. Using ISCCP cloud and radiation retrievals, we find that in the Southern Hemisphere, poleward shifts of high clouds yield a negative SW CRE. This radiative effect is attributed to increased cloud albedo at the poleward side of the storm track. In the Northern Hemisphere, poleward shifts of high cloud produce a positive SW CRE, attributed to cloud amount decreases at the equatoward side of the oceanic storm tracks.

            "abstract": "Irrigated farms account for 80%-90% of consumptive water use in the United States and $118.5 billion of US agricultural production. Despite the vast water use and high yields of irrigated croplands, agriculture is typically the lowest value sector in a water resources system, and thus the first to face reductions when water becomes scarce. A major challenge for hydrologic and agricultural communities is assessing the effects of climate change on the sustainability of regional water resources and irrigated agriculture. To explore the interface of water and agriculture in California’s Central Valley, the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop model was coupled to the Water Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP) water resources model, deployed over the service area of Yolo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, and forced using both historical and future climate scenarios. This coupling brings water supply constraints to DSSAT and sophisticated agricultural water use, management, and diagnostics to WEAP. Thirty year historical (1980-2009) simulations of WEAP-DSSAT for corn, wheat, and rice were run using a spatially interpolated observational dataset, and contrasted with future simulations using climate scenarios developed by adjusting the spatially interpolated observational dataset with North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program differences between future (2050-2069) and historical (1980-1999) regional climate model simulations of precipitation and temperature. Generally, within the Central Valley temperatures warm by approximately 2°C, precipitation remains constant, and crop water use efficiency increases. On average corn yields decrease, wheat yields increase, and rice yields remain unchanged. Potential adaptations, as well as implications for groundwater pumping, irrigation extent and method, and land use change including fallowing and switching crops, are examined.",

            "abstract": "The concentration and distribution of Cr in the oceans is strongly controlled by its oxidation state. Cr(VI) (as soluble chromate) is the dominant oxidation state in oxygenated seawater. Chromate is typically greater than 70% of total dissolved Cr in the open ocean, consistent with thermodynamic predictions. However, lower than average chromate concentrations in coastal seas and oxygen minimum zones suggest that chromate is being removed in these settings by reduction to Cr(III), which favours particle reactive species. Cr is an element whose isotopes are fractionated by redox changes. Reduction of Cr(VI) causes light isotopes of Cr to be enriched in the product Cr(III). Accordingly, any local-scale increase in reductive Cr removal fluxes will cause the seawater Cr concentration to decrease and the δ53Cr value to increase. A recent study of Cr isotopes in the oceans1 supports this prediction. Cr isotopes show a range of δ53Cr values correlating inversely with Cr concentration. The fractionation factor deduced from this correlation is –0.80 ±0.03 ‰ (2s) on a global scale. The difference in solubility of oxidized and reduced Cr in seawater, and the isotopic fractionation between them, is the basis on which the Cr isotope proxy may be used for tracing ocean deoxygenation events in the geological past. More specifically, changes in the size of the chromate inventory of seawater, both locally and globally, should be traceable from reconstructions of seawater-derived Cr isotope variations in marine sedimentary successions. Geological records of Cr isotope changes in the oceans during past deoxygenation events may be used to gauge the impact of global warming on future deoxygenation of the oceans, particularly if proxy records of temperature and ocean pH are also reconstructed. However, study of the modern ocean Cr cycle is still in its early stages, and important knowledge gaps need to be filled going forward. In this talk, we present results of our seawater Cr isotope investigations in the modern ocean, and address the implications for the Cr isotope proxy.\n1Scheiderich et al. (2015) EPSL 423, 87-97.",

            "abstract": "Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) uses two or more SAR images over the same area to determine landscape topography or ground deformation. An interferogram, generated by the phase components of two coherent SAR images, depicts range changes between the radar and the ground resolution elements, and can be used to derive both landscape topography and subtle changes in surface elevation. However, spaceborne repeat-pass interferometry has two main drawbacks: effects due to differences in atmospheric temperature, pressure, and water vapour at two observation times, and loss of coherence due to long spatial and temporal baselines between observations. Airborne repeat-pass interferometry does not suffer from these drawbacks. The atmospheric effect in case of airborne DInSAR becomes negligible due to smaller swath coverage, and the coherence can be maintained by using smaller spatial and temporal baselines. However, the main technical limitation concerning airborne DInSAR is the need of precise motion compensation with an accurate navigation system to correct for the significant phase errors due to typical flight instability from air turbulence.\nHere, we present results from a pilot study conducted on July 2015 using both X-band and L-band SlimSAR airborne system over the Slumgullion landslide in Colorado in order to (1) acquire the differential interferograms from the airborne platform, (2) understand their source of errors, and (3) pave a way to improve the precision of the derived surface deformation. The landslide movement estimated from airborne DInSAR is also compared with coincident GPS, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), airborne LiDAR, and spaceborne DInSAR measurements using COSMO-SkyMed images. The airborne DInSAR system has a potential to provide time-transient variability in land surface topography with high-precision and high-resolution, and provide researchers with greater flexibility in selecting the temporal and spatial baselines of the data sets. Furthermore, it is expected that the airborne DInSAR system will greatly expand the number of academic researchers that will have access to the observational data they need to better characterize, quantify, and understand the behaviour of many natural hazards.",

The National Phenology Database (NPDb) maintained by USA-NPN contains almost 6 million in-situ observation records for plants and animals for the period 1954-2015. These data have been used in a number of science, conservation and natural resource management applications, including national assessments of historical and potential future trends in phenology and regional assessments of spatio-temporal variation in organismal activity. Customizable downloads of raw or summarized data, freely available from www.usanpn.org, are accompanied by metadata, data-use and data-attribution policies, published protocols, version/change control, documentation of QA/QC, and links to publications that use historical or contemporary data held in the NPDb. The National Coordinating Office of USA-NPN is developing a suite of standard data products (e.g., quality-controlled raw or summarized status data) and tools (e.g., a new visualization tool released in 2015) to facilitate use and application by a diverse set of data users. This presentation outlines a workflow for the development and validation of spatially gridded phenology products, drawing on recent work related to the Spring Indices now included in two national Indicator systems. In addition, we discuss how we engage observers to collect in-situ data to validate model predictions. Preliminary analyses indicate high fidelity between historical in-situ and modeled observations on a national scale, but with considerable variability at the regional scale. Regions with strong differences between expected and observed data are identified and will be the focus of in-situ data collection campaigns using USA-NPN’s Nature’s Notebook on-line user interface (www.nn.usanpn.org).",

            "abstract": "Los Frailes submarine canyon is located at the south boundary of the Cabo Pulmo National Marine Park on the southeast tip of the Baja California Peninsula. During the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) 2015 Gulf of California expedition we used an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to map this canyon from 50 m to 450 m depths, and then explored the canyon with a small remotely operated vehicle (ROV). This three day R/V Rachel Carson cruise was a collaboration with the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Centro para la Biodiversidad Marina y la Conservación in La Paz.\nThe MBARI AUV D. Allan B. collected high resolution bathymetry, sidescan, and subbottom profiles of Los Frailes submarine canyon and part of the north Cabo Pulmo deep reef. In order to safely generate a 1-m lateral resolution multibeam bathymetry map in the nearshore high relief terrain, the mapping operations consisted of an initial short survey following the 100-m isobath followed by a series of short, incremental AUV missions located on the deep edge of the new AUV bathymetry.\nThe MBARI Mini-ROV was used to explore the submarine canyon within the detailed map created by the MBARI AUV. The Mini-ROV is a 1.2-m-long, 350 kg, 1,500-m-depth-rated ROV designed and constructed by MBARI. It is controlled by six 600-watt thrusters and is equipped with a high-definition video camera and navigation sensors. This small ROV carries less accurate, lower cost navigation sensors than larger vehicles. We implemented new algorithms to localize combining Doppler velocity log sensor data and low-cost MEMS-based inertial sensor data with sporadic ultra-short baseline position measurements to provide a high accuracy position estimation. The navigation performance allowed us to colocate the ROV video imagery with the 1-m resolution bathymetric map of the submarine canyon.\nUpper Los Frailes Canyon is rugged and, aside from small sand pockets along the thalweg, largely bare of sediment. ROV video indicates the north wall is composed of granitic rock similar to outcrops on shore. Few fish or other animals are observed below 100 m depth, but considerable diversity exists along the canyon walls above 100 m depth. These observations are consistent with a pronounced oxygen minimum zone present below about 100 m depth.",

            "abstract": "Under mid-crustal conditions, faults commonly are associated with distributed inelastic deformation (i.e., ductile fabrics). The effect of such inelastic deformation on fault slip profiles and fault interaction remains poorly understood, though it likely plays a significant role in the earthquake cycle. We have investigated meter-scale strike-slip faults exhumed from ~10 km depth in the Lake Edison granodiorite (Sierra Nevada, CA). These faults are characterized by slip-to-length ratios and slip gradients near fault tips that greatly exceed what is measured for faults in the brittle upper crust, or produced by linear elastic models. Using Abaqus, we construct elastoplastic finite element models to evaluate the impact of off-fault plasticity on the resulting slip profiles for both continuous and discontinuous faults. Elastoplastic models show that plastic strain near fault tips effectively lengthens faults, allowing for greater overall slip and increased slip gradients near fault tips. In the field, regions adjacent to fault tips contain mylonitized granodiorite and ductilely sheared dikes and schlieren, consistent with the model results. In addition, distributed plastic strain facilitates slip transfer between echelon fault segments, particularly for contractional step geometries. Relative to an isolated fault, fault segments adjacent to contractional steps are asymmetric, with the maximum slip shifted in the direction of the step. Immediately adjacent to the contractional step, fault slip is significantly reduced because shear offset is accommodated by distributed plastic shearing within the step, rather than by discrete slip on the faults. Although slip is locally reduced on each fault segment directly adjacent to a contractional step, overall slip transfer between discontinuous fault segments is most efficient for this step geometry. That is, faults segmented by contractional steps produce greater maximum slip than do those separated by extensional steps (assuming no opening fractures) under mid-crustal conditions.",

            "abstract": "Clumped isotope paleothermometry on carbonate minerals has emerged as a leading tool in paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry studies. The utility of Δ47 measurements is especially pronounced when estimating formation temperature of carbonates that precipitated from solutions with unknown water oxygen isotope composition. However, the interpretation of Δ47 values has been hindered by discrepancies among the many published thermometric calibrations. As the number of calibrations grows, it now appears that the slope of the Δ47 vs. inverse temperature relationship clusters into two distinct groupings based on whether the carbonate minerals were digested at low temperature (25°C) vs. high temperature (generally 70 - 90°C).\nWe model the effect that small amounts of oxygen exchange between CO2 liberated to the phosphoric acid solution and trace water in that solution can have on measured Δ47. This can occur with very little shift in δ47 and δ18O of the CO2. The extent and effect of oxygen exchange following CaCO3 dissolution is a complex function of the phosphoric acid’s temperature, water content, and viscosity. Conventional approaches to preparation of phosphoric acid (targeting a defined density range at room temperature) are likely inadequate for resolving the details of these dependencies. This stems in part from changes that can occur to the water content and density of phosphoric acid during heating of the acid under vacuum. Secondary effects may also arise that relate to the grain and crystallite size of the carbonate minerals, intercalation of carbonate minerals with siliciclastic matrix in sediments or paleosols, and possibly the reactivity of hydrous components of a siliciclastic rich sample.",

            "abstract": "The terrestrial biosphere is currently absorbing about a quarter of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions, thus acting as a carbon sink. The fate of this sink in the coming decades is, however, subject to large uncertainties, as current Earth System Models (ESMs) simulate diverging responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle to upcoming climate change. Here, we use observation-based constraints of water and carbon fluxes to reduce uncertainties in the projected carbon cycle response derived from simulations of ESMs conducted as part of the 5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We find in the ESMs a clear linear relationship between present-day Evapotranspiration (ET) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), as well as between these present-day fluxes and projected changes in GPP thus providing an emergent constraint on projected GPP. Constraining the ESMs on their ability to simulate present-day ET and GPP leads to a substantial decrease of the projected GPP and to a 50% reduction of the associated model spread in GPP by the end of the century. Given the strong correlation between projected changes in GPP and in NBP in the ESMs, applying the constraints on Net Biome Productivity (NBP) reduces the model spread in the projected land sink by more than 30% by 2100. Moreover, the projected decline in the land sink is at least doubled in the constrained ensembles and the probability that the terrestrial biosphere is turned into a net carbon source by the end of the century is dramatically increased. This finding indicates that the decline in the future land carbon uptake might be stronger than previously thought, which would have important implications for the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration and future climate change. Similar emergent constraints on the sensitivity of global land carbon storage to climate warming will also be discussed.",

When Hurricane Sandy struck, we were in an ideal position, making flood forecasts and communicating NOAA forecasts to the public with dozens of media placements, translating the poorly understood flood forecasts into human dimensions. In 2013 and 2015, by request of New York City (NYC), we worked through the NYC Panel on Climate Change to deliver updated climate risk assessment reports, to be used in the post‐Sandy rebuilding and resiliency efforts. These utilized innovative methodologies for probabilistic local and regional sea level change projections, and contrasted methods of dynamic versus (the more common) static flood mapping. We participated in a federal-academic partnership that developed a Sea Level Tool for Sandy Recovery that integrates CCRUN sea level rise projections with policy‐relevant FEMA flood maps, and now several updated flood maps and coastal flood mapping tools (NOAA, FEMA, and USACE) incorporate our projections.\nFor the adaptation response, we helped develop NYC’s $20 billion flood adaptation plan, and we were on a winning team under the Housing and Urban Development Rebuild By Design (RBD) competition, a few of the many opportunities that arose with negligible additional funding and which CCRUN funds supported. Our work at times disrupted standard lines of thinking, but NYC showed an openness to altering course. In one case we showed that an NYC plan of wetland restoration in Jamaica Bay would provide no reduction in flooding unless deep-dredged channels circumventing them were shallowed or narrowed. In another, the lead author’s RBD team challenged the notion at one location that levees were the solution to accelerating sea level rise, developing a plan to use ecological breakwaters and layered components of physical and social resilience. CCRUN has succeeded in winning another five years of RISA funding, and this will enable us to continue our climate risk and adaptation work for the entire Urban Northeast.",

Quantification of surface water storage and river-floodplain exchanges in different regions of the basin is needed to understand important ecological and biogeochemical processes on large basins as the Amazon. And large scale hydrology-hydraulic models can provide the technical basis to answer such questions. In order to investigate the hydrological pathways, water sources and in-stream travel time in drainage basins, we developed a probabilistic hydrological particle-tracking model. This model considers water volumes generation and tracking along river networks using probabilities based on water storage and discharges obtained by hydrologic-hydraulic models. In this study, we coupled the tracking method with the MGB-IPH large-scale hydrological simulation of the Amazon River Basin. The particle-tracking approach captures the large scale basin in-stream water dynamics and provides information on river and floodplain flow variability along the basin. The method is used to study (i) volumes and sources of water flowing through Amazon floodplains and (ii) evaluate in‑stream travel time distribution of both river and floodplain waters.",

            "abstract": "The satellite Io which has many active volcanos supplies volcanic gases to the Jovian magnetosphere with typical rate of 1 ton/sec and has been known be a primary source of plasmas in the magnetosphere. Change in the volcanic activity on Io should cause change of the supply rate and could affect structure of the magnetosphere and dynamics occurs in it. However, responses of the magnetosphere to the volcanic activity is still not fully understood; one of the reasons is lack of continuous and long term observations of Io' volcanic gas extended around Io, plasmas in the Io torus, and activity of the magnetosphere. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectroscope, EXCEED, onboard the HISAKI satellite has capability to measure ion and atomic emission lines in EUV range (55-145nm) and is dedicated to observing solar system planets. The satellite has been successfully launched on Sep. 2013 and 2nd campaign of Io plasma torus and Jovian northern EUV aurora observation has been done from the end of Nov. 2014 to middle of May 2015. On middle of Jan. 2015, HISAKI detected gradual increase in intensity of S+ emission lines and decrease of S3+ ones in the plasma torus. The S+ intensity showed a maximum around the end of Feb. and S++ and S3+ intensities also showed maxima subsequently. Simultaneous ground based observation of the sodium nebula showed increase of the emission intensity from the middle of Jan. to the beginning of Mar. These observations suggest that the volcanic activity began at the middle of Jan. and increase neutral atom and ion densities in the Io torus. The intensities of S+ and S2+ ions returned to the pre-increase level by the middle of May 2015. S3+ had still been in the decay phase at the end of the observation. Change in radial structure of the plasma torus was also found during the volcanic event. The intensity of S+ ion began to increase around the orbit of Io (6 Jovian radii). The brightened region propagated outward and reached at 8.5 Jovian radii from Jupiter at the beginning of Feb. Outward transport speed of ion is simply estimated to be 140m/sec. Further one month later, HISAKI found unusual activity of Jovian EUV aurora intensity. It began at the beginning of Mar. and continued for 1 month. The aurora activity may be caused by the enhanced loading of heavy ion plasma into the middle magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Taiwan orogenic belt is often treated as a steady, southward propagating orogenic system with an erosion rate of 4–6 mm/yr for 5 My. A few recent studies of the exhumation history, however, suggest that the collision was initially simultaneous and that exhumation rates changed through time. To test this hypothesis, we constructed four new age-elevation curves that span the length of the orogen from the Central Cross-Island Hwy (CXIH) in northern Taiwan to Small Ghost Lake (XGH) in the south. The age-elevation curves are based on 10 new zircon (U-Th)/He (ZrnHe), 10 new zircon fission track (ZrnFT) ages and 82 previously published ZrnFT and ZrnHe dates. Samples used for each age-elevation analysis extended map distances, ranging from 11 to 17 km for ZrnHe and 11 to 27 Km for ZrnFT to limit the influence of topography on estimated uplift rates. Three of the sites, CXIH, XGH and the South Cross-Island Hwy, are from the eastern Central Range whereas the fourth, Mt Yu, is from western Central Range.\nThe results show that all four sites record similar exhumation histories from about 5 Ma to the present, except for a slight difference at Mt Yu. For example, the three eastern sites record an apparent increase in exhumation rate from < 1.2 mm/yr. to ~ 3-5 mm/yr. at about 1.5 Ma. At Mt. Yu, however, a similar increase in the rate of exhumation occurs at about 2 Ma. In addition, the zero-age intercepts of the youngest phase of uplift from the three eastern sites suggest the possibility of an additional increase in exhumation rate after ~0.4 Ma that is not recorded at Mt. Yu. Interestingly, Mt Yu is also mapped as a continuation of the Eocene rocks exposed in the Hsüehshan Range rather than part of the Central Range, consistent with the presence of a major structural boundary between Mt Yu and the three areas to the east.\nThese data suggest the following conclusions: 1) the Hsüehshan and Central Ranges appear to have different exhumation histories; 2) the eastern Central Range appears to have experienced two stages of accelerated exhumation cooling – the first at about 1.5 Ma and the second at about 0.4 Ma and 3) changes in exhumation cooling through time appear to have been simultaneous along strike.",

            "abstract": "Failure of magmatic reservoirs and propagation of magmas is controlled in part by the state of stress within the lithosphere. Such stresses are induced by a range of loadings (e.g., gravitational and magmatic). Additional stresses can be introduced by flexural deformation of the lithosphere due to a large volcanic edifice or mantle plume loading, or as a consequence of the regional tectonic environment. Rifting environments, for instance are the results of extensional stresses at the surface of planets (e.g., Devana Chasma on Venus). The resulting stress field may influence the failure of a magmatic reservoir and the propagation of magmas.\nTo explore this scenario, we created 3D elastic models of the Venusian lithosphere using COMSOL Multiphysics, in which an extensional stress was applied. The stress state was implemented through horizontal deformation created by orthogonal contraction and extension on the outer boundaries of the quarter symmetry model. A spherical reservoir is embedded within the lithosphere to represent a magma chamber. In these models, we analyzed magma reservoir stability at different depths, the amount of overpressure needed to reach failure, and the type of resulting intrusions within the 3D model for three distinct environments: 1- lithostatic; 2- upward flexure due to a rising mantle plume; and 3- downward flexure due to a basaltic shield volcano.\nPreliminary results show that as the extensional stress increases: magmatic reservoirs become unstable at shallow depth and the amount of overpressure needed to reach failure decreases. In addition, the failure location along the reservoir flank rotates to parallel the horizontal contraction, which favors the formation of lateral dikes along the magma reservoir flanks over vertical dikes at the summit.",

            "abstract": "Over the past two decades, a large number of rainfall products have been developed based on satellite, radar, and/or rain gauge observations. However, to produce optimal rainfall estimation for a given region is still challenging due to the space time variability of rainfall at many scales and the spatial and temporal sampling difference of different rainfall instruments. In order to produce high-resolution rainfall products for urban flash flood applications and improve the weather sensing capability in urban environment, the center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA), in collaboration with National Weather Service (NWS) and North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), has developed an urban radar remote sensing network in DFW Metroplex. DFW is the largest inland metropolitan area in the U.S., that experiences a wide range of natural weather hazards such as flash flood and hailstorms. The DFW urban remote sensing network, centered by the deployment of eight dual-polarization X-band radars and a NWS WSR-88DP radar, is expected to provide impacts-based warning and forecasts for benefit of the public safety and economy.\nHigh-resolution quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) is one of the major goals of the development of this urban test bed. In addition to ground radar-based rainfall estimation, satellite-based rainfall products for this area are also of interest for this study. Typical example is the rainfall rate product produced by the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) onboard Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory satellite. Therefore, cross-comparison between ground and space-based rainfall estimation is critical to building an optimal regional rainfall system, which can take advantages of the sampling differences of different sensors.\nThis paper presents the real-time high-resolution QPE system developed for DFW urban radar network, which is based upon the combination of S-band WSR-88DP and X-band CASA radars. In addition, we focuses on the cross-comparison between rainfall estimation from this ground based QPE system and GPM rainfall products. The observations collected during the GPM satellite overpasses over DFW area will be used extensively in this study. Data alignment for better comparison will also be presented.",

This project attempts to demonstrate whether an alternate method to wind calibration flights can be implemented using data collected from many previous hurricane, winter storm, and surveying flights. Wind derivations require using airplane attack and slip angles, airplane pitch, pressure differentials, dynamic pressures, ground speeds, true air speeds, and several other variables measured by instruments on the aircraft. Through the use of linear regression models, future wind measurements may be fit to past statistical models. This method of wind calibration could replace the need for annual wind calibration flights, decreasing NOAA expenses and providing more accurate data. This would help to ensure all data users have reliable data and ultimately contribute to NOAA’s goal of building of a Weather Ready Nation.",

            "abstract": "Current understanding of ice sheet grounding zone dynamics is limited because direct observation of grounding zones and their deposits (grounding zone wedges, GZW) is restricted to marine geophysical methods, which provide large-scale measurements of planform morphology and internal stratigraphy, but little information regarding sedimentary architecture. Seismic data nevertheless reveal that GZW range meters to kilometers in length scale and typically possess foresets and incised channels. Sediment cores from measured wedges are helpful for evaluating vertical changes in stratigraphy, but leave significant uncertainty regarding the spatial variability of deposits and the nature of their contacts, which are necessary data to evaluate sedimentary processes operating within grounding zones. This study presents results from outcrop studies of GZW exposed in sea cliffs of the Puget Sound, Washington (U.S.A.), where a series of back-stepping GZW record rapid grounding line retreat of the Puget Lobe. These outcrops are used to evaluate first-order physical controls on depositional processes. The data are compared to geophysical observations and cores collected from the Ross Sea, Antarctic, to evaluate similarities between the outcrop-scale deposits and polar grounding zone wedges that possess wavelengths measuring several kilometers, and amplitudes of tens of meters. The preliminary results show that for these larger features, wedge progradation is facilitated by foreset deposition. Alternatively, for small-scale wedges (100’s of m wavelength, m-scale amplitudes), wedge development occurs through topset aggradation. Additionally, based on the Puget Sound GZW deposits, progradation arises due to sediment gravity flows on the foreset. Sand and silt couplets, preserved within wedge foresets, suggest that tidal pumping occurred under ice, producing deposits between punctuated sediment gravity flows. These data show a multitude of sedimentary and morphological scales that are required to further elucidate physical processes that lend to the development of GZW.",

Two quantile mapping downscaling methods were applied to both GCMs to obtain local scale projections. The downscaled outputs were applied to a GDD formula to show the GDD changes between the historical period (1961–2004) and the future period (2006–2098) in terms of mean differences. The results show that at the end of the 2098 growing season, the increase in GDD is expected to be between -2.0 and 6.

To elucidate the impacts of forest and agricultural land use on stream DOC during storm events, we investigated concentrations, optical properties, δ13C, and Δ 14C of DOC in forest and agriculture dominated headwater streams in South Korea. Stream DOC concentrations were the highest in a forested subwatershed, and a significant positive correlation was observed between stream DOC concentrations and the proportion of forested area in watersheds, which was strengthened by increased rain intensity. Four PARAFAC components were extracted including terrestrial humic substances, terrestrial fulvic acids, microbial organic matter, and protein-like organic matter, all of which showed a positive correlation with stream DOC concentration although relative proportion of components were dependent on land use. While DOC in a forest stream was mostly composed of terrestrially derived and 14C-enriched, DOC in an agricultural stream included aged DOC up to ~1,000 years old. Although the impacts of hydrological changes due to irrigation, fertilizer use, and selected crop species were not examined, the results of this study suggest that agricultural land use can be a source of aged terrestrial DOC to streams during summer monsoon storms, potentially changing the balance of the regional carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - SL_AGU2015_Poster_r7-lores.pdf\nThe size distribution of sediments produced on hillslopes and supplied to channels depends on the geomorphic processes that weather, detach and transport rock fragments down slopes. Little in the way of theory or data is available to predict patterns in hillslope size distributions at the catchment scale from topographic and geologic maps. To address this knowledge gap, we map the steep granitic catchment of Inyo Creek, eastern Sierra Nevada, California and categorize geomorphic landscape units (GLUs) by overlaying basic GIS attributes to create polygons of similar inferred sediment production process regimes. Key attributes include elevation, slope, aspect, and land cover, which varies across 2 km of relief from bare bedrock cliffs at higher elevations to vegetated, regolith-covered slopes at lower elevations. We expect that factors that influence temperature and water residence time, and thus the intensity of chemical versus mechanical weathering, will correlate with resulting hillslope sediment size. For example, GLUs constructed from binned combinations of slope, elevation and aspect were used to predict three categories of sediment size on an ordinal scale. We used a map of predicted sediment size to guide field measurements, using point counts and photogrammetry to quantify hillslope surface size distributions. Areas predicted to have relatively large sediments were primarily covered in boulders and cobble-sized particles, whereas areas predicted to have small sediments were primarily covered in scree and gruss. Although hillslope sediment size at Inyo Creek correlates strongly with elevation, incorporation of slope and aspect creates a significantly better predictive model. We combine this result with supervised classification of aerial images using eCognition to estimate that more than half the catchment area produces boulder and cobble-rich sediment. Further analysis will include characterizing the local contributing areas to each field sampling point to account for sediment production on bare bedrock surfaces upslope. We are also exploring whether other landscape attributes, such as hillslope curvature, as well as estimates of spatial variation in erosion rate, can be used in refining catchment-wide predictions of hillslope sediment size.",

            "abstract": "By investigating the footprints of typhoons on seismic records, we can understand their contributions to seismic noises as well as to small-scale coupling mechanisms of typhoon-land and typhoon–ocean–land. We analyze the signatures of typhoon KAI-TAK and BOPHA using seismic data from the ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs) deployed in the central basin of South China Sea by Tongji University in 2012 as well as seismic stations (IC.QIZ,HK.HKPS and RM.SZP) on lands.Our preliminary results show that typhoons mainly enhance microseisms at the frequency band of ~0.1–0.5 Hz, including both long period double frequency (LPDF) and short period double frequency (SPDF) microseisms. A positive correlation observed between the amplitude of microseisms and the height of local ocean waves. Because OBSs are deployed at the bottom of ocean, single frequency (SF) microseisms are not prominent on them due to their fast attenuation with depth. During the typhoon KAI-TAK, the increase of LPDF energy is very small in OBSs while that is very high on land stations, indicating that LPDF microseisms are generated at nearby shorelines and can propagate towards the sea through the solid earth. However, the increase of SPDF energy is almost the same level for both OBSs and land stations indicating that the generation of SPDF is probably local.However, we also observe a small amount of energy arrives before the increases of the wave heights at the land station HK.HKPS. We derive that this energy may from a source that is not local: while LPDF can be generated at nearby shorelines and SPDF can be generated everywhere locally, they can both transmit through the solid part of the Earth to a station some distance away, i.e. HK.HKPS. In addition, we find that typhoons enhance not only the microseisms as expected but also the seismic energy from higher frequency bands. The spectrum amplitude during Typhoon periods, normalized by that of no-storm periods, shows that land stations produce stronger higher frequency seismic waves than OBSs.This may reflect a difference of coupling mechanisms between typhoon-land and typhoon–ocean–land, which we are further investigating.",

            "abstract": "Extracellular enzymes are the proximate agents for organic matter degradation, but the turnover rate of enzymes is often assumed in most decomposition models without direct observations. Here, we assess turnover rates of C (ß-D-glucosidase), N (Leucine aminopeptidase), and P (Phosphomonoesterase) degrading enzymes by spiking commercially available enzymes to the dissolved organic matter of two subtropical peats incubated at 15°C and 25°C and monitoring of net activity of spiked enzymes (i.e. the difference between the spiked and the non-spiked samples) over time. Turnover rates of all three enzymes were greater in the samples incubated at 25°C (ranged between 0.006 hr-1 to 0.014 hr-1) as compared to those incubated at 15°C (ranged between 0.002 hr-1 to 0.009 hr-1). Concentrations of dissolved organic matter were positively correlated with the turnover rates (R2 ranged between 0.71-0.77) of all enzyme groups. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to evaluate the turnover rates of enzymes in wetland soils as a function of warming and dissolved organic matter concentration. The findings suggest that warming-induced changes in the size of soil enzyme pool due to direct (by increasing protease activity) and indirect (by increasing concentrations of dissolved organic matter) effects on their turnover rates has potential to alter soil C stocks in a warmer world.",

            "abstract": "A central problem for micrometeorologists has been the relationship of air-surface exchange rates of momentum and heat to quantities that can be predicted with confidence. The flux-gradient profile developed through Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) provides an integration of the dimensionless wind shear expression where is an empirically derived expression for stable and unstable atmospheric conditions. Empirically derived expressions are far from universally accepted (Garratt, 1992, Table A5). Regardless of what form of these relationships might be used, their significance over any short period of time is questionable since all of these relationships between fluxes and gradients apply to averages that might rarely occur. It is well accepted that the assumption of stationarity and homogeneity do not reflect the true chaotic nature of the processes that control the variables considered in these relationships, with the net consequence that the levels of predictability theoretically attainable might never be realized in practice. This matter is of direct relevance to modern prognostic models which construct forecasts by assuming the universal applicability of relationships among averages for the lower atmosphere, which rarely maintains an average state.\nUnder a Cooperative research and Development Agreement between NOAA and Duke Energy Generation, NOAA/ATDD conducted atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) research using Duke renewable energy sites as research testbeds. One aspect of this research has been the evaluation of legacy flux-gradient formulations (the ϕ functions, see Monin and Obukhov, 1954) for the exchange of heat and momentum. At the Duke Energy Ocotillo site, NOAA/ATDD installed sonic anemometers reporting wind and temperature fluctuations at 10Hz at eight elevations. From these observations, ϕM and ϕH were derived from a two-year database of mean and turbulent wind and temperature observations. From this extensive measurement database, using a methodology proposed by Kanenasu, Wesely and Hicks (1979), the overall dependence of ϕM and ϕH on is characterized. Results indicate considerable scatter with the familiar relationships, such as Paulson (1970), best describing the averages; however it is the scatter that largely defines the attainable levels of predictability.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimates in time and space of organic carbon export to the ocean interior via plankton net community production (NCP) for the global oceans (the biological pump) are essential for understanding the feedback between NCP, atmospheric CO2 and climate. Since integrated, multi-sensor satellite and in situ observations of many ocean variables are required to estimate NCP from space, this is a complex, interdisciplinary challenge. Satellite ocean color sensors are a fundamental component in estimating spatial and temporal variations in NCP. Therefore, NASA’s PACE mission (NASA-PACE 2012), a mission included in NASA’s Climate Architecture Plan (NASA-CAP, 2010), specifies a need for field programs to improve satellite algorithms and models to reduce uncertainties in estimates of NCP. Diverse data from sediment and glacial cores, and climate models, indicate that the Southern Ocean plays a large role in the glacial-interglacial variations in the biological pump, with considerable implications for variations in atmospheric CO2. The “Interdisciplinary Coordinated Experiment of the Southern Ocean Carbon Cycle (ICESOCC)” project is a NASA-funded field campaign scoping (planning) effort. Over 18 months and many public meetings and workshops, the ICESOCC team of 13 interdisciplinary scientists has integrated the input from scientific experts in ocean, atmosphere, ice physics, biogeochemistry, advanced observational tools (ship, autonomous, atmospheric gases and dust, cryosphere dynamics, winds), and models, to create a draft recommendation to NASA for field observations required to constrain uncertainty of NCP for the Southern Ocean. The ICESOCC team requests and encourages careful review and comments of the draft to ensure the most robust final recommendations are submitted in early 2016 for NASA consideration.",

            "abstract": " Ice cores from Antarctica have revealed that atmospheric CO2 concentration is strongly linked with climate over the past hundreds of thousands years. During the last glacial termination CO2 concentration increased by ~80 ppm and the increase rate changed with abrupt climate events such as Bølling-Allerød and Younger Dryas. Precise and high-resolution CO2 records during the events may help us better understand climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. However, most of the existing ice core records are severely smoothed by gradual bubble close-off and gas diffusion in the firn layer. Recently, a CO2 record with an unprecedented temporal resolution was obtained from West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core, where glaciological conditions permit a relatively small gas smoothing effect. The WAIS Divide record shows three abrupt CO2 increases of 10-15 ppm in less than 200 years during the last glacial termination. The ancient air extracted from the WAIS Divide ice core was in a form of air hydrates and the results must yet be confirmed with other ice cores. Here we present a new high-resolution atmospheric CO2 record from the Siple Dome ice core, in which air is preserved only in bubbles. Our data cover 11.0-21.0 ka with an average time resolution of 65 yrs. The Siple Dome records show that abrupt CO2 increases of ~ 10 ppm within 100-200 years at 11.7, 14.7, and 16.3 ka, confirming the rapid CO2 increases observed in the WAIS Divide record. We are analyzing the common and uncommon features during the three rapid CO2 increases in order to decipher the control mechanisms. The updated results will be presented at the meeting.",

Using a split validation, the final results show reasonable skill in predicting the inflow terciles (0-25, 25-75, and 75 – 100 percentile) for key periods identified by dam managers. A Heidke skill score of 0.35 (0 no skill and 1 perfect skill) was found for the forecast for total June-September inflow based on February-April sea surface temperatures and 0.36 for total September-December inflows based on May-July SSTs.

            "abstract": "The Amazon River basin is the largest watershed in the world containing thousands of tributaries. Although the mainstream and its larger tributaries have been the focus on much research, there has been few studies focused on the hydrodynamics of smaller rivers in the foothills of the Andes Mountains. These smaller rivers are of particular importance for the fishery industry because fish migrate up these headwater rivers to spawn. During the rainy season, fish wait for storm event to increase water depths to a sufficient level for their passage. Understanding how streamflow dynamics will change in response to future conditions is vital for the sustainable management of the fishery industry.\nIn this paper, we focus on improving the accuracy of river discharge estimates on relatively small-scale sub-catchments (100 ~ 40,000 km2) in the headwaters of the Amazon River basin. The Hillslope River Routing (HRR) hydrologic model and remotely sensed datasets are used. We provide annual runoff, seasonal patterns, and daily discharge characteristics for 81 known migration reaches. The model is calibrated for the period 2000-2014 and climate forecasts for the period 2070-2100 are used to assess future changes in streamflow dynamics. The forecasts for the 2070 to 2100 period were obtained by selecting 5 climate models from IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) based on their ability to represent the main aspects of recent (1970 to 2000) Amazon climate.\nThe river network for the HRR model is developing using surface topography based on the SRTM digital elevation model. Key model forcings include precipitation (TRMM 3B42) and evapotranspiration (MODIS ET, MOD16). Model parameters for soil depth, hydraulic conductivity, runoff coefficients and lateral routing were initially approximated based on literature values and adjusted during calibration. Measurements from stream gauges located near the reaches of interest were used for calibration. Model calibration results and simulated changes in future streamflow dynamics for the 81 river reaches are presented.",

            "abstract": "We present a new analysis of Galileo plasma observations in the vicinity of Europa’s orbit. We estimated plasma densities and temperatures from the Plasma Wave Spectrometer and Plasma Spectrometer instruments. Both density and temperature show extreme fluctuations. As expected some of this results from Europa's varying distance from the centrifugal equator, but most of the variability is random. An anti-correlation in ion density and temperature suggests that these fluctuations are due to flux tube interchange—cold and dense plasma traveling outward from the Io plasma torus interchanging with hot and tenuous plasma traveling inward from the outer magnetosphere. The unusually large plasma density observed during Galileo’s E12 Europa encounter falls onto this temperature/density regression, suggesting that Galileo observed a cold flux tube traveling outward from the Io plasma torus. We also find that the plasma is significantly denser than generally appreciated, with a median electron density of ~160 cm-3. These new results have important implications for models of Europa’s interaction with the jovian magnetosphere. Many models assume a much lower plasma density, and telescopic observations have been interpreted using these low values. These much higher densities suggest, e.g., much larger charge exchange rates, a process that is often ignored at Europa. Assumptions built into such models will need to be revisited.",

The current National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tsunami forecast system falls short in detecting these phenomena. This study attempts to classify the range of effects possible from these non-seismic threats, and to investigate detection methods appropriate for use in a forecast system. Typical observation platforms are assessed, including DART bottom pressure recorders and tide gauges. Other detection paths include atmospheric pressure anomaly algorithms for detecting meteotsunamis and the early identification of asteroids large enough to produce a regional hazard. Real-time assessment of observations for forecast use can provide guidance to mitigate the effects of a non-seismic tsunami.",

            "abstract": "Alfvén waves, a fundamental mode of magnetized plasmas, are ubiquitous in space plasmas. For example, a cascade of non-linearly interacting Alfvén waves is believed to play a key role in solar wind turbulence. At perpendicular length scales below the ion gyroradius, this takes the form of Kinetic Alfvén Waves (KAWs). Theoretical predictions show that these Alfvén waves may be unstable to various decay instabilities (e.g. [1,2]) even at very low amplitudes (δB/B<10-3) [2]. Given the turbulent nature of solar wind observations and limited spacecraft spacial resolution, laboratory experiments can play a vital role in exploring the key physics responsible.\nThe present work, conducted at UCLA's Large Plasma Device (LAPD) represents the first fundamental laboratory study of the non-linear Alfvén wave interactions responsible for Alfvén wave decay instabilities. These experiments include the first laboratory observation of the Alfvén-acoustic mode coupling at the heart of the Parametric Decay Instability [3]. More recently, laboratory efforts have focused on the non-linear decay of a KAW into daughter KAWs. In these experiments, a single high-frequency ω/Ωi~0.7 Alfvén wave is launched, resulting in three daughter modes with frequencies and wave numbers that suggest co-propagating KAWs produced by decay of the pump wave. The observed process is parametric in nature, with the frequency of the daughter modes varying as a function of pump mode amplitude. The decay is only observed when there is significant power in the right-hand circularly polarized pump branch; this branch has a phase speed different from the left hand mode at the ω/Ωi where the process is seen. Efforts are underway to fully characterize this set of experiments and compare with decay instabilities predicted by theory and simulations.\n[1] JV Hollweg, J. Geophys.

Using the framework of the light-use efficiency model, this presentation will review efforts to explore the controls on ecosystem-atmosphere carbon fluxes using a variety of novel optical sensors and platforms. Topics of appropriate sampling methodology, scaling and data aggregation will also be considered, with examples of how information content and interpretation of optical data can be scale-dependent.

Yet those archives are noisy recordings of their environment and are always uncertain to some degree. Given a network of paleoclimate observations, we propose a data assimilation (DA) framework that allows us to reconstruct past climate along with its uncertainty estimate. Starting with a distribution of climate states of interest given by an ensemble of instrumental or simulated observations, and a realistic Proxy System Model (PSM) to connect the climate representation to the paleoclimate records, our method assimilates the proxy data to update the target distribution. The believed degree of uncertainty present in the archives is explicitly modeled via the PSM and is therefore inherently propagated throughout the reconstruction process into the informed climate distribution.",

            "abstract": "The concept of using sediment records to identify regime shifts in lakes has largely focussed on biological proxies, such as diatoms and chironomids. In this approach, long-term records of rapid ecological change are compared with independent proxies of the variables driving ecosystem change, for example, climate or catchment disturbance processes (hydrological budgets, deforestation, fire etc.). One of the main problems with this approach is that the sediment cores upon which the data analyses are made are taken from the central part of lakes, often at the deepest point. As a result, the ecological changes observed reflect pelagic (open water) processes rather than whole-lake responses. As most lakes (apart from hypertrophic systems) are dominated by benthic production it is unclear whether palaeolimnological assessments of regime shifts are representative of the whole lake response. Theoretically, this question can be addressed simply by using cores from shallow water. There are a number of problems with this approach, most notably the loss of temporal resolution in shallow water cores (due to the slower sediment accumulation rate) and the different biological assemblages in the shallow water (littoral) cores. There is a strong effect of water depth on the zonation and distribution of biological remains across any lake. An alternative approach therefore is to use total organic carbon [OC] accumulation rate as a measure of the whole lake response to see if there is, in fact, a regime shift at the whole lake scale. Here I present examples of Holocene OC accumulation rate responses to external forcing from shallow eutrophic and boreal lakes and compare them to biological records of structural ecological change to determine whether there has been a whole-lake regime shift.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - 2015.12.08.AGU NH.pdf\nStudies from the natural hazards literature indicate that many natural processes, including wind speeds, landslides, wildfires, precipitation, streamflow and earthquakes, show evidence of nonstationary behavior such as trends in magnitudes through time. Traditional probabilistic analysis of natural hazards based on partial duration series (PDS) generally assumes stationarity in the magnitudes and arrivals of events, i.e. that the probability of exceedance is constant through time. Given evidence of trends and the consequent expected growth in devastating impacts from natural hazards across the world, new methods are needed to characterize their probabilistic behavior. The field of hazard function analysis (HFA) is ideally suited to this problem because its primary goal is to describe changes in the exceedance probability of an event over time. HFA is widely used in medicine, manufacturing, actuarial statistics, reliability engineering, economics, and elsewhere. HFA provides a rich theory to relate the natural hazard event series (x) with its failure time series (t), enabling computation of corresponding average return periods and reliabilities associated with nonstationary event series. This work investigates the suitability of HFA to characterize nonstationary natural hazards whose PDS magnitudes are assumed to follow the widely applied Poisson-GP model. We derive a 2-parameter Generalized Pareto hazard model and demonstrate how metrics such as reliability and average return period are impacted by nonstationarity and discuss the implications for planning and design. Our theoretical analysis linking hazard event series x, with corresponding failure time series t, should have application to a wide class of natural hazards.",

In September 2014, two production wells within the San Joaquin Valley Aquifer System, located in Fresno, CA were sampled and analyzed for a suite of inorganic and organic contaminants and isotopic constituents. The radiotracers 3H (< 50 years) and 14C (> 1000 years) are routinely measured as part of the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Enhanced Trends Network project. Adding 39Ar to the suite of tracers provides age data in the intermediate range to refine the groundwater age distribution of mixed waters and establishes groundwater residence times and flow rates. Characterizing the groundwater recharge and flow rate is of particular interest at these wells for determining the sources and movement of contaminants in groundwater, particularly nitrate, DBCP, and perchlorate.\nThe sampled wells were pumped and purged. The sample collection for the 39Ar measurements required extracting the dissolved gases from 3000-5000 L of groundwater using a membrane degasification system with a maximum flow rate of 50 gpm (11.4 m^3/hr). The membranes are plastic hollow fibers that are hydrophobic. The gas was collected in duplicate large aluminum coated plastic sample bags. The gas was purified and then counted via direct beta counting using ultra-low background proportional counters loaded with a mixture of geologic Ar and methane to enhance the sensitivity for Ar measurements. The activity of 39Ar is 1.01 Bq/kg Ar, corresponding to an abundance of 0.808 ppq. The estimated absolute ages of the samples from the two groundwater wells were 23.3 and 27.0 percent of modern Ar. The comparison of the groundwater residence times determined using the suite of radiotracers (3H, 39Ar, and 14C) highlighted the value of knowing the intermediate age of groundwater when determining contaminant fate and transport pathways.",

With the increasing number of discoveries of Super-Earths (rocky planets many times the mass of our own), the properties of terrestrial phases at ultrahigh pressures are required to understand and interpret the variability of large-scale exoplanet observations. The properties of the cores of these bodies are important for understanding the bulk chemistry, thermal evolution, magnetic fields, and, ultimately, habitability of a planet.\nRecent diamond anvil cell studies interrogating the structure of iron generally agree that Fe should be hcp at core pressures and temperatures, although other structures have been proposed. At higher pressures and with the addition of light elements, the structure is less understood. The addition of large amounts of Si, for example, stabilizes the cubic B2 structure with respect to hcp at outer core pressures. Our goal in this study is to explore the effect of Si-alloying at inner core and exoplanetary-core pressures.\nDynamic compression experiments were carried out at the Omega Laser at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, University of Rochester. High pressures were achieved by focusing laser drives onto target packages containing Fe-Si alloys. Pressures within the sample were determined by monitoring the velocity history at the sample/window interface. Quasi-monochromatic X-rays, timed with maximum compression of the Fe-alloy sample, were generated via laser irradiation of iron or germanium foils arranged in a backlighter configuration and collected on image plates lining the inner walls of a box attached to the target package.\nIn this presentation we will report on the effect of Si-alloying on the structure and density of Fe over the pressure range 100–1000 GPa. We find that while Fe with 7 wt.% Si remains in the hcp structure, Fe with 15wt.% Si is cubic to very high pressures. We present our experimental findings and discuss the implications for exoplanet interiors.",

Such flows are intercalated with ones that are nearly aphyric or that bear plagioclase (plag) phenocrysts of 0.5-2 cm. Addition textures are distinctive radial, snowflake plag clusters and sandwich glomerocrysts of plag, with olivine trapped between laths. These clusters and glomerocrysts are typically 1, but as large as 3 cm in diameter. Plag composition of all textural types is limited (An76-60). Plag dominates the phenocryst mode; rare flows, mainly low in the section, have olivine > plag and phenocrystic clinopyroxene occurs rarely, and mainly high in the section. Unlike the flows, dikes have few phenocrysts; giant laths are rare and the snowflake texture has not been observed.\nGiant plag laths are euhedral and make up a few percent to more than 50% of the rock. Many plag megacrysts are made of several plag crystals that form a mosaic, where the constituent crystals are crystallographically distinct and are overgrown with feldspar to make the crystal euhedral. We describe these composite megacrysts as “mosaicrysts”. We are exploring magmatic conditions that would trigger oversaturation to spawn rapid growth yielding clusters and overgrowths that form mosaicrysts. Giant plagioclase basalts (so-called GPB) are also described for the Deccan and Emeishan flood basalt provinces attesting to similar magmatic processes.\nPlag laths typically define strong flow foliation at the flow base, have a swirled distribution in the flow core, and are sparse in the top. Some particularly crystal-rich flows (or sills) have an abrupt transition to a crystal-poor upper few decimeters of the several-m- thick flow. We interpret the crystal-poor top to be the expelled melt from crystal accumulation in the flow, which locally reinjects and is entrained in lower crystal mush.",

            "abstract": "While most scientists recognize climate change as a major societal and environmental issue, social and political will to tackle the problem is still lacking. One of the biggest obstacles is inaccurate reporting or even outright misinformation in climate change coverage that result in the confusion of the general public on the issue.\nIn today’s era of instant access to information, what we read online usually falls outside our field of expertise and it is a real challenge to evaluate what is credible. The emerging technology of web annotation could be a game changer as it allows knowledgeable individuals to attach notes to any piece of text of a webpage and to share them with readers who will be able to see the annotations in-context –like comments on a pdf.\nHere we present the Climate Feedback initiative that is bringing together a community of climate scientists who collectively evaluate the scientific accuracy of influential climate change media coverage. Scientists annotate articles sentence by sentence and assess whether they are consistent with scientific knowledge allowing readers to see where and why the coverage is –or is not– based on science. Scientists also summarize the essence of their critical commentary in the form of a simple article-level overall credibility rating that quickly informs readers about the credibility of the entire piece.\nWeb-annotation allows readers to ‘hear’ directly from the experts and to sense the consensus in a personal way as one can literaly see how many scientists agree with a given statement. It also allows a broad population of scientists to interact with the media, notably early career scientists.\nIn this talk, we will present results on the impacts annotations have on readers –regarding their evaluation of the trustworthiness of the information they read– and on journalists –regarding their reception of scientists comments.\nSeveral dozen scientists have contributed to this effort to date and the system offers potential to scale up as it relies on a crowdsourced process where each scientist only makes small contributions that get aggregated together. The project aims to build a network of scientists with varied expertise and to organize their efforts at a global scale to efficiently peer-review major news coverage on climate.",

            "abstract": "Mantle xenoliths from late-Proterozoic diamond-bearing kimberlitic dikes in the Kangerlussuaq, Sarfartoq and Maniitsoq areas of southwestern Greenland provide constraints on the composition and thermal state of lithospheric mantle beneath Greenland to depths of ~200 km [1]. Similarly, surface wave tomography studies carried out as part of the GLATIS project use a range of Rayleigh wave periods sensitive to structures at a similar depth interval within southwestern Greenland lithospheric mantle [2]. Here we link petrologic and seismologic constraints on the mantle lithosphere beneath Greenland utilizing methods of [3] that show that inferred chemical and mineralogical stratification inferred from petrology, showing mantle peridotite transitioning from garnet-free harzburgite to garnet lherzolite between ~70 and 180 km, cannot readily be resolved with fundamental mode Rayleigh waves. On the other hand, comparing phase velocities predicted from xenolith compositions, mineralogy and last equilibration temperatures and pressures, defining the continental geotherm during late-Proterozoic time, with those for the present-day mantle lithosphere suggest significant cooling of the cratonic mantle to a modern geotherm characterized by a heat flux of 30 mW/m2 and average crustal heat production of 0.3 mW/m3 [4]. These preliminary findings point to the weak dependence of shear wave velocities on mantle peridotite composition and mineralogy, and further illustrate its strong temperature dependence. Comparison of ancient and modern continental geotherms made possible by combining petrologic and seismological data, as shown here for southwest Greenland, provide additional constraints on secular cooling of cratonic regions linked to large-scale tectonic processes.

            "abstract": "We used a helicopter-borne time domain electromagnetic resistivity survey to detect and map hypersaline brines beneath glaciers and permafrost in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV). In the MDV, a substantially ice-free region of coastal Antarctica, liquid water is present at the surface only in summer streams, ice-covered lakes with brackish to hypersaline bottom waters, and at Blood Falls, a hypersaline discharge from Taylor Glacier. Beneath the surface, however, water can remain liquid at temperatures below 0 °C (and therefore at unexpectedly shallow depths) as a hypersaline brine. These brines, which are measured as zones of low resistivity in an otherwise high resistivity environment, are widespread in Taylor Valley, where they may connect lakes, subglacial waters, and the ocean. By using surface landscape characteristics – such as the presence of lakes, glaciers, or bare ground – we are able to compare changes in resistivity with depth. We find that in areas of surface permafrost (most of the MDV) there is a marked shift to low resistivity material around 200 m below the surface. At lakes, the stratified nature of their waters is detectable and sufficiently large lakes create taliks (unfrozen 'holes' in permafrost) that penetrate to the low resistivity zone around 200 m depth, suggesting connectivity through a regional aquifer. Underneath Taylor Glacier, we detect similar brines, which are the probable source for Blood Falls. These subglacial brines extend from the snout of Taylor Glacier (where they appear to connect to the hypersaline waters of West Lake Bonney) to the limit of our detection ability several kilometers up glacier where the ice became too thick for measurements.\nOur measurements are consistent with limited drilling done in the MDV during the 1970s and radar measurements taken more recently on Taylor Glacier. The transition to low resistivity at ~200 m depth occurs over a temperature range measured in boreholes of about -10 to -5 °C, which is consistent with predictions of temperatures at the base of Taylor Glacier. The widespread nature of these brines may require reassessment of our understanding of Taylor Glacier's movement and the geochemistry of MDV lakes, which have historically been considered isolated from a regional aquifer.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the interactions between minerals and organics in H2O-CO2 fluids is important, as they are the two most abundant volatiles in the crust. CO2-rich fluids in natural and anthropogenic environments, such as metamorphic aureoles and carbon storage reservoirs, respectively, produce a complex geochemical setting in which CO2-rich fluids containing dissolved water and organic compounds interact with rocks and minerals. We have undertaken experimental and theoretical studies to evaluate how organics impact carbonate mineralization and to determine the partitioning behavior of organic complexes between CO2, H2O, and mineral interfaces. The first groups of experiments have clarified how the type and concentration of simple organic ligands impact the degree and type of carbonation in interfacial water films. In these experiments, salts of simple organic ligands were equilibrated with wet supercritical CO2, which was reacted with the model mineral forsterite (Mg2SiO4). The forsterite dissolution and coupled carbonate precipitation reactions were followed with time-resolved pressurized X-ray diffraction (XRD) at 50 °C and 90 bar. The extent of carbonation and the relative abundance of anhydrous magnesite (MgCO3) precipitated relative to hydrated nesquehonite (MgCO3·3H2O) was impacted by the type of organic ligand. Magnesite enhancement was observed with the trend of citrate>oxalate≈malonate>acetate>organic-free control. This indicates that the organic ligands complexed Mg2+ in the interfacial water film environment and helped alleviate kinetic barriers to magnesite formation. Additional XRD experiments with varying concentrations of citrate verified the dependence of magnesite enhancement and the degree of overall carbonation on the amount of organic present in the water film. Lastly, our ongoing work concerning the partitioning of organic and metal-organic complexes between CO2, H2O, and interfacial water films will be presented. This experimental work, which includes in situ spectroscopic measurements, has been coupled with atomistic simulations to clarify the energy barriers and reaction mechanism. The implications for cycling of C-O-H-metal compounds (e.g. H2O, carbonates, metal-organics, and CO2) in a broad range of subsurface environments will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Evidence for increased subaerial volcanism during the last deglaciation has been hypothesized to result from depressurization of magma chambers in response to glacial unloading. However, the direct link between isostatic changes and the initiation of volcanism is obscured by different regional climate histories and timescales of isostatic adjustment. Likewise, the regional and global response to this volcanic forcing is poorly constrained due to the difficulty of obtaining high-resolution records that can capture short-term climate variability.\nMarine sediment records from the Southeast Alaska margin have exceptionally high sedimentation rates (up to 1 cm/yr across the last deglacial transition), along with excellent age control (28 14C dates), and thus provide a decadal-scale record of 23 tephra layers paired with foraminiferal oxygen isotopes and alkenone temperature reconstructions that record the timing and climate impacts of these eruptions. Major element compositions of eight discrete tephra layers are consistent with a source from the Mt. Edgecumbe Volcanic Field (MEVF).\nThe onset of the MEVF eruptive sequence is concurrent with the onset of Bølling-Allerød interstadial warmth, the disappearance of ice-rafted detritus, and a period of rapid vertical land motion associated with modeled isostatic rebound in response to glacier retreat. These data support the hypothesis that regional deglaciation can trigger volcanic activity. A series of short-term cooling and surface ocean freshening events are associated with the interval of intense volcanic activity. The Southeast Alaska record thus supports a two-way interaction between climate and volcanism, in which nearly instantaneous volcanic response to ice unloading may enhance climate variability during deglaciation.",

For this, the TR32 set up the following three elements during the past nine years:\nmeasurement techniques that allow us to characterize and monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics and evolution of system properties across scales,\na cross-scale, multi-compartment terrestrial system modeling approach that includes all relevant processes using the terrestrial model platform TerrSysMP and\nstate variable assimilation and parameter estimation methods.\nWe will present examples of how the TR32 utilizes these three elements to improve our understanding of the water cycle.\nThe available soil moisture monitoring network consisting of e.g. cosmic-ray sensors or an in situ NMR slim-line logging tool has been helpful in understanding the interactions of plant growth and soil moisture dynamics. New algorithms derive soil moisture from satellite based SAR systems, which showed potential for the derivation of surface roughness and vegetation information.\nFor surface precipitation, a radar composite using observations from two dual-polarized X-band Doppler radars provides nearly 100% coverage of the Rur catchment. To also be able to include other precipitation observations which occur at different temporal and spatial resolutions, such as rain gauges, a high resolution space-time precipitation model is being developed. Commercial microwave links used for cell phone communication have also been experimented with to improve polarimetric quantitative precipitation estimation.\nIn addition, uncertainty plays a major role with respect to the central goal of the TR32 and is taken into account in various ways. For example, model uncertainty in the Rur catchment results in large parts from anthropogenic activities such as e.g. drainage patterns in fields, the control of the Rur discharge, groundwater pumping, storage lakes, etc. Other approaches to quantify uncertainty include sensitivity experiments to evaluate the effects of parameter lumping.",

Sentinel 2A’s MSI instrument is now providing optical data similar to Landsat 8’s OLI imagery and, with its global repeat of 10 days, has the potential to increase the availability of 30m resolution high level products such as leaf area index (LAI). Prior to the launch of S-2A, we simulated MSI imagery using EO-1 Hyperion data and estimated green LAI using an algorithm based on canopy spectral invariants theory. Comparison of the resulting LAI maps resulting from the simulated MSI and corresponding maps derived from OLI data showed a RMSE of 0.1875. Uncertainty bounds on actual MSI data promise to be narrower because of the superior signal-to-noise ratio of MSI.

            "abstract": "ePoster - Farrell_2015 AGU poster_final.pdf\nThe hyporheic zone (HZ) of streams may be a significant source of nitrous oxide (N2O). However, the biogeochemical processes controlling N2O emissions remain poorly constrained due to difficulties in obtaining high-resolution chemical, physical, and biological data from streams. Our research elucidates specific controls on N2O production within the HZ by coupling the distribution of denitrifying microbial communities to flow dynamics (i.e. hydraulics and streambed morphology) and biogeochemical processes. We conducted a large-scale flume experiment that allowed us to constrain streambed morphology, flow rate, organic carbon loading, grain size distribution, and exogenous nitrate loading while enabling regular monitoring of dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, nitrogen species, and elemental concentrations in the HZ. We also employed real-time PCR (qPCR) to quantify the distribution of denitrifying functional genes (nirS and nosZ, nitrite reductase and nitrous oxide reductase genes, respectively) in HZ sediment cores as a measure of denitrifying microorganism abundance. A steady increase in N2O was observed after 8 hours of residence time with a peak in concentration (9.5 µg-N/L) recorded at hour 18. Abundance of nosZ increased an order of magnitude between hours 8 and 18 (2.6x106 to 2.1x107 gene copy #/g dry sediment). nirS abundance remained within the same order of magnitude between hours 8 and 18 (1.7x107 to 3.8x107). Linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models were used to investigate N2O production in the HZ as a function of total nitrogen, nirS, nosZ, residence time, and dissolved oxygen. N2O production was localized at redox-controlled hotspots within the subsurface and concentrations were strongly correlated with the availability of nitrogen when an interaction with nosZ abundance was considered. On-going analysis will provide predictions of N2O production and support for conditions under which the HZ could be a significant contributor of N2O emissions. These results are also being used to parameterize a reactive transport model for predicting N2O production from stream sediments with different bedform morphologies, flow rates, and reactant concentrations.",

            "abstract": "In March 2009, the Woods Hole Diversity Initiative launched the Partnership Education Program (PEP), a multi-institutional effort to increase diversity in the student population (and ultimately the work force) in the Woods Hole science community. PEP, a summer research internship program, is open to students of all backgrounds but is designed especially to provide opportunities for URM in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). PEP is a 10-week program which provides intensive mentored research, a credit-bearing course and supplemental career and professional development activities. Students have opportunities to work in various research areas of geosciences. PEP is emerging as an effective and sustainable approach to bringing students into the STEM research community. PEP is carefully structured to provide critical support for students as they complete their undergraduate experience and prepare for geosciences careers and/or graduate school. The PEP experience is intended to provide students with an entry into the Woods Hole science community, one of the most vibrant marine and environmental research communities in the world. The program aims to provide a first-hand introduction to emerging issues and real-world training in the research skills that students need to advance in science, either as graduate students or bachelors-level working scientists. This is a long-recognized need and efforts are being made to ensure that the students begin to acquire skills and aptitudes that position them to take advantage of a wide range of opportunities. Of note is that the PEP is transitioning into a two year program where students are participating in a second year as a research intern or employee. Since 2013, at least four partner institutions have invited PEP alumni to participate in their respective programs as research assistants and/or full-time technicians.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015poster_kimura_151214.pdf\nIn the Nankai Trough, Japan, a cabled real-time seismic, geodetic and tsunami observation system, comprising twenty DONET1 seafloor and one IODP C0002G borehole observatories, monitors seismic activity above the seismogenic zone, where mega-thrust earthquakes occur at 100-150 years interval. On Nov. 2013 through June 2015, we conducted three seismic airgun surveys above DONET1 and C0002G seismometers. In this study, we aimed to reveal spatial distribution of S-wave anisotropy, i.e., a proxy of stress state governing the fault dynamics in the subduction zone, from the dataset recorded by the cabled system during these surveys\nIn these surveys, airgun shootings at circular survey lines around each observatory with different radii of 3, 7 and 10 km were carried out. In the observed horizontal components for each shot from 3km radius lines (R3 lines), seismic waveforms in 3.0 to 5.0s after the shot are clearly visible to indicate the up-coming P-S converted waves from the bottom of the shallow sediment, although signal-to-noise ratio decreases with depth due to spherical divergence and to complicated structure such as dipping reflectors. We computed radial and transverse records for each shot-receiver azimuth, and then estimated S-wave anisotropy parameters, i.e., magnitude and azimuth, as a function of depth for R3 lines at thirteen observatories.\nThe obtained results confirm that the distributions of S-wave anisotropy, especially in shallow sediments, have localities: the magnitude of S-wave anisotropy becomes smaller in landward basin than in imbricated thrust zone. The axes of fast S-wave symmetry become closer to subduction direction for results from deep reflections. We plan to conduct more attentive analysis, including error evaluation using repeated shooting dataset to discuss the detectability of temporal change of S-wave anisotropy deepen the present discussion after integrating numerical analysis in complicated structure model with the current method.",

            "abstract": "A close connection between ionospheric SEDs and plasmaspheric plumes has been reported during the main phase of magnetic storms in previous studies. The temporal and spatial variation of the connection has not yet been studied in detail, as the plasmas in ionosphere and plasmasphere get redistributed dynamically during various phases of a storm. Furthermore, how the Ionosphere-Plasmasphere coupling depends on the types of the solar wind driving conditions has not yet been studied. A newly developed global three dimensional ionosphere-plasmasphere-electrodynamics (IPE) model is used to address the coupling between the ionosphere and plasmasphere. IPE model has reproduced the Storm Enhanced Density plume feature in TEC being transported into cusp and over the pole, characterized as the Tongue of Ionization (TOI). Furthermore, the same simulation reveals the plasmaspheric plume like structure in the magnetospheric equatorial plane. Our simulations suggest that neither SAPS nor midlatitude SED bulge is essential in reproducing the SED plume-like features. A term analysis of the ion continuity equations in the IPE model has indicated that the SED plume/TOI feature observed in the ionosphere is produced due primarily to a combination of plasma transport and production/loss, which is supportive of previous studies. However, the plasmaspheric plume responds differently to that of the ionospheric plume depending on the various setting of the numerical experiments. The results indicate a need of a careful examination of the relative importance of the plasma transport between the parallel and perpendicular directions to the magnetic field in both the ionosphere and plasmasphere. In this presentation, we will compare how the ionosphere-plasmasphere coupling depends on the solar wind driving conditions for the selected campaign events.",

            "abstract": "We address mechanisms which seek to explain the observed solar flare distribution, dN/dE ~ E1.8. We have compiled a comprehensive database, from GOES, NOAA, XRT, and AIA data, of solar flares and their characteristics, covering the year 2013. These datasets allow us to probe how stored magnetic energy is released over the course of an active region’s evolution. We fit power-laws to flare distributions over various attribute groupings. For instance, we compare flares that occur before and after an active region reaches its maximum area, and show that the corresponding flare distributions are indistinguishable; thus, the processes that lead to magnetic reconnection are similar in both cases. A turnover in the distribution is not detectable at the energies accessible to our study, suggesting that a self-organized critical (SOC) process is a valid mechanism. However, we find changes in the distributions that suggest that the simple picture of an SOC where flares draw energy from an inexhaustible reservoir of stored magnetic energy is incomplete. Following the evolution of the flare distribution over the lifetimes of active regions, we find that the distribution flattens with time, and for larger active regions, and that a single power-law model is insufficient. This implies that flares that occur later in the lifetime of the active region tend towards higher energies. We conclude that the SOC process must have an upper bound. Increasing the scope of the study to include data from other years and more instruments will increase the robustness of these results.\nThis work was supported by the NSF-REU Solar Physics Program at SAO, grant number AGS 1263241, NASA Contract NAS8-03060 to the Chandra X-ray Center and by NASA Hinode/XRT contract NNM07AB07C to SAO",

            "abstract": "The chemistry of drainage from waste-rock piles at mine sites is difficult to predict because of a number of uncertainties including heterogeneous reactive mineral content, distribution of minerals, weathering rates and physical flow properties. In this presentation, we examine the effects of mixing on drainage chemistry over timescales of 100s of years. We use a 1-D streamtube conceptualization of flow in waste rocks and multicomponent reactive transport modeling. We simplify the reactive system to consist of acid-producing sulfide minerals and acid-neutralizing carbonate minerals and secondary sulfate and iron oxide minerals. We create multiple realizations of waste-rock piles with distinct distributions of reactive minerals along each flow path and examine the uncertainty of drainage geochemistry through time. The limited mixing of streamtubes that is characteristic of the vertical unsaturated flow in many waste-rock piles, allows individual flowpaths to sustain acid or neutral conditions to the base of the pile, where the streamtubes mix. Consequently, mixing and the acidity/alkalinity balance of the streamtube waters, and not the overall acid- and base-producing mineral contents, control the instantaneous discharge chemistry. Our results show that the limited mixing implied by preferential flow and the heterogeneous distribution of mineral contents lead to large uncertainty in drainage chemistry over short and medium time scales. However, over longer timescales when one of either the acid-producing or neutralizing primary phases is depleted, the drainage chemistry becomes less controlled by mixing and in turn less uncertain. A correct understanding of the temporal variability of uncertainty is key to make informed long-term decisions in mining settings regarding the management of waste material.",

            "abstract": "The response of the tropical surface oceans to greater than modern atmospheric carbon dioxide is poorly constrained. Eocene climate modelling broadly indicates that the tropical surface ocean was 8-10°C warmer compared to pre-industrial simulations, at odds with much of the currently available proxy information which suggests low latitude sea surface temperatures (SST) no more than a few degrees warmer than at present. However, the accuracy of some of this proxy information, particularly the δ18O and Mg/Ca ratio of biogenic marine carbonates, is hampered by uncertainties regarding the secular evolution of seawater chemistry. Here, we present clumped isotope temperatures of modern and Eocene shallow-dwelling benthic foraminifera, a palaeothermometer independent of seawater isotopic composition. These organisms have photosymbionts and therefore inhabit the photic zone, within the depth range of planktic species considered to be surface dwelling. Specimens collected from the modern ocean precipitate calcite in agreement with the clumped isotope-temperature calibration of Zaarur et al. [2013]. Based on 11 tropical to mid-latitude localities from across the globe we demonstrate that the Eocene ocean was significantly warmer than suggested by much of the previous proxy data. Exceptionally-preserved samples from the mid-Eocene of Java indicate the West Pacific was characterised by mean annual SST of 34-37°C at this time, whilst mid-latitude northern hemisphere SST (from localities in the UK, France and Belgium) were 24-30°C throughout the Eocene. These data bring (sub)tropical SST in a high-CO2 world into much better agreement with climate models, indicating low-mid latitudinal SST gradients similar to modern.",

Therefore, more studies are needed to evaluate the possible relationship between urban growth and local and regional changes. In the last 30 years, the population of Manaus grew by over 500%, with approximately 1.9 million inhabitants in 2010. Trying to understand the effects of urban growth of the city of Manaus on its microclimate and atmospheric processes, the present study aims to evaluate the possible physical mechanisms related to the urbanization process observed through a study of atmospheric modeling. The results allowed to assess that the presence of the urban area significantly modifies the Surface Energy Balance (SEB), generating a thermal gradient between the city and surrounding regions, favoring the formation and intensification of local atmospheric circulations. The results indicated that with urban growth there is an increase in temperature, decrease in the atmospheric water content and significant changes in the flow at low levels, mainly in the breeze circulations, with significant changes observed in the structure and characteristic of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) over the study area. A positive correlation between the increase of the urban area and increased rainfall was also observed. From the results, it was possible to observe that there is a direct relationship between urban growth and changes in the local microclimate in Manaus.",

            "abstract": "As documented in Straub (2013), different MJO indices may classify the same MJO-like event as “being” or “not being” an MJO. A good example is the period during late November and early December 1992, during TOGA-COARE, when wavenumber-frequency filtering of OLR identifies a clear MJO, but the RMM (Real-Time Multivariate MJO) index does not. More recently, several additional MJO indices have been developed, including the VPM (Velocity Potential-MJO) index and the OMI (OLR-based MJO) index. Each index was designed to be a universal index, such that it can be applied in all seasons and at all longitudes. However, each index is generally understood by the MJO community to most effectively capture a particular feature or set of features of the MJO, such as its large-scale envelope of cloudiness or its zonal wavenumber 1 dynamical structure, in some cases in a particular geographic region or during a particular season. MJO indices are also typically used in an on/off fashion: either something “is” or “isn’t” an MJO, which is often determined via a specific threshold, e.g. an amplitude of 1 in the RMM index. Straub (2013) and more recent research shows, however, that MJO-like structures do exist at index amplitudes smaller than the on/off thresholds. For example, composites of MJO-like convective events similar those seen during October through December 2011 during DYNAMO, which have longitudinally constrained convective envelopes that dissipate over the Maritime Continent and 20-30 day time scales, illustrate that these smaller-scale MJOs do not project strongly onto the RMM index and thus may be missed in composites using the commonly applied threshold of RMM=1. This research also opens up the larger questions of 1) whether the MJO should continue to be analyzed in this on/off fashion and 2) whether a universal MJO index is in fact the most effective way to analyze the MJO.",

Although few studies have been conducted to investigate the well bore integrity subjected to thermal cycling during CO2injection, a systematic investigation on thermally induced expansion and contraction affecting the debonding and cracking of the well barrier materials has not yet been performed. In this work, we have analyzed the thermo-mechanical characteristics of the well barrier materials undergoing repeated thermal cycling using a multiscale, multiphysics platform named GEOS. More specifically, we model the modes of failure during thermal cycling to assess the temperature range for minimal impact on well integrity. A finite element solver was used for the geomechanics and a finite volume solver was used for the thermal diffusion. Results of the initiation and propagation of fractures due to temperature variations in the cement sheath are presented. Preliminary results suggest that radial fracture develops as the cement is heated while debonding occurs in the casing-cement and cement-rock interfaces during the cooling period. The effects of different confinement conditions based on in-situ stresses were also analyzed.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under the Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

            "abstract": "The link between fluid overpressure and the earthquake cycle has been documented through previous studies of vein arrays associated with faults and carefully designed experimental work. In the interseismic period, elevated pore fluid pressure (overpressure) will reduce the effective fault-normal stress, weakening the fault and promoting seismic rupture. Fractures produced during faulting will serve as fluid migration pathways until they are sealed by either collapse or precipitation of cement. Following sealing, pore fluid pressure is inferred to progressively increase until it reaches a level sufficient to start the cycle again.\nThough the rock record of this overpressure-driven seismic cycle is clear, the timescales of the different elements of the cycle have not been quantified. We have addressed this problem by dating calcite veins in the hanging wall damage zone of the Loma Blanca fault zone of the Socorro Basin, Rio Grande rift, New Mexico. These veins exhibit crack-seal microstructures that record repeated episodes of fracture opening, fluid migration, and fracture sealing, suggesting a prolonged history of recurrent seismicity and post-failure fluid migration. Stable isotope analyses of these veins reveal distinct fluid chemistries associated with individual fluid migration events. Carbon isotope values as high as +6.00‰ suggest depressurization and degassing of CO2 charged fluids, supporting the interpretation that fracturing was associated with fault slip. Preliminary U-series dating of calcite veins show a well-defined periodicity of fault slip and fracture formation, with a slip recurrence interval of approximately 73 ± 17 ka, consistent with previous studies of other faults in the Rio Grande rift. Analyses of cements deposited during single crack-seal events record sealing times of approximately 16 ± 4 ka. These results suggest that the time required to re-establish sufficient pore fluid pressure for failure following sealing of damage zone fractures may be ca. 50 ka. Our results provide the first quantitative constraints on the timescales of fluid overpressure development, fault slip, and fracture sealing in a seismogenic fault zone, and may provide insight into the seismic cycle of intraplate fault zones in other extensional tectonic settings.",

            "abstract": "The Hikurangi subduction zone (New Zealand) is one of many subudction zones that exhibit slow slip behavior. Geodetic observations along the Hikurangi subduction zone are unusual in that not only does the subduction zone exhibit periodic slow slip events at “typical” subduction-zone depths of 25-50 km along the southern part of the margin, but also much shallower depths of 8-15 km along the northern part of the margin. Furthermore, there is evidence for interplay between slow slip events at these different depth ranges (between the deep and shallow events) along the central part of the margin, and some of the slow slip behavior is observed along regions of the interface that were previously considered locked, which raises questions about the slip behavior of this region. This study employs the earthquake simulator, RSQSim, to explore variations in the effective normal stress (i.e., stress after the addition of pore fluid pressures) and the frictional instability necessary to generate the complex slow slip events observed along the Hikurangi margin. Preliminary results suggest that to generate slow slip events with similar recurrence intervals to those observed the effective normal stress (MPa) is 3x higher in the south than the north, 6-9MPa versus 2-3MPa, respectively. Results also suggest that, at a minimum, that some overlap along the central margin must exist between the slow slip sections in the north and south to reproduce the types of slip events observed along the Hikurangi subduction zone. To further validate the results from the simulations, Okada solutions for surface displacements will be compared to geodetic solution to more accurately constrain the areas in which slip behavior varies and the cause(s) for the variation(s).",

The flow of groundwater through the Mississippi River Delta (MRD) to the Gulf, however, has been largely understudied and is typically overlooked in MRD biogeochemical studies. Previous work demonstrated that sand-rich paleochannels that maintain a hydrologic connection to the Mississippi River could transport riverine water to the MRD2. We present data from biogeochemical surveys at 2 sites in the lower MRD to explore the effects of river-derived submarine groundwater discharge on the biogeochemistry of MRD wetlands. Lac des Allemands is a fresh water lake and Myrtle Grove is a brackish canal with variable salinities. Both are surrounded by extensive wetlands. Over the course of a year, surface water, shallow pore water, and deeper groundwaters were sampled to understand the cycling of redox-sensitive trace elements (Fe, Mn, V, As) and the potential supply from groundwater to surface water bodies. Major ion chemistry suggests that both Lac des Allemands and Myrtle Grove Canal receive river-derived terrestrial water at their heads, the flux of which varies as a function of river stage. However, the lateral flow through adjacent wetlands is altered as a function of sediment heterogeneity. Evidence for sulfate reduction exists in the near-surface sediment and at depth where a continuous vertical organic matter layer exists. In sand-rich layers, iron reduction buffers redox conditions, and V varies inversely with dissolved Fe. Concentrations of V and As are much greater in near-surface pore waters than in deeper groundwaters and in surface waters, suggesting that the subterranean estuary serves as a sink of these redox-sensitive trace elements.\n[1] Bianchi and Allison (2009) PNAS 1068085-8092.\n[2] Kolker et al.

            "abstract": "Circulation in the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer (STBL) is thought to be primarily driven by the emission of longwave radiation at cloud top, and enhanced by latent heat release in updrafts and latent heat uptake in downdrafts. However, for optically thick clouds, with a liquid water path (LPW) ≳ 50 g m-2, long wave emissions increase only negligibly with LWP. Yet, additional moistening of the boundary layer, e.g. due to wind speed driving a higher surface moisture flux, leads to faster boundary layer growth and entrainment. In this presentation we investigate cloud layer updrafts as drivers of boundary layer growth and entrainment in optically thick stratocumulus clouds. We conduct cloud-system resolving simulations of stratocumulus clouds in which additional moistening of the boundary layer by wind speed leads to a stronger production of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) due to latent heat release in cloud updrafts, and thereby to enhanced boundary layer growth and entrainment. We find that LWP increases as well, but without an effect on longwave cooling and TKE production. Furthermore, we find that even in the strongly decoupled daytime boundary layer, wind speed drives additional TKE production in cloud layer updrafts and thereby boundary layer growth and entrainment. This mechanism could, potentially, result in a runaway breakup of the cloud, or initiate or assist in the transition from stratocumulus to shallow cumulus, especially at higher wind speeds.",

A particular focus will be the \"limiting factors hypothesis\", which argues that farmers will respond to the climate variables that usually have the largest impact on their crop productivity. For example, the most limiting factor in California is usually water so how climate change affects water will be the largest drive of climate adaptation decisions. This basic idea is drawn from the broader theory of \"psychological distance\", which argue that human decisions are more attuned to ideas that are psychologically closer in space, time, or other factors.

            "abstract": "Diffuse auroral pecipitation provides a major source of ionization for the high latitude upper atmosphere, and as such controls the spatial distribution of ionospheric conductivity and its variability during geomagnetic activity. The physical mechanisms responsible for diffuse auroral precipitation have been debated for several decades. But recent detailed modeling of the rates of electron scattering by plasma waves, together with new and improved observations of the wave and particle environment in space, have allowed us to identify the dominant mechanisms responsible for the precipitation of plasma sheet electrons into the atmosphere. At lower invariant latitude (L< 8) a combination of lower and upper band chorus emissions provides the dominant scattering mechanism and can also account for the unique anisotropic pitch angle distribution left in space, which can continue to provide the source for chorus excitation over the dawn side of the magnetosphere. However, at higher L shells the electron anisotropy is insufficient to cause chorus excitation, but the residual loss cone distribution can excite electrostatic cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves, which are the dominant scattering agent at higher invariant latitude. Both chorus and ECH waves are capable of causing electron scattering at the strong diffusion rate during more intense geomagnetic activity, and this can lead to a significant reduction of plasma sheet electron flux able to reach the dayside, which acconts fore the strong day-night asymmetry of diffuse auroral precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Recent geologic field mapping, shallow geophysical surveys, and boreholes, combined with interpretation of reprocessed industry 2D seismic reflection profiles, provide new constraints for the structural characterization of the Cheraw Fault in southeastern Colorado. A previously unmapped topographic scarp extending northeast from of the mapped fault trace exhibits northeast-oriented fractures in Cretaceous Niobrara shale and an apparent ~3m down-to-the-northwest offset across a bedrock/alluvium contact observed in exposures of the scarp near of Haswell, CO. Shallow seismic surveys and a transect of 4 shallow borings across the scarp confirm the vertical displacement estimates. Two industry 2D seismic refraction profiles that cross this scarp were licensed, reprocessed, and depth-migrated. Preliminary analyses of the seismic profiles show ~ 100m or less of down-to-the-northwest displacement across a primary fault that is coincident with the topographic scarp and extends through Mesozoic and Paleozoic strata into Precambrian basement. Fault dip constraints and are pending further seismic data interpretation and analysis. These data show that 1) the Cheraw fault extends an additional 15 km from its currently mapped northern termination, for a minimum total fault length of ~60 km, 2) offset of an early (?) Quaternary pediment along the northeast extension near the town of Haswell of ~3 m, is similar in magnitude to the offset in a late Pleistocene channel reported by Crone et al. (1997) along the main trace of the fault, and 3) seismic reflection data show that the fault extends into crystalline basement rock, supporting a tectonic feature rather than dissolution collapse.",

Profile data from both Argo and Line-P surveys supports the Reynolds SSTa analysis and further indicates that the anomaly was, and continues to be, confined to the upper ocean, above approximately 100 m depth. The anomaly has lasted for many months, exceeding 4 standard deviations above the multi-decadal mean, a feature that would not be expected more than once in several millennia. The “blob”, as it is dubbed, drifted first off and then towards shore during the spring and fall of 2014 driven by, among other forces, the seasonal up and down-welling winds, respectively that occur along the west coast of North America. By November 2014, when winter down-welling winds became prevalent, the warm surface waters encroached all the way into Barkley Sound along western Vancouver Island, as measured by the continuous temperature measurements on the NEPTUNE ocean observatory of Ocean Networks Canada. The analysis includes some of the known dynamical variations which contributed to the formation of the blob, with an emphasis on mid to high latitude atmosphere-ocean conditions, avoiding the temptation to link the development processes occurring in the Gulf of Alaska in the winter of 2013 to equatorial phenomena.",

            "abstract": "Precipitous sea cliffs on the northwest side of Kauai, sculpted into deep bedrock gullies and sharp divides, are known as “Na Pali”, Hawaiian for “the cliffs”, and are commonly referred to as fluted cliffs. Rising 500 m above the coast, they constitute some of the most dramatic scenery on planet Earth and are a world famous tourist attraction. After the discovery of flank collapses on some Hawaiian volcanoes the great Na Pali escarpment was hypothesized to have been generated by a megalandslide, but bathymetric data show the shallow submarine shelf off the Na Pali coast bears no landslide deposits. It is likely that wave erosion at the base of the local thin-bedded lavas, particularly in winter, is responsible for the escarpment.\n Superimposed on the escarpment are the deep gullies, or grooves, and divides, which constitute drainage networks that happen to be developed on very steep slopes. Networks are poorly developed on relatively young parts of the escarpment and well developed on older parts, which feature coalescing tributaries and very deep gullies. In most cases gullies shallow going upslope, and many fade out completely just below drainage divides, just like in drainage networks developed on more gently sloping landscapes. The drainage networks show that the basalts along this coast are relatively easily eroded by runoff.\n Rocks easily eroded by runoff generally do not stand in 500-m-high cliffs because they are not mechanically strong enough to resist failure and mass movement. The key to development of high fluted cliffs is a mix of mechanical strength and erodibiity, a combination whose rarity explains why analogs to the Na Pali cliffs are not found outside the Hawaiian Islands. The combination here is provided by basalt which is strong where unweathered but rotten and in some case completely decomposed close to the surface, courtesy of the Hawaiian climate. Weathering must proceed downward at about the same rate as removal of mass by runoff erosion, otherwise surface erosion would cease or mass movement would dismantle the cliffs. Steepness of the escarpment is in part maintained by wave erosion, but in valleys that have eroded headward back from the coast valley walls are just as steep as cliffs right on the coast. This suggests a type of pedimentation is at play, possibly aided by groundwater sapping.",

            "abstract": "The calving and capsize of cubic kilometer-sized icebergs in both Greenland and Antarctica are known to be the source of long-period seismic events classified as glacial earthquakes. The ability to monitor both calving events and the mass of ice calved using the Global Seismographic Network is quite attractive, however, the basic physics of these large calving events must be understood to develop a robust relationship between seismic magnitude and mass of ice calved. The amplitude and duration of the seismic signal is expected to be related to the mass of the calved iceberg and the magnitude of the acceleration of the iceberg's center of mass, yet a simple relationship between these quantities has proved difficult to develop from in situ observations or numerical models. To address this, we developed and carried out a set of experiments on a laboratory scale model of iceberg calving. These experiments were designed to measure several aspects of the post-fracture calving process. Our results show that a combination of mechanical contact forces and hydrodynamic pressure forces are generated by the capsize of an iceberg adjacent to a glacier's terminus. These forces combine to produce the net horizontal centroid single force (CSF) which is often used to model glacial earthquake sources. We find that although the amplitude and duration of the force applied to the terminus generally increases with the iceberg mass, the details depend on the geometry of the iceberg and the depth of the water. The resulting seismic signal is thus crucially dependent on hydrodynamics of the capsize process. ",

To effectively account for fracture–matrix interactions, emphasis must be placed on identifying and parameterizing all of the fractures that participate substantially in groundwater flow and contaminated transport. High resolution plume studies at four primary research sites, where chlorinated solvent plumes serve as long-term (several decades) tracer tests, provide insight concerning the density of the fracture network unattainable by conventional methods. Datasets include contaminant profiles from detailed VOC subsampling informed by continuous core logs, hydraulic head and transmissivity profiles, packer testing and sensitive temperature logging methods in FLUTe™ lined holes. These show presence of many more transmissive fractures, contrasting observations of only a few flow zones per borehole obtained from conventional hydraulic tests including flow metering in open boreholes. Incorporating many more fractures with a wider range of transmissivities is key to predicting contaminant migration. This new understanding of dense fracture networks combined with matrix property measurements have informed 2-D DFN flow and transport modelling using Fractran and HydroGeosphere to simulate plume characteristics ground-truthed by detailed field site plume characterization. These process-based simulations corroborate field findings that plumes in sedimentary rock after decades of transport show limited plume front distances and strong internal plume attenuation by diffusion, transverse dispersion and slow degradation. This successful application of DFN modeling informed by field-derived parameters demonstrates how the DFN Approach can be applied to other sites to inform plume migration rates and remedial efficacy.",

            "abstract": "We model blind thrust scenario earthquakes matching the fault geometry of 1994 Mw 6.7 Northridge earthquake up to 8 Hz by first performing dynamic rupture propagation using a support operator method (SORD). We extend the ground motion by converting the slip-rate data to a kinematic source for the finite difference wave propagation code AWP-ODC, which incorporates an improved frequency-dependent attenuation approach. This technique has high accuracy for Q values down to 15. The desired Q function is fit to the ‘effective’ Q over the coarse grained-cell for low Q, and a simple interpolation formula is used to interpolate the weights for arbitrary Q. Here, we use a power-law model Q above a reference frequency in the form Q 0 f^n with exponents ranging from 0.0-0.9. We find envelope and phase misfits only slightly larger than that of the elastic case when compared with that of the frequency-wavenumber solution for both a homogenous and a layered model with a large-velocity contrast. We also include small-scale medium complexity in both a 1D layered model and a 3D medium extracted from SCEC CVM-S4 including a surface geotechnical layer (GTL). We model additional realizations of the scenario by varying the hypocenter location, and find that similar moment magnitudes are generated. We observe that while the ground motion pattern changes, the median ground motion is not affected significantly, when binned as a function of distance, and is within 1 interevent standard deviation from the median GMPEs. We find that intra-event variability for the layered model simulations is similar to observed values of single-station standard deviation. We show that small-scale heterogeneity can significantly affect the intra-event variability at frequencies greater than ~1 Hz, becoming increasingly important at larger distances from the source. We perform a parameter space study by varying statistical parameters and find that the variability is fairly independent of the correlation length. The intra-event variability of our simulations in the CVM is typically larger than that for the observations at frequencies > 1 Hz. However, this discrepancy tends to decrease when small-scale heterogeneity in the medium is included in the simulations, suggesting the need for a highly complex velocity model to fit ground motion variability.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_small.pdf\nLate summer streamflow for the Scott River in northern California has decreased approximately 50% since the mid 1960’s, resulting in increased water temperatures and disconnection of the stream. This negatively impacts aquatic habitat of fish species such as coho and fall-run Chinook salmon. In collaboration with local stakeholders, the Scott Valley Integrated Hydrologic Model has been developed, which combines a water budget model and a groundwater-surface water model (MODFLOW) of the 200 km2 basin. The goal of the integrated model is to better understand the hydrologic system of the valley and explore effects of different conjunctive management scenarios on late summer streamflow. The groundwater model has a 100 m lateral resolution with aggregated monthly stresses over a 21 year simulation period (1990-2011). The Scott River and tributaries are represented using the streamflow routing (SFR) package. A sensitivity analysis and calibration were performed by hand using 812 head observations from 50 wells in the basin and average daily streamflow observations from a USGS stream gauge during the simulation period. The calibrated model was used to evaluate two different management scenarios: 1) in-lieu recharge where surface-water instead of groundwater is used to irrigate fields near the river while streamflow is sufficiently high, and 2) managed aquifer recharge during the winter months on agricultural fields located in gulches on the eastern side of the valley using existing infrastructure. Preliminary results indicate that implementation of conjunctive water management may increase late summer streamflow at the gauging station by 1-2 cubic feet per second (cfs), a significant amount given that flows are around 10-20 cfs during this time. This increase in flow during the late summer decreases the length of dry reaches both spatially and temporally, allowing for earlier reconnection of the Scott River and decreased stress on fish.",

            "abstract": "The last few years of record-breaking climate anomalies across North America--a resilient atmospheric ridge and extreme drought over the West Coast, and severe winters across the Midwest and East Coast regions--have been linked to anomalous Pacific sea surface temperatures (Seager et al. 2014, Wang et al. 2014, Hartmann 2015). The synoptic associations prompt important questions on the relation between these unusual phenomena and extreme expressions of known Pacific decadal modes, such as the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). These questions motivate our pursuit to document multiple realizations of decadal variability in the Pacific-North American region through periods of varied radiative forcing.\nHere we introduce a 178 year, seasonally resolved Porites coral record from Clarion Island (18N, 115W), the westernmost island of the Revillagigedo Archipelago, a region both highly influenced by NPGO SST and SSS variability and critical for NPGO tropical-extratropical communication via the Seasonal Footprinting Mechanism (Vimont et al. 2003). When coupled with tree ring records from the western United States (Griffin and Anchukaitis 2014, MacDonald and Case 2005) and coral records from the central tropical Pacific (Cobb et al. 2001), the δ18O signal from the Clarion coral offers an extended framework of coherent continental hydroclimate and oceanic variability across the Pacific basin beyond the instrumental record. Over the last 200 years, we find clear commonality in the timing, magnitude and spatial expression of variability (illustrated through the NADA Atlas, Cook et al. 2004) amongst the proxy records. The strong relationship between Northeastern Pacific Clarion and the Central Pacific Palmyra record with the North American hydroclimate records can be viewed within the mechanistic framework of the NPGO; this framework is then explored over the last millennium across intervals of varied radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "Automatic seismic event bulletins are generally produced by performing two sequential processing steps: first station processing to find signal detections, then network processing to form events. This processing paradigm differs significantly from that applied by human analysts. Analysts bring to bear considerable human intuition acquired during the processing of past events and use that to iteratively reprocess data resulting in a significantly improved bulletin. Our Iterative Processing Framework (IPF) attempts to mimic analyst behavior during automatic bulletin generation. After a first pass through signal detection and signal association, the resulting events are compared to historical information with the goal of identifying expected signals which are missing from the set of signals currently available, or which are present but erroneous in some respect. Waveform data is reprocessed to improve the set of available signal detections and signal association is repeated when changes are made. The process is repeated until stability is achieved. IPF also introduces seismic events detected using waveform correlation into automatic processing prior to signal association, which can significantly reduce the number of signal detections available to confuse the automatic signal associator. We present results comparing IPF to traditional methods.",

            "abstract": "Estimations of sea level rise over the last centuries are mostly based on the rare historical sea level records from tide gauge stations usually designed for navigational purposes. In this study, we examine the quality of sea level measurements performed by a mean sea level gauge operated in Nice from 1887 to 1909 and transferred to the nearby town of Villefranche-sur-Mer in 1913 where it stayed in operation untill 1974. The mean sea level gauges, called medimaremetres, were invented for geodetic studies and installed in many French ports since the end of the XIX century. By construction, the medimaremetre was connected to the sea through a porous porcelain crucible in order to filter out the tides and higher frequency sea level oscillations. Ucontrolled properties of the crucible and some systematic errors made the medimaremetre data to be ignored in the current sea level researches. We demonstrate that the Nice-Villefranche medimaremetre measurements are coherent with two available historical tide gauge records from Marseille and Genova and a new century-scale sea level series can be build up by combining the medimaremetre data with the those recorded by a tide gauge operating in Nice since the 1980s. We analyse the low frequency variabilities in Marseille, Nice-Villefranche and Genova and get new insights on the decadal sea level variations in the Ligurian Sea since the end of the XIX century.",

In Washington State, much of the drainage system installed in the last several decades uses IDF curves that are outdated by as much as half a century, making the system inadequate and vulnerable for flooding as seen more frequently in recent years. In this study, we have developed new and forward looking rainfall and runoff IDF curves for each county in Washington State using recently observed and projected precipitation data. Regional frequency analysis coupled with Bayesian uncertainty quantification and model averaging methods were used to developed and update the rainfall IDF curves, which were then used in watershed and snow models to develop the runoff IDF curves that explicitly account for effects of snow and drainage characteristic into the IDF curves and related designs. The resulted rainfall and runoff IDF curves provide more reliable, forward looking, and spatially resolved characteristics of storm events that can assist local decision makers and engineers to thoroughly review and/or update the current design standards for urban and rural storm water management infrastructure in order to reduce the potential ramifications of increasing severe storms and resulting floods on existing and planned storm drainage and flood management systems in the state.",

For this reason, rings of enhanced specific humidity at the leading edges of evaporatively driven cold pools have recently received considerable attention. The prevailing theory explains these rings by the water-vapor source from the evaporation of rain drops below cloud base. Their origin is studied in this letter using large-eddy simulations of individual cumulus clouds that rise into a tropical atmosphere over ocean. It is demonstrated that -- in contrast to this theory -- water-vapor rings are primarily explained by surface latent-heat fluxes rather than by the evaporation of rain. This finding implies that conceptual models used in subgrid-scale parameterizations of deep convection should consider the formation of rings of increased specific humidity by the cold-pool-induced enhancement of surface fluxes.",

One data source is the legacy of annual Landsat mosaics from the research of Hansen et al. on global forest dynamics. Following previous research by Hansen et al., BGG observed by Landsat data is defined as a process of land cover change featuring permanent or semi-permanent clearing of vegetation cover by human land use or natural disturbances at the 30-m Landsat pixel scale. A sophisticated method has been developed to capture the change signal from high dimension metrics derived from time series of Landsat spectral bands and continuous bare ground field. By examining the contribution of each metric to the effectiveness of BGG detection, 140 metrics were selected and put into a supervised machine learning algorithm, the bagged classification tree. A recursive strategy was adopted to complete training data and improve result. A global BGG training data set counting to around 27.5 million pixels was produced. Additional training was obtained from regional sources like the bare ground gain layer of Web-enabled Landsat data (WELD) and the impervious surface layer of National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Independent validation was performed by interpreting stratified samples on Google Earth high resolution images.

One data source is the legacy of annual Landsat mosaics from the research of Hansen et al. on global forest dynamics. Following previous research by Hansen et al., BGG observed by Landsat data is defined as a process of land cover change featuring permanent or semi-permanent clearing of vegetation cover by human land use or natural disturbances at the 30-m Landsat pixel scale. A sophisticated method has been developed to capture the change signal from high dimension metrics derived from time series of Landsat spectral bands and continuous bare ground field. By examining the contribution of each metric to the effectiveness of BGG detection, 140 metrics were selected and put into a supervised machine learning algorithm, the bagged classification tree. A recursive strategy was adopted to complete training data and improve result. A global BGG training data set counting to around 27.5 million pixels was produced. Additional training was obtained from regional sources like the bare ground gain layer of Web-enabled Landsat data (WELD) and the impervious surface layer of National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Independent validation was performed by interpreting stratified samples on Google Earth high resolution images. The preliminary results of the first global BGG map will be presented at the meeting with accuracy estimates.",

            "abstract": "Accurate mapping of the composition and ultrastructure of minerals and cells is key to understanding biogeochemical process in contaminated environments. Here we developed two apparatus that allow correlation of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (TEM), synchrotron hard X-ray microprobe (SHXM) and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) datasets. These cryogenic methods enabled precise determination of the distribution, valence state and structure of selenium in intact biofilms sampled during a biostimulation experiment in a contaminated aquifer near Rifle, CO, USA. Results were replicated in the laboratory via anaerobic selenate-reducing enrichment cultures. 16S rRNA analyses of field-derived biofilm indicated the dominance of Betaproteobacteria from the Comamonadaceae family, and uncultivated members of the Simplicispira genus. The major product in field and culture-derived biofilms consists of ~25-300 nm red amorphous Se0 aggregates of colloidal nanoparticles. Correlative analyses of the cultures provided direct evidence for microbial dissimilatory reduction of Se(VI) to Se(IV) to Se0. X-ray diffraction and Se K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy revealed red amorphous Se0 with a first shell Se-Se interatomic distance of 2.339 ± 0.003 Å. STXM showed that these aggregates are strongly associated with a protein-rich biofilm matrix containing acidic polysaccharides. From Rifle groundwater, we isolated a strain that shares 98.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with Dechloromonas aromatica RCB and grows anaerobically by oxidizing acetate and reducing selenate. We refer to this isolate as Dechloromonas selenatis strain RGW99. 3D cryo-electron tomography showed that Se0 particles do not form inside the cytoplasm but rather originate in the cell membrane. The end product of selenate reduction by D. selenatis is 240 ± 66 nm diameter red amorphous Se0 colloidal aggregates. This product was found to be stable for months. Overall, these results established a role for D. selenatis RGW99 in selenate reduction in the Rifle aquifer and provided new insights into the nature and stability of selenium bioreduction products in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "Urban land cover and associated impervious surface area is expected to increase by as much as 50% over the next few decades across substantial portions of the United States. In combination with urban expansion, increases in temperature and changes in precipitation are expected to impact ecosystems through changes in productivity, disturbance and hydrological properties. In this study, we use the NASA Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System Biogeochemical Cycle (TOPS-BGC) model to explore the combined impacts of urbanization and climate change on hydrologic dynamics (snowmelt, runoff, and evapotranspiration) and vegetation carbon uptake (gross productivity). The model is driven using land cover predictions from the Spatially Explicit Regional Growth Model (SERGoM) to quantify projected changes in impervious surface area, and climate projections from the 30 arc-second NASA Earth Exchange Downscaled Climate Projection (NEX-DCP30) dataset derived from the CMIP5 climate scenarios.\nWe present the modeling approach and an analysis of the ecosystem impacts projected to occur in the US, with an emphasis on protected areas in the Great Northern and Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCC). Under the ensemble average of the CMIP5 models and land cover change scenarios for both representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, both LCCs are predicted to experience increases in maximum and minimum temperatures as well as annual average precipitation. In the Great Northern LCC, this is projected to lead to increased annual runoff, especially under RCP 8.5. Earlier melt of the winter snow pack and increased evapotranspiration, however, reduces summer streamflow and soil water content, leading to a net reduction in vegetation productivity across much of the Great Northern LCC, with stronger trends occurring under RCP 8.5. Increased runoff is also projected to occur in the Appalachian LCC under both RCP 4.5 and 8.5. However, under RCP 4.5, the model predicts that the warmer wetter conditions will lead to increases in vegetation productivity across much of the Appalachian LCC, while under RCP 8.5, the effects of increased precipitation are not enough to keep up with increases in evapotranspiration, leading to projected reductions in vegetation productivity for this LCC by the end of this century.",

            "abstract": "A primary advantage of place-based research is the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research that can be applied to a single locale, with a depth of continued study through time. Through the last decade, Lamont-Doherty’s Secondary School Field Research Program (SSFRP) has promoted scientific inquiry, mostly among groups under-represented in STEM fields, in Piermont Marsh, a federally protected marsh in the Hudson estuary. At the same time, Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) scientists have become more involved, through mentoring by researchers, postdocs and graduate students, often paired with high school teachers. The sustained engagement of high school students in a natural environment, experiencing the Hudson River and its tidal cycles, protection of coastline, water quality improvement, native and invasive plant communities, is fundamental to their understanding of the importance of wetlands with their many ecosystem services. In addition, the Program has come to see “place” as inclusive of the Observatory itself. The students’ work at Lamont expands their understanding of educational opportunities and career possibilities. Immersing students in a research atmosphere brings a level of serious inquiry and study to their lives and provides them with concrete contributions that they make to team efforts. Students select existing projects ranging from water quality to Phragmites removal, read papers weekly, take field measurements, produce lab results, and present their research at the end of six weeks. Ongoing results build from year to year in studies of fish populations, nutrients, and carbon sequestration, and the students have presented at professional scientific meetings. Through the Program students gain a sense of ownership over both their natural and the academic environments. Challenges include sustained funding of the program; segmenting the research for reproducible, robust results; fitting the projects to PIs’ research goals, time management, and institutionalization.",

            "abstract": "Alluvial fans are highly heterogeneous due to the complicated depositional processes, which make it difficult to characterize the spatial distributions of the hydraulic conductivity and to evaluate the evolution trends. This study develops a methodology to identify the spatial statistical parameters (mean, variance, correlation range) of the hydraulic conductivity by using the hydraulic and geophysical data. The Chaobai River alluvial fan in the Beijing Plain, China, is used as an example to test the developed methodology for depicting the spatial variations of the alluvial fan. Due to the non-stationary property of the hydraulic conductivity distributions in the alluvial fan, a multi-zone parameterization approach is applied to analyze conductivity statistical properties of different hydrofacies and the composite variance of each zone is computed to describe the evolution of the conductivity along the flow direction of the alluvial fan. Results show that conductivity variances of medium-coarse sand and gravel decrease from Zone 1 to Zone 3 along the flow direction, which is consistent with the scales of the sedimentary transport energy. In the upper zone of the alluvial fan sediments were formed by higher-energy flooding, which induces bad sorting and larger conductivity variances in the sediments. The variance of fine sand also decreases from Zone 1 to Zone 3. The variances of the sub-clay and clay increase from the upper zone of the alluvial fan to the lower zone, where multiple layers of the sub-clay and clay formed by different flooding events have quite different conductivity distributions and statistical properties. With a much larger thickness in the lower zone, the vertical variations of conductivity contribute mainly to the relatively increased variance. The result of this study will provide insight for understanding conductivity heterogeneity and a method for characterizing the conductivity spatial distributions in alluvial fans.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster_JAC.pdf\nThe stability of residually trapped CO2 is often taken for granted in the simulation studies used for predicting the long-term fate of CO2 in geological storage reservoirs. Ostwald ripening is one of the mechanisms that could potentially remobilize residually trapped CO2. This would cause the gradual growth of ganglia with low capillary pressures, at the expense of ganglia with higher capillary pressure. Ostwald ripening will be driven by differences in capillary pressure between ganglia, and subsequent diffusion of dissolved CO2 through the aqueous phase. Therefore, a critical question is to understand the distribution of capillary pressure in isolated ganglia. The goal of this study is to develop reliable methods for estimating capillary pressure of individual ganglia of gases that are trapped during imbibition. Multi-resolution X-ray microtomography datasets from air-water spontaneous imbibition experiments in sintered glass beads and sandstone samples with voxel sizes varying from 0.64 to 4.44 µm were acquired at the Advanced Light Source, in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. A series of computational techniques to estimate curvature at the interface between two immiscible fluids in porous were developed. In a first step, isosurfaces are extracted using resources from MATLAB’s Image Processing Toolbox or the Avizo software suite resulting in a triagonal mesh representing the considered surfaces. A second step is to identify and separate the interfaces between each of the three phases. The mesh is then smoothed and its curvature is estimated.\nThe sensitivity of results to different curvature estimation and smoothing techniques is studied. Estimating curvature on unsmoothed meshes shows a high degree of sensitivity to the resolution of the images, as well as the method chosen to calculate curvature. When the mesh is smoothed using a heat diffusion method however, curvature estimation using different methods and resolutions converges, as verified by calculating the standard deviation of the point-by-point difference in curvature values.\nThree-dimensional visualization of a curvature calculation comparison on the surface of a disconnected ganglion in sintered glass beads (top/bottom: low/high resolution, left/right: raw/smoothed mesh)",

            "abstract": "As climate warms and ice margin positions recede, Greenland ice retreat is driven by changing forcings. With a focus on southwest Greenland, we review the current understanding of these retreat drivers from the end of the last glaciation through the late Holocene. Shortly after the glacial maximum, ice margins withdrew rapidly from the continental shelf break, responding to small increases in insolation and/or eustatic sea level. For the next several thousand years, little net margin migration is observed. Then, just prior to the start of the Holocene, the southwestern Greenland ice sheet retreated onto the modern coastline. There, marine-terminating outlet glaciers thinned and retreated more quickly than did land-based ice. At the same time, the Labrador Sea experienced warming that led into its early Holocene maximum temperatures. This suggests that the rapid retreat of marine-terminating outlet glaciers was driven by a warming ocean. Transitioning into the early Holocene, southwest Greenland ice margins responded to relatively strong radiative forcing and withdrew inside their present-day positions. After a subsequent advance during the mid- to late-Holocene Neoglacial, outlet glaciers retreated at different times over a ~2,000 year period. In some instances, this retreat was forced by warming after the Little Ice Age (LIA). In other cases, retreat may have been driven by local topography and/or local, pre-LIA climate changes. While questions remain, the magnitude of past southwest Greenland ice response to different retreat forcings can inform our projections of future retreat.",

Croplands will take on the responsibility to support approximate 60% increase in food production by 2050 as FAO estimates. In addition to nutrient supply to plants, cropland soils also play a major source and sink of greenhouse gases regulating global climate system. It is a big challenge to understand how soils function under global changes, but it is also a great opportunity for agricultural sector to manage soils to assure sustainability of agroecosystems and mitigate climate change. Previous studies have attempted to investigate the impacts of different land uses and climates on cropland soil carbon storage. However, large uncertainty still exists in magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of global cropland soil organic carbon, due to the lack of reliable environmental databases and relatively poorly understanding of multiple controlling factors involved climate change and land use etc. Here, we use a process-based agroecosystem model (DLEM-Ag) in combination with diverse data sources to quantify magnitude and tempo-spatial patterns of soil carbon storage in global croplands during 1901-2010. We also analyze the relative contributions of major environmental variables (climate change, land use and management etc.). Our results indicate that intensive land use management may hidden the vulnerability of cropland soils to climate change in some regions, which may greatly weaken soil carbon sequestration under future climate change.",

[2] present simulations of line-tied asymmetric magnetic reconnection that make a falsifiable prediction regarding the handedness of rolling motions of flux ropes during solar eruptions. Mass motions in prominence eruptions tend to be complicated, and characterizing these motions is a challenge. We use the AIA filament eruption catalog [3] as a source for finding events. If rolling motions are detected then we will investigate the handedness prediction. We use magnetograms from HMI to determine the strength and asymmetric properties of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld in the regions of interest and will use AIA observations to determine the handedness of the rolling motions. We then compare the photospheric magnetic information with the handedness to determine if there is a relationship between the two. The AIA filament eruption catalog is a great source for finding events, but it lacks a chirality determination. We aim to add these determinations and then compare the chirality with the directionality of the twisting/rolling motions.\n[1] O. Panasenco, S. Martin, A. D. Joshi, & N. Srivastava, J. Atmos.

            "abstract": "CLIVAR support has been essential in the development of the Linear Inverse Model (LIM), an empirical dynamical model that can be used to both diagnose and predict climate variability on time scales as short as a week and as long as a decade. The LIM is an approximation of chaotic weather and climate variability that assumes that, under certain conditions, predictability within the system reduces to multivariate linear dynamics forced by unpredictable noise. This assumption is testable, and for those systems where it is demonstrated to be appropriate, LIM forecasts are competitive with state-of-the-art numerical forecast models. Over the course of more than twenty years of research, LIM has been developed as a forecast tool in parallel with its development for basic research in climate diagnosis, and has now reached the point where it is being transitioned to the Climate Predictions Center (CPC) as a part of their new Weeks 3 and 4 operational forecasting effort. In this presentation, we will discuss the development of the LIM as a CLIVAR-funded research effort, how it is being transitioned to CPC operations, and its part in the larger CPC subseasonal forecasting effort.",

Thus, in addition to the pressure from human impact in the deltas, changes far upstream are tightly linked to effects downstream. The Global-NEWS approach has explored scenarios along storylines that influence future nutrient fluxes, and if highlighted for individual delta, reveals large differences in future change, with most of the influence being attributed to factors such as land use change or increased damming. Notably the latter factor has received recent attention with regards to nutrient fluxes, and phosphorus (P) in particular (Maavara et al. in review): the largest increases in P retention by reservoirs, between 2000 and 2030, are expected to occur in the Yangtze, Mekong, Amazon and Ganges-Brahmaputra river basins. Here, we discuss how Global-NEWS and other approaches assess these future changes in nutrient fluxes, and how the expected new boom in dam construction can influence these fluxes to deltas world-wide.",

            "abstract": "It is hypothesized that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) inhalation can catalytically generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in excess of the body’s antioxidant capacity, leading to oxidative stress and ultimately adverse health. PM2.5 emissions from different sources vary widely in chemical composition, with varied effects on the body. Here, the ability of mixtures of different sources of PM2.5 to generate ROS and associations of this capability with acute health effects were investigated. A dithiothreitol (DTT) assay that integrates over different sources was used to quantify ROS generation potential of ambient water-soluble PM2.5 in Atlanta from June 2012 - June 2013. PM2.5 source impacts, estimated using the Chemical Mass Balance method with ensemble-averaged source impact profiles, were related to DTT activity using a linear regression model, which provided information on intrinsic DTT activity (i.e., toxicity) of each source. The model was then used to develop a time series of daily DTT activity over a ten-year period (1998-2010) for use in an epidemiologic study. Light-duty gasoline vehicles exhibited the highest intrinsic DTT activity, followed by biomass burning and heavy-duty diesel vehicles. Biomass burning contributed the largest fraction to total DTT activity, followed by gasoline and diesel vehicles (45%, 20% and 14%, respectively). These results suggest the importance of aged oxygenated organic aerosols and metals in ROS generation. Epidemiologic analyses found significant associations between estimated DTT activity and emergency department visits for congestive heart failure and asthma/wheezing attacks in the 5-county Atlanta area. Estimated DTT activity was the only pollutant measure out of PM2.5, O3, and PM2.5 constituents elemental carbon and organic carbon) that exhibited a significant link to congestive heart failure. In two-pollutant models, DTT activity was significantly associated with asthma/wheeze and congestive heart failure while PM2.5 was not, which supports the hypothesis that PM2.5 health effects are, in part, due to oxidative stress and that DTT activity may be a better indicator of some aerosol-related health effects than PM2.5 mass.",

            "abstract": "JPL's Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (MSPI) development effort is aimed at advancing our understanding of the climate and air quality impacts of airborne particles. Three photoelastic modulator (PEM)-based cameras have been built with the aim of acquiring high-accuracy multispectral images of intensity and linear polarization. The ground-based and airborne GroundMSPI and AirMSPI acquire multiangle images in the ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared, and measure polarization at 470, 660, and 865 nm. AirMSPI-2 extends the approach into the shortwave infrared, adding polarization channels at 1620 and 2185 nm. MSPI observations are being used to develop data processing algorithms for retrieval of aerosol and cloud properties. Data include ground-based imagery to validate assumptions used to characterize surface bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs), namely, spectral invariance in the angular shape of the BRFs and absolute magnitude of the polarized BRF (pBRF). GroundMSPI measurements show that many surfaces satisfy these conditions, providing valuable constraints on the multivariate aerosol-surface retrieval problem. Algorithms for retrieval of aerosol optical and microphysical properties are being applied to AirMSPI data acquired during several airborne field campaigns, including PODEX and SEAC4RS. We explore the information content of different combinations of view angles, spectral bands, and polarimetric channels by using subsets of AirMSPI observations coincident with ground-based or airborne validation datasets, enabling direct association of particular measurement capabilities with retrieval accuracies and sensitivities. In preparation for the ORACLES Earth Venture Suborbital field campaign to be conducted off the west coast of Africa in 2016, retrievals of aerosols above stratocumulus clouds using constraints on cloud reflectance through polarimetric observations of the backscatter glory and supernumerary bows are also being tested and refined.",

We propose an approach to quantify such processes using mixing calculations. The methodology consists of the following steps: (1) identification of the recharge sources (end-members) and selection of the species (conservative and non-conservative) to be used, (2) identification of the chemical processes and (3) evaluation of mixing ratios including the chemical processes. This methodology has been applied in the Besòs River Delta (NE Barcelona, Spain), where the River Besòs is the main aquifer recharge source. A total number of 51 groundwater samples were collected from July 2007 to May 2010 during four field campaigns. Three river end-members were necessary to explain the temporal variability of the River Besòs: one river end-member is from the wet periods (W1) and two are from dry periods (D1 and D2). This methodology has proved to be useful not only to compute the mixing ratios but also to quantify processes such as calcite and magnesite dissolution, aerobic respiration and denitrification undergone at each observation point",

            "abstract": "Global livestock production is heterogeneous, and its benefits and costs vary widely across global contexts. Extensive grazing lands (or rangelands) constitute the vast majority of the land dedicated to livestock production globally, but they are relatively minor contributors to livestock-related environmental impacts. Indeed, the greatest potential for environmental damage in these lands lies in their potential for conversion to other uses, including agriculture, mining, energy production and urban development. Managing such conversion requires improving the sustainability of livestock production in the face of fragmentation, ecological and economic marginality and climate change.\nWe present research from Mongolia and the United States demonstrating methods of improving outcomes on rangelands by improving the fit between the scales of social and biophysical processes. Especially in arid and semi-arid settings, rangelands exhibit highly variable productivity over space and time and non-linear or threshold dynamics in vegetation; climate change is projected to exacerbate these challenges and, in some cases, diminish overall productivity. Policy and governance frameworks that enable landscape-scale management and administration enable range livestock producers to adapt to these conditions. Similarly, livestock breeds that have evolved to withstand climate and vegetation change improve producers’ prospects in the face of increasing variability and declining productivity. A focus on the relationships among primary production, animal production, spatial connectivity, and scale must underpin adaptation strategies in rangelands.",

            "abstract": "Satellites capture the rate and character of environmental change from local to global levels, yet integrating these changes into flood exposure models can be cost or time prohibitive. We explore an approach to global flood modeling by leveraging satellite data with computing power in Google Earth Engine to dynamically map flood hazards. Our research harnesses satellite imagery in two main ways: first to generate a globally consistent flood inundation layer and second to dynamically model flood vulnerability.\nAccurate and relevant hazard maps rely on high quality observation data. Advances in publicly available spatial, spectral, and radar data together with cloud computing allow us to improve existing efforts to develop a comprehensive flood extent database to support model training and calibration. This talk will demonstrate the classification results of algorithms developed in Earth Engine designed to detect flood events by combining observations from MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-1. Our method to derive flood footprints increases the number, resolution, and precision of spatial observations for flood events both in the US, recorded in the NCDC (National Climatic Data Center) storm events database, and globally, as recorded events from the Colorado Flood Observatory database.\nThis improved dataset can then be used to train machine learning models that relate spatial temporal flood observations to satellite derived spatial temporal predictor variables such as precipitation, antecedent soil moisture, and impervious surface. This modeling approach allows us to rapidly update models with each new flood observation, providing near real time vulnerability maps.\nWe will share the water detection algorithms used with each satellite and discuss flood detection results with examples from Bihar, India and the state of New York. We will also demonstrate how these flood observations are used to train machine learning models and estimate flood exposure. The final stage of our comprehensive approach to flood vulnerability couples inundation extent with social data to determine which flood exposed communities have the greatest propensity for loss. Specifically, by linking model outputs to census derived social vulnerability estimates (Indian and US, respectively) to predict how many people are at risk.",

            "abstract": "Global cycling of volatile elements (H2O, CO2, F, S, Cl) via subduction to deep mantle followed by entrainment and melting within ascending mantle plumes is an enigmatic process that controls key aspects of hot spot volcanism (i.e. melting rate, magma supply, degassing, eruptive style). Variations in radiogenic isotope ratios (e.g.187Os/188Os) at hot spots such as Hawaii reveal magmatic processes within deep-seated mantle plumes (e.g. mantle heterogeneity, lithology, and melt transport). Shield-stage lavas from Hawaii likely originate from a mixed plume source containing peridotite and recycled oceanic crust (pyroxenite) based on variations of radiogenic isotopes. Hawaiian lavas display correlations among isotopes, major and trace elements [1] that might be expected to have an expression in the volatile elements. To investigate this link, we present Os isotopic ratios (n=51), and major, trace, and volatile elements from 1003 olivine-hosted melt inclusions (MI) and their host minerals from tephra from Koolau, Mauna Loa, Hualalai, Kilauea, and Loihi volcanoes. The data show a strong correlation between MI volatile contents and incompatible trace element ratios (La/Yb) with Os isotopes of the same host olivines and reveal large-scale volatile heterogeneity and zonation exists within the Hawaiian plume. ‘Loa’ chain lavas, which are thought to originate from greater proportions of recycled oceanic crust/pyroxenite, have MIs with lower H2O, S, F, and Cl contents compared to ‘Kea’ chain lavas that were derived from more peridotite-rich sources. The depletion of volatile elements in the ‘Loa’ volcano MIs can be explained if they tapped an ancient dehydrated oceanic crust component within the Hawaiian plume. Higher extents of melting beneath ‘Loa’ volcanoes can also explain these depletions. The presence of dehydrated recycled mafic material in the plume source suggests that subduction effectively devolatilizes part of the oceanic crust. These results are similar to the observed shifts in H2O/Ce ratios near the Easter and Samoan hotspots [2,3]. Thus, it appears that multiple hotspots may record relative H2O depletions and possibly other volatiles. [1] Hauri et al. 1996, Nature 382, 415-419.

Moreover, interpreting and understanding the processes that dictate the production and consumption of these gases will allow for proper management of GHGs in order to mitigate its detrimental climate effects. Presence of oxygen, or lack of it, is the driving force for determining pathways within biochemical redox reactions. Experiments to find correlations between oxygen and greenhouse gases have helped us understand photosynthesis, denitrification and beyond. Within the past few years measurements of O2 and nitrous oxide have been used over a wide ranging array of disciplines; from studying avenues for redox chemistry to characterizing gas profiles in sputum of cystic fibrosis patients. We present a full analysis solution, based on cavity ring-down spectroscopy, for simultaneous measurements of N2O, CO2, CH4, H2O, NH3, and O2 concentrations in soil flux, in order to better understand dynamics of ecological and biogeochemical processes. The stability and high temporal resolution of the five-species CRDS analyzer, coupled with a continuous high-precision O2 measurement (1-σ <200ppm) produces a complete picture of biogeochemical processes, for which a multitude of additional research experiments can be conceived. Adding another dimension to explore to help determine the rate at which these greenhouse gases are produced or consumed, allows scientists to further address fundamental scientific questions. Data is presented showing precision, drift and limitations of the O2 sensor measurement as well as the validity of spectroscopic corrections with the CRDS analyzer caused by changing O2. Experimental data is also presented to explore correlations of soil respiration rates of N2O, CO2 and CH4 due to differing soil O2 contents at varying timescales from minutes to days.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_poster_2015_no_map_01_landscape.pdf\nUsing the open channel diel method of Odum (1956) and the night-time regression method (Hornberger and Kelly, 1985), we analysed a time series of dissolved oxygen (DO) in two slow flowing streams for a two month period in summer 2014 and obtained values for ecosystem respiration and the aeration constant for each day in the period. We then used the standard dissolved oxygen lumped model to generate a DO time series behaviour for one of those rivers selecting respiration and aeration parameters by randomly sampling from the values obtained from the data. Two synthetic time series were created, one where respiration and aeration were independent of temperature and a second where respiration and aeration were affected by temperature according to the modified Arrhenius relationship. With these two synthetic time series, we again recovered the respiration and aeration input parameters using the night- time regression method and compared those recovered parameters with the input parameters. Because the simulations were conducted with parameters that were known, the values recovered using the night-time regression method (i.e post-simulation) could be compared with parameters driving the simulation (i.e. pre-simulation input values). For values based on data, we found a strong correlation between the aeration constant and respiration for both rivers. For the synthetic time series, no such correlation was found, either with the temperature independent or temperature dependent time series. The night-time regression method also recovered perfectly the input parameters, so the correlation was not brought about as a result of implementing the method itself. We are currently investigating the cause of the correlation.",

To support our home institution and others in the region, we offer services to researchers at all stages of the data lifecycle—from grant application and data management planning to data distribution and archive. In this role, we recognize the need to work closely with other data management efforts at partner institutions and agencies, as well as with larger aggregation efforts such as our state geospatial data clearinghouses, data.gov, DataONE, and others.\nIn the past, one of our challenges with monolithic, prepackaged data management solutions is that customization can be difficult to implement and maintain, especially as new versions of the software are released that are incompatible with our local codebase. Our solution is to break the monolith up into its constituent parts, which offers us several advantages. First, any customizations that we make are likely to fall into areas that can be accessed through Application Program Interfaces (API) that are likely to remain stable over time, so our code stays compatible. Second, as components become obsolete or insufficient to meet new demands that arise, we can replace the individual components with minimal effect on the rest of the infrastructure, causing less disruption to operations. Other advantages include increased system reliability, staggered rollout of new features, enhanced compatibility with legacy systems, reduced dependence on a single software company as a point of failure, and the separation of development into manageable tasks.\nIn this presentation, we describe our application of the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) design paradigm to assemble a data repository that conforms to the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) ",

It is constituted of Oligocene granodiorites intruding Eocene tuff deposits and andesitic lava flows. The eastern and western parts of the island are covered with Miocene limestone (Terre-Basses and Tintamarre islet). The igneous rocks outcrop in the central part of the island. As a response to tropical weathering, the coarse grain granodiorites are deeply eroded and form depressions. The very fine-grained tuffs are on the contrary forming crests and hilltops. At Fort Hill, immediately west of Philipsburg city, the metamorphised tuffs are extending North-South, following the direction of the contact with the granodiorite that form the base of the hill. The granodiorite is quartz bearing and its magmatic prismation is well developed. It shows fractures in both directions, parallel and perpendicular to the contact (i.e. north-south and east-west). Being in the hill-slope orientation, the contact parallel fractures are re-activated into normal faults. Several blocks are individualized, sliding downhill towards the first houses. In this work, we present a geological sketch of the Fort Hill landslide and its applications with regard to disaster mitigation. We also present ongoing satellite survey of deformation through time.

Access to up-to-date scientific data and basic climate literacy are essential tools to enable community members to make informed decisions about their own coast.\nOcean Networks Canada (ONC) operates the world-leading NEPTUNE and VENUS cabled ocean observatories off the west coast of British Columbia (BC). ONC also operates smaller, coastal community observatories which provide data for both scientific and educational initiatives.\nThe first Arctic community observatory, deployed in 2012, is located in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut. Real-time data flowing from the platform are collected by a range of instruments, including a conductivity-temperature-depth sensor (CTD), hydrophone, video camera, and an ice profiler. There is also a meteorological station and time lapse camera on the dock.  Five additional community observatories are being installed over the next year along the coast of BC. Indigenous communities, including the Inuit population in Cambridge Bay and First Nations on BC’s north and central coast, are key partners and collaborators of this initiative.\nBenefits to communities from cabled observatory ocean monitoring can only be achieved if the data collected are relevant to community members and contribute to research priorities identified within the community. The data must be easily accessible and complement existing environmental monitoring initiatives. Community members must possess knowledge and tools to analyze and interpret the data for their purposes. For these reasons, community involvement is critical to the project, including the design of user interfaces for data access, development of educational programs, and long-term planning.\nHere we describe Ocean Networks Canada’s community initiatives including collaboration with Indigenous knowledge holders and local experts, programs in community schools to foster K-12 climate literacy and post-secondary programs targeted to community members.",

            "abstract": "In rural areas where farming competes with urban development and environmental amenities, urban and forest transitions occur simultaneously at different locales with different rates due to the underlying socio-economic shifts. Here we develop an interactive land use transition agent-based model (ILUTABM) in which farmers’ land use decisions are made contingent on expansion and location choices of urban businesses and urban residences, as well as farmers’ perceived ecosystem services produced by their land holdings. The ILUTABM simulates heterogeneity in land use decisions at parcel levels by differentiating decision making processes for agricultural and urban landowners. Landowners are simulated to make land-use transition decisions as bounded rational agents that maximize their partial expected utility functions under different underlying socio-economic conditions given the category of a landowner and the spatial characteristics of the landowner’s landholdings. The ILUTABM is parameterized by spatial data sets such as National Land Cover Database (NLCD), zoning, parcels, property prices, US census, farmers surveys, building/facility characteristics, soil, slope and elevation. We then apply the ILUTABM to the rural Vermont landscape, located in the Northeast Arm District of Lake Champlain and the downstream sub-watersheds of Missisquoi River, to generate phase transitions of rural land towards urban land near peri-urban areas and towards forest land near financially stressed farmlands during 2001-2051. Possible tipping point trajectories of rural land towards regional forest or urban transition are simulated under three socio-economic scenarios: business as usual (ILUTABM calibrated to 2011 NLCD), increased incentives for conservation easements, and increased incentives for attracting urban residences and businesses.",

To date, UV transparency of these rock types have not been fully characterized, and we have performed a systematic study to better constrain the UV attenuation over a wide range of materials relevant to Mars.\nAt one point during the history of Mars, the surface may have been habitable, with flowing liquid water and access to food and energy sources. As surface conditions changed, it is not unreasonable to assume that life would have migrated into the protected interior of porous rocks, veins, fissures, and the subsurface as a means to protect itself from harsh surface conditions, such as the UV flux that we observe today. Given geological time, the depth that UV light penetrates into the subsurface will play a role in altering and/or effecting the preservation of organic molecule containing biosignatures. However, the extent to which various rock types can shield organic material currently is not well understood.\nIn addition to constraining the UV-driven habitable “zone”, the data also helps constrain the SHERLOC instrument limits of detection. SHERLOC is a deep UV fluorescence and Raman imaging instrument. This is achieved by spatially scanning a deep UV laser at 248.6 nm to stimulate fluorescence emissions and Raman scattering from the sample. Specifically, fluorescence is generated from electronic transition from aromatic organics and Raman scatter is generated from vibrational bonds from both organics and minerals. Given the excitation wavelength, and the emission/scattering wavelengths (250-350), the mineral transparency will affect the interrogation volume of analysis and thus constrain the limits of detection.\nWe will report on the attenuation of both Raman and Fluorescence signals through natural rock samples selected based on relevance to Martian surface mineralogy. These samples have been prepared as thin sections of known thickness from 30-1000 μm. Samples analyzed include various naturally occurring basalts, basaltic sandstones and evaporites.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - 2015.12.15.AGU Poster Final.pdf\nUrban flood modeling at the watershed scale carries unique challenges in routing complexity, data resolution, social and political issues, and land surface – infrastructure interactions. The ability to accurately trace and predict the flow of water through the urban landscape enables better emergency response management, floodplain mapping, and data for future urban infrastructure planning and development. These services are of growing importance as urban population is expected to continue increasing by 1.84% per year for the next 25 years, increasing the vulnerability of urban regions to damages and loss of life from floods. Although a range of watershed-scale models have been applied in specific urban areas to examine these issues, there is a trend towards national scale hydrologic modeling enabled by supercomputing resources to understand larger system-wide hydrologic impacts and feedbacks. As such it is important to address how urban landscapes can be represented in large scale modeling processes. The current project investigates how coupling terrain and infrastructure routing can improve flow prediction and flooding events over the urban landscape. We utilize the WRF-Hydro modeling framework and a high-resolution terrain routing grid with the goal of compiling standard data needs necessary for fine scale urban modeling and dynamic flood forecasting in the urban setting. The city of Denver is selected as a case study, as it has experienced several large flooding events in the last five years and has an urban annual population growth rate of 1.5%, one of the highest in the U.S. Our work highlights the hydro-informatic challenges associated with linking channel networks and drainage infrastructure in an urban area using the WRF-Hydro modeling framework and high resolution urban models for short-term flood prediction.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude of warming predicted for the Arctic is much higher than elsewhere on the planet. Methane emissions from Arctic wetlands may contribute to a positive feedback loop in global atmospheric warming dynamics. Understanding the inputs, outputs, pool size and pertinent controls on production and release will be critical for making accurate predictions about how Arctic methane cycling will affect global climate change. The goal of the research presented here is to investigate the springtime shoulder season with regard to methane flux, physical and chemical soil characteristics, and abundances of methanogenic precursors. This time period coincides with rapid lowering of the thaw depth and water table with the onset of the growing season. Significant shifts in soil organic carbon constituents and alternative electron acceptors occur during this time period as well as a sharp increase in methane flux observed at the landscape level. From June 16th to June 27th, 2015, on the Barrow Environmental Observatory in Barrow, Alaska, methane and carbon dioxide chamber fluxes were measured and soil chemical properties were recorded on alternating days. Additionally, soil pore water was collected every day as well as thaw depth and water table measurements. This study was replicated across 20 plots representing 4 microtopographic polygon features. Interestingly, this study site experienced exceptionally high late-spring / early-summer air temperatures, making the data presented here useful for predicting future conditions under a warming Arctic climate scenario. Results from this study indicate a sharp increase in methane flux with increasing thaw depth, followed by a plateau in methane flux with a lowering of the water table and an increase in soil conductivity. Methane flux dynamics may be due to release of frozen soil methane stores during thaw down, a change in the concentration and oxidation state of alternative electron acceptors, a nutrient pulse of methanogenic precursors in soil pore water, stimulation and/or inhibition of methanogenic and methanotrophic microbial groups, or a combination of some or all of these factors. Chemical analysis of pore water samples is ongoing and should shed light on the role of alternative electron acceptors and methanogenic precursors during this important transition period.",

In Japan, a probability method based on precipitation data is used to define the scale of design flood: Tone River, the biggest river in Japan, is 1 in 200 years, Shinano River is 1 in 150 years, and so on. It is one of important socio-hydrological issue how to set reasonable and acceptable design flood in a changing world.\nThe method to set design flood vary among countries. Although the probability method is also used in Netherland, but the base data is water level or discharge data and the probability is 1 in 1250 years (in fresh water section). On the other side, USA and China apply the maximum flood method which set the design flood based on the historical or probable maximum flood. This cases can leads a question: “what is the reason why the method vary among countries?” or “why does Japan use the probability method?” The purpose of this study is to clarify the historical process which the probability method was developed in Japan based on the literature.\nIn the late 19the century, the concept of “discharge” and modern river engineering were imported by Dutch engineers, and modern flood prevention plans were developed in Japan. In these plans, the design floods were set based on the historical maximum method. Although the historical maximum method had been used until World War 2, however, the method was changed to the probability method after the war because of limitations of historical maximum method under the specific socio-economic situations: (1) the budget limitation due to the war and the GHQ occupation, (2) the historical floods: Makurazaki typhoon in 1945, Kathleen typhoon in 1947, Ione typhoon in 1948, and so on, attacked Japan and broke the record of historical maximum discharge in main rivers and the flood disasters made the flood prevention projects difficult to complete. Then, Japanese hydrologists imported the hydrological probability statistics from the West to take account of socio-economic situation in design flood, and they applied to Japanese rivers in 1958. The probability method was applied Japan to adapt the specific socio-economic and natural situation during the confusion after the war.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies show that the distribution of projected climate sensitivity (CS) is highly asymmetric with large tails towards higher temperatures, leaving open an uncomfortably large possibility of CS > 4.5oC. Central to the estimation of CS is the distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere, which directly affects the water vapor feedback and indirectly drives the cloud feedback. Yet, a plethora of studies report large discrepancies between models and observations of the tropical humidity climatology and its vertical distribution. Our preliminary results indicate that the tropical humidity climatology derived from Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (GPSRO) observations are in excellent agreement with NASA’s Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). We will present the time series of tropospheric water vapor using GPSRO data sets from 2006 onwards, and will compare our results with different sources such as the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). We will carefully quantify the statistical differences among the series to identify and document biases among the data sets. Finally, we will correlate the aforementioned humidity series with surface temperature climatologies in order to estimate the variability of water vapor in response to temperature fluctuations, dq/dTs, which is directly related to the water vapor feedback. Current research indicates that GPSRO data sets can capture the amount of water vapor in very dry and very moist air more efficiently than other observing platforms, possibly suggesting larger water vapor feedback than previously known. Inter–comparing the dq/dTs among the different data sets will provide us with an additional constraint on the water vapor feedback. The critical role of the up–coming Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC–2) mission in late 2016, in characterizing the tropical humidity climatology and the associated climate feedbacks, will be discussed.",

This study presents observations of atmospheric sea-salt size distributions in the range 0.7 < rd < 14 μm based on external impaction of sea-spray aerosol particles onto microscope polycarbonate microscope slides. The slides have very large sample volumes, typically about 250 L over a 10-second sampling period. This provides unprecedented sampling of giant sea-salt particles for flights in marine boundary layer air.\nThe slides were subsequently analyzed in a humidified chamber using dual optical digital microscopy. At a relative humidity of 90% the sea-salt aerosol particles form spherical cap drops. Based on measurement the volume of the spherical cap drop and assuming NaCl composition, the Kohler equation is used to derive the dry salt mass of tens of thousands of individual aerosol particles on each slide. Size distributions are given with a 0.2 μm resolution.\nThe slides were exposed from the NSF/NCAR C-130 research aircraft during the 2008 VOCALS project off the coast of northern Chile and the 2011 ICE-T in the Caribbean. In each deployment, size distributions using hundreds of slides are used to relate fitted log-normal size distributions parameters to wind speed, altitude and other atmospheric conditions. The size distributions provide a unique observational set for initializing cloud models with coarse-mode aerosol particle observations for marine atmospheres.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the nonpoint source pollutant loads and assessing the water quality benefits of conservation practices (BMPs) are prone to different types of uncertainties which have to be taken into account when developing nutrient trading programs. Although various types of modeling uncertainties (parameter, input and structure) have been examined in the literature more or less, the impact of modeling uncertainties on evaluation of BMPs has not been addressed sufficiently. Currently, “trading ratios” are used within nutrient trading programs to account for variability of nonpoint source loads. However, we were not able to find any case of some rigorous scientific approach to account for any type of uncertainties in trading ratios. In this study, Bayesian inferences were applied to incorporate input, parameter and structural uncertainties using a statistically valid likelihood function. IPEAT (Integrated Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis Tool), a framework developed for simultaneous evaluation of parameterization, input data, model structure, and observation data uncertainty and their contribution to predictive uncertainty was used to quantify the uncertainties in effectiveness of agricultural BMPs while propagating different sources of uncertainty. SWAT was used as the simulation model. SWAT parameterization was done for three different model structures (SCS CN I, SCS CN II and G&A methods) using a Bayesian based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method named Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM). For each model structure, the Integrated Bayesian Uncertainty Estimator (IBUNE) was employed to generate latent variables from input data. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was then used to combine the models and Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization technique was used to estimate the BMA weights. Using this framework, the impact of different sources of uncertainty on nutrient loads from nonpoint sources and subsequently effectiveness of BMPs in reducing them was assessed and bands of uncertainty around BMP efficiencies were determined. Moreover, using the predicted cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for nonpoint loads (Agriculture) and CDFs of observed loads for point sources (WWTPs), trading ratios for specific trades were determined under uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is likely to affect mountainous areas unevenly due to the complex interactions between topography, vegetation, and the accumulation of snow and ice. This heterogeneity will complicate relationships between species presence and large-scale drivers such as precipitation and make predicting habitat extent and connectivity much more difficult. We studied the potential for fine-scale variation in climate and habitat use throughout the year in the American pika (Ochotona princeps), a talus specialist of mountainous western North America known for strong microhabitat affiliation. Not all areas of talus are likely to be equally hospitable, which may reduce connectivity more than predicted by large-scale occupancy drivers. We used high resolution remotely sensed data to create metrics of the terrain and land cover in the Niwot Ridge (NWT) LTER site in Colorado. We hypothesized that pikas preferentially use heterogeneous terrain, as it might foster greater snow accumulation, and used radio telemetry to test this with radio-collared pikas. Pikas use heterogeneous terrain during snow covered periods and less heterogeneous area during the summer. This suggests that not all areas of talus habitat are equally suitable as shelter from extreme conditions but that pikas need more than just shelter from winter cold. With those results we created a predictive map using the same habitat metrics to model the extent of suitable habitat across the NWT area. These strong effects of terrain on pika habitat use and territory occupancy show the great utility that high resolution remotely sensed data can have in ecological applications. With increasing effects of climate change in mountainous regions, this modeling approach is crucial for quantifying habitat connectivity at both small and large scales and to identify potential refugia for threatened or isolated species.",

While the observed pressure of such polyamorphic transition in the Ce-base binary BMG is not very sensitive to its composition based on some of the previous studies[\n2\n,\n3\n], this study indicates that such transition pressure increases considerably when a new component is added to the system. In the electrical conductivity measurement, a significant resistance change was observed in the pressure range coupled to polyamorphic transition. More discussions will be given regarding the electrical conductivity behavior of this system under high pressure to illustrate the delocalization of 4f electrons as the origin of the observed polyamorphic transition.\n",

Low solubility of HSEs in silicate melts and the small size of samples obtained from diamond anvil cell (DAC) experiments have prevented the experimental study of the partitioning of these elements at realistic deep magma ocean conditions. In this study, we present results for metal-silicate partitioning experiments of sulfur and platinum conducted at pressures between 45 and 80 GPa and at temperatures from 3500 to 4200 K. With the nanoSIMS as our main tool for measuring trace element concentrations, we have developed a protocol for studying the partitioning behavior of these elements from samples that underwent equilibration at high pressure and temperatures in a Laser-Heated DAC. The nanoSIMS has the spatial resolution and the required sensitivity to measure the low concentration of some HSEs in the quenched silicate glass. The results of this study will help to refine current core-mantle differentiation models. Furthermore they add constraints to the contribution of the late veneer to the mantle's elemental abundances.",

            "abstract": "The Humu’ula Groundwater Research Project was undertaken on the Island of Hawaii in an effort to characterize the hydrologic structures controlling groundwater movement and storage within Saddle region between Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea volcanoes. In 2013, the project drilled a 1764 m, continuously-cored, borehole from an elevation of 1946 m amsl near the center of the Saddle, and has now completed a second borehole at an elevation of 1645 m on the western edge of the Saddle. Although the stratigraphy of the rocks is similar, dominantly pahoehoe lava flows with somewhat fewer a’a lavas and occasional dike rock intervals, the hydrologic character of the formation in the latter is distinctly different from the former. Whereas the former test hole encountered a few high elevation perched aquifers that were underlain by an inferred regional, dike-impounded, water table at an elevation of 1390 m amsl, the latter bore encountered a sequence of confined aquifers with heads substantially higher than depth of entry. The shallowest of the confined aquifers was encountered at an elevation of 1340 m and showed a hydrostatic head of >160 m when the capping formation was breached. Deeper confined aquifers showed initial heads of > 400 m although none had heads sufficient to discharge at the surface. Most of the confined aquifers were associated with clay-rich ash beds that mantled the more permeable lavas however one of the deeper confined zones, that showed the highest head, was associated with a highly compacted breccia zone that has tentatively been ascribed to an explosive deposit. Chemical analysis of the clasts within this layer is underway to determine whether this deposit is associated with explosive activity of Mauna Kea or with another volcano on the island. Previous geophysical surveys have suggested that these confined aquifers may extend well down the leeward slopes of Mauna Kea. Evidence of multiple confining layers within the flanks of Mauna Kea suggest that its capacity for storage of groundwater is substantially higher than has previously been considered and may have implications for transport of recharge to the “basal” groundwater system on its coastal flanks. We will present the detailed stratigraphy of the borehole and isotopic and geochemical data on ground waters found in this region of Hawaii Island.",

In our simulation, an EH is generated by plasma blob injection at the beginning. When the EH passes density gradient region, two features are observed: one is oscillations of EH bipolar field and another is IASWs generation. We found that these E field oscillations correspond to odd-symmetric trapped mode in the EH (OSTM). Using theoretical formalism introduced by Lewis, we theoretically derived the structure and the dispersion relation of OSTM. The OSTM structures calculated from simulation and theory are in good agreement. In the presence of density gradient, OSTM structure is distorted and become spatially asymmetric; its potential is weak in the higher density side and strong in the lower density side. Ions are pulled and pushed by the OSTM potential. As a results of potential difference, ions are accelerated to the lower density side then they formed IASWs. These process are repeated in the density gradient region when EH are passing, so IASWs are generated coherently.",

            "abstract": "Geoscience analyses often require the use of existing data sets that are large, heterogeneous, and maintained by different organizations. A particular challenge in creating reproducible analyses using these data sets is automating the workflows required to transform raw datasets into model specific input files and finally into publication ready visualizations. Data grids, such as the Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS), are architectures that allow scientists to access and share large data sets that are geographically distributed on the Internet, but appear to the scientist as a single file management system. The DataNet Federation Consortium (DFC) project is built on iRODS and aims to demonstrate data and computational interoperability across scientific communities. This paper leverages iRODS and the DFC to demonstrate how hydrological modeling workflows can be encapsulated as workflows using the iRODS concept of Workflow Structured Objects (WSO). An example use case is presented for automating hydrologic model post-processing routines that demonstrates how WSOs can be created and used within the DFC to automate the creation of data visualizations from large model output collections. By co-locating the workflow used to create the visualization with the data collection, the use case demonstrates how data grid technology aids in reuse, reproducibility, and sharing of workflows within scientific communities.",

The spatial scales of a collisionless shock is a very important parameter that needs to be identified. In the pre ISEE period, analytically calculated solutions have been used, in order to find an estimate of the shock-spacecraft velocity and as an extent identify other spatial scales of the shock front. These analytical solutions mainly used shock regions, such as the foot or the overshoot. In this study we exploit multi-point Cluster observations of the terrestrial bow shock, in order to identify the reliability and accuracy of various pre ISEE methodologies, that where developed for single spacecraft measurements.

            "abstract": "We present a fast, scalable, and highly-implementable stochastic inverse method for characterization of aquifer heterogeneity. The method utilizes recent advances in randomized matrix algebra and exploits the structure of the Quasi-Linear Geostatistical Approach (QLGA), without requiring a structured grid like Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) methods. The QLGA framework is a more stable version of Gauss-Newton iterates for a large number of unknown model parameters, but provides unbiased estimates. The methods are matrix-free and do not require derivatives or adjoints, and are thus ideal for complex models and black-box implementation. We also incorporate randomized least-square solvers and data-reduction methods, which speed up computation and simulate missing data points. The new inverse methodology is coded in Julia and implemented in the MADS computational framework (\nhttp://mads.lanl.gov\n). Julia is an advanced high-level scientific programing language that allows for efficient memory management and utilization of high-performance computational resources. Inversion results based on series of synthetic problems with steady-state and transient calibration data are presented.",

            "abstract": "The physiological response of plants to water stress provides insights into which species may survive in exceptional drought conditions. This study conducted on a remnant post oak savanna site in College Station, Texas, examined how drought affected the physiology of three native oak species. In June 2014, after a period of equal watering, we subjected three year old Quercus shumardii (Shumard oak; SO), Q. virginiana (live oak; LO), and Q. macrocarpa (bur oak; BO) saplings to one of two watering treatments: 1) watered, receiving the equivalent of theaverage precipitation rate and 2) droughted, receiving a 100% reduction in precipitation. We measured predawn (ΨPD) and midday (ΨMD) leaf water potential; midday gas exchange (MGE) parameters including photosynthesis (Al), transpiration (T), stomatal conductance (gsw); and leaf soluble (SS) and non-soluble sugar (NSS) concentrations monthly between June and October 2014. Drought stress responses were evident after only one month of induced drought. Droughted saplings showed reduced ΨPD, ΨMD, and MGE (P ≤ 0.05) in comparison to watered saplings of the same species. LO saplings exhibited greater MGE (P ≤ 0.05) while maintaining similar LWP to their respective watered and droughted BO and SO counterparts. Droughted LO exhibited MGE rates similar to those of watered BO and SO (P ≤ 0.05), while watered LO adjusted its MGE rates to changes in water availability better than BO and LO during short-term drought. Compared to water saplings, droughted saplings had greater leaf SS (P = 0.08) and lower NSS concentrations (P = 0.10), possibly due to the conversion of NSS to SS and other simple compounds and reduced consumption of SS for growth by the droughted saplings. Although SO and BO exhibited similar photosynthesis rates, leaf total sugar (SS+NSS) concentration was greater in SO (P ≤ 0.05). By displaying the greatest average photosynthesis rate (P ≤ 0.05), LO should have accumulated the greatest amount of carbon, but had a low total leaf sugar concentration. LO saplings did however have greater relative height and diameter growth (P ≤ 0.05) than SO and BO, suggesting these species may differ in carbon allocation strategies. Results suggest LO is more likely to withstand drought mortality than BO or SO and may be an ideal species for forest restoration in environments that suffer from drought.",

The observatory is deployed once per month for a series of 2-6 long-distance flights and operates at aircraft cruise altitude (10-12 km), placing the observations predominantly in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere (UT/LS). The IAGOS-CARIBIC payload includes instruments to make in situ trace gas and aerosol observations, as well as a system for the collection of whole air samples for post flight analysis of greenhouse gases, halocarbons, and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs). NMHCs are particularly useful indicators of air mass sources and transport histories, and using the relationships between different hydrocarbons in the UT/LS we have identified regions of the upper troposphere regularly influenced by strong convection as well as instances of rapid cross-tropopause transport. Here we provide an overview of our findings along with a more detailed description of our observations in far northern latitudes, where we frequently observed air with high tropospheric character in the lower stratosphere during spring.",

Real-time tsunami data from the monitoring system can be used to forecast coastal flooding in advance of tsunami arrival, thus saving lives through early warnings. The global tsunami monitoring system could also be used to expand the coverage of global navigation by satellites to the seafloor of the world’s oceans.

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster total c.pdf\nThe search for new sources of sustainable energy has cast attention on switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) as a potential biofuel crop. However, growing switchgrass in a high-input, low-diversity cropping system can have negative environmental consequences, such as enhanced nitrate (NO3) leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Increasing plant diversity has been shown to promote plant production by increasing nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE), which may lower fertilizer requirements in cropping systems. With this study we asked how increasing cultivar diversity of switchgrass impacts NUE. The study took place at Fermilab National Environmental Research Park in Batavia, IL. In 2013, we applied a 15N tracer label to switchgrass planted in monocultures and mixtures of 2-types, 4-types, and 6-types of cultivars. We harvested the aboveground biomass and collected soil cores after one growing season. Preliminary data showed that cultivars differed significantly in yield and in the total 15N content in aboveground biomass, but there are no differences in tissue 15N concentration. In addition, there appears to be no effect of diversity level on 15N contents or concentrations. We intend to use this aboveground and soil 15N data to calculate NUE. These results could suggest that choosing the cultivar that most efficiently takes up N and produces the most yield may be more important than increasing diversity to promote the efficacy of biofuel feedstock production. However, increasing diversity can have other positive ecological consequences and does not appear to have negative impacts on yield or the N cycle.",

For this purpose, MRMS (Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor) data is used to provide spatially distributed rainfall data and MPE (Mean Precipitation Estimation) data is used to provide spatially lumped rainfall data to force the ModClark rainfall-runoff model, developed by the Hydrologic Engineering Center (US Army Corps of Engineers). ModClark is an event-oriented semi-distributed rainfall-runoff model which simulates surface runoff from each grid and routes these to the outlet point of the basin using a time-lag approach. Also, ModClark uses a soil curve number approach to simulate direct runoff. The study is conducted in the Napa River basin, California. The streamflow gage at St Helena (USGS 11456000, drainage area 78 sq. mi.), located in the upper reaches of the basin, is used as a control gage site as it is has minimal influences by reservoirs and diversions.\nThere are two main objectives for this study. First, we investigate the effect of spatially distributed rainfall input data on parameter estimation for the ModClark model. For this purpose, parameters are estimated by using MRMS and MPE data for a set of rainfall events by comparing their hydrograph results. To assess the impact of each rainfall data set on ModClark simulated stream flow, the derived parameters are used to simulate hydrographs corresponding to an independent set of rainfall input data which are different from the rainfall data used for estimating parameters. Second, this study examines the uncertainty arising from rainfall error due to the spatial distribution of the rainfall field and the accuracy of quantitative rainfall amount. To perform this analysis, we attempt to find the relationship between rainfall error and runoff error and to compare both runoff results from MPE and MRMS using ensemble rainfall input data derived from Monte Carlo simulations as an estimate of rainfall error. Preliminary results show that there is difference in the ModClark parameters resulting from the spatially distributed versus lumped rainfall input data. The difference in parameters also affected the rainfall-runoff simulation results. It is also shown that the rainfall error arising from the MRMS and MPE inputs becomes amplified the runoff error differently.",

            "abstract": "The Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) Arc System, south of Japan, hosts a multitude of active and extinct (remnant) arc volcanic sediment sources. Core extracted adjacent to the proto-IBM arc (Kyushu-Palau Ridge; KPR) in the Amami-Sankaku Basin on International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 351 contains evidence of the variety of sediment sources that have existed in the area as a result of changing tectonic regimes through arc development, backarc basin formation and remnant arc abandonment. Approximately 1000 meters of Eocene to Oligocene volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks were analyzed via shipboard core photos, core descriptions, and thin sections with the intention of understanding the depositional history at this site. These materials contain a crucial record of arc development complementary to the Neogene history preserved in the active reararc (Expedition 350) and compressed whole-arc record in the current forearc (Expedition 352). A database of stratigraphic columns was created to display grain size trends, facies changes, and bedding characteristics. Individual beds (depositional events) were classified using existing and slightly modified classification schemes for muddy, sandy and gravel-rich gravity flow deposits, as well as muddy debris flows and tuffs. Utilizing the deep marine facies classes presented by Pickering et al. (1986), up section changes are apparent. Through time, as the arc developed, facies and bedding types and their proportions change dramatically and relatively abruptly. Following arc initiation facies are primarily mud-rich with intercalated tuffaceous sand. In younger intervals, sand to gravel gravity-flow deposits dominate, becoming more mud-rich. Muddy gravity flow deposits, however, dominate farther upsection. The overall coarsening-upward pattern (Unit III) is consistent with building of the arc edifice. Farther upsection (Unit II) an abrupt fining-upward trend represents the onset of isolation of the KPR as backarc spreading in the Shikoku Basin was initiated. This information will be combined with volcanic provenance and geochemical information from other studies, ultimately creating a deep-marine facies model for intraoceanic arc systems.",

            "abstract": "Inorganic Soil Carbon (SIC) constitutes approximately 40% of terrestrial soil carbon and it is an integral part of the global carbon cycle. The precipitation and storage of inorganic carbon within soils is controlled by the soil forming factors (Jenny, 1941) where the amount of rainfall is the strongest control on SIC presence or absence. However, within areas dry enough to allow inorganic carbon formation, the hierarchy of controls on SIC amount is complex. Measuring and modeling SIC accumulation at the pedon and watershed scale will improve our understanding of SIC storage. The Reynolds Creek watershed in southwestern Idaho is an ideal location for the study as it transitions from SIC dominated in low elevations to organic carbon dominated at high elevations, and includes a range of parent materials and vegetation types. Initial results show that SIC is unlikely to form at sites with >450mm of precipitation, and variability in SIC concentration at the pedon scale is significant. The study locations had vegetation types that included a variety of sagebrush species (Artimesia spp), bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) and juniper (Juniperus occidentalis). Samples were collected from soils formed on granite, basalt, other volcanics, and alluvium. SIC measurements were made using a modified pressure calcimeter, measuring CO2 released from the reaction of acid with the sample. The highest SIC concentrations range from 15 to 27kg/m2 and are found in basaltic and terrace soils with loess accumulation, in elevations ranging from 1148-1943m and rainfall ranging from 250-716mm. Soils examined from a chronosequence of four terraces in the lower watershed (282-296mm of rainfall), and generally increasing amounts of loess accumulation with time, suggest strong accumulation of SIC on older loessal surfaces. Measurements from both fine-grained and gravelly soils suggests that approximately 15% of SIC in gravelly sites may be accumulated as coatings on clasts; developing a range of the amount of SIC accumulation found ‘on the rocks’ will simplify future analyses.",

            "abstract": "Inverse modeling of volcano seismic sources can provide insight into the geometry and dynamics of volcanic conduits. But given the logistical challenges of working on an active volcano, seismic networks are typically deficient in spatial and temporal coverage; this potentially leads to large errors in source models. In addition, uncertainties in the centroid location and moment-tensor components, including volumetric components, are difficult to constrain from the linear inversion results, which leads to a poor understanding of the model space. In this study, we employ a nonlinear inversion using a Monte Carlo scheme with the objective of defining robustly resolved elements of model space. The model space is randomized by centroid location and moment tensor eigenvectors. Point sources densely sample the summit area and moment tensors are constrained to a randomly chosen geometry within the inversion; Green’s functions for the random moment tensors are all calculated from modeled single forces, making the nonlinear inversion computationally reasonable. We apply this method to very-long-period (VLP) seismic events that accompany minor eruptions at Fuego volcano, Guatemala. The library of single force Green’s functions is computed with a 3D finite-difference modeling algorithm through a homogeneous velocity-density model that includes topography, for a 3D grid of nodes, spaced 40 m apart, within the summit region. The homogenous velocity and density model is justified by long wavelength of VLP data. The nonlinear inversion reveals well resolved model features and informs the interpretation through a better understanding of the possible models. This approach can also be used to evaluate possible station geometries in order to optimize networks prior to deployment.",

However, analytical procedure for strontium-90 in seawater is still quite complicated and challenging. Here we show a simple and rapid analytical technique for the determination of strontium-90 in seawater samples without time-consuming separation of strontium from calcium. The separation with DGA Resin® is used to determine the abundance of strontium-90, which selectively collects yttrium-90, progeny of strontium-90. Naturally occurring radioactive nuclides (such as potassium, lead, bismuth, uranium, and thorium) and anthropogenic radionuclides (such as cesium, barium, lanthanum, and cerium) were separated from yttrium. Through a sample separation procedure, a high chemical yield of yttrium-90 was achieved at 93.9 % for seawater. The result of IAEA 443 certified seawater analysis was in good agreement with the certified value. At 20 hrs counting a lower detection limit of 1.5 mBq L-1 was obtained from 3 L of seawater. The proposed method can finish analyzing 8 samples per day, which is a reasonably fast throughput in actual seawater monitoring. Reproducibility was found to be 3.4 % according to 10 separate analyses of natural seawater samples from the vicinity of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in September 2013.",

            "abstract": "The photolysis of natural organic matter (NOM) is a potential pathway for the alteration of material that is not easily biodegraded. Irradiation can alter the physical state of organic matter by facilitating the cycling between the particulate (POM) and dissolved (DOM) pools. However, a detailed understanding of the underlying chemical changes to the material in both phases is lacking. Here, we use a suspension of particles derived from Phragmites australis, a common marsh reed with high lignin content, as our model “recalcitrant” POM substrate. The solution was irradiated for three weeks with regular sampling, and the composition of the POM and the photo-produced DOM were measured separately using a suite of mass spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques. The chemical composition of individual molecules was measured by coupling soft ionization techniques (electrospray (ESI) and matrix assisted laser desorption (MALDI) to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Structural information, including the distribution of the major carbon containing functional groups, was obtained using a combination of FTIR for bulk analyses and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) for spatially resolved chemistry. Results are discussed in the context of differences in chemical composition and structure with increased irradiation time for both organic matter pools. We observed a general shift in the mass spectra of POM towards lower molecular weight masses and an increase in the abundance of ions in DOM as a function of irradiation time- hence the larger POM matrix is likely fragmenting into smaller species that are more soluble. Spectroscopic measurements indicate that the abundance of acidic and alcohol functionalities increased with irradiation in both carbon pools. These complementary approaches provide new detailed information about how the chemical composition of recalcitrant NOM evolves as it is exposed to sunlight.",

            "abstract": "With new Rayleigh-wave tomography results, we have detected a clear and strong asymmetry in the shear velocity structure of the Juan de Fuca ridge. Concentrated in a relatively thin layer with a depth range of ~30-60km, there lies a region of very low shear velocity, with velocities ranging from ~3.8km/s to 4.0km/s. Such low velocities provide strong evidence for the presence of partial melt. This low-velocity region is highly asymmetric, extending much further west than east of the ridge. Especially at shallow depths of ~35 km, this low-velocity region is concentrated just west of the southern portion of the ridge. Peaking near the Axial Seamount, the youngest of the Cobb-Eickelberg Seamounts, it extends south to the region around the small Vance Seamounts just north of the junction with the Blanco Fracture Zone. The Juan de Fuca plate is relatively stationary in the hotspot reference frame, and the Juan de Fuca ridge migrates westward in the hotspot reference frame. Seamounts are overwhelmingly concentrated on the western flank of the ridge, and an asymmetric upwelling driven by migration in the hotspot reference frame has been proposed to explain the seamount asymmetry (i.e. Davis and Karsten, 1986). Our velocity asymmetry, which matches the seamount asymmetry, provides evidence for this asymmetric upwelling and its connection to migration in the absolute hotspot reference frame.\nIn the shear velocity results, the Gorda ridge displays a remarkable lack of features, with no clearly identifiable expression in the subsurface velocity. There is evidence of a broad low-velocity feature beneath Gorda beginning at a depth of ~150 km, but no clear shallow features can be tied to the ridge. At the depths we can resolve (~25-250km), the anisotropy beneath and within the Juan de Fuca plate is small, indicating a deep source of the shear wave splitting results (Bodmer et al., in press), which indicate a fast axis aligned with the Juan de Fuca plate's absolute motion. Around the Gorda ridge, we observe clear East-West fast axis orientation on both the Pacific Plate and the Gorda portion of the Juan de Fuca Plate.",

            "abstract": "An updated GPS velocity field along the Dead Sea Fault (DSF) provides a basis for assessing off-transform strain within the Sinai and Arabian plates along entire length of this left-lateral, continental transform. As one of the main tectonic elements in the eastern Mediterranean region, an improved kinematic view of the DSF elucidates the broader understanding of the regional tectonic framework, as well as contributes to refining the earthquake hazard assessment. Reconciling short-term (geodetic) measurements of crustal strain with neotectonic data on fault movements can yield insight into the mechanical and rheological properties of crustal deformation associated with transform tectonics. In addition to regional continuous GPS stations, this study assembles results from campaign GPS networks in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan spanning more than a decade. 1-sigma uncertainties on velocities range from less than 0.4 mm/yr (continuous stations and older GPS survey sites) to about 1.0 mm/yr (newer survey sites). Analyses using elastic block models suggest slip rates of 4.0 – 5.0 mm/yr along the southern and central DSF and slip rates of 2.0 – 3.0 mm/yr along the northern DSF, and fault locking depths also vary along strike of the transform. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of GPS observations permits analyzing residual strains within the adjacent plates, after plate boundary strain is removed. A key observation is horizontal stretching within the Sinai plate, which may be related to pull by the subducted slab of the Sinai plate. Within the Arabian plate, areas of horizontal stretching generally correlate with locations of Quaternary volcanism.",

            "abstract": "Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies employing water-alternate-gas (WAG) injections may improve oil mobility and production recovery. WAG injections for EOR create regions in the reservoir with simultaneous flow of oil, water and air dominated by capillary and gravity forces. As a result of the dynamics in the transition zones, the invading fluid may snap off compartments of the displaced fluid which could then be trapped in the pore space, contributing to the hysteresis of the three-phase capillary pressure curves.\nThree-phase capillary pressure curves are needed to model the three-phase transition zone movements in the reservoir. In reservoir simulation models, the common practice has been to implement three-phase capillary pressure curves based on two-phase gas-oil and oil-water capillary pressure data. However, experimental and modelling studies of three-phase fluid distributions at the pore scale have shown that this procedure is not always valid; three-phase capillary pressure curves exhibit hysteresis and depend on the saturation history of the three phases which cannot be derived from two-phase capillary pressure curves.\nWe have developed three-phase experiments that provide capillary pressures and 3D-image data of fluid distributions in the entire saturation space of oil, water and air in water-wet porous glass-bead columns; a time-consuming and technically challenging exercise. The 3D data with a resolution of 6.38 µm were derived from high-resolution synchrotron x-ray computed micro-tomography (CMT), collected at the GSECARS beam line 13-BM-D at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. In particular, we discuss how three-phase pore-scale mechanisms, such as oil layer existence and multiple displacement events, affect the mobility and trapping of oil in the porous medium. We also show that wettability-alterations of the porous medium in contact with the three-phase fluid system and exposure to x-rays can be avoided by using iodine-containing contrast agents in the oil and water phase, respectively. The experimental data will also serve to develop, refine and confirm the simulation model developed by our collaborative partners.",

            "abstract": "Zonostrophic turbulence was discovered in the one-layer shallow water model forced by random stirring and has since been related to Jovian atmosphere for the appearance of very strong and steady zonal jets. This study shows that such zonostrophic turbulence can also exist in a two-layer QG model driven by baroclinic instability. The kinetic energy spectrum shows a clear transition from the inertial inverse cascade regime with energy spectrum slope -5/3 at small scales to the zonostrophic regime with slope -5 at the largest scales. The turbulent regime is characterized by two non-dimensional numbers criticality and non-dimensional surface friction. The zonostrophic regime is reached and is most clear in the corner of low friction and low criticality. A new dependency of eddy diffusivity on surface friction is founded when surface friction is low enough, that eddy diffusivity decreases with surface friction regardless of criticality. The zonal jets are found to be strong mixing barriers, especially in the upper layer, and therefore potential vorticity (PV) and tracer staircases are formed. Time-space spectrum shows that the strong zonal jet traps waves within the critical latitudes so that the waves do not break. The longest waves are trapped as edge waves, and the shorter waves are trapped by Rossby wave reflection. Both are a result of the PV gradient created by the jet core.",

SIT is designed to have very fine layers near surface and is able to capture diurnal warm layer and cool skin. This refined discretization near ocean surface in SIT provides accurate SST simulation and hence gives precise air-sea interaction. By coupling SIT with ECHAM5, CAM5 and HiRAM, the MJO simulation in three AGCMs are significant improved comparing to AGCM driven by prescribed SST. Moreover, AGCMs coupled with ocean model with coarse uppermost layer are not able to improve MJO simulation as significant as AGCMs coupling with SIT. This study suggests that accurately simulating MJO requires a fine vertical resolution near surface that can capture temperature variations in the upper few meters of the ocean.",

            "abstract": "In most cases, large-scale features of the auroral distribution are the projection, along magnetic field lines, of corresponding magnetospheric features. The poleward boundary of the oval is a key example of such a feature. At almost all local times, this is most often interpreted as the ionospheric marker of the latitudinal transition between open lobe and closed central plasma sheet field lines. Earlier work by Blanchard et al. [J. Geophys. Res., 1995 & 1997] used ground-based photometric observations of 630 nm \"redline\" aurora and in situ particle observations from simultaneous DMSP overflights to demonstrate that the poleward boundary of the redline aurora is a particularly robust signature of the poleward boundary of the plasma sheet. Owing to the orbits of the DMSP spacecraft and the relative newness of the photometer program (CANOPUS) that provided the optical observations, the Blanchard results represent a limited sampling of magnetic local time and a limited number of events. In this paper we revisit the Blanchard et al study, using particle data from the NASA FAST satellite and the DMSP program, together with redline observations obtained by ground-based All-Sky Imagers. Our results indicate that the Blanchard technique for identifying the polar cap boundary holds true for essentially all magnetic local times on the night side, but that the picture is more nuanced than previously appreciated. Here we present these results, and discuss specific examples where the technique does not work (and explore why). Furthermore, this work is motivated by a new extensive network of highly sensitive redline imagers that has been deployed across northern and central Canada which provides high time resolution large-scale snapshots of the instantaneous polar cap boundary. This in turn enables us to explore magnetospheric dynamics at the interface between the lobe and central plasma sheet in fundamentally new and exciting ways.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGUposter_Xuan_final.pdf\nThe sea-level rise and increase in the frequency and intensity of coastal storms due to climate change are likely to exacerbate adverse effects of storm surges on low-lying coastal areas. The landward flow of water during storm surges introduces salt to surficial coastal aquifers and threatens groundwater resources. Coastal topography (e.g. ponds, dunes, canals) likely has a strong impact on overwash and salinization processes, but is generally highly simplified in modeling studies. To understand the topographic impacts on groundwater salinization, we modeled overwash and variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport in 3D using the fully coupled surface and subsurface numerical simulator, HydroGeoSphere. The model simulates the coastal aquifer as an integrated system considering processes such as overland flow, coupled surface and subsurface exchange, variably saturated flow, and variable-density flow. To represent various coastal landscape types, we started with realistic coastal topography from Delaware, USA, and then generated synthetic fields with differing shore-perpendicular connectivity and surface depressions. The groundwater salinization analysis suggested that the topographic connectivity promoting overland flow controls the volume of aquifer that is salinized. In contrast, depression storage of surface water mainly controls the time for infiltrated salt to flush from the aquifer. The results indicate that for a range of synthetic conditions, topography increases the flushing time of salt by 20–300% relative to an equivalent “simple slope” in which topographic variation is absent. Our study suggests that topography have a significant impact on overwash salinization, with important implications for land management at local scales and groundwater vulnerability assessment at regional to global scales.",

Such studies pave the way for future landed and sample return missions for high science priority targets. Among such targets are (1) the youngest volcanic rocks on the Moon, including mare basalts formed as recently as ~1 Ga, and irregular mare patches (IMPs) that appear to be even younger [1]; (2) volcanic rocks and complexes with compositions more silica-rich than mare basalts [2-4]; (3) differentiated impact-melt deposits [5,6], ancient volcanics, and compositional anomalies within the South Pole-Aitken basin; (4) exposures of recently discovered key crustal rock types in uplifted structures such as essentially pure anorthosite [7] and spinel-rich rocks [8]; and (5) frozen volatile-element-rich deposits in polar areas [9]. Important data sets include feature sequences of paired NAC images obtained under similar illumination conditions, NAC geometric stereo, from which high-resolution DTMs can be made, and photometric sequences useful for assessing composition in areas of mature cover soils. Examples of each of these target types will be discussed in context of potential future missions. ",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in satellite mapping of evapotranspiration (ET) have made it possible to largely automate the process of mapping ET over large areas at the field-scale. This development coincides with recent drought events across the western U.S. which have intensified interest in mapping of ET and consumptive use to address a range of water management challenges, including resolving disputes over water rights, improving irrigation management, and developing sustainable management plans for groundwater resources.\nWe present a case study for California that leverages two automated ET mapping capabilities to estimate ET at the field scale over agricultural areas in the California Central Valley. We utilized the NASA Earth Exchange and applied a python-based implementation of the METRIC surface energy balance model and the Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) system, which uses a surface reflectance-based approach, to map ET over agricultural areas in the Central Valley. We present estimates from 2014 from both approaches and results from a comparison of the estimates. Though theoretically and computationally quite different from each other, initial results from both approaches show good agreement overall on seasonal ET totals for 2014. We also present results from comparisons against ET measurements collected on commercial farms in the Central Valley and discuss implications for accuracy of the two different approaches. The objective of this analysis is to provide data that can inform planning for the development of sustainable groundwater management plans, and assist water managers and growers in evaluating irrigation demand during drought events.",

Mountain snowpacks are recognized as a sensitive bellwether of global and regional change. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been collecting snow data across the Western United States at manual (snowcourse) stations since the 1930s and at automated (snow telemetry) stations since the 1970s. These USDA data have been used to investigate change across the Western U.S., and many stations have seen significant decreases in their snowpack.\nDaily data from 34 SNOTEL stations and monthly data from 25 snowcourse stations across the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado were used to evaluate the variability and trends in snow water equivalent (SWE) for the selected periods to assess if there has been a systematic change in the San Juan snowpack. April 1st and peak SWE decreased at almost all of the stations, with a significant decrease being observed at about half of the stations. Decreases were over the entire period of record, with large declines in the 1980s through the year 2000, but there tended to be no decrease in the past 15 years (2001 to 2015). On average the snow accumulation has been less in recent years (2001 to 2015) than over previous periods; at stations with a deeper snowpack these decreases have been much greater and illustrate a possible shift in winter climate occurring in the early 2000s.\nThe Center for Snow and Avalanche Studies (CSAS) in Silverton Colorado has been collecting comprehensive higher elevation meteorological and snowpack data since this possible climatic shift occurred. If the current snowpack regime represents a new normal, then existing and new data collected by CSAS will assist in interpreting changes within this regime.",

            "abstract": "Carr and Head (Geophys. Res. Lett., 42, 726–732, 2015) have estimated that the size of the present-day inventory of near-surface water on Mars (that which exists in climatically exchangeable reservoirs) is equal to a global equivalent layer (GEL) ~34 m deep. Based on this estimate, they have attempted to extrapolate the evolution of this inventory backward in time, taking into account the introduction of new water by volcanism and outflow channel activity and the loss of water by exospheric escape. They conclude that, at the end of the Noachian, Mars had a near-surface water inventory of ~24 m which, they argue, was incompatible with the existence of a former ocean.\nHere, we argue that the uncertainties associated with Carr and Head analysis are significant and preclude its use as a reliable constraint on the size of the Noachian inventory of water or the presence of an early ocean. Indeed, consideration of the geologic evolution of the northern plains suggest that, if early Mars possessed an inventory of water sufficient to form an early ocean, then a frozen relic of that body may survive at depth to the present day. While sublimation undoubtedly depleted some fraction of the ocean’s initial inventory of ice, the subsequent accumulation of ~0.5 - 1.5 km of sediments and volcanics, combined with recurrent episodes of outflow channel activity and obliquity-driven polar ice redistribution, could have led to the development of a complex volatile stratigraphy throughout the northern plains (at depths far below those that can be assessed as part of the present-day near-surface inventory). Thus, even if the present near-surface inventory of ice could be determined with high precision, it would place no constraint on either the past near-surface inventory of H2O or the former presence of a northern ocean.",

            "abstract": "Leaf functional traits act as driving forces on each other, as well as being driven by abiotic factors. Leaf Nitrogen Content (LNC), Specific Leaf Area (SLA) and maximum conductance to water vapor (gwmax) are well researched, yet their relationship to each other and the climate is still not fully understood. Urban setting provides a unique look into trait relationships because of the high plant biodiversity, distribution of plants outside their native climate conditions, well-watered conditions that remove a key abiotic factor and soil nutrient availability varies due to atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We predict owing to these conditions, both LNC and gwmax will increase in across the climate gradient of the LA area.\nTen tree species were sampled from green spaces across the L.A Megacity in three geographic areas of focus: coastal (Irvine), inland (Riverside) and desert (Palm Springs), exhibiting a gradient of increasing MAT, and nitrogen deposition peaking inland. Leaf samples were processed for N, and gwmax was quantified through stomatal characteristics. LNC increased between the coastal and inland region (mean diff. -0.324; p=0.007). For two case study species, gwmax in the genus’ Jacaranda and Pyrus show a contrasting positive and negative correlation with LNC (Jacaranda: p=0.037, Pyrus: p<.001). The varying relationship of N and gwmax may show that economic and hydraulic traits tradeoffs are dependent on the evolutionary characteristics of the species (Drought deciduous sub-tropical Jacaranda’s large compound leaves, and average sampled SLA: 94.05; winter deciduous temperate Pyrus’ simple leaf with average SLA: 61.78). The increase in N along one section of the gradient, but not the other, potentially shows the driving force of the N deposition may outweigh the forces of MAT. If the variation in driving forces behind economic and hydraulic traits can be identified, there will be a significant increase in the predictive power of how urban vegetation responds to climatic shifts.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - briggsposter2015_4compressed.compressed.pdf\nSeparation of the microcontinent Zealandia from the Marie Byrd Land sector of Antarctica in the Late Cretaceous marked the final stage in the breakup of Gondwana. Two contrasting ideas for the Late Cretaceous rifting of Zealandia from Gondwana have been proposed. One is that subduction at the paleo-Pacific - Gondwana convergent margin ceased after the last pulse of batholith emplacement at ~100 Ma, followed by a rapid transition to extension and seafloor spreading at 82 Ma. The other hypothesis is that convergence continued along Zealandia simultaneously with back-arc extension until ~85 M. This hypothesis is based on recently reported Late Cretaceous ages from the Alpine Schist, a metamorphosed accretionary wedge assemblage. Without accompanying pressure-temperature (P-T) information, the significance of Late Cretaceous ages from the Alpine Schist in terms of the orogenic processes that occurred during cessation of subduction at the paleo-Pacific – Gondwana margin remains unclear.\nIn this study, Lu-Hf geochronology of Alpine Schist garnet is paired with phase equilibria modelling to elucidate the P-T-t history of the orogen and clarify the mechanisms behind Zealandia-Gondwana rifting. Garnet Lu-Hf dates have been obtained from 9 samples ranging in bulk composition from quartzo-feldspathic schists to mafic amphibolites. Garnet yields Early Cretaceous ages from the southern Alpine Schist, whereas northern Alpine Schist garnet yields Late Cretaceous ages. Garnet textures and major and trace element compositional zoning suggest that an additional, later period of garnet growth or recrystallization may be recorded in the northern samples. P-T-t data from each dated sample is supplemented with thermobarometric analysis from an adjacent sample of different lithology, with the advantage of providing more complete local P-T-t paths. The P-T-t paths define whether garnet grew during increasing P-T (prograde early), decreasing P and increasing T (prograde late), and/or decreasing P-T (retrograde). Our preliminary results indicate that 1) convergence coincided with the initiation of rifting along most of the Zealandia-Gondwana margin and 2) convergence either ceased prior to initiation of extension or did not result in garnet growth at the segment of the margin represented by southern Alpine Schist.",

This research uses Vision, Inertial, and LIDAR sensors to build a high resolution model of a skylight as a landing vehicle flies overhead. We design and fabricate a pit modeling instrument to accomplish this task, implement software, and demonstrate sensing and modeling capability on a suborbital reusable launch vehicle flying over a simulated pit. Future missions on other planets and moons will explore pits and caves, led by the technology developed by this research.\nSensor software utilizes modern graph-based optimization techniques to build 3D models using camera, LIDAR, and inertial data. The modeling performance was validated with a test flyover of a planetary skylight analog structure on the Masten Xombie sRLV. The trajectory profile closely follows that of autonomous planetary powered descent, including translational and rotational dynamics as well as shock and vibration. A hexagonal structure made of shipping containers provides a terrain feature that serves as an appropriate analog for the rim and upper walls of a cylindrical planetary skylight.\nThe skylight analog floor, walls, and rim are modeled in elevation with a 96% coverage rate at 0.25m2 resolution. The inner skylight walls have 5.9cm2 color image resolution and the rims are 6.7cm2 with measurement precision superior to 1m.\nThe multidisciplinary student team included students of all experience levels, with backgrounds in robotics, physics, computer science, systems, mechanical and electrical engineering. The team was commited to authentic scientific experimentation, and defined specific instrument requirements and measurable experiment objectives to verify successful completion.This work was made possible by the NASA Undergraduate Student Instrument Project Educational Flight Opportunity 2013 program. Additional support was provided by the sponsorship of an IMU by KVH industries and mentorship was provided by members of the NASA ALHAT team.

GLOFs also pose a risk to human presence and infrastracture.\nIce-dammed lakes at the margin of the ice sheet and of local glaciers and ice caps are common features of Greenland’s landscape. The occasional or periodic emptying of some of these lakes have been described as early as the 18thcentury. Thinning glaciers in a warming climate are already changing the behaviour of some of these lakes. However, little is known of the frequency and seasonality of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOF) outside of the relatively more densely populated parts of West and South Greenland.\nThis contribution demonstrates automatic multi-sensor detection of ice-dammed lake emptying events from space for three test regions in West, South and Northeast Greenland, using visible imagery from Landsat, ASTER, PROBA-V and MODIS. The current detection algorithm relies on prior knowledge of lakes location and approximate shape from a topographic map at the scale of 1:250.000, and it is meant as a prototype for a future operational product. For the well documented case of the glacier-dammed lake of A.P. Olsen Ice Cap (NE Greenland), where GLOF’s observations at Zackenberg Research Station started in 1996, the remote sensing and in situ records are compared, showing good agreement. ICESat altimetry, MODIS and AVHRR thermal imagery, and the ENVISAR ASAR signature of two detected GLOFs that took place late autumn and winter are also discussed to demonstrate the potential for successful retrievals during the polar night.\nThe upcoming Sentinel-3 missions will alleviate what is currently the major drawback of implementing this prototype into an operational service, namely the limited availability of high resolution imagery. This is of special importance for applications characterizing and monitoring GLOF hazard in areas of Greenland of interest for mining, hydropower development, tourism and and other human activities.",

Recognizing water utilities will face the brunt of these impacts, this study seeks to better understand the disconnect between the projections produced and the needs of utilities on-the-ground. As part of the first stage of the three-year study, this presentation reports results of a statewide survey evaluating how far along water utilities in California are along in preparing for the projected climate change impacts on water quality, the range in respondents' perspectives (and concerns) of climate change on water quality, and how the state's four-year drought is already presenting treatment challenges. On-going case studies are investigating the needs and capacity of utilities to prepare for and adapt to the projected water quality impacts from increasing extreme events and how or whether climate scientists can help meet these needs.",

            "abstract": "Grazing is the most extensive land use on Earth. Widespread consequences of overgrazing pastures include long-term decreases in plant biomass and limited recovery of vegetation. Remotely-sensed vegetation indices linked to biomass (e.g. NDVI) are routinely used to monitor pasture health over broad areas to track pasture degradation and recovery over time. Unfortunately, overgrazing can impact vegetation in various other ways not easily evaluated using satellite imagery, such as by altering species composition. Furthermore, the response of vegetation to grazing may be influenced by underlying terrain and topographic gradients.\nWe examined multi-decadal trends in pasture condition in Kyrgyzstan, a country where pasture degradation is of serious concern. Using a chronosequence of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery, we compared fifteen-year trends in NDVI with contemporary field-based measurements of pasture health in thirty 1-km 2 sites. Multivariate regression was used to discern the relationship between long-term NDVI trends and pasture health in pastures of differing terrain (areas of varying topographic wetness index and solar insolation). Preliminary results suggest that pasture degradation can be correlated with either positive or negative changes in NDVI depending upon the topographic position of the pasture. Furthermore, terrain characteristics explained a considerable portion of the observed variance in NDVI trends across the region. Improving our understanding of grazing impacts in montane systems is critical given their vulnerability to impending climate change.",

            "abstract": "Coastal emergent vegetation in estuaries physically interrupts flow within the water column, reduces wave energy and increases sediment deposition. Previous workers conclude that wave attenuation rates decrease exponentially with distance from the marsh edge and are dependent on site and species-specific plant characteristics (Yang et al., 2011). Sediment deposition may exhibit similar patterns; however, sediment, geomorphic and habitat models seldom integrate site-specific biophysical plant parameters into change analyses. We paired vegetation and sediment dynamic studies to: (1) characterize vegetation structure, (2) estimate sediment available for deposition, (3) estimate rate, distribution and composition of sediment deposits, (4) determine sediment accumulation on vegetation, (5) compare sediment deposition within dense tidal wetland relative to non-vegetated tidal flat. These studies integrate a variety of monitoring methods, including the use of sediment traps, turbidity sensors, side-on photographs of vegetation and remote sensing image analysis. We compared sedimentation data with vegetation characteristics and spatial distribution data to examine the relative role of vegetation morphologic traits (species, stem density, biomass, distribution, tidal channels, etc.) on sediment dynamics. Our study is focused on Port Susan Bay of Washington State; a protected delta that has experienced up to 1 kilometer of marsh retreat (loss) over the past fifty years. Preliminary results show that the highest winter deposition occurred in the high marsh/mid-marsh boundary, up to 300m inland of the marsh edge, where bulrush species are most dense. These results will inform restoration efforts aimed at reestablishing sediment supply to the retreating marshland. This research is necessary to understand the vulnerability and adaptability of coastal marshlands to climate change related stressors such as, increased water levels (sea-level rise) and wave energy.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - MarrasEtAl-AGU2015-poster-DEFINITIVE.pdf\nCoastal communities around the world are being encouraged to plant or restore vegetation along their shores for the purpose of mitigating tsunami damage. A common setup for these projects is to develop ‘mitigation hills’ – an ensemble of vegetated hills along the coast – instead of one continuous stretch of vegetation. The rationale behind a staggered-hill setup is to give tree roots more space to grow and deepen. From a fluid-dynamical point of view, however, staggered mitigation hills may have significant drawbacks such as diverting the flow into the low-lying areas of the park, which could entail strong currents in the narrow channels between the hills and lead to erosion of the hills from the sides.\nThe goal of this study is to quantify how mitigation hills affect tsunami runup and to provide constraints on the design of mitigation hills that mitigate tsunami damage using numerical simulations. Our computations of tsunami runup are based on the non-linear shallow water equation solved through a fully implicit, high-order, discontinuous Galerkin method. The adaptive computational grid is fitted to the hill topography to capture geometric effects accurately. A new dynamic subgrid-scale eddy viscosity originally designed for large eddy simulation of compressible flows is used for stabilization and to capture the obstacle-generated turbulence. We have carefully benchmarked our model in 1D and 2D against classical test cases. The included figure shows an example run of tsunami runup through coastal mitigation hills.\nIn the interest of providing generalizable results, we perform a detailed scaling analysis of our model runs. We find that the protective value of mitigation hills depends sensitively on the non-linearity of the incoming wave and the relative height of the wave to the hills. Our simulations also suggest that the assumed initial condition is consequential and we hence consider a range of incoming waves ranging from a simple soliton to a more realistic N-wave and an actual measured wave train. Our results suggest that channelization of flow between the mitigation hills is likely to occur in most setting and that limiting the degree of energy focusing should be a consideration in the design of a tsunami mitigation park.",

            "abstract": "We are developing a laboratory system for studying micro- to meso-scale interactions between microorganisms and their physicochemical environments. The Autonomous Adaptive Directed Evolution Chamber (AADEC) cultures microorganisms in controlled,small-scale geochemical environments. It observes corresponding microbial interactions to these environments and has the ability to adjust thermal, chemical, and other parameters in real time in response to these interactions. In addition to the sensed data, the system allows the generation of time-resolved ecological, genomic, etc. samples on the order of microbial generations.\nThe AADEC currently houses cultures in liquid media and controls UVC radiation, heat exposure, and nutrient supply. In a proof-of-concept experimental evolution application, it can increase UVC radiation resistance of Escherichia coli cultures by iteratively exposing them to UVC and allowing the surviving cells to regrow. A baseline characterization generated a million fold resistance increase. This demonstration uses a single-well growth chamber prototype, but it was limited by scalability. We have expanded upon this system by implementing a microwell plate compatible fluidics system and sensor housing. This microwell plate system increases the diversity of microbial interactions seen in response to the geochemical environments generated by the system, allowing greater control over individual cultures' environments and detection of rarer events.\nThe custom microfluidic card matches the footprint of a standard microwell plate. This card enables controllable fluid flow between wells and introduces multiple separate exposure and sensor chambers, increasing the variety of sensors compatible with the system. This gives the device control over scale and the interconnectedness of environments within the system. The increased controllability of the multiwell system provides a platform for implementing machine learning algorithms that will autonomously adjust geochemical environmental parameters.",

            "abstract": "Transpressional fault systems comprise networks of high-angle strike-slip and more gently-dipping oblique-slip faults. Large oblique-slip earthquakes may involve complex ruptures of multiple faults with both strike-slip and dip-slip. Geophysical data including high-resolution multibeam bathymetry maps, multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) profiles, and relocated seismicity catalogs enable detailed mapping of the 3-D structure of seismogenic fault systems offshore in the California Continental Borderland. Seafloor morphology along the San Clemente fault system displays numerous features associated with active strike-slip faulting including scarps, linear ridges and valleys, and offset channels. Detailed maps of the seafloor faulting have been produced along more than 400 km of the fault zone. Interpretation of fault geometry has been extended to shallow crustal depths using 2-D MCS profiles and to seismogenic depths using catalogs of relocated southern California seismicity.\nWe examine the 3-D fault character along the transpressional Santa Cruz-Catalina Ridge (SCCR) section of the fault system to investigate the potential for large earthquakes involving multi-fault ruptures. The 1981 Santa Barbara Island (M6.0) earthquake was a right-slip event on a vertical fault zone along the northeast flank of the SCCR. Aftershock hypocenters define at least three sub-parallel high-angle fault surfaces that lie beneath a hillside valley. Mainshock rupture for this moderate earthquake appears to have been bilateral, initiating at a small discontinuity in the fault geometry (~5-km pressure ridge) near Kidney Bank. The rupture terminated to the southeast at a significant releasing step-over or bend and to the northeast within a small (~10-km) restraining bend. An aftershock cluster occurred beyond the southeast asperity along the East San Clemente fault. Active transpression is manifest by reverse-slip earthquakes located in the region adjacent to the principal displacement zone of dextral shear, which is ~2-3 km wide along this section. Links to adjacent faults including the San Clemente Island and Catalina Ridge may enable complex multi-fault rupture producing large (M>7) earthquakes along this fault system. Vertical uplift due to transpression may produce a significant (>1 m) local tsunami.",

This project facilitates a symbiotic relationship between the scientific community and the general public. Using the data from this website, a large database of classified auroral images will be created and then used for future analysis by the scientific community. In exchange, the general public can learn about the aurora and contribute to auroral physics in a tangible way. The ultimate aim of this project is to create an ever expanding database of all-sky images classified by arc type (i.e. single arc, diffuse aurora, multiple arc, etc.) and filtered for adverse viewing conditions (i.e. snow, rain, light pollution, etc).

Ten ~1 million year (Myr) wobbles of magnetic inclination can be identified and correlated across Italy from 87-74 Myr ago, potentially refining the global polarity time scale and seafloor spreading rates. Milankovitch wobble is an omnipresent geophysical process that represents, irrespective of its mechanism, a new chronometer for age calibration with paleomagnetism. If Milankovitch wobble is interpreted as a geomagnetic artifact—the long-considered but still unproven idea that astronomical variations influence the geodynamo—the geocentric-axial dipole hypothesis would only be viable when averaged over time scales 100 times greater than currently thought, making present-day geocentricity largely coincidental. If interpreted as true geographic change, Milankovitch wobble implies an unrecognized, rapid time scale (~10˚ Myr-1) of true polar wander, possibly due to ice sheet dynamics driven by the 1.2 Myr modulation of Earth’s rotational obliquity. Stable isotope data co-vary with the Milankovitch wobble, possibly favoring the polar wander mechanism that predicts rapid environmental change where the geomagnetic artifact hypothesis does not.",

            "abstract": "Flux-rope coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are believed to be organized along a main axis of symmetry, therefore they exhibit differing appearances depending on the axis orientation with respect to the observer. There are observational reports of CMEs seen along their main axis (axial perspective) and perpendicular to it (lateral perspective), however to date no simultaneous observations of both perspectives from the same CME have been reported. The stereoscopic views of the telescopes aboard the Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) twin spacecraft, in combination with the views from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), allow us to study for the first time simultaneously the lateral and axial perspectives of the three-dimensional configuration of a polar coronal mass ejection. In addition to the validation of the observation of both perspectives, this study shows that the lateral angular width (l) grows up linearly with time, while the angular width of the axial perspective (d) presents only this behaviour from the low corona to ≈ 5R sun , then it slows down. The ratio l/d ≈ 1.4 between both dimensions of the angular width is consistent with measurements of l and d previously performed on events exhibiting only one of the perspectives.",

Here, we present sounding radar and laser altimetry observations of two aspects that are indispensable for understanding those changes: basal melting and bedrock topography in the grounding zones. We find that Smith Glacier in particular thinned by a remarkably fast 300-490 m between the years 2002 and 2009. Its grounding line has retreated far enough to be now at 2000 m below sea level in a previously identified trench. All three glacier grounding lines have already retreated down steeper parts of their bedrocks to flatter terrains, plausibly contributing to the reported slowing down in the acceleration of their ice volume discharges. The wider implications of the work emphasize the unprecedented perspectives that direct observation can offer of diverse grounding zone structures and evolution scenarios.",

            "abstract": "An understanding of sediment redistribution processes and the main sediment sources within a watershed is needed to support watershed management strategies. The fingerprinting technique is increasingly being recognized as a method for establishing the source of the sediment transported within watersheds. However, the different behaviour of the various fingerprinting properties has been recognized as a major limitation of the technique, and the uncertainty associated with tracer selection needs to be addressed. There are also questions associated with which modelling approach (frequentist or Bayesian) is the best to unmix complex environmental mixtures, such as river sediment. This study aims to compare and evaluate the differences between fingerprinting predictions provided by a Bayesian unmixing model (MixSIAR) using different groups of tracer properties for use in sediment source identification. We used fallout radionuclides (e.g. 137Cs) and geochemical elements (e.g. As) as conventional fingerprinting properties, and colour parameters as emerging properties; both alone and in combination. These fingerprinting properties are being used (i.e. Koiter et al., 2013; Barthod et al., 2015) to determine the proportional contributions of fine sediment in the South Tobacco Creek Watershed, an agricultural watershed located in Manitoba, Canada. We show that the unmixing model using a combination of fallout radionuclides and geochemical tracers gave similar results to the model based on colour parameters. Furthermore, we show that a model that combines all tracers (i.e. radionuclide/geochemical and colour) gave similar results, showing that sediment sources change from predominantly topsoil in the upper reaches of the watershed to channel bank and bedrock outcrop material in the lower reaches.\nBarthod LRM et al.

            "abstract": "The induced polarization (IP) technique has been successful in mineral exploration, particularly for finding disseminated sulphide or porphyry deposits, but also in helping solve geotechnical and environmental problems. Electrical induced polarization (EIP) surveys use grounded electrodes and take measurements of the electric field while the current is both “on” and “off”. Currently, 2D and 3D inversions of EIP data are generally carried out by first finding a background conductivity from the asymptotic “on-time” measurements. The DC resistivity problem is then linearized about that conductivity to obtain a linear relationship between the off-time data and the “pseudo-chargeability”. The distribution of pseudo-chargeability in the earth is then interpreted within the context of the initial geoscience problem pursued.\nDespite its success, the current EIP implementation does have challenges. A fundamental assumption, that there is no electromagnetic induction (EM) effect, breaks down when the background is conductive. This is especially problematic in regions having conductive overburden. EM induction complicates, and sometimes overwhelms, the IP signal. To ameliorate this effect, we estimate the inductive signal, subtract it from the “off-time” data and invert the resultant IP data using the linearized formulation. We carefully examine the conditions under which this works. We also investigate the potential alterations to the linearized sensitivity function that are needed to allow a linearized inversion to be carried out.\n\nInversions of EIP data recover a “chargeability” but this is not a uniquely defined quantity. There are multiple definitions of this property because there are a diverse number of ways in which an IP datum is defined. In time domain IP surveys, the data might be mV/V or a time-integrated voltage with units of ms. In reality however, data from an EIP survey have many time channels and each one can be inverted separately to produce a chargeability at that time, or multiple times can be worked with at once, to obtain time dependent IP parameters. We present an approach for doing this and illustrate its effectiveness by applying it to a mineral exploration problem. The result allows us to distinguish geological units having different polarization characteristics.",

It is imperative that a good understanding is developed of how climate change affects the events that are reflected in hydrological extremes such as floods and how practitioners in water resources management deal with them. Since there is still major uncertainty as to how the impact of climate change affect actual water resources management, it is important to build robustness into management schemes and communities. Flood management under such variety of uncertainty favors the flexible and adaptive implementation both in top-down and bottom-up approaches. The former uses projections of global or spatially downscaled models to drive resource models and project resource impacts. The latter utilizes policy or planning tools to identify what changes in climate would be most threatening to their long-range operations. Especially for the bottom-up approaches, it is essential to identify the gap between what should be done and what has not been achieved for disaster risks. Indicators or index are appropriate tools to measure such gaps, but they are still in progress to cover the whole world. The International Flood Initiative (IFI), initiated in January 2005 by UNESCO and WMO in close cooperation with UNU and ISDR, IAHS and IAHR, has promoted an integrated approach to flood management to take advantage of floods and use of flood plains while reducing the social, environmental and economic risks. Its secretariat is located in ICHARM. The initiative objective is to support national platforms to practice evidence-based disaster risk reduction through mobilizing scientific and research networks at national, regional and international levels. The initiative is now preparing for a new mechanism to facilitate the integrated approach for flood management on the ground regionally in the Asia Pacific (IFI-AP) through monitoring, assessment and capacity building.",

            "abstract": "The use of lead in automobile gasoline resulted in more than 240,000 tonnes of lead being emitted to the Australian environment over its 70-year period of use starting in 1932. The consequences of the emissions and subsequent depositions have resulted in marked contamination of urban and peri-urban aerosols, soils, plants and humans. This paper charts these effects and examines the extent of recovery from one of the most pervasive and persistent environmental pollutants. Lead isotopic composition of Adelaide and Sydney aerosol filters show that air lead composition shifts from values that approximate Broken Hill type ores, the predominant lead source used in gasoline (1.04 206Pb/207Pb and 2.31 208Pb/207Pb), towards ratios that more closely match local uncontaminated soil and bedrock values (Adelaide ~1.19 206Pb/207Pb and ~2.50 208Pb/207Pb; Sydney ~1.15 206Pb/207Pb and 2.48 208Pb/207Pb).\nProxy atmospheric measurements from historic wine, lichen and fungi samples extending over 120 years show how both concentration and composition values shifted in the middle to late 20th century to reflect petrol emissions and then recovered rapidly at the end of the century as leaded gasoline consumption declined. For example, lead in wine from South Australia fell from >100 µg/L in the 1960s and 1970s to < 5 µg/L in the 2010s due to the removal of the primary source of atmospheric lead - gasoline. However, measurement of contemporary surface soils, ash produced from wildfires and air filters demonstrate that the effect of depositions persists and industrial lead and other toxic metals (including arsenic, cadmium and nickel) are subject to frequent remobilization. Predicted increases in wildfires and the generation of lead, arsenic and cadmium toxic particulates warrants greater consideration of the risk for vulnerable populations and firefighters who are most exposed.",

            "abstract": "A 762-meter Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) array with a channel spacing of one meter was deployed at the Garner Valley Downhole Array in Southern California. The array was approximately rectangular with dimensions of 180 meters by 80 meters. The array also included two subdiagonals within the rectangle along which three-component geophones were co-located. Several active sources were deployed, including a 45-kN, swept-frequency, shear-mass shaker, which produced strong Rayleigh waves across the array. Both DAS and geophone traces were filtered in 2-Hz steps between 4 and 20 Hz to obtain phase velocities as a function of frequency from fitting the moveout of travel times over distances of 35 meters or longer. As an alternative to this traditional means of finding phase velocity, it is theoretically possible to find the Rayleigh-wave phase velocity at each point of co-location as the ratio of DAS and geophone responses, because DAS is sensitive to ground strain and geophones are sensitive to ground velocity, after suitable corrections for instrument response (Mikumo & Aki, 1964). The concept was tested in WPP, a seismic wave propagation program, by first validating and then using a 3D synthetic, full-waveform seismic model to simulate the effect of increased levels of noise and uncertainty as data go from ideal to more realistic. The results obtained from this study provide a better understanding of the DAS response and its potential for being combined with traditional seismometers for obtaining phase velocity at a single location.

Preliminary estimates indicate that (1) the ratio of BC to dust in snow increases going south from Northern to Central Chile, and (2) in snow sampled during the two weeks following the snowstorm, the impurities were concentrated in the upper 5 cm of snow, indicating that the surface layer became polluted over time by dry deposition.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes a non-parametric frequency analysis method for hydrological extreme-value samples with a size larger than 100, verifying the estimation accuracy with a computer intensive statistics (CIS) resampling such as the bootstrap. Probable maximum values are also incorporated into the analysis for extreme events larger than a design level of flood control.\nTraditional parametric frequency analysis methods of extreme values include the following steps: Step 1: Collecting and checking extreme-value data; Step 2: Enumerating probability distributions that would be fitted well to the data; Step 3: Parameter estimation; Step 4: Testing goodness of fit; Step 5: Checking the variability of quantile (T-year event) estimates by the jackknife resampling method; and Step_6: Selection of the best distribution (final model). The non-parametric method (NPM) proposed here can skip Steps 2, 3, 4 and 6.\nComparing traditional parameter methods (PM) with the NPM, this paper shows that PM often underestimates 100-year quantiles for annual maximum rainfall samples with records of more than 100 years. Overestimation examples are also demonstrated. The bootstrap resampling can do bias correction for the NPM and can also give the estimation accuracy as the bootstrap standard error. This NPM has advantages to avoid various difficulties in above-mentioned steps in the traditional PM.\nProbable maximum events are also incorporated into the NPM as an upper bound of the hydrological variable. Probable maximum precipitation (PMP) and probable maximum flood (PMF) can be a new parameter value combined with the NPM. An idea how to incorporate these values into frequency analysis is proposed for better management of disasters that exceed the design level. The idea stimulates more integrated approach by geoscientists and statisticians as well as encourages practitioners to consider the worst cases of disasters in their disaster management planning and practices.",

Within this framework, the PAGES 2k Network was established to provide a focus on the past 2000 years, a period that encompasses Medieval Climate Anomaly warming, Little Ice Age cooling, and recent anthropogenically-forced climate change. The results of these studies are used for testing earth system models, and for understanding decadal- to centennial-scale variability, which is needed for long-term planning. International coordination and cooperation among the nine regional Working Groups that make up the 2k Network has been critical to the success of PAGES 2k. The collaborative approach is moving toward scientific achievements across the regional groups, including: (i) the development of a community-driven open-access proxy climate database; (ii) integration of multi-resolution proxy records; (iii) development of multivariate climate reconstructions; and (iv) a leap forward in the spatial resolution of paleoclimate reconstructions. The last addition to the 2k Network, the Ocean2k Working Group has further innovated the collaborative approach by: (1) creating an open, receptive environment to discuss ideas exclusively in the virtual space; (2) employing an array of real-time collaborative software tools to enable communication, group document writing, and data analysis; (3) consolidating executive leadership teams to oversee project development and manage grassroots-style volunteer pools; and (4) embracing the value-added role that international and interdisciplinary science can play in advancing paleoclimate hypotheses critical to understanding future change. Ongoing efforts for the PAGES 2k Network are focused on developing new standards for data quality control and archiving. These tasks will provide the foundation for new and continuing “trans-regional” 2k projects which address paleoclimate science that transcend regional boundaries. The PAGES 2k Network encourages participation by all investigators interested in this community-wide project.",

As examples, we will present the results from our recent studies on formation of calcium carbonates, dolomites and bio-cements.\nThe extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the Synechococcuscell envelope are recognized key players in the nucleation of carbonates in marine and freshwater environments. Yet, little is known about a nutrient contents control over the molecular composition of Synechococcus cell envelope, and consequently, biomineralization. In the first study, we investigated how a variation of the phosphorus (P) in the growth media can lead to changes in the surface reactivity of the cells and impact their ability to form carbonates.\nThe objective of the second study is to gain insights into the spatial distribution of cyanobacterial EPS and dolomite from different sediment layers of Khor Al-Adaid sabkha (Qatar). Here, we characterized microbial mats on molecular level in respect of organic and inorganic components using in-situ 2D Raman spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were used. Additionally, 2D chemical maps of sediment layers documented spectral characterizations of minerals and organic matter of microbial origins at high spatial resolution.\nFinally, we will show the results from the experiments with auto-phototrophic cyanobacteria Gloeocapsa PCC73106, which habitat on the monument surfaces, towards its application for bio-concrete, a product of microbial carbonate precipitation. We studied the biomineralization in biofilm forming Gloeocapsa PCC73106 on the concrete surface as a pre-requirement for microbial carbonate precipitation. Biomineralization on the concrete surface by live cells and killed cells were compared with that under the abiotic condition.\nOur experiments allow us to conclude that environmental conditions play a significant role in the control of the EPS dynamics and synthesis by cyanobacteria cells and, hence, these factors should be considered in biomineralization experiments.\n ",

            "abstract": "The IRIS Data Management Center (DMC) has served the seismological community for nearly 25 years. In that time we have offered data and information from our archive using a variety of mechanisms ranging from email-based to desktop applications to web applications and web services. Of these, web services have quickly become the primary method for data extraction at the DMC. In 2011, the first full year of operation, web services accounted for over 40% of the data shipped from the DMC. In 2014, over ~450 TB of data was delivered directly to users through web services, representing nearly 70% of all shipments from the DMC that year. In addition to handling requests directly from users, the DMC switched all data extraction methods to use web services in 2014. On average the DMC now handles between 10 and 20 million requests per day submitted to web service interfaces.\nThe rapid adoption of web services is attributed to the many advantages they bring. For users, they provide on-demand data using an interface technology, HTTP, that is widely supported in nearly every computing environment and language. These characteristics, combined with human-readable documentation and existing tools make integration of data access into existing workflows relatively easy. For the DMC, the web services provide an abstraction layer to internal repositories allowing for concentrated optimization of extraction workflow and easier evolution of those repositories. Lending further support to DMC’s push in this direction, the core web services for station metadata, timeseries data and event parameters were adopted as standards by the International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN).\nWe expect to continue enhancing existing services and building new capabilities for this platform. For example, the DMC has created a federation system and tools allowing researchers to discover and collect seismic data from data centers running the FDSN-standardized services. A future capability will leverage the DMC’s MUSTANG project to select data based on data quality measurements. Within five years, the DMC’s web services have proven to be a robust and flexible platform that enables continued growth for the DMC. We expect continued enhancements and adoption of web services.",

            "abstract": "High volume hydraulic fracturing of unconventional deposits has expanded rapidly over the past decade in the US, with much attention focused on the Marcellus Shale gas reservoir in the northeastern US. We use naturally occurring radium isotopes and 222Rn to explore changes in formation characteristics as a result of hydraulic fracturing. Gas and produced waters were analyzed from time series samples collected soon after hydraulic fracturing at three Marcellus Shale well sites in the Appalachian Basin, USA. Analyses of δ18O, Cl- , and 226Ra in flowback fluid are consistent with two end member mixing between injected slick water and formation brine. All three tracers indicate that the ratio of injected water to formation brine declines with time across both time series. Cl- concentration (max ~1.5-2.2 M) and 226Ra activity (max ~165-250 Bq/Kg) in flowback fluid are comparable at all three sites. There are differences evident in the stable isotopic composition (δ18O & δD) of injected slick water across the three sites, but all appear to mix with formation brine of similar isotopic composition. On a plot of water isotopes, δ18O in formation brine-dominated fluid is enriched by ~3-4 permille relative to the Global Meteoric Water Line, indicating oxygen exchange with shale. The ratio of 223Ra/226Ra and 228Ra/226Ra in produced waters is quite low relative to shale samples analyzed. This indicates that most of the 226Ra in the formation brine must be sourced from shale weathering or dissolution rather than emanation due to alpha recoil from the rock surface. During the first week of flowback, ratios of short lived isotopes 223Ra and 224Ra to longer lived radium isotopes change modestly, suggesting rock surface area per unit of produced water volume did not change substantially. For one well, longer term gas samples were collected. The 222Rn/methane ratio in produced gas from this site declines with time and may represent a decrease in the brine to gas ratio in the reservoir over the course of six months after initial fracturing. Naturally occurring radium and radon isotopes show promise in elucidating sub-surface dynamics following hydraulic fracturing plays.",

            "abstract": "Concerns have arisen of the potential effects of hydraulic fracturing water withdrawals on both water for human consumption and aquatic communities. Any impacts are likely to be location specific since current U.S. hydraulic fracturing activities are concentrated in particular regions, water availability is unevenly distributed, and hydraulic fracturing water use differs between locations, including the amount of water use per well, source water, and reuse rates. Here, we used FracFocus to estimate annual hydraulic fracturing water use, and combined this with U.S. Geological Survey water use data and water availability indices to identify U.S. counties where potential impacts may be most likely. We surveyed the literature to understand source water and reuse rates. Overall, we found that hydraulic fracturing water use and consumption are a small percentage relative to total water use and consumption for most U.S. counties. However, there are 26 counties where fracturing water use is greater than 10% compared to 2010 total water use, and eight and four counties at greater than 30% and 50%, respectively. We conclude hydraulic fracturing water use currently has the greatest potential for impacts in southern and western Texas due to relatively high fracturing water use, low reuse rates, low fresh water availability, and frequent drought. However, the availability of brackish groundwater in these areas is also high relative to fracturing water use, suggesting an alternative source that could reduce potential impacts. Comparatively, the potential for impacts appears to be lower in other U.S. regions. While our county-scale findings do not preclude the possibility of more localized water quantity effects, this study provides a relative indicator of areas where potential problems might arise.

In particular, the trapping and mobilization of nonwetting phase fluids (e.g. oil, CO2, gas, or NAPL in water-wet media) is of significant concern; and has been well documented to be a function of both wetting and nonwetting fluid properties, morphological characteristics of the porous medium, and system history. However, generalization of empirical trends and results for application between different fluid-fluid-medium systems requires careful consideration and characterization of the relevant system properties.\nWe present a comprehensive and cohesive description of nonwetting phase behaviour as observed via a suite of three dimensional x-ray microtomography imaging experiments investigating immiscible fluid flow, trapping, and interfacial interactions of wetting (brine) and nonwetting (air, oil, and supercritical CO2) phase in sandstones and synthetic media. Microtomographic images, acquired for drainage and imbibition flow processes, allow for precise and extensive characterization of nonwetting phase fluid saturation, topology, and connectivity; imaging results are paired with externally measured capillary pressure data to provide a comprehensive description of fluid states. Fluid flow and nonwetting phase trapping behaviour is investigated as a function of system history, morphological metrics of the geologic media, and nonwetting phase fluid characteristics; and particular emphasis is devoted to the differences between ambient condition (air-brine) and reservoir condition (supercritical CO2-brine) studies.\nPreliminary results provide insight into the applicability of using ambient condition experiments to explore reservoir condition processes, and also elucidate the underlying physics of trapping and mobilization of nonwetting phase fluids.",

            "abstract": "North-south compression across the Los Angeles basin is accommodated by slip on thrust faults beneath the basin that may present significant seismic hazard to Los Angeles. Previous geodesy-based efforts to constrain the distributions and rates of elastic strain accumulation on these faults [Argus et al 2005, 2012] have found that the elastic model used has a first-order impact on the inferred distribution of locking and creep, underlining the need to accurately incorporate the laterally heterogeneous elastic structure and complex fault geometries of the Los Angeles basin into this analysis. We are using Gamra [Landry and Barbot, in prep.], a newly developed adaptive-meshing finite-difference solver, to compute elastostatic Green’s functions that incorporate the full 3D regional elastic structure provided by the SCEC Community Velocity Model. Among preliminary results from benchmarks, forward models and inversions, we find that: 1) for a modeled creep source on the edge dislocation geometry from Argus et al [2005], the use of the SCEC CVM material model produces surface velocities in the hanging wall that are up to ~50% faster than those predicted in an elastic halfspace model; 2) in sensitivity-modulated inversions of the Argus et al [2005] GPS velocity field for slip on the same dislocation source, the use of the CVM deepens the inferred locking depth by ≥3 km compared to an elastic halfspace model; 3) when using finite-difference or finite-element models with Dirichlet boundary conditions (except for the free surface) for problems of this scale, it is necessary to set the boundaries at least ~100 km away from any slip source or data point to guarantee convergence within 5% of analytical solutions (a result which may be applicable to other static dislocation modeling problems and which may scale with the size of the area of interest). Here we will present finalized results from inversions of an updated GPS velocity field [Argus et al, AGU 2015] for the inferred distribution of locking and creep on 1) the Argus et al [2005] dislocation source and 2) major fault planes in the SCEC Community Fault Model, using the full 3D SCEC velocity model in addition to vertically stratified and elastic halfspace models.",

However, professors and academics are generally in charge of the design of field-based activities and the roles played by the students in field research programs. In this presentation, I will discuss the pedagogical potential and impact of engaging students as i) genuine research partners, and ii) outreach scientists in field-based investigations. As research partners, students are given the opportunity to discuss and even influence the experimental design and acquisition of field data in research consortia. As outreach scientists, students engage their audience with their own inquiry-based fieldwork. I will use examples from a major geophysical research consortium and a community-based archaeological-geophysical project to illustrate these pedagogical approaches that involve changing the power balance between students and academics. The benefits to both the students and academics will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Greening has been observed across the arctic, but the ecological processes that enable widespread increases in plant productivity have been difficult to understand with field measurements alone. Using the functional convergence of foliar nitrogen and leaf area index in arctic plants, we developed a simple coupled carbon and nitrogen cycling model (CCaN) to increase our understanding of warming induced vegetation changes and carbon and nitrogen coupling in the arctic. We used primary literature and data from long term ecological research sites at Toolik Field Station, Alaska to calculate prior ranges for CCaN parameters, and then we assimilated five years of eddy covariance data from a nearby field site using a batch data assimilation method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. Variance decomposition analyses show that the majority of model variance in carbon and nitrogen stocks can be attributed to uncertainty in four parameters: proportion of nitrogen in foliage, proportion of nitrogen in roots, nitrogen uptake rate, and litter rate. These parameters associated with nitrogen cycling are widely used in biogeochemical cycling models and are difficult to constrain because they vary greatly across plant functional groups. The parameters responsible for variance in net ecosystem exchange vary seasonally; winter variance is controlled by parameters associated with the temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration, and summer variance is controlled by the proportion of nitrogen in foliage. The widespread greening observed across the arctic over the last decade has been attributed to the direct effects of increased temperature, despite the inconsistency of the response of arctic plants to experimental warming indicating there must be other mechanisms at play. These mechanisms can be teased apart using models, but we must first improve model predictions by constraining widely-used processes and parameters, particularly those linked to nitrogen cycling.",

            "abstract": "It has been proposed that the mechanisms for intermediate-depth and deep earthquakes might be different. While previous extensive seismological studies suggested that such potential differences do not significantly affect the scaling relationships of earthquake parameters, there has been only a few investigations regarding their dynamic characteristics, especially for fracture energy. In this work, the 2014 Mw7.9 Rat Islands intermediate-depth (105 km) earthquake and the 2015 Mw7.8 Bonin Islands deep (680 km) earthquake are studied from two different perspectives. First, their kinematic rupture models are constrained using teleseismic body waves. Our analysis reveals that the Rat Islands earthquake breaks the entire cold core of the subducting slab defined as the depth of the 650oC isotherm. The inverted stress drop is 4 MPa, compatible to that of intra-plate earthquakes at shallow depths. On the other hand, the kinematic rupture model of the Bonin Islands earthquake, which occurred in a region lacking of seismicity for the past forty years, according to the GCMT catalog, exhibits an energetic rupture within a 35 km by 30 km slip patch and a high stress drop of 24 MPa. It is of interest to note that although complex rupture patterns are allowed to match the observations, the inverted slip distributions of these two earthquakes are simple enough to be approximated as the summation of a few circular/elliptical slip patches. Thus, we investigate subsequently their dynamic rupture models. We use a simple modelling approach in which we assume that the dynamic rupture propagation obeys a slip-weakening friction law, and we describe the distribution of stress and friction on the fault as a set of elliptical patches. We will constrain the three dynamic parameters that are yield stress, background stress prior to the rupture and slip weakening distance, as well as the shape of the elliptical patches directly from teleseismic body waves observations. The study would help us getting a better understanding of the dynamic conditions that control the rupture behaviour of these two types of earthquakes, and subsequently improving our knowledge of the dynamics of subducting slabs.",

In order to develop probabilistic regional climate information that represents the uncertainty in climate scenario experiments in East Asia (CORDEX-EA and Japan), the probability distribution of 2m air temperature was estimated by using developed regression model. The method can be easily applicable to other regions and other physical quantities, and also to downscale to finer-scale dependent on availability of observation dataset. Probabilistic climate information in present (1969-1998) and future (2069-2098) climate was developed using CMIP3 SRES A1b scenarios 21 models and the observation data (CRU_TS3.22 & University of Delaware in CORDEX-EA, NIAES AMeDAS mesh data in Japan). The prototype of probabilistic information in CORDEX-EA and Japan represent the quantified structural uncertainties of multi-model ensemble experiments of climate change scenarios.

            "abstract": "The Validation of Ground Based Ozone Measurements over Korea\nKorea will launch GEMS instrument in 2018 onboard the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite to monitor tropospheric gas concentrations in both high temporal and spatial resolution. In order to utilize information from satellite, it is crucial to carry out validation of satellite data with respect to ground-based measurements because satellite retrievals suffer from large error. The purpose of this study is to examine the performance of total ozone measurements from Pandora, Brewer, and Dobson which will be used for validation of GEMS ozone product. Because single version of the satellite retrieval algorithm is used to process the entire data set for a given satellite instrument and satellite instrument characteristics are typically changing slowly, it is assumed that sudden jumps or large drifts in ground-satellite total ozone measurements difference for individual sites are commonly related to problems with ground-based measurements. Thereby, satellite measurements can be used to estimate the performance of the ground-based measurement network as well as to identify potential problems residing in individual station. As a reference of satellite ozone measurements, we have selected ozone data derived from OMI-TOMS V8.5 algorithm because it is a very robust algorithm that has well studied about various error sources such as the effects of aerosols and clouds, variation in shape of ozone profiles with season, latitude, and total ozone. For the future validation of GEMS measurements, Korea has planned to use Pandora measurement that has been started operating since 2012. However, Pandora measurements reported to have unusual high total column ozone in the presence of clouds from the comparison of Pandora with OMI total ozone during DISCOVERY-AQ campaign. In this study, we will analyze the Pandora measurements associated with cloud and introduce the statistical technique, Kalman Filter, to correct the cloud contaminated ozone measurements.",

These components include magnetic neutral lines, supergranule cells, fibrils (spicules), filaments (prominences when observed on the limb), coronal cells, filament cavities and their overlying coronal arcades. Filaments are very highly structured and extend in height from the photosphere to the corona. Filament cores have chromospheric temperatures - 10,000 K (even at coronal heights ~ 100 Mm), surrounded by hotter plasma with temperature up to ~50,000 K. The whole filament is isolated from the rest of the solar corona by an envelope - the filament channel cavity - with temperatures of about 2,000,000 K. The filament channel cavity is even hotter than the solar corona outside the filament channel arcade.\nThe compactness and big temperature variations make filament channels unique ready-to-go laboratories of coronal plasma heating and thermodynamics. In this work we discuss possible sources and mechanisms of heating in the filament channel environment. In particular, we address the mechanisms of magnetic canceling and current sheet dissipation.",

These interfaces have become the primary access mechanisms for all data extraction from the DMC. For the last two years the DMC has been a principal participant in the GeoWS project, which aims to develop common web service interfaces for data access across hydrology, geodesy, seismology, marine geophysics, atmospheric and other geoscience disciplines. By extending our approach we have converged, along with other project members, on a web service interface and presentation design appropriate for geoscience and other data. The key principles of the approach include using a simple subset of RESTful concepts, common calling conventions whenever possible, a common tabular text data set convention, human-readable documentation and tools to help scientific end users learn how to use the interfaces. The common tabular text format, called GeoCSV, has been incorporated into the DMC’s seismic station and event (earthquake) services. In addition to modifying our existing services, we have developed prototype GeoCSV web services for data sets managed by external (unfunded) collaborators. These prototype services include interfaces for data sets at NGDC/NCEI (water level tides and meteorological satellite measurements), INTERMAGNET repository and UTEP gravity and magnetic measurements. In progress are interfaces for WOVOdat (volcano observatory measurements), NEON (ecological observatory measurements) and more. An important goal of our work is to build interfaces usable by non-technologist end users. We find direct usability by researchers to be a major factor in cross-discipline data use, which itself is a key to solving complex research questions. In addition to data discovery and collection by end users, these interfaces provide a foundation upon which federated data access and brokering systems are already being built.\n\nGeoWS project: http://earthcube.org/group/geows-geoscience-web-services\nGeoWS technical home: http://data.geows.org",

            "abstract": "The evolution of the atmosphere on Mars is one of the most intriguing problems in the exploration of the Solar System, and the climate of Mars may have evolved from a warmer, wetter early state to the cold, dry current state. Because CO2 is the major constituent of Mars’s atmosphere, its isotopic signatures offer a unique window to trace the evolution of climate on Mars. We derive new quantitative constraints on the amount of carbonate deposition and the atmospheric pressure of Mars through time, extending into the Noachian, ~3.8 Gyr before present. This determination is based on recent Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) isotopic measurements of Mars’s atmosphere, recent orbiter, lander, and rover measurements of Mars’s surface, and a newly identified mechanism (photodissociation of CO) that efficiently enriches the heavy carbon isotope. In particular, we find that escape via CO photodissociation on Mars has a fractionation factor of 0.6 and hence, photochemical escape processes can effectively enrich 13C in the Mars’s atmosphere during the Amazonian. This enrichment is partially compensated by moderate carbonate precipitation during the late Noachian and/or Hesperian. The current atmospheric 13C/12C and rock and soil carbonate measurements indicate an early atmosphere with a surface pressure less than 1 bar. Only scenarios with large amounts of carbonate formation in open lakes permit higher values up to 1.8 bars. The evolutionary scenarios are fully testable with data from the MAVEN mission and further studies of the isotopic composition of carbonate in the Martian rock record through time.",

We investigated the climate impacts of widespread deployment of cool pavements by increasing the albedo of the pavements from 0.1 to 0.5 to understand the efficiency of cool pavements in reducing the temperature in California’s urban areas. A validated parameterization of WRF model coupled with Single Layer Urban Canopy Model (SLUCM) is employed to simulate the effects of pavements at the bottom of canopy on urban heat islands. The results show local surface air temperature reductions, peaking at late morning and late evening which coincides with the lowest boundary layer height in the day time. Summer time temperature reductions up to 0.62 K in the evening (20:00 local) and 0.32 K in afternoon (14:00) in California are predicted. The cooling effects of 15 cities in California are sampled and analyzed. The average temperature reductions for the cities in California show 0.32 K temperature reduction per 0.1 total albedo reduction in the afternoon (14:00) which is consistent with the previous works. The linear relation between temperature reductions and the albedo increase is used to estimate the effect of cool pavements in “No Canopy” state, which can be used as an upper bound of the effects of cool pavements.",

            "abstract": "In arid and semi-arid ecosystems, solar radiation plays an important role in C cycling by increasing the decomposition rate of plant litter and soil organic matter (i.e. photodegradation). Recent studies suggest that exposure to solar radiation can facilitate microbial decomposition of litter by altering litter chemistry and consequently litter degradability. However, it remains unclear at what time scale this facilitation mechanism operates. Does radiation exposure during the day facilitate microbial decomposition at night? In a laboratory jar incubation experiment, a common grass litter was exposed to either a cycle of alternating ultraviolet (UV) radiation and dark phases (2 days in UV phase and 2 days in dark phase) or a continuous dark treatment in order to examine the impacts of UV radiation on CO2 production. The litter samples were also incubated under either wet or dry conditions to separate the contributions of abiotic photochemical and microbial processes to CO2 production. Under wet conditions, radiation regime did not affect CO2 production for the first half of the 4-month experiment; interestingly, in the second half of the experiment, wet litter in the alternating treatment produced at least 15% more CO2, regardless of UV or dark phase, than wet litter in the continuous dark treatment. This difference in CO2 production was significant even after accounting for higher temperature in the alternating treatment that may have stimulated microbial respiration or generated thermal CO2 production. Under dry conditions, litter in the alternating treatment produced 1.6 times more CO2 than litter in the continuous dark treatment, which we interpret to be abiotic photochemical CO2 production. However, this abiotic flux was minimal compared to the microbial respiration flux, as cumulative CO2 production from dry litter was less than 1% of that from wet litter. Overall, these results confirm that UV radiation does facilitate microbial decomposition at a diel scale. This diel facilitation mechanism is likely to be more important than abiotic processes in explaining the enhanced litter decay rate reported by previous photodegradation studies.",

            "abstract": "In the binary neutron star system, angular momentum transfer from accretion disk to a star is essential process for spin-up/down of stars. The angular momentum transfer has been well formulated for the accretion disk strongly magnetized by the neutron star [e.g., Ghosh and Lamb, 1978, 1979a, b]. However, the electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the neutron star and accretion disk has not been self-consistently solved in the previous studies although the magnetic field lines from the star are strongly tied with the accretion disk. In this study, we applied the planet-magnetosphere coupling process established for Jupiter [Hill, 1979] to the binary neutron star system. Angular momentum distribution is solved based on the torque balance between the neutron star’s surface and accretion disk coupled by the magnetic field tensions. We found the EM coupling can transfer significantly larger fraction of the angular momentum from the magnetized accretion disk to the star than the unmagnetized case. The resultant spin-up rate is estimated to ~10^-14 [sec/sec] for the nominal binary system parameters, which is comparable with or larger than the other common spin-down/up processes: e.g., the magnetic dipole radiation spin-down. The Joule heating energy dissipated in the EM coupling is estimated to be up to ~10^36 [erg/sec] for the nominal binary system parameters. The release is comparable to that of gravitation energy directly caused by the matters accreting onto the neutron star. This suggests the EM coupling at the neutron star can accompany the observable radiation as auroras with a similar manner to those at the rotating planetary magnetospheres like Jupiter, Saturn, and other gas giants.",

            "abstract": "Recorded by numerous local and temporary stations and containing over 5000 earthquakes shallower than 5-km depth, the 2008 Mogul Earthquake sequence (MES) in west Reno, NV provides an excellent dataset for investigating earthquake interaction and physical properties of a long-duration earthquake swarm. The MES was energetic for a 6-month period beginning in late Feb 2008 with 8 weeks of foreshock activity leading to the Mw 5.0 mainshock on Apr 26, 2008. We develop a high-precision catalog with relative hypocentral errors less than 100 meters using the double-difference algorithm HypoDD (Waldhauser and Ellsworth, 2000). The data is objectively decomposed into spatiotemporal subclusters by applying the statistical declustering methods of Zaliapin et al. (2008) based on nearest-neighbor space-time-magnitude distances. We choose a cluster threshold using a Gaussian mixture model. This approach results in 57 distinct subclusters, with a minimum of 5 earthquakes each, that together comprise 66% of the entire MES relocated catalog. Ten of the 57 subclusters have mainshocks that occur prior to the Mw 5.0 mainshock. All single events or those clustered with less than 4 other events are ignored in further analysis. We compare the spatial and temporal patterns, including aftershock decay and/or diffusion rates, of each subcluster as well as Poisson’s ratio, focal mechanisms, and source parameters for each. Over 1000 focal mechanisms developed using the HASH algorithm of Hardebeck and Shearer (2002) reveal distinct right-lateral, left-lateral, normal, and normal-oblique structures, which the declustering method identifies successfully. Stress drops for 90 events greater than or equal to Ml 2.5 are estimated from multiple EGF spectral ratios of P- and S-waves, objectively chosen based on signal-to-noise ratio, cross-correlation, bandwidth, and corner-frequency variance. We also investigate how the subclusters interact with and overlap each other in time and space to understand the interior dynamics of an earthquake swarm.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is impacting northern ecosystems through the thawing of the permafrost, which has resulted in changes to plant communities and greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). These greenhouse gases are of concern due to their potential feedbacks which create a warmer climate, thus increasing permafrost thawing. Our study focuses on how vegetation type differs in areas that have been impacted by thawing permafrost at Stordalen Mire located in Abisko, Sweden. To estimate change in vegetation communities, field-based measurements combined with remotely sensed image data was used. 75 randomized square-meter plots were measured for vegetation composition and classified into one of five site-types, each representing a different stage of permafrost degradation. New high-resolution imagery (1 cm) was collected using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) providing insight into the spatial patterning, characterizations, and changes of these communities. The UAV imagery was georectified using high precision GPS points collected across the mire. The imagery was then examined using a neural network analysis to estimate cover type across the mire. This 2015 cover type classification was then compared to previous UAV imagery taken on July 2014 to analyze changes in vegetation distribution as an indication of permafrost thaw. Hummock sites represent intact permafrost and have lost 21.5% coverage since 2014, while tall gramminoid sites, which indicate fully thawed sites, have increased coverage by 12.1%. A discriminate function analysis showed that site types can be differentiated based on species composition, thus showing that vegetation differs significantly across the thaw gradient. Using average flux rates of CH4 from each cover type reported previously, the percent of CH4 emitted over the mire was estimated for 2014 and 2015. Comparing both estimates, CH4 emissions increased with a flux change of 5604.5 g CH4/day. Our estimates of vegetation change may be used to parameterize simulation models and create future scenarios of how the vegetation cover will change in response to climate change. Data from this study will also help to explain how the ecology of the subarctic peatlands, now a carbon sink, may be on its way to changing into a source of carbon.",

            "abstract": "The strength and latitudinal position of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds (SHWW) play a fundamental role in influencing mid latitude climate and carbon dioxide exchange between the Southern Ocean and the atmosphere. Despite their importance, our understanding of past changes in the SHWW is limited by few paleoclimate records from the modern wind maximum that are often not in agreement. The New Zealand subantarctic Auckland Islands are located within the core of the modern wind belt (50°S) where the ocean-atmospheric linkages between the Antarctic and middle latitudes are strong. In contrast to other subantarctic islands on the Campbell Plateau, the Auckland Islands have protected fjord sub-basins, deep lakes, and peatlands that are advantageous for the development of high-resolution paleoclimate records.\nWe will present ongoing work towards the establishment of multi-proxy and multi-site reconstructions of past SHWW variability from the Auckland Islands. Modern process and paleoclimate results from two research cruises in 2014 and 2015 suggest that in lacustrine and fjord settings, the degree of water column mixing, the stable isotopic composition of n-alkanes and benthic foraminifera, the influx of terrestrial organic matter are good indicators of wind-induced mixing of the water column or precipitation-driven erosion within catchments. In ombrotrophic peatlands, hydrogen isotope ratios of specific organic molecules allow reconstructions of the hydrogen isotope ratios of precipitation, which is related to precipitation source area and the latitudinal position of the SHWW. Using macrofossil counts paired with abundances of leaf wax biomarkers, we are able to estimate the moisture balance at peatland coring sites. Early results indicate an overall strengthening of the SHWW at the Auckland Islands through the Holocene. We will discuss these results within the context of complimentary records developed from New Zealand and southern South America to ultimately obtain a Pacific basin view of Holocene SHWW.",

            "abstract": "Optimal management of subsurface processes requires the characterization of the uncertainty in reservoir description and reservoir performance prediction. The application of ensemble-based algorithms for history matching reservoir models has been steadily increasing over the past decade. However, the majority of implementations in the reservoir engineering have dealt only with production history matching. During geologic sequestration, the injection of large quantities of CO2 into the subsurface may alter the stress/strain field which in turn can lead to surface uplift or subsidence. Therefore, it is essential to couple multiphase flow and geomechanical response in order to predict and quantify the uncertainty of CO2 plume movement for long-term, large-scale CO2 sequestration projects. In this work, we simulate and estimate the properties of a reservoir that is being used to store CO2 as part of the In Salah Capture and Storage project in Algeria. The CO2 is separated from produced natural gas and is re-injected into downdip aquifer portion of the field from three long horizontal wells. The field observation data includes ground surface deformations (uplift) measured using satellite-based radar (InSAR), injection well locations and CO2 injection rate histories provided by the operators. We implement ensemble-based algorithms for assimilating both injection rate data as well as geomechanical observations (surface uplift) into reservoir model. The preliminary estimation results of horizontal permeability and material properties such as Young Modulus and Poisson Ratio are consistent with available measurements and previous studies in this field. Moreover, the existence of high-permeability channels/fractures within the reservoir; especially in the regions around the injection wells are confirmed. This estimation results can be used to accurately and efficiently predict and monitor the movement of CO2 plume.",

            "abstract": "Extensive high-severity wildfires and drought-induced tree mortality (including drought-and-heat-related insect pest outbreaks), along with associated major alterations of watershed conditions and hydrological processes, have intensified over the last two decades in Southwest USA forests and woodlands—on a scale unseen regionally since at least pre-1900, and quite possibly not for millennia, based on diverse lines of paleo-ecological and geomorphic evidence. Historical land-use patterns, decadal-scale climate variability (e.g., drought linked to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation), and warming temperatures in recent decades (resulting in “hotter drought” conditions) have been important interactive drivers of observed nonlinear threshold changes in these forest disturbance processes. In response, Southwest forest landscapes have been rapidly transitioning toward more open and drought-tolerant ecosystems, with altered ecohydrological patterns. If regional temperatures increase as projected by climate models, multiple lines of evidence (experiments, observations, empirical models, process models) suggest that Southwest drought stress after ca. 2050 will increasingly exceed that of the most severe droughts in the past 1,000 years, putting current historical forests at grave risk—in particular the tallest (& often the oldest) trees and forests. These findings point toward the emergence of increasingly novel vegetation patterns over the course of this century. Forests globally exhibit great diversity in environmental drivers, histories, dominant ecological patterns and processes, biodiversity, etc., which are expected to produce diverse forest responses (and levels of resilience) to projected global changes in climate and human uses this century. Even given this planetary diversity of forests and expected global change responses, the observed reorganization of forests underway in the Southwest USA – driven by the convergence of changes in land use patterns, disturbance trends, and climate (particularly hotter droughts) – may foreshadow widespread forest ecosystem changes more broadly in North America and beyond. Analogous global examples of recent increases in forest disturbance levels related to threshold responses to hotter droughts also will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Great earthquakes have occurred along the Japan trench subduction zone, and some of them, e.g. Meiji Sanriku earthquake in 1896, could have ruptured the shallow portion of the plate boundary fault similar to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Geological/geophysical structure in the vicinity of the trench axis is one of the keys to understand the nature of shallow mega thrust events and tsunamigenesis. We have conducted high resolution seismic surveys in the northern part of the Japan Trench axis region in 38 – 40.5 N to investigate the detailed structure in the trench axis area. Thrust faults and possible slope failures are observed landward of the trench axis, beneath the lowermost landward trench slope. The deformation and evolution styles of the lowermost landward slope show variation along the trench strike. To the south of the survey area in 38 – 39 N, imbricate thrust-and-fold packages is observed but limited within the vicinity of the trench axis. Thickness of the hanging wall sediment is relatively thinner in the lowermost landward slope. These observation could suggest that the lowermost slope has not been well developed in this area. To the north around 40 – 40.5 N, frontal thrusts and imbricate structure are clearly observed on the seismic profiles through ~ 10 – 15 km landward of the trench axis. Thickness of the hanging wall sediment is thicker in this area. The bending-related faults on the subducted plate are generally not located beneath the lowermost slope up to ~ 10 km landward of the trench. These observations suggest that the imbricate structure has been well developed in the last ~ 10 kyr in this area. Around 39.5 N, it is suggested that slope failures have occurred. The trench axis is filled by slump deposits and debris with chaotic acoustic characteristics. Above mentioned variations in the deformation and evolution style in the lowermost landward slope could affect the mechanism of tsunami generation in the northern Japan Trench. The variation on the thickness of the incoming sediments is also identified along the trench strike. The variation of the sediment thickness on the incoming plate and its relation with the throw of the bending-related normal fault could also be an important factor for the tsunami generation caused by the shallow mega slip events in the northern Japan Trench.",

With changes to the cloud screening and optical property retrieval algorithms between Collections 5.1 and 6, there is additional uncertainty with regard to which product provides the more representative estimate.\nIn order to quantify and better understand the differences in estimates between both products, CDNC is calculated from one year of Level 2 MODIS optical property retrievals and aggregated to Level 3 (1x1 degree) for the 1.6, 2.1 and 3.7 μm channels over global ocean scenes. Several comparisons between Collections 5.1 and 6 are made. 1) Investigating how MODIS Cloud Product quality flag selections affect CDNC estimates. 2) The dependence of the 3.7 and 1.6 μm values on the retrieval success of the 2.1 μm value in Collection 5.1 relative to the independent retrievals provided in Collection 6. 3) The inclusion of partly cloudy retrievals in Collection 6, which are excluded from the Collection 5.1 dataset via the Clear Sky Restoral Algorithm. Differences in estimates are presented in both a regional and temporal context.",

            "abstract": "Central to the improvement of upper atmospheric models is a dramatic expansion in current understanding of the coupling and dynamics within the Ionosphere / Thermosphere (IT) system. Conventional in situ measurement techniques using energy scanning and analog current detection are limited by poor sensitivity and have produced incomplete datasets. The Atmospheric Velocity Imaging Detector (AVID) overcomes the limitations of current instruments through the use of two orthogonally mounted Imaging Dispersive Energy Analyzers (IDEAs) which share a single pulse-counting ion detector. The second-generation IDEA design uses inexpensive and lightweight printed circuit boards, with parallel exposed copper traces connected via resistors to generate a highly uniform deflection field. This arrangement allows AVID to make accurate and sensitive in situ measurements of neutral wind / ion drift velocities, temperature, density, and composition, with no voltage scanning required. We present results from the development progress of AVID, through laboratory testing and characterization of an individual IDEA unit when exposed to angle-resolved hypervelocity ion beams emulating 4.7 eV O and 8.2 eV N2. Through these measurements, the projected performance of the AVID system and recently developed image processing algorithms are compared against SIMION ion trajectory calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.",

However, very little ice thickness information actually exists. We present results of the first-ever airborne electromagnetic ice thickness surveys over the NWP carried out in April and May 2011 and 2015 over first-year and multiyear ice. Results show modal thicknesses between 1.8 and 2.0 m in all regions. Mean thicknesses over 3 m and thick, deformed ice were observed over some multiyear ice regimes shown to originate from the Arctic Ocean. Thick ice features more than 100 m wide and thicker than 4 m occurred frequently. There are few other data to compare with to evaluate if the ice of the Northwest Passage has transitioned as other parts of the Arctic have. Although likely thinner than some 20 or more years ago, ice conditions must still be considered severe, and the Canadian Arctic Archipelao may well be considered the last ice refuge of the Arctic. These results have important implications for the prediction of ice break-up and summer ice conditions, and the assessment of sea ice hazards during the summer shipping season.",

Typically efforts to map community exposure to climate threats over large areas have limited consideration of local perspectives about associated risks, constraining their utility for local management. This problem is especially acute in remote locations such as the Arctic where there are unique vulnerabilities to coastal threats that can be fully understood only through inclusion of community stakeholders. Through collaboration with community members, this study identifies important coastal assets and places and surveys local perspectives of exposure to climate threats along Alaska's vast North Slope coastline spanning multiple municipalities. To model physical exposure, the study adapts the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) coastal vulnerability index (CVI) to the Arctic context by incorporating the effects of open water distance determined by sea ice extent, and assigning CVI values to coastal assets and places according to direction and proximity. The study found that in addition to concerns about exposed municipal and industrial assets, North Slope communities viewed exposure of traditional activity sites as presenting a particular risk for communities. Highly exposed legacy Cold War Distant Early Warning Line sites are of particular concern with impacts ranging from financial risk to contamination of sensitive coastal marine environments. This research demonstrates a method to collaboratively map community exposure to coastal climate threats to better understand local risks and produce locally usable exposure maps.",

            "abstract": "Recent work (Ridolfi and Renzulli 2014) shows that amphiboles can be used to infer magmatic temperatures, even without knowledge of co-existing liquids. Here, we apply this approach, using new calibrations, to investigate felsic-mafic magma interactions, in a volcanic (Lassen Volcanic Center, a Cascade volcano) and plutonic (the Jurassic Guadalupe Igneous Complex) system. Preliminary data suggest that volcanic processes, as might be expected, preserve higher temperatures than plutonic materials (on average, volcanic amphiboles recorded 907±57.3°C while plutonic amphiboles recorded 764±59.7°C). We also find that the average T of a given mineral grain decreases with increased mineral size such that those crystallized below 800°C sometimes reach sizes beyond ~1mm, while those near 900°C appear truncated to ~0.3mm. It is not clear if T is the only control on amphibole crystal growth; however, our results would imply that larger grains not only require more time to grow but require continued undercooling. Significant cooling or heating is also recorded in many volcanically- and plutonically-grown grains, which may reflect transitioning between magmas of different T and composition. Core-to-rim cooling trends (with a common T of drop of 80oC) likely represent mafic-to-felsic magma transitions, whereas core-to-rim heating of similar magnitudes indicate a felsic-mafic transition. Some grains, though, exhibit a constant T (in the range 700-900°C) from core to rim, which perhaps indicates some shielding from magma mixing processes. Amphiboles might thus provide a reliable record of the intensity of magma mingling and mixing experienced by any particular enclave. Interestingly, volcanically-derived amphiboles appear to mostly record cooling towards the rims, while their plutonic counterparts tend to experience heating. It would thus appear that at Lassen, amphiboles are unaffected by later mafic magma recharge, but at the GIC, the plutonic amphiboles are more likely to be assimilated into hotter recharge magma. This contrast may simply reflect an accident of sampling, but it might also be important for understanding how recharge magmas interact with resident felsic magmas under contrasting conditions of magma storage.",

Higher LST has been tied to higher rates of glacier mass loss as well as a reduction in surface albedo. A lower albedo means more solar radiation is absorbed which can increase the LST, leading to more melt and further reductions in albedo. Recent work on the Greenland Ice Sheet, immediately east of the QEI, has found recent reductions in ice sheet albedo to be consistent with documented increases in summer air and ice temperatures as well as melt and mass loss. No studies documenting large-scale trends in surface albedo and their relationship to land surface temperatures, surface melt and glacial mass balance exist for the QEI.\nData from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to determine mean summer clear-sky land surface temperature over QEI ice caps and glaciers from 2000 to 2014 (MOD11A2), and mean and minimum shortwave broadband white-sky and black-sky albedo from 2001 to 2014 (MCD43A3). Preliminary results reveal 14yr (2001-2014) mean summer melt season white-sky and black-sky surface albedos, of 0.547 and 0.562, respectively, averaged across all ice masses in the QEI. Mean summer QEI-wide ice surface temperature, averaged over the period 2000-2014 was 269.2K with a maximum of 270.4K in 2007. Manson Icefield and Sydkap Ice Cap, situated on southern Ellesmere Island had both the lowest mean summer albedo and the highest mean summer LST whilst the ice masses on northern Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg Islands, in the northwest sector of the QEI, had both the highest mean summer albedo and the lowest mean summer LST. Expanding on these preliminary results, the spatial and temporal trends in LST and albedo over ice caps in the QEI will be presented and the relationship between these two variables will be investigated.",

            "abstract": "Microbial mats are thought to have originated around 3.7 billion years ago, most likely in the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents, which supplied a source of energy in the form of reduced chemical species from the Earth’s interior. Active hydrothermal vents are also believed to exist on Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's moon Enceladus, and on Mars, earlier in that planet’s history. Microbial mats have been an important force in the maintenance of Earth’s ecosystems and the first photosynthesis was also originated there.\nMicrobial mats are believed to exhibit most, if not all, biogeochemical processes that exist in aquatic ecosystems, due to the presence of different physiological groups of microorganisms therein. While most microbially mediated biogeochemical transformations have been shown to occur within microbial mats, the nitrogen cycle in the microbial mats has received very little study in spite of the fact that nitrogen usually limits growth in marine environments.\nWe will present the first results in the determination of a complete nitrogen budget for a photosynthetic microbial mat. Both in situ sources and sinks of nitrogen in photosynthetic microbial mats are being measured using stable isotope techniques. Our work has a particular focus on recently described, but poorly understood, processes, e.g., anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction, and an emphasis on understanding the role that nitrogen cycling may play in generating biogenic nitrogen isotopic signatures and biomarker molecules.\nMeasurements of environmental controls on nitrogen cycling should offer insight into the nature of co-evolution of these microbial communities and their planets of origin. Identifying the spatial (microscale) as well as temporal (diel and seasonal) distribution of nitrogen transformations, e.g., rates of nitrification and denitrification, within mats, particularly with respect to the distribution of photosynthetically-produced oxygen, is anticipated.\nThe results of this research, the first results of which will be presented here, will help us to improve our understanding of the cycle of the element most responsible for limiting the production of biomass on Earth and improved an ability to use stable isotopes of nitrogen, and nitrogen containing compounds, in our search for life elsewhere.",

Communicating changes in earthquake probability is likely be very difficult, however, as the absolute probability of a damaging event is likely to remain quite small despite a significant increase in the relative value.

            "abstract": "Regional scale ecosystem modeling requires high-resolution data of surface climate variables. Spatial variability in temperature and precipitation has been well studied over the past two decades resulting in several sophisticated algorithms. However, compared to temperature and precipitation, other surface climate variables, such as humidity, solar radiation and wind speed, are not available to use, even though those data are equally important for ecosystem modeling. The main reason for this is the lack of governing physical equations for interpolating observations and the lack of comparable satellite observations. Therefore, scientists have been using reanalysis data or simply interpolated data for ecosystem modeling, though they are too coarse for regional scale ecosystem analysis.\nIn this study, we developed a method to spatially map daily climate variables, including humidity, solar radiation, wind, precipitation, and temperature. We applied the method to the conterminous USA from 1980 to 2015. Previously, we successfully developed a precipitation interpolation method using random forest algorithm, and now we extended it to the other variables. Because this method does not require any assumptions about physical equations, this method can potentially be applicable to any climate variable if measured data are available. The method requires point data along with a host of spatial data sets . Satellite data, reanalysis data, and radar data were used and the importance of each dataset was analyzed using random forest algorithm. The only parameter we need to adjust is the radius from the target point, in which statistically meaningful relationships between observed and spatial co-variate data is calculated. The radius was optimized using mean absolute error and bias. We also analyzed temporal consistency and spatial patterns of the results. Because it is relatively easy to customize the setup depending on user’s request, the resulting datasets may be useful for ecosystem modeling, validation of regional climate models, and regional climate analysis.",

The performance of atmosphere-surface exchange parameterizations in CTMs depends on parameterization uncertainty (in terms of both accuracy and precision) and feasibility of implementation. We provide a comparison of the performance of three available parameterizations of net atmosphere-surface exchange. To evaluate parameterization accuracy, we compare predicted exchange fluxes to field measurements conducted over a variety of surfaces compiled in a recently developed global database of terrestrial Hg0 surface-atmosphere exchange flux measurements. To assess precision, we estimate the sensitivity of predicted fluxes to the imprecision in parameter input values, and compare this sensitivity to that derived from analysis of the global Hg0 flux database. Feasibility of implementation is evaluated according to the availability of input parameters, computational requirements, and the adequacy of uncertainty representation. Based on this assessment, we provide suggestions for improved treatment of Hg0 net exchange processes in CTMs.",

            "abstract": "Magnetospheric and astrophysical plasmas are rarely in the state of thermal equilibrium. Plasma distribution functions may contain beams, supra-thermal tails, multiple ion and electron populations which are not thermalized over long time scales due to the lack of collisions between particles. In particular, the equatorial region of the dayside Earth’s magnetosphere is often populated by plasma containing hot and cold ion components of comparable densities [Andre and Cully, 2012], and such ion distribution alters properties of the magnetic reconnection regions at the magnetopause [Toledo‐Redondo et. al., 2015].\nMotivated by these recent findings and also by fact that this region is one of the targets of the recently launched MMS mission, we performed 2D PIC simulations of magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma with hot and cold ion components. We used a standard Harris current sheet, to which a uniform cold ion background is added.\nWe found that introduction of the cold component modifies the structure of reconnection diffusion region. Diffusion region displays three-scale structure, with the cold Ion Diffusion Region (cIDR) scale appearing in-between the Electron Diffusion Region (EDR) and Ion Diffusion Region (IDR) scales. Structure and strength of the Hall magnetic field depends weakly on cold ion temperature or density, and is rather controlled by the conditions (B, n) upstream the reconnection region.\nThe cold ions are accelerated predominantly transverse to the magnetic field by the Hall electric fields inside the IDR, leading to a large ion pressure anisotropy, which is unstable to ion Weibel-type or mirror-type mode. On the opposite, acceleration of cold ions is mostly field-aligned at the reconnection jet fronts downstream the X-line, producing intense ion phase-space holes there. Despite comparable reconnection rates produced , we find that the overall evolution of reconnection in presence of cold ion population is more dynamic compared to the case with a single hot ion component.",

            "abstract": "Rainwater harvesting, the small-scale collection and storage of runoff for irrigated agriculture, is recognized as a sustainable strategy for ensuring food security, especially in monsoonal landscapes in the developing world. In south India, these strategies have been used for millennia to mitigate problems of water scarcity. However, in the past 100 years many traditional rainwater harvesting systems have fallen into disrepair due to increasing dependence on groundwater. With elevated declines in groundwater resources, there is increased effort at the state and national levels to revive older systems. Critical to the success of such efforts is an improved understanding of how these ancient water-provisioning systems function in contemporary landscapes with extensive groundwater pumping and shifted climatic regimes. Knowledge is especially lacking regarding the water-exchange dynamics of these rainwater harvesting “tanks” at tank and catchment scales, and how these exchanges regulate tank performance and catchment water balances. Here, we use fine-scale water level variations to quantify daily fluxes of groundwater, evapotranspiration, and sluice outflows in four tanks over the 2013 northeast monsoon season in a tank cascade that covers a catchment area of 28.2 km2. Our results indicate a distinct spatial pattern in groundwater-exchange dynamics, with the frequency and magnitude of groundwater inflow events (as opposed to outflow) increasing down the cascade of tanks. The presence of tanks in the landscape dramatically alters the catchment water balance, with catchment-scale runoff:rainfall ratios decreasing from 0.29 without tanks to 0.04 – 0.09 with tanks. Recharge:rainfall ratios increase in the presence of tanks, from ~0.17 in catchments without tanks to ~ 0.26 in catchments with tanks. Finally, our results demonstrate how more efficient management of sluice outflows can lead to the tanks meeting a higher fraction of crop water requirements.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric gravity waves are often generated in the lower atmosphere and can, under favorable atmospheric conditions, propagate into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. As a consequence of this vertical propagation, the waves carry momentum fluxes and energy from the lower atmosphere into the near-space environment, providing a strong coupling across atmospheric layers. While these waves have been observed and studied in details for decades, there are still many questions to be addressed regarding the tropospheric source location and nature of individually observed waves in the mesosphere.\nIn an effort to increase undergraduate student research experiences, we are linking atmospheric gravity wave research and undergraduate curriculum to improve both academic and scholarly experiences by our students. In this particular case, we present a research project addressing the identification of tropospheric source locations of mesospheric waves observed by airglow imagers. The project involves observations, theory, and modeling techniques with a strong emphasis on how each part plays a role in the curriculum. Specifically, a simple ray tracing model is propagating observed waves downwards through the atmosphere until the point of origin is reached. In the process, we apply basic calculus, numerical methods, and simple fluid dynamics related to course taught at the undergraduate level.",

            "abstract": "Models of core and mantle evolution with a basal magma ocean suggest that vigorous convection in the outer core may have begun in the Proterozoic, but that inner core crystallization did not drive the geodynamo until ~0.5 Ga. Published paleointensity data suggest that Earth’s magnetic field may have been relatively weak during the Proterozoic due to geodynamo activity generated by superadiabatic cooling of the fluid core. The Laramie Anorthosite Complex (LAC; Wyoming, USA) crystallized at 1.43 Ga, during the hypothesized Proterozoic weak-field interval. The LAC consists of several genetically related plutons, including (from oldest to youngest) the Poe Mountain and Snow Creek Anorthosites, and the Sybille Monzosyenite. Anorthositic, leucogabbroic, and monzosyenitic rocks from these units formed under a range of fO2 and contain different magnetic carriers, but likely retain a thermoremanent magnetization from at or close to their crystallization age.\nInitial IZZI Thellier experiments were conducted on oriented cores from 22 sites. Additional paleointensity analyses utilized smaller chips, selected for high Königsberger ratios to minimize the influence of larger discrete magnetic grains. Over 60% of these high Q specimens yielded reliable results, using strict criteria (FRAC > 0.80; beta < 0.1) in the ThellierGUI program. Ten site mean paleofield estimates from the Poe Mountain Anorthosite range from 40 to 70 μT (7.8 - 13.7 x 1022 Am2) while the Snow Creek Anorthosite has lower values (~20 μT). These values have been corrected for remanence anisotropy, which is significant for core samples (median τ1/τ3 = 1.46) and extreme for some chips (τ1 values exceeding 0.95) from the Snow Creek Anorthosite. A proposed slow cooling rate of the LAC would cause our paleointensity values to overestimate the ancient field by as much as 50%. Nonetheless, the range of intensity values recorded in the LAC is similar to that in the Phanerozoic and does not appear compatible with the proposed weak Proterozoic field.",

GeoFieldBook and StratLogger allow for the real-time display of spatial (structural) and temporal (stratigraphic) field data as well as very easy in-field navigation.\nField techniques and methods for data acquisition and mapping in the field have dramatically advanced and simplified how we collect and analyze data while in the field. The Apps are not geologic mapping programs, but rather a way of bypassing the analog field book step to acquire digital data directly that can then be used in various analysis programs (GIS, Google Earth, Stereonet, spreadsheet and drawing programs). We now complete all of our fieldwork digitally.\nGeoFieldBook can be used to collect structural and other field observations. Each record includes location/date/time information, orientation measurements, formation names, text observations and photos taken with the tablet camera. Records are customizable, so users can add fields of their own choosing. Data are displayed on an image base in real time with oriented structural symbols. The image base is also used for in-field navigation.\nIn StratLogger, the user records bed thickness, lithofacies, biofacies, and contact data in preset and modifiable fields. Each bed/unit record may also be photographed and geo-referenced. As each record is collected, a column diagram of the stratigraphic sequence is built in real time, complete with lithology color, lithology texture, and fossil symbols. The recorded data from any measured stratigraphic sequence can be exported as both the live-drawn column image and as a .csv formatted file for use in spreadsheet or other applications.\nCommon to both Apps is the ability to export the data (via .csv files), photographs and maps or stratigraphic columns (images). Since the data are digital they are easily imported into various processing programs (for example for stereoplot analysis). Requiring that all maps, stratigraphic columns and cross-sections be produced digitally continues our integration on the use of digital technologies throughout the curriculum.\nInitial evaluation suggests that students using the Apps more quickly progress towards synthesis and interpretation of the data as well as a deeper understanding of complex 4D field relationships.",

Historical written records documented that coasts of Beppu Bay, eastern Kyushu, Japan was devastated by a tsunami associated with the AD 1596 Keicho-Bungo earthquake (M7.0). It is considered that the earthquake occurred at submarine active faults in the bay. The aim of this study is to unravel the occurrence age and source of tsunamis that struck the coast of the bay in prehistorical ages. This study may also make a contribution to the understanding of tsunami-generating system at submarine active faults.\nWe conducted a coring survey at paddy fields along the north coast of the bay. The 10 cm thick muddy sand layer with a few granules (hereinafter, sand layer), bounded by sharp contacts, was evident in the 1.7 m long sediment core taken at 700 m from the shoreline. Plant materials obtained from mud above the sand layer was dated to 1880–2000 cal. yr BP. Sharp contacts between sand and surrounding muds imply that the sand layer is formed by a sudden event. Existence of mud clast in the sand layer indicates erosion of surface mud. There were no brackish–marine diatoms in surrounding mud, but they accounted for 5–6% of the total within the sand layer, indicating that the sand grains were sourced at least in part from brackish–marine environment. Mean grain size/sorting of the sand layer and beach sand were 2.31/0.94 and 2.03/0.41 phi. The difference in sorting probably suggests that the sand layer partly contains the onshore sediments eroded in inundation process. Additional coring surveys would clarify the distribution of prehistorical tsunami deposits and source of past tsunamis.",

With limited field data constraining the glacier’s current bed elevation and basal slip rate, modeling efforts of present and future glacier dynamics have been limited. Here we present the first 1D Shallow Shelf Approximation finite difference flowline model of the Taku glacier. We run the model with field data collected annually by the Juneau Icefield Research Program, including mass balance derived from shallow ice-penetrating radar and snow pits and bed elevation from active seismics. We vary bed elevation and bed slipperiness parameters in order to fit the modeled glacier surface to the GPS-derived observed surface elevation profile and velocities. In lieu of more extensive seismic surveying on Taku, the best-fitting bed elevation profile product presented here will be useful for future predictive modeling efforts of Taku flow dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The 2002 Mw7.9 Denali earthquake ruptured over 350 km with coseismic slip of up to ~10 m. Stress-driven relaxation of the upper mantle and afterslip of the fault cause postseismic crustal deformation that has been recorded at GPS stations. We analyze the time series of seven continuous and more than 150 campaign-mode GPS stations. We calculate the cumulative postseismic displacements in every three-year time window since 2003. The obtained postseismic displacements in a similar direction as the coseismic motions are up to ~15 cm in 2003 – 2006 and decrease with time to less than 5 cm in 2012 – 2015. The significant postseismic deformation provides a unique opportunity to better constrain the viscosity structure in the continental upper mantle in central Alaska and to test the contribution of afterslip following the earthquake. We have developed three-dimensional viscoelastic finite element models of the Denali earthquake to study these problems. The model includes an elastic lithosphere and a viscoelastic upper mantle. We assume that the upper mantle is characterized by a bi-viscous Burgers rheology. For simplicity, we assume that the transient Kelvin viscosity is one order of magnitude lower than that of the steady-state Maxwell viscosity. The stress-driven, time-dependent afterslip of the fault is modeled by a 2-km thick weak shear zone. Locked portions of the fault, that is, where no afterslip is allowed, are assumed to be outlined by the 5-m coseismic contours. Our preliminary model indicates that areas within ~100 km to the fault are controlled mainly by the afterslip, and the far-field is controlled mainly by the viscoelastic relaxation of the upper mantle. The modeled afterslip is up to more than 1 m in the first three years after the earthquake. The stead-state viscosity of the upper mantle between the Denali fault and the trench is determined to be on the order of 8 × 1018 Pa s. The viscosity of the upper mantle north of the fault has to be at least one order of magnitude higher in order to better fit the observed displacements in this area. A test model that includes the subduction Pacific slab and oceanic upper mantle produces negligible change in the surface deformation. A test model with the depth-variation in rock properties produces approximately the same results as that of the preferred two-layered model.",

            "abstract": "Detect plant responses to environmental changes across tropical systems, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, is an important question in the global agenda, since few studies have addressed trends related to global warming. Traditional on-the-ground direct, manned phenological observations preclude large areas of study, are laborious and time consuming and restricts frequency of observations to large time-intervals (usually monthly). Near-surface remote phenology using digital cameras or phenocams set up at the top of towers have reduced the temporal and labor constraints of on-the-ground human observations, and eliminates the uncertainty of cloud cover, enhancing the resolution of information at individual tree, species, and community scales. Phenocams have reduced considerably manpower, since images are taken sequentially at reduced time-scales. Furthermore, Phenocams have proven to be an important tool for monitoring several species and ecosystems, accurately accessing leaf changes daily or several times a day and the relation to climate drivers but it is still area-limited. Here we propose to apply new technologies to enhance the capabilities near-surface remote phenological observations by integrating at time and space to detect changes on vegetation phenology at various scales, from leaves to ecosystems. Our studies have been carried out in the rupestrian grassland (campos rupestres) a rare, unique Brazilian mountain ecosystem, distinguished by a highly species rich, heterogeneous herbaceous/shrub vegetation and high number of endemic species. We discuss how the combination of cutting-edge technologies collected and framed within a e-science research project has been used to increase our observational capabilities in space by integrating phenology to cutting-edge technologies of environmental and phenology monitoring systems, based on the combination of two near-surface remote phenology monitoring systems: digital and hyperspectral sensors at three scales: direct manned on-the-ground, phenology tower, and remote piloted aerial vehicle (RPAV), increasing our accuracy in time and space to define the relationship between phenology and climate.",

            "abstract": "Since its successful launch in early 2009, the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) has been making global measurement of reflected light spectra from which column-averaged CO2 concentrations (XCO2) are retrieved. The XCO2 values, retrieved under clear-sky conditions, have been utilized together with the surface-based GLOBALVIEW-CO2 (GV) data in the inference of monthly CO2 fluxes on sub-continental and ocean-basin scales (42 terrestrial and 22 oceanic regions). The results of the flux inference calculation have been made public as the GOSAT Level 4 data product by the National Institute for Environmental Studies GOSAT Project. We herein present the overview of the GOSAT Level 4 inversion approach and the characteristics of multi-year time series of the obtained regional-scale CO2 flux estimates.\nThe GOSAT-GV combined inversion estimates for many of the land regions were found to exhibit larger seasonal-cycle amplitudes compared to those of the GV-only estimates. The annual global-total terrestrial uptakes inferred by the GOSAT-GV inversion turned out to be smaller than those by the GV-only inversion, but the opposite trends were found in terrestrial uptakes for some latitudinal-bands, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere.\nTouched also in this report is the evaluation of balancing GOSAT data amount that vary with time and locations over the globe. The data amount balancing was considered necessary since successful GOSAT retrievals are obtained mostly over sunny periods and areas and thus their number distributions over the globe can be uneven. In our current inversion approach, individual GOSAT XCO2 retrievals are gridded to 5°×5° cells and averaged on a monthly basis (GV data are also monthly averaged). Inversion results based on “single-shot” concentration data were obtained for comparisons. We will discuss the differences observed and their implications for better satellite-based flux estimation.",

            "abstract": "The identification of compositionally distinct lava flows is essential to determining the stratigraphy, number of lavas, and hence timing and frequency of eruptions in flood basalt provinces. Here, we address this issue using paired geochemical and paleomagnetic sampling of lavas comprising the Sentinel Bluffs Member (SB), the youngest member of the Grande Ronde Basalt (GRB). We develop the SB stratigraphy using geochemical characterizations of lavas based on ratios and mass-normalized abundances of immobile elements, together with an integrated stratigraphy of sections containing continuous exposures of multiple SB flows. Mass normalization is part of a mass analysis methodology that enables precise determinations of magmatic immobile element abundances of lavas variably enriched by alteration-generated mass loss (see Sawlan, M.G., 2013, Alteration, mass conservation, and magmatic compositions of lavas of the Columbia River flood basalt province: Insights from the Sentinel Bluffs Member, Grande Ronde Basalt: AGU Fall Meeting, V13F-2689). Within the SB chemical stratigraphy five chemical series, each of which includes three or four more precisely defined chemical groups, are recognized. Paleomagnetic directions, averaged by chemical series, show distinct differences between lavas of Series I (I=64.8°, D=351.2°, N=9, α95=3.8°), Series II-IV (I=56.5°, D=4.8°, N=29, α95=1.7°), and Series V (I=71.4°, D=326.0°, N=9, α95=4.6°). These differences in paleomagnetic directions of chemical series indicate SB eruptions occurred in pulsed eruptive episodes during which multiple, closely related, and geochemically distinct magmas erupted. Directions for Series II-IV lavas, near the geomagnetic dipole direction, are indistinguishable from one another (Series II: I=53.4°, D=2.0°, N=5, α95=4.4°; Series III: I=55.7°, D=5.6°, N=15, α95=1.8°; Series IV: I=59.6°, D=5.2°, N=9, α95=4.1°) and indicate that these lavas erupted either closely spaced in time or within a more extended period with little paleosecular variation. Overall, this approach of mass analysis geochemistry-based stratigraphy, paired with paleomagnetic directions, forms the foundation for quantitative identification of individual flood basalt eruptions.",

Continuous power and connectivity permit large volumes of data to be collected and made available to scientists and citizens alike over the Internet through a web-based interface. The Oceans 2.0 data management system contains over one quarter petabyte of data, including more than 20,000 hours of video from fixed seafloor cameras and a further 8,000 hours of video collected by remotely operated vehicles.\nCabled observatory instrument deployments enable the collection of high-frequency, long-duration time series of data from a specific location. This enables the study of important questions such as whether effects of climate change—for instance, variations in temperature or sea-level—are seen over the long term. However, cabled observatory monitoring also presents challenges to scientific researchers: the overwhelming volume of data and the fixed spatial location can be barriers to addressing some big questions.\nHere we describe how Ocean Networks Canada is using Citizen Science to address these limitations and supplement cabled observatory research. Two applications are presented:\nDigital Fishers is a crowd-sourcing application in which participants watch short deep-sea video clips and make annotations based on scientific research questions. To date, 3,000 participants have contributed 140,000 scientific observations on topics including sablefish abundance, hydrothermal vent geology and deep-sea feeding behaviour.\nCommunity Fishers is a program in which ordinary citizens aboard vessels of opportunity collect ocean data including water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll. The program’s focus is to directly address the typical quality concerns around data that are collected using a citizen science approach. This is done by providing high quality scientific instruments and basic (but imperative) training to the citizens and vessel operators who participate. The data are downloaded using a specially designed tablet app, and then transmitted to Oceans 2.0 where raw and corrected data and metadata are made available through the web in real-time.",

            "abstract": "Flare ribbons are emission structures that are frequently observed during flares in transition-region and chromospheric radiation. These typically straddle a polarity inversion line (PIL) of the radial magnetic field at the photosphere, and move apart as the flare progresses. The ribbon flux - the amount of unsigned photospheric magnetic flux swept out by flare ribbons - is thought to be related to the amount coronal magnetic reconnection, and hence provides a key diagnostic tool for understanding the physical processes at work in flares and CMEs. Previous measurements of the magnetic flux swept out by flare ribbons required time-consuming co-alignment between magnetograph and intensity data from different instruments, explaining why those studies only analyzed, at most, a few events. The launch of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), both aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), presented a rare opportunity to compile a much larger sample of flare-ribbon events than could readily be assembled before. We created a dataset of 141 events of both flare ribbon positions and fluxes, as a function of time, for all C9.-class and greater flares within 45 degrees of disk center observed by SDO from January 2013 till April 2015. For this purpose, we used vector magnetograms (2D magnetic field maps) from HMI and UV images from AIA. A critical problem with using unprocessed AIA data is the existence of spurious intensities in AIA data associated with strong flare emission, most notably \"blooming\" (spurious smearing of saturated signal into neighboring pixels, often in streaks). To overcome this difficulty, we have developed an algorithmic procedure that effectively excludes artifacts like blooming. We present our database and compare statistical properties of flare ribbons, e.g. evolutions of ribbon reconnection fluxes and reconnection flux rates, with the properties from theoretical models.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution borehole temperature monitoring can provide valuable insight into the hydrogeologic structure of fault zones and transient processes that affect fault zone stability. Here we report on results from a subseafloor temperature observatory within the Japan Trench plate boundary fault. In our efforts to interpret this unusual dataset, we have developed several new methods for probing hydrogeologic properties and processes.\nWe illustrate how spatial variations in the thermal recovery of the borehole after drilling and other spectral characteristics provide a measure of the subsurface permeability architecture. More permeable zones allow for greater infiltration of cool drilling fluids, are more greatly thermally disturbed, and take longer to recover. The results from the JFAST (Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project) observatory are consistent with geophysical logs, core data, and other hydrologic observations and suggest a permeable damage zone consisting of steeply dipping faults and fractures overlays a low-permeability clay-rich plate boundary fault.\nUsing high-resolution time series data, we have also developed methods to map out when and where fluid advection occurs in the subsurface over time. In the JFAST data, these techniques reveal dozens of transient earthquake-driven fluid pulses that are spatially correlated and consistently located around inferred permeable areas of the fault damage zone. These observations are suspected to reflect transient fluid flow driven by pore pressure changes in response to dynamic and/or static stresses associated with nearby earthquakes. This newly recognized hydrologic phenomenon has implications for understanding subduction zone heat and chemical transport as well as the redistribution of pore fluid pressure which influences fault stability and can trigger other earthquakes.",

The research literature has extensive assessments of future impacts on environment, cities, agriculture, human health, infrastructure, social and political changes, and the risks of military conflict. Society is facing massive infrastructure redevelopment, protection and possible abandonment due to increasing weather extremes. We have reached the point where science consensus is obvious and the population over much of the developed and developing world understands the urgency - humanity is changing the climate. The challenge is helping people help themselves. People understand there are consequences - they want to know how to minimize those consequences, and how to adapt to minimize the impacts. There is a dire need for a senior level course that addresses the key issues across disciplines. This course should cover a range of topics across many disciplinary boundaries, including: an introduction to the science, politics, health and well-being challenges of climate change; likely changes to personal and community lifestyles; consumption of energy and other resources. Population migration due to climate change impacts is a critical topic. Most important, the course must address the solutions to climate change. The population is demanding the power to address this massive challenge. This course will provide a multimedia curriculum on the impacts and solutions to our climate change dilemma.",

The effects of the free-surface on the stability of the moment tensor method becomes important as we continue to investigate and improve the capabilities of regional full moment tensor inversion for source-type identification and discrimination. It is important to understand these free surface effects on discriminating shallow explosive sources for nuclear monitoring purposes. It may also be important in natural systems that have shallow seismicity such as volcanoes and geothermal systems. In this study, we apply the moment tensor based discrimination method to the HUMMING ALBATROSS quarry blasts. These shallow chemical explosions at approximately 10 m depth and recorded up to several kilometers distance represent rather severe source-station geometry in terms of vanishing traction issues. We show that the method is capable of recovering a predominantly explosive source mechanism, and the combined waveform and first motion method enables the unique discrimination of these events. Recovering the correct yield using seismic moment estimates from moment tensor inversion remains challenging but we can begin to put error bounds on our moment estimates using the NSS technique.",

            "abstract": "Visible and shortwave-infrared (VSWIR) reflectance spectroscopy has been used for large-scale mineral mapping on Earth and on Mars. A prototype instrument (UCIS—Ultra Compact Imaging Spectrometer), operating in microscopic mode, applies the same principles over an area the size of a traditional thin section (15-50 cm2), acquiring data over the 0.5-2.5 μm range at a spatial scale of 80 μm/pixel. This technique requires little to no sample preparation and is non-destructive, preserving rock texture. It can be used on future rovers/landers for in-situ petrology and in the lab to link spectral data acquired at large scale with rock mineralogy. We compare microscale mineral maps and abundance results from linear spectral unmixing to other techniques, including XRD, acid dissolution, and EDS/WDS mapping. Samples from the Semail Ophiolite (Oman) are used as an analogue for Martian carbonate and serpentine deposits to assess the capabilities of IR spectroscopy to discriminate carbonate from minerals with absorptions at similar wavelength positions, to determine carbonate composition and the composition of intermixed phases, and to determine their relative abundances. We find that UCIS infrared images can differentiate between carbonate phases not distinguished in XRD results. For example, in a magnesite vein sample, the bulk magnesite is spectrally distinct from another carbonate phase present only in cavities within the sample. Microprobe and EDS analyses of the sample confirm that calcite is present only as a coating within secondary porosity. Similar to SEM-EDS mapping at smaller scales, UCIS can identify rare phases contained within a few pixels (100s µm). For example, aluminum-bearing phyllosilicates in discrete clasts were found among more typical serpentine in a carbonate-cemented breccia. Signals from such rare phases are typically not detectable in XRD but are in spatially resolved microscale IR data. Collectively, data indicate that VSWIR microspectroscopy is an effective, novel way to study carbonate-bearing and other rocks accurately and rapidly and is a means of understanding the accuracy of remote sensing-derived mineralogies.",

            "abstract": "Ammonia oxidation, the rate-limiting first step of nitrification, is an important link between reduced (ammonia) and oxidized (nitrate) nitrogen, and controls the relative distribution of these forms of inorganic nitrogen. This process is catalyzed via the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme of both ammonia-oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) and Archaea (AOA); the α subunit of this enzyme is encoded by the amoA gene and has been used as the molecular marker to detect this process. In the ocean, AOA are typically 10-1000 times more and are likely more active than AOB, and thus are key players in the marine nitrogen cycle. Monterey Bay is a dynamic site to study nitrification, as seasonal upwelling brings deep water and nutrients into surface waters, which can promote phytoplankton blooms and impact biogeochemical processes such as the nitrogen cycle. We have sampled two sites within Monterey Bay bimonthly for two years as part of the ongoing Monterey Bay Time Series (MBTS) to quantify AOA genes, transcripts, and nitrification rates. Two ecotypes of AOA are routinely found in Monterey Bay – the ‘shallow’ water column A (WCA) and ‘deep’ water column B (WCB) clades, which are thought to have distinct physiological properties and can be distinguished based on the amoA gene sequence. Previous work has shown a strong relationship between nitrification rates in Monterey Bay with the abundance of WCA amoA genes and transcripts. Additionally, we found a correlation between the relative abundance of Marine Group I (MGI) Thaumarchaeota 16S rRNA reads (as % of total) and the absolute abundance of AOA amoA genes (determined via qPCR) in Monterey Bay and the California Current System. AOA 16S rRNA gene abundances in turn correlated significantly with changes in nitrification rate with depth, while the relative abundance of genes and transcripts binned to a single AOA (Nitrosopumilus maritimus) was not significantly correlated to nitrification rate. Further analysis of the sequenced AOA metagenomes and metatranscriptomes will allow us to determine whether nitrification rates correspond to a particular group of AOA, and the inclusion of the MBTS dataset will provide a seasonal framework to allow for predictions of how AOA abundance and activity will be impacted by a changing environment.",

            "abstract": "The creation and use of large amounts of data in scientific investigations has become common practice. Data collection and analysis for large scientific computing efforts are not only increasing in volume as well as number, the methods and analysis procedures are evolving toward greater complexity (Bell, 2009, Clarke, 2009, Maimon, 2010). In addition, the growth of diverse data-intensive scientific computing efforts (Soni, 2011, Turner, 2014, Wu, 2008) has demonstrated the value of supporting scientific data integration. Efforts to bridge this gap between the above perspectives have been attempted, in varying degrees, with modular scientific computing analysis regimes implemented with a modest amount of success (Perez, 2009). This constellation of effects – 1) an increasing growth in the volume and amount of data, 2) a growing data-intensive science base that has challenging needs, and 3) disparate data organization and integration efforts – has created a critical gap. Namely, systems of scientific data organization and management typically do not effectively enable integrated data collaboration or data-intensive science-based communications. Our research efforts attempt to address this gap by developing a modular technology framework for data science integration efforts – with climate variation as the focus. The intention is that this model, if successful, could be generalized to other application areas.\nOur research aim focused on the design and implementation of a modular, deployable technology architecture for data integration. Developed using aspects of R, interactive python, SciDB, THREDDS, Javascript, and varied data mining and machine learning techniques, the Modular Data Response Framework (MDRF) was implemented to explore case scenarios for bio-climatic variation as they relate to pacific northwest ecosystem regions. Our preliminary results, using historical NETCDF climate data for calibration purposes across the inland pacific northwest region (Abatzoglou, Brown, 2011), show clear ecosystems shifting over a ten-year period (2001-2011), based on multiple supervised classifier methods for bioclimatic indicators.",

            "abstract": "After the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in 1992 established a mandate for the UN to establish a set of indicators of sustainable development, the indicators to gauge sustainability have been widely used. In the water sector, the concept of sustainable water use has been used in many different ways. In this study, we aimed to develop sustainability indicators and indices for sustainable water use in South Korea. We identified major indicators for sustainable water use with considering multiple aspects of water use: not only physical, biological and chemical aspects but also social and environmental aspects. Furthermore, stressors for sustainable water use were of major interests because they were straightforward and easy to measure in comparison to indicators representing the state- and impact-related indictors. As a result, sets of indicators were identified with a theme-based hierarchical approach, including 1) human water requirements, 2) renewability of water resources, 3) water quality requirements, 4) health of aquatic ecosystems and 5) equitable water use. Then for each sub-component, multiple indicators, i.e., proxy variables were identified. We have evaluated our indicators and indices for drainage basins as well as grid boxes with multiple sizes of 0.5 km and 0.25 km in South Korea. Indicator data were collected for concurrent time, 2010 per se, with number of datasets from earlier or later times and integrated. At last, we evaluated sustainability index with focusing on the spatial variability of index and indicators and the sensitivity of index to individual indicators. Also the sensitivities of indices to different spatial scales were examined.",

            "abstract": "The Sierra San Pedro Mártir (SSPM), MX defines a prominent section of the Main Gulf Escarpment that marks the breakaway fault of the Gulf of California rift. The SSPM is an uplifted rift shoulder that has the highest topography and relief in Baja California, with local elevations exceeding 3,000 m and range relief (summit to baselevel) ranging from ~500 to 2,500 m. Prior studies report Eocene apatite fission track ages from the base of the escarpment and indicate low total exhumation, thus limiting the use of low-temperature thermochronology to constrain the timing and pattern of Neogene faulting of this important structure. However, topography is expected to record tectonic, climatic, and rock strength controls on long-term denudation rates in active margins, and morphometric analysis offers an alternative approach, particularly when combined with cosmogenic 10Be-derived, catchment-averaged denudation rates. Denudation rates and topographic metrics in the SSPM record along-strike gradients in rock uplift that increase asymmetrically from fault tips to a maximum within the northern half of the range. Surface uplift of an Eocene paleo-erosion surface and slope-break knickpoints found at increasingly higher elevations in northern segments of the SSPM fault system suggest that range asymmetry is due to a recent northward acceleration in rock uplift rate. By characterizing the relationship between channel steepness and 10Be-derived denudation rates, we extrapolate millennial-scale denudation rates to million-year time-scales to estimate ages for the transient increase in rock uplift rates as well as the initial onset of faulting. From this, we predict that the SSPM fault system initiated during the Middle Miocene (~16-14 Ma) in the center of the range and ~11-8 Ma ago near the fault tips. These age estimates are consistent with independent, regional geologic constraints and show that careful pairing of cosmogenic denudation rates with topographic analysis can be used to extract million-year scale tectonic signals from the topography. Applying this same approach to knickpoint locations shows an increase in rock uplift rate during the Late Pliocene (~3-2 Ma), perhaps in response to either a local transfer of strain from hanging wall detachments to the east or a regional increase in extension.",

            "abstract": "Nearly 40% of California is rangeland comprising the largest land type in California and providing forage for livestock, primarily beef cattle. In addition to forage, rangelands provide a host of ecosystem systems services, including habitat for common and endangered species, fire fuels management, pollination services, clean water, viewsheds, and carbon sequestration. Published research has documented that most of these ecosystem services are positively impacted by managed livestock grazing and rancher stewardship. Ranchers typically do not receive any monetary reimbursement for their stewardship in providing these ecosystem services to the public. Markets have been difficult to establish with limited ability to adequately monitor and measure services provided. At the same time, rangelands have been experiencing rapid conversion to urbanization and more profitable and intensive forms of agriculture such as almond and walnut orchards.\nTo prevent further conversion of rangelands and the loss of the services they provide, there needs to be a mechanism to identify and compensate landowners for the value of all products and services being received from rangelands. This paper considers two methods (opportunity cost and avoided cost) to determine the value of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) for rangelands. PES can raise the value of rangelands, making them more competitive financially.\nReal estate values and University of California Cooperative Extension Cost Studies, were used to demonstrate the difference in value (lost opportunity cost) between the primary products of rangelands (livestock production) and the products of the converted rangelands (almond and walnut orchards). Avoided costs for vegetation management and habitat creation and maintenance were used to establish the value of managed grazing. If conversion is to be slowed or stopped and managed grazing promoted to protect the ecosystem services rangelands provide, this value could be compensated through PES",

            "abstract": "With the opening of the Landsat archive, researchers have a vast new data source teeming with imagery and potential. Beyond Landsat, data from other sensors is newly available as well: these include ALOS/PALSAR, Sentinel-1 and -2, MERIS, and many more. Google Earth Engine, developed to organize and provide analysis tools for these immense data sets, is an ideal platform for researchers trying to sift through huge image stacks. It offers nearly unlimited processing power and storage with a straightforward programming interface. Yet labeling forest change through time remains challenging given the current state of the art for interpreting remote sensing image sequences. Moreover, combining data from very different image platforms remains quite difficult. To address these challenges, we developed the BULC algorithm (Bayesian Updating of Land Cover), designed for the continuous updating of land-cover classifications through time in large data sets. The algorithm ingests data from any of the wide variety of earth-resources sensors; it maintains a running estimate of land-cover probabilities and the most probable class at all time points along a sequence of events.\nHere we compare BULC results from two study sites that witnessed considerable forest change in the last 40 years: the Pacific Northwest of the United States and the Mato Grosso region of Brazil. In Brazil, we incorporated rough classifications from more than 100 images of varying quality, mixing imagery from more than 10 different sensors. In the Pacific Northwest, we used BULC to identify forest changes due to logging and urbanization from 1973 to the present. Both regions had classification sequences that were better than many of the component days, effectively ignoring clouds and other unwanted signal while fusing the information contained on several platforms. As we leave remote sensing’s data-poor era and enter a period with multiple looks at Earth’s surface from multiple sensors over a short period of time, this algorithm may help to sift through images of varying quality in Google Earth Engine to extract the most useful information for mapping.",

            "abstract": "<span\" roman\"=\"Roman\"\" new=\"New\">Rock fracture is traditionally viewed as a brittle process involving damage nucleation and growth in a zone ahead of a larger fracture, resulting in fracture propagation once a threshold loading stress is exceeded. It is now increasingly recognized that coupled chemical-mechanical processes influence fracture growth in wide range of subsurface conditions that include igneous, metamorphic, and geothermal systems, and diagenetically reactive sedimentary systems with possible applications to hydrocarbon extraction and CO2 sequestration. Fracture processes aided or driven by chemical change can affect the onset of fracture, fracture shape and branching characteristics, and fracture network geometry, thus influencing mechanical strength and flow properties of rock systems.\nWe are investigating two fundamental modes of chemical-mechanical interactions associated with fracture growth: 1. Fracture propagation may be aided by chemical dissolution or hydration reactions at the fracture tip allowing fracture propagation under subcritical stress loading conditions. We are evaluating effects of environmental conditions on critical (fracture toughness KIc) and subcritical (subcritical index) fracture properties using double torsion fracture mechanics tests on shale and sandstone. Depending on rock composition, the presence of reactive aqueous fluids can increase or decrease KIc and/or subcritical index. 2. Fracture may be concurrent with distributed dissolution-precipitation reactions in the hostrock beyond the immediate vicinity of the fracture tip. Reconstructing the fracture opening history recorded in crack-seal fracture cement of deeply buried sandstone we find that fracture length growth and fracture opening can be decoupled, with a phase of initial length growth followed by a phase of dominant fracture opening. This suggests that mechanical crack-tip failure processes, possibly aided by chemical crack-tip weakening, and distributed solution-precipitation creep in the hostrock can independently affect fracture opening displacement and thus fracture aperture profiles and aperture distribution.",

            "abstract": "The partitioning of total evapotranspiration between contributions from surface evaporation and plant transpiration offers acute insight into the hydrological and biogeochemical behaviors of an ecosystem, but is notoriously difficult to establish directly. Furthermore, evapotranspiration partitioning relies heavily on knowledge of the relative pathways by which water moves from the soil column to the atmosphere. These pathways are parameterized by ecosystem resistances, which may not be known with great certainty in practical situations. By leveraging the unique signatures of evaporation and transpiration on the ratios of stable water isotopes, additional constraint on the evapotranspiration partitioning may be obtained. We present evapotranspiration partitioning results for a site in central Colorado, USA, for which sufficient meteorological, hydrological and water isotopic measurements are available to run and validate an isotopically-enabled land surface model. Field observational data are coupled with a Markov chain Monte Carlo parameter calibration framework to constrain the ecosystem resistances and provide model realizations which accurately match observations. Experiments are conducted to determine the degree to which uncertainty in the evapotranspiration partitioning may be reduced by incorporating stable water isotopic information, a Bayesian model calibration approach, or both. We find that stable water isotopic information offers unique insight into ecosystem flux partitioning, and accurate partitioning relies on accurate modeling of the isotopic kinetic fractionation factor, and therefore proper accounting for the ecosystem resistances.",

During our weeklong campaign, we detected more than 50 isolated and strongly enhanced methane plumes, ranging from coal mine venting shafts and gas processing facilities through individual well-pads, pipeline leaks and outcrop. Results could be immediately shared with ground-based teams and TOPDOWN aircraft so that ground-validation and identification was feasible for a number of sources.

            "abstract": "Displacement monitoring using Terrestrial Radar Interferometry (TRI) over an urban environment was conducted to monitor for potential movement of buildings, roadways, and urban infrastructure in Seattle, Washington for a 6 week deployment in March and April of 2015. A Gamma Portable Radar Interferometer was deployed on a the lower roof of the Smith Tower at an elevation of about 100 m, overlooking the historical district of Pioneer Square. Radar monitoring in this context provides wide area coverage, sub millimeter precision, near real time alarming, and reflectorless measurement. Image georectification was established using a previously collected airborne lidar scan which was used to map the radar image onto a 3D 1st return elevation model of downtown Seattle. Platform stability concerns were monitored using high rate GPS and a 3-axis accelerometer to monitor for building movement or platform instability. Displacements were imaged at 2 minute intervals and stacked into 2 hour averages to aid in noise characterization. Changes in coherence are characterized based on diurnal fluctuations of temperature, cultural noise, and target continuity. These informed atmospheric and image selection filters for optimizing interferogram generation and displacement measurement quality control. An urban monitoring workflow was established using point target interferometric analysis to create a monitoring set of approximately 100,000 stable monitoring points measured at 2 minute to 3 hour intervals over the 6 week deployment. Radar displacement measurements were verified using ongoing survey and GPS monitoring program and with corner reflector tests to verify look angle corrections to settlement motion. Insights from this monitoring program can be used to design TRI monitoring programs for underground tunneling, urban subsidence, and earthquake damage assessment applications.",

            "abstract": "The active Eurasia-Nubia plate boundary runs across the Alboran Sea in the Western Mediterranean Sea. Earthquakes of magnitude Mw >6, fluid escape and thick accumulations are potential triggers of submarine landslides along the Alboran contouritic margins. Over the last decade, international collaboration between Spanish, French and Moroccan marine geologists working has allowed a large amount of high-resolution multibeam and multi- and single channel seismic data to be collected from the Alboran Sea. Multibeam and echosounder data collected during the SARAS Eurofleet cruise reveal the distribution of slope failures along the northern flank of the Xauen-Tofiño bank along the Moroccan margin and the southern flank of the Alboran ridge. Those highs are active folds located on both sides of the Trans Alboran Shear Zone (TASZ). Here we provide a detailed mapping and description of the morphology of the Xauen-Tofiño landslides, including volumetric estimates of the failed mass and the related mass transport deposits over the last 2 myr. The most voluminous Holocene landslide mobilized ~0.5 km3 of sediment at the initial stage of slope failure, and formed a ~2.2-2.4 km3 mass transport deposit. Twenty-eight and thirty-eight Mass Transport Deposits (MTD) were described from the Xauen and Tofiño banks, respectively. Boreholes analysis of ODP sites 976 and 979 allowed the calibration of some of the reflectors and relative ages of the pulses of tectonic activity and MTD’s events. Active uplift pulses are observed at 1.19, 0.79 and 0.46 Ma for the Alboran ridge, and at 1.19 and 0.79 Ma for the Xauen-Tofiño Bank. We compute different parameters for each MTD’s from the literature, including the volume of sediments involved and the porosity, thanks to physical laws. For few MTD’s, we also map associated slump scars and compute parameters such as the run-off and the volume of sediments, deduced from the scar with a simple geometric reconstitution of the paleo-topography. The nature and volume of the MTD depends on the preexisting slope and contouritic accumulations. As the topography controls the localization of contouritic currents in the area, we therefore propose that the tectonic activity influences the growth of contouritic structures and may be a triggering factor to rework contouritic deposits as MTD.",

            "abstract": "The use of stable isotopes of water (O18 and D) to determine the pathway of water through a hilslope, and source water for vegetation generally assumes that isotopic composition is conserved through the shallow evaporative front. Frequent sampling through the entire critical zone at Rivendell, a 32° hillslope in a mixed conifer forest, reveals a structured heterogeneity in the isotopic composition of subsurface water. We demonstrate that the moisture held in the soil, saprolite, and weathered bedrock is isotopically light relative to both the average meteoric water, and to the mobile water in the shallow subsurface and saturated zone. Weathered argillite, the dominant rock type, retains moisture that is isotopically more negative than neighboring sandstone. These differences in isotopic composition are persistent, suggesting subsurface fractionation and/or filtration processes. Different species of vegetation collocated on the same hillslope use different subsurface reservoirs. Throughout the year, Douglas-fir xylem water occupies a region of dual isotope space that differs from hardwoods (madrone, live oak, and tanoak) Whereas Douglas-firs use non-evaporatively enriched, deep bulk soil moisture, and unsaturated zone rock moisture throughout year, hardwoods switch their source water from shallow mobile water, to bulk soil moisture, to unsaturated zone rock moisture depending on subsurface water availability. Furthermore, Douglas-fir roots transport water that is more negative than collocated madrone roots. At no time do trees use groundwater. Collectively, these discoveries suggest that a deep and frequent sampling campaign is required to capture the structured heterogeneity in the critical zone, as well as the species-specific and seasonal variability of vegetative water use.",

Our radial coverage around Fuego during the 2012 campaign satisfies conditions outlined by Dawson et al. [2011] for good network coverage. Very-long-period (VLP) events that accompany small-scale explosions were classified by waveform and eruption style. We located these VLP event families which have been persistent at Fuego since at least 2008 through inversion in the same manner employed by Lyons and Waite [2011] with improved radial coverage in our network. We compare results for source inversions performed with independent tilt data against inversions incorporating tilt data extracted from the broadband.\nThe current best-practice method for choosing an optimum solution for inversion results is based on each solution’s residual error, the relevance of free parameters used in the model, and the physical significance of the source mechanism. Error analysis was performed through a boot strapping in order to explore the source location uncertainty and significance of components of the moment tensor. The significance of the number of free parameters has mostly been evaluated by calculating Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), but little has been done to evaluate the sensitivity of AIC or other criteria (i.e. Bayesian Information Criterion) to the number of model parameters. We compare solutions as chosen by these alternate methods with more standard techniques for our real data set as well through the use of synthetic data and make recommendations as to best practices.\nFigure 1: a) Map of 2012 station network: stations highlighted in red were collocated with infrasound arrays. b) Location of Fuego within Guatemala and view of the complex from the west with different eruptive centers labeled. c) Operational times for each of the stations and cameras.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a flurry of research on how atmospheric river events (ARs) will respond to anthropogenic global warming. This study uses 10 CMIP5 RCP 8.5 climate models to focus on changes in AR frequency, seasonality, and synoptic conditions along the west coast of the United States and is a follow-up to previous work by the same authors (Warner et al. 2015) which investigated expected changes in AR intensity in the same region. There are only very slight changes in annual AR climatology from the end of the last century to the end of this century when considering the most extreme integrated water vapor transport (IVT) events (99th percentile). However, when evaluating by the number of future days exceeding a historical threshold, there are significant increases in extreme IVT events in all months, especially during months when the majority of events take place. The peaks in historical and future frequency occur in similar months given the amount of model variability. Extreme IVT events appear to be occurring slightly earlier in the season, particularly along the northern US coast, and these results are similar to other studies. Spatially, 10-model mean historical composites of IVT reveal canonical AR conditions. At locations farther south, there is less model agreement on the spatial extent and intensity of AR events; whereas farther north, the various models are in agreement. Composites of future events indicate very little spatial change from historical events. The location and orientation of AR events in the historical and future time periods are similar, and the upper-level winds change little over that time period (Warner et al. 2015). This suggests little change in synoptic conditions for approaching ARs. The future-historical difference plots highlight the largest changes expected in the future, namely increases in IVT intensity which are primarily associated with thermodynamic changes related to future integrated water vapor increases due to a warming atmosphere.",

However using these δ13C values to interpret finer-scale ecosystem properties, including climate attributes such as CO2 concentrations, is difficult owing to uncertainty in the magnitude of internal biosynthetic fractionations that determine the δ13C of waxes relative to that of bulk leaf material. We investigated the composition, abundance and δ13C of n-alkanes in the aboveground biomass of a C4 grass and a C3 grass exposed to experimentally controlled CO2 at ambient [490ppm] and elevated [630ppm] levels within natural grassland in Wyoming. The δ13C values of bulk tissues were predictably different based on the C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways, but the difference between bulk tissue and n-alkanes (εlipid), for both C29 and C31, was consistently greater in the C4 grass. The magnitudes of these εlipid values were large (- 7‰ to -15‰) relative to those found in most other studies. CO2 concentration of the growing environment also had a significant effect on n-alkane δ13C values, with consistently higher values of ~ 2‰ under elevated CO2 found in both species and in both a wet and a dry year. These results underscore the importance of recognizing potential abiotic effects on leaf wax δ13C values, in addition to the biotic drivers their variation, when interpreting climate from leaf-wax biomarkers of terrestrial ecosystems.",

This fundamental tenet has been emphasized for centuries, and has been receiving increased attention in recent years. The Office of Management and Budget (2002) addressed reproducibility and other aspects of quality and utility of information from federal agencies. Specific guidelines from NASA (2002) are derived from the above. According to these guidelines, “NASA requires a higher standard of quality for information that is considered influential. Influential scientific, financial, or statistical information is defined as NASA information that, when disseminated, will have or does have clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions.” For information to be compliant, “the information must be transparent and reproducible to the greatest possible extent.” \nWe present how the principles of transparency and reproducibility have been applied to NASA data supporting the Third National Climate Assessment (NCA3). The depth of trace needed of provenance of data used to derive conclusions in NCA3 depends on how the data were used (e.g., qualitatively or quantitatively). Given that the information is diligently maintained in the agency archives, it is possible to trace from a figure in the publication through the datasets, specific files, algorithm versions, instruments used for data collection, and satellites, as well as the individuals and organizations involved in each step. Such trace back permits transparency and reproducibility.",

While semi-analytic models exist and hydrocode simulations of cratering are well studied, there is very little literature on the blast waves from asteroids hitting the Earth. The blast waves depend strongly on the energy deposition rate, which in turn depends on the break-up mechanics of the asteroid either during atmospheric entry or on the ground.\nThis presentation will examine the effect of different rock models on the break-up and energy deposition. The simplest models can assign a single rock strength, chosen to match the burst altitude of previously observed airbursts. Such simple models can provide energy deposition curves that match observations reasonably well, but are not representative of the behaviour of real rock masses. We will compare the failure mechanisms and energy deposition of more sophisticated models including effects such as more realistic yield surfaces that account for tensile, shear, and compressive failure strengths, and size dependent features such as cracks, strength distributions, porosity, and variations in internal composition.",

ARB has also developed a robust and multi-tiered in-house research effort to investigate methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gas emission sources. This presentation will provide an overview of ARB’s monitoring and measurement research efforts to study the regional and local emission sources of these pollutants in California.\nARB initiated the first subnational GHG Research Monitoring Network in 2010 to study the regional GHG emissions throughout the state. The network operates several high precision analyzers to study CH4, N2O, CO and CO2 emissions at strategically selected regional sites throughout California, and the resulting data are used to study the statewide emission trends and evaluate regional sources using statistical analyses and inverse modeling efforts. ARB is also collaborating with leading scientists to study important emission sources including agriculture, waste, and oil and gas sectors, and to identify \"hot spot\" methane sources through aerial surveys of high methane emitters in California. At the source level, ARB deploys Mobile Measurement Platforms (MMP) and flux chambers to measure local and source specific emissions, and uses the information to understand source characteristics and inform emissions inventories. Collectively, all these efforts are offering a comprehensive view of regional and local emission sources, and are expected to help in developing effective mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions in California.",

This program, based on local observations and global connections improves data-rich teaching and learning via visualization tools, interactive plotting interfaces and lesson plans for teachers that focus on student inquiry and exploration. For example, students use all aspects of STEM by accessing, selecting, and interpreting data in multiple dimensions, from their local community observatories to the larger VENUS and NEPTUNE networks. The students make local observations and global connections in all STEM areas.\nThe first year of the program with teachers and students who use this innovative technology is described. Future community observatories and their technological applications in education, communication and STEM efforts are also described.",

We present data collected from a high-resolution, ground-based magnetic survey over Anomaly B, the largest of these anomalies, that reveal details about a buried crater and its associated lava flow, not previously observed in the aeromagnetic surveys. These details provide insight into the nature of the eruption and the volume of this buried volcano. Results from non-linear inversion demarcate a crater with a diameter of approximately 700 m and a base approximately 150 m below the ground surface. Coupled with well log data, the inversion results suggest a total volume for the Anomaly B crater area and associated lava flows of approximately 1.0 ± 0.4 km3, based on an estimated lava flow field area of 24 km2 and a lava thickness of 42 ± 15 m.

            "abstract": "Observations of iron chemistry and mineralogy over time provide a valuable tool for studying paleoenvironments, but questions still remain as to the redox character of Proterozoic basins after the rise of oxygen. To evaluate the mechanisms of iron mineralization in Proterozoic samples, we developed an approach that pairs the microscale textural techniques of light microscopy, magnetic scanning microscopy, and (synchrotron-based) microprobe x-ray spectroscopy with sensitive bulk rock magnetic experiments. Samples were collected from stratigraphic sections across the ~1.4 Ga lower Belt Group, Belt Supergroup, MT and ID, USA with a focus on excellently preserved sedimentary rocks, but also including those altered by a variety of diagenetic, metamorphic, and metasomatic events. Results show that even in the best-preserved parts of the Belt Basin, late diagenetic and/or metasomatic fluids affected (in some cases very mildly) the primary iron phases as evidenced by prevalent post‑depositional alterations such as rare base metal sulfides. In more heavily altered rocks, the appearance of pyrrhotite and other minerals signaled transformations in iron mineralogy through metamorphism and metasomatism. Despite these secondary phases crystallizing in an open fluid-rich system, primary records of redox chemistry were preserved in the recrystallized early diagenetic framboidal pyrite and (sub)micron-sized detrital magnetite grains. Detrital magnetite is not the most abundant iron-bearing phase in any of the samples (typically <0.01 wt%), but is widely observed in both proximal and deeper basin facies, illustrating an important detrital flux of iron to the basin and a highly reactive iron source for early diagenetic pyrite. Based on our analyses, we interpret the shallow waters of the Belt Basin to be oxic with sulfidic pore fluids and deeper waters in parts of the basin as likely euxinic, consistent with the results of some bulk geochemical proxies. This redox reconstruction also helps explain the exceptional fossil record and diversity of eukaryotes observed in Belt Basin paleoenvironments.",

The use of objective methods are essential to reduce the time of data analysis. An indication of synoptic systems development in surface is the presence of trough in the middle level (500 hPa). That atmospheric pattern denotes strong indication of instability and changes in the weather. Many of algorithms tracking of meteorological systems are two-dimensional. For example, the tracking of cyclones are based on identification of minimum center of sea level pressure or center of cyclonic vorticity close to the surface. The goal of this work is the creation of the algorithm that identifies and tracks the trough and ridge at middle levels (500 hPa), which can be used for three-dimensional identification/tracking of the cyclone on surface. The algorithm consists in identifying the area where the trough/ridge is contained, besides to provide information of the location of the axis of the trough/ridge and its slope, amplitude and intensity. So, allowing associate the features of the trough/ridge with the features of the systems at the surface.",

The total energy added to the earth system along with the fate of that energy is analyzed. The energy added to the system is derived from the radiative forcing and is separated into individual forcing terms. The fate of the energy is controlled by the size of the climate feedback to the applied forcing. The relationship between the forcing, feedback, and the stored energy varies greatly across CMIP5 models. The model relationships are compared to observations during the recent time period since 1950 (including the hiatus period). This provides a stringent test of model fidelity against observation, although in some models it is hampered by the inability to adequately remove model drifts. It is found that while the multi-model means of the terms in the earth's energy budgets are in reasonable agreement with observations there are substantial range across individual models.",

            "abstract": "Large, high-intensity wildfire risk in the western United States is growing, fueled by increasing vegetation density from a century of fire suppression and climatic shifts resulting in extended dry seasons. Strategically Placed Landscape Treatments (SPLATs) are a fuel reduction method designed to reduce fire risk on the entire landscape by treating only a fraction of the area. During 2011 and 2012, SPLATs were implemented in the mixed-conifer zone of the Tahoe (Last Chance study area, American River Basin) and Sierra (Sugar Pine study area, Merced River Basin) National Forests. Wildfire events were then simulated for both treated and untreated conditions. We integrated the vegetation changes with the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys) to project impacts of fuel treatments and wildfire on runoff and evapotranspiration for the period of observed data, water years 2010-2013. Results from the model simulations show that vegetation treatments in the Last Chance study area, which removed 8.0% of the total biomass by treating 25% of the area, increased mean annual runoff by 12.0% and decreased mean annual evapotranspiration by 4.1%. Vegetation treatments in the Sugar Pine study area, which removed 7.5% of the total biomass by treating 33% of the area, increased runoff by 2.7% and decreased ET by 0.5%. Compared to pre-treatment conditions, wildfire simulations in Last Chance reduced total biomass by 38-50% when fuel treatments were not applied, resulting in a 55-67% runoff increase and a 19-23% evapotranspiration decrease. In Sugar Pine, fire simulation reduced biomass 39-43%, increasing runoff and decreasing ET by 13-15% and 1.8-2.7% respectively. Applying the same magnitude of biomass reductions equally over the entire watershed, in contrast to the localized areas of vegetation reductions due to treatment or fire, resulted in smaller impacts on runoff and evapotranspiration rates. Vegetation effects on hydrologic fluxes are greater in Last Chance than in Sugar Pine, and can be attributed to the higher precipitation rates, suggesting vegetation in the Sugar Pine area is more water-limited. These model results also indicate that strategic fuel treatments implemented to reduce the risk of high-intensity fire have a potential benefit of producing additional water yield.",

Beyond the amount of the canopy area, however, little is known what kind of spatial patterns and structures of urban forests best contributes to reducing temperatures and mitigating the urban heat effects. Previous studies attempted to find the relationship between the land surface temperature and various indicators of vegetation abundance using remote sensed data but the majority of those studies relied on two dimensional area based metrics, such as tree canopy cover, impervious surface area, and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index, etc. This study investigates the relationship between the three-dimensional spatial structure of urban forests and urban surface temperature focusing on vertical variance. We use a Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor image (acquired on July 24, 2014) to estimate the land surface temperature of the City of Sacramento, CA. We extract the height and volume of urban features (both vegetation and non-vegetation) using airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and high spatial resolution aerial imagery. Using regression analysis, we apply empirical approach to find the relationship between the land surface temperature and different sets of variables, which describe spatial patterns and structures of various urban features including trees. Our analysis demonstrates that incorporating vertical variance parameters improve the accuracy of the model. The results of the study suggest urban tree planting is an effective and viable solution to mitigate urban heat by increasing the variance of urban surface as well as evaporative cooling effect.",

            "abstract": "Geospeedometry, the quantification of timescales from diffusional relaxation of compositional zoning in minerals, is usually implemented using quartz, feldspar, and olivine. Clinopyroxene (cpx), commonly found in both igneous and metamorphic rocks as well as in meteorites, could also be a powerful tool for diffusion-related applications, once the appropriate suite of magmaphile elements with different diffusivities is identified—especially where the initial condition cannot be assumed to be a step function. Here we develop the use of cpx as a geospeedometer in rhyolitic magma by investigating slow diffusing elements via SIMS and NanoSIMS analyses using Yellowstone Plateau rhyolite lavas as a test case. LA-ICPMS analyses identified slow diffusing elements with resolvable abundances in the Yellowstone cpx; Ce and Dy were the best candidates, because experimental studies demonstrate they diffuse 12–88 times slower at a given temperature than elements such as Fe-Mg, which are typically used for diffusion dating in pyroxene. SIMS profiles with ≤ 8 micron resolution across intracrystalline zone boundaries reveal Ce and Dy abundances of ~175 ppm and ~78 ppm respectively, but also motivate analyses with higher spatial resolution in order to quantify concentration gradients for diffusion modeling. Subsequent NanoSIMS profiles at 0.2–1 micron spacing across intracrystalline zone boundaries capture Ce and Dy gradients that can be used to provide rejuventation-eruption timescales from the Yellowstone cpx. SIMS analyses employing energy filtering vs. those collected at full transimission both replicate the cpx Ce and Dy zoning and indicate there are not significant mass interferences for Ce and Dy, confirming that the NanoSIMS results replicate true intracrystalline variation. In addition, NanoSIMS Si, Mg, Fe, Ce, and Dy distribution maps of individual exsolution lamellae from the cpx cores provide information about the cooling history of the cpx.",

Connecticut has more than $542 billion in insured assets in harms way, only Florida has a greater exposure. As part of the state of Connecticut Phase 1 application for the HUD National Disaster Resilience Competition, the Connecticut Institute for Resilience and Climate Adaptation (CIRCA) at the University of Connecticut undertook an assessment of coastal vulnerabilities, including the impacts of sea level rise on the frequency of flooding, socioeconomic factors, critical infrastructure, and housing using data collected from federal, state, and municipal sources. Connecticut’s unique geology, characterized by a glaciated coastline with highly erodible former deltas and elevated ridgelines extending out to rocky headlands, became the basis of the climate adaptation approach. Together with a nine state agency workgroup, municipal and regional government, and non-profit and industry representatives, CIRCA and the Yale UED lab developed a long-term urban redevelopment solution of resilient access and egress corridors layered over ridgelines and resilient zones of transit oriented economic development linked to shoreline communities. This concept can be applied in both Connecticut’s coastal cities like New Haven and its smaller towns. The process demonstrated the effective partnership between the universities and state agencies in bringing the science of flood modeling and mapping together with innovative design to create solutions for climate adaptation. However, it also revealed significant gaps in data availability to analyze the economic and social drivers for adopting different adaptation strategies. Furthermore, the accuracy of current flood mapping tools needs to be improved to predict future flooding at the municipal project scale. As Connecticut and other states move forward with resilience planning, continued investment in physical and social sciences at the local level will be necessary to effectively implement those plans.",

            "abstract": "In recent decades, near and far field proxies of continental ice production indicate the presence of continental ice on Antarctica. Short Antarctic glaciations blinked in and out of existence throughout the middle and late Eocene, culminating in the formation of a continental ice sheet during the Eocene Oligocene Transition (EOT; ~34 Ma). Moreover, the onset of the Antarctic glaciation coincides with pCO2 declining below a critical threshold for the accumulation of a continental ice sheet. New evidence suggesting bipolar glaciation (that is, northern and southern hemisphere) occurred through this period with ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. However, the pCO2 threshold for the accumulation of ice on Greenland is not reached until the late Oligocene.\nPreliminary hafnium-neodymium (Hf-Nd) isotope results of oxyhydroxide leachates from IODP Site U1411 on the Newfoundland Ridge points to increased weathering intensity coinciding with the EOT, marked by less radiogenic Hf isotope compositions. One interpretation of this data is that glaciation of the northern hemisphere (e.g. Greenland) coincides with that of Antarctica during the EOT. Hf-Nd isotopic composition of sediment on the Newfoundland ridge indicates a shift from incongruous chemical weathering to a more congruous mechanical weathering regime (i.e. glaciers). However, it could be suggested that the observed congruous Hf-Nd isotopic signal originates in the southern ocean and has been propagated north from the Antarctic.\nWe are using sediment core from the equatorial Pacific to determine if a signal of glacial weathering could be transmitted though deep waters from Antarctica. The core, IODP Site 1333, is in the equatorial Pacific positioned far from either pole thus, a shift towards a less radiogenic Hf isotopic compositions is not to be expected. The absence of a shift in Hf isotopes in the oxydroxide leachates, or a shift of lesser magnitude, will strengthen the possibility of northern hemisphere glaciation.",

Denial seems to be everywhere, from the heights of official political power to the depths of anonymous trolls piling on the abuse in the “comment” sections of websites.\n What can scientists do, in public discussions, in the classroom, to change the balance of forces?\n One possibility is to point to the statements of powerful institutional actors that (a) have taken strong positions about the reality and seriousness of the climate threat, and (b) are not usually thought of as potential participants in environmental action. These include: the American military; the CIA and other elements of the national security apparatus; insurance and re-insurance firms (the largest “industry” in the world); and many of the great religions of the world, such as the Roman Catholic Church, “mainline” Protestant churches, the Greek Orthodox Church, and others.\n In this presentation I review key statements from all of these “unexpected allies,” paying special attention particularly to statement from the great religions, and discuss how teaching about these in science classes can help students begin to think about how they can turn their scientific understanding into successful political engagements.",

            "abstract": "Our ability to assess seismic hazard depends in large part on our understanding of the composition and structure of the crust, of which only the upper third can be directly sampled. For the middle and lower crust we must rely on our ability to interpret geophysical observations, including seismic anisotropy, to better understand composition and structure. Current methods of measuring crustal anisotropy use the assumption of transverse isotropic symmetry. While complicated, the symmetry of elastic properties of crustal materials has the potential to be used to help differentiate between materials of different composition. We present results of calculations of elastic tensors based on electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements of mineral crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO) in crustal rocks from a number of locations, including new results from the Appalachian Mountains. Elastic tensors can be deconvolved into their main symmetry components to illustrate the importance of low-order symmetry in constraining rock type and composition. Initial results indicate that all crustal rock types with at least 5% anisotropy have a significant component of transverse isotropic (TI) symmetry, but many also have a significant component of orthorhombic symmetry. TI and orthorhombic components appear to be related to amounts of mica and amphibole, respectively. Because seismic methods assume TI symmetry, misfit in seismic inversion may in fact be a useful indicator of composition.",

            "abstract": "Global flows of reactive nitrogen (N) have increased significantly over the last century in response to land-use change, agricultural intensification and elevated levels of atmospheric N. Although the use of commercial N fertilizers began to plateau in developed countries in the mid-1980s and despite widespread implementation of a range of conservation measures to mitigate the impacts of N-intensive agriculture, N concentrations in surface waters are in many cases remaining steady or continuing to increase. This lack of correlation between N inputs and outputs is increasingly being attributed to the presence of legacy N stores in subsurface reservoirs, with present-day concentrations being a function of inputs that are many decades old. It has remained unclear, however, what the magnitudes of such stores might be, and how they are partitioned between soil and groundwater reservoirs.\nIn the present work, we have synthesized agricultural, population, and land-use data to develop a comprehensive, 150-year dataset of N inputs to the land surface of the continental United States. We have concurrently developed a parsimonious, process-based model that utilizes this N input trajectory to simulate biogeochemical transformations of N along subsurface pathways. Model results allow us predict the magnitudes of legacy N in soil and groundwater pools and to predict long-term stream N concentration trajectories over the last century and into the future. We have applied this modeling approach to two U.S. watersheds, the Mississippi River and Susquehanna River Basins, which are major sources of nutrient contamination to the Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay, respectively. Our results show significant stream N loading above baseline levels in both watersheds before the widespread use of commercial N fertilizers, largely due to 19th-century conversion of natural forest and grassland areas to row-crop agriculture. However, the temporal patterns of this loading differ between the two watersheds due to differences in trajectories of land-use change. Using the model, we estimate spatiotemporal patterns of N accumulation in both groundwater and soil organic matter in response to increases in N inputs to agricultural soil and explore future scenarios to predict changes in N-loading as a function of these N legacies.",

            "abstract": "The physical dynamics of the inner continental shelf determine the exchange of heat, nutrients, and other tracers between the nearshore environment and deeper ocean. At locations where the coastline and bathymetry are not uniform, there is likely to be significant exchange associated with with complex three-dimensional flow structures. Resolving such features in observations remains a challenge, particularly below the surface where satellites and high-frequency radar do not measure. To obtain high-resolution measurements of subsurface alongshore temperature variability during a field study on inner-shelf exchange, a fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system was deployed at the Martha’s Vineyard Coastal Observatory off the southern coast of New England. The DTS system emits a laser down a fiber-optic cable and measures the intensity of Raman backscatter at different frequencies, which provides an estimate of the surrounding ocean temperature at 1-m intervals along the cable. In this study, a 5-km fiber-optic cable was deployed along the seafloor at the 17-m isobath for a duration of over three months. The fine-scale measurements of temperature along the cable reveal sharp fronts that propagate along the bottom and are associated with rapid near-bottom cooling. When these features are present, which is only when the water column is stratified, their appearance is linked with the tidal cycle. The direction of propagation, calculated at a location where the cable turns inshore, has a significant alongshore component and suggests that the propagating fronts originate at a tidal mixing front where strong tidal currents flow over a shallow shoal. The fronts decay as they travel, indicating that they influence the alongshore thermal structure of the water column. These DTS observations provide a new perspective on the complex three-dimensional circulation associated with the combination of strong tides, stratification and shallow bathymetry.",

            "abstract": "Serpentinization, the reaction at moderate pressure and temperature of water with olivine and pyroxene that are common in basalts and ultramafic rocks, results in the formation of alkaline fluids and the precipitation of a variety of secondary minerals. Terrestrial localities where active serpentinization is occurring are ideal Mars analogs for examining the characteristics of an environment that possesses two of the key features that we assume necessary to host life: water and an internally generated energy source.\nThis study focuses on a related but different feature present where active serpentinization is occurring – namely, carbonate cements forming under plain air in the vicinity of Adobe Springs, CA. This site is located in the Del Puerto ophiolite about 150 km ESE of San Francisco, in the Coast Range of California. Two alkaline spring water compositions have been described at the site, a Ca-OH water (which is not currently being emitted by the active springs), and a Mg-CO3 water. Abundant dolomitic and calcitic carbonate cements are found in the creek drainages near the springs, associated with a diverse microbial community. We conducted a systematic study of the carbonate cements using SEM, EMP, XRD, TEM, and SIMS, focusing on sub-mm variations in texture, mineral chemistry and stable isotope (COH) composition. We compared our measurements with thermodynamic modeling results constrained by chemical analysis of water chemistry from the site and known partition coefficients and stable isotope fractionation factors. The wide range of carbonate compositions and textures observed at the Adobe Springs site suggests that more than one process is involved in their precipitation, including the possibility of microbially mediated dolomite mineralization. These carbonate cements could be a mineralogic biomarker of serpentinization and microbiological processes on Mars and other rocky planets and, therefore, prime targets for future astrobiological investigations.",

            "abstract": "The two dominant modes of boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) that influence onset and retreat of the Asian summer monsoon system and strongly modulate extreme rainfall events over Asia have been identified. One is the canonical northward propagating mode (BSISO1) with quasi-oscillating periods of 30-60 days and strong variance throughout the May to October period often in conjunction with the eastward Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The other is the northwestward propagating mode (BSISO2) with periods of 10-30 days during primarily the pre-monsoon and monsoon-onset season. This study investigates how the two modes are different from each other dynamically and thermodynamically. The BSISO1 circulation cells are more Rossby wave like with a northwest to southeast slope, whereas the circulation associated with the BSISO2 is more elongated and front-like with a southwest to northeast slope. The associated rainfall anomalies over the Indian monsoon and Western North Pacific region are out-of-phase in the BSISO1 but rather in-phase in the BSISO2. For both modes, moisture convergence plays more important role in development and propagation of BSISO than moisture advection but with different energetics. In the BSISO1, convective instability characterized by the low-level warm advection of moisture-laden air and upper-level cold advection of dry air is dominant but the baroclinic instability with warm-air rising and cold-air sinking tends to control the BSISO2. Phase-latitude composite analysis over the western North Pacific-East Asian region further indicates differences in intensification and propagation mechanism between the two modes.",

Data are streamed, collected autonomously, or transmitted via satellite from a variety of instruments. The Software Engineering group at ONC develops and maintains Oceans 2.0, an in-house software system that acquires and archives data from sensors, and makes data available to scientists, the public, government and non-government agencies. The Oceans 2.0 workflow tool was developed by ONC to manage a large volume of tasks and processes required for instrument installation, recovery and maintenance activities. Since 2013, the workflow tool has supported 70 expeditions and grown to include 30 different workflow processes for the increasing complexity of infrastructures at ONC. The workflow tool strives to keep pace with an increasing heterogeneity of sensors, connections and environments by supporting versioning of existing workflows, and allowing the creation of new processes and tasks. Despite challenges in training and gaining mutual support from multidisciplinary teams, the workflow tool has become invaluable in project management in an innovative setting. It provides a collective place to contribute to ONC’s diverse projects and expeditions and encourages more repeatable processes, while promoting interactions between the multidisciplinary teams who manage various aspects of instrument development and the data they produce. The workflow tool inspires documentation of terminologies and procedures, and effectively links to other tools at ONC such as JIRA, Alfresco and Wiki. Motivated by growing sensor schemes, modes of collecting data, archiving, and data distribution at ONC, the workflow tool ensures that infrastructure is managed completely from instrument purchase to data distribution. It integrates all areas of expertise and helps fulfill ONC’s mandate to offer quality data to users.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster_Jessica.pdf\nThe recent California drought presents an opportunity to study CO2 flux changes over time due to insufficient water uptake by plant life using remote sensing data. Three flux towers were used to create linear regressions between AVIRIS derived Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE = PRI * NDVI * PAR) and tower measured CO2 flux in the San Joaquin Experimental Range. To estimate CO2 from NEE, two linear regressions were used based on time of day and season, with R2 values of 0.85 and 0.87 respectively. Per-pixel CO2 flux was estimated for AVIRIS flights flown in June 2013, 2014, and 2015, as well as September 2011 and October 2014. There was a significant decrease in post drought photosynthetic CO2 uptake over the 6,700 km2 studied, totaling 2,977 grams per minute less (15.9% decrease) from June 2013 to June 2014. Data from the 2015 HyspIRI flights suggest a continuation of this trend for June 2015. Pre-drought conditions over a 33 km2 area show that the photosynthetic CO2 uptake dropped from 74 mg per minute on September 24, 2011, to 35 mg per minute on October 6, 2014 (a 53% decrease). HyspIRI flight lines also include 434 km2 of the Rim Fire, an area that saw a decrease in CO2 uptake of 413 grams per minute (71.7% decrease from June 2013 to June 2014) from the burn alone. It is estimated that the entire Rim Fire (1,041 km2) has caused a total decrease in photosynthetic CO2 uptake totaling 988 grams less per minute from 2013 to 2014, with some recovery evident in 2015.",

            "abstract": "Independent co-variation of speleothem δ18O values and other moisture-sensitive speleothem proxies (e.g., growth rate, trace element concentrations) in recently published Holocene stalagmite records from Texas and New Mexico suggest a decoupling between precipitation amounts and precipitation sources over the southwest US. There is, however, limited understanding of the relation between precipitation sources and precipitation amounts and the climate processes governing variability in the region’s precipitation sources. To address this, we use source water tags to track precipitation derived from Pacific and Atlantic Oceans during a simulation of modern (1975-2013) climate. We find distinct patterns in the spatial distribution of the fraction of Pacific-derived winter precipitation are associated with unique atmospheric states. High pressure ridging reflected by 500 hPa geopotential heights result in weaker zonal winds and stronger northerly winds over the western US. Under these conditions, Pacific-derived moisture propagates further to the east, and Atlantic-derived moisture is suppressed over southern US. Conversely, 500 hPa geopotential heights that are latitudinally streamline result in strong zonal winds across the entire US. Under these conditions, the fraction of West Pacific-derived precipitation is limited to higher latitudes, and the fraction of far East Pacific- and Atlantic-derived precipitation is enhanced across the Southwest and Southern US, respectively. Further analysis of this data set will assess the teleconnections that link the distinct atmospheric conditions over the US with the state of the ocean and atmosphere over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The results will be applied to reconstructing variability in the climate dynamics governing moisture transport to the southwest US during the mid to late Holocene as reflected by speleothem δ18O records in the region.",

The Brazilian Experimental Solar Telescope is designed to obtain full disk magnetic field and line-of-sight velocity observations in the photosphere. Here we discuss the system requirements and the first design review of the instrument. The instrument is composed by a Ritchey-Chrétien telescope with a 500 mm aperture and 4000 mm focal length. LCD polarization modulators will be employed for the polarization analysis and a tuning Fabry-Perot filter for the wavelength scanning near the Fe II 630.25 nm line. Two large field-of-view, high-resolution 5.5 megapixel sCMOS cameras will be employed as sensors. Additionally, we describe the project management and system engineering approaches employed in this project. As the magnetic field anchored at the solar surface produces most of the structures and energetic events in the upper solar atmosphere and significantly influences the heliosphere, the development of this instrument plays an important role in advancing scientific knowledge in this field. In particular, the Brazilian's Space Weather program will benefit most from the development of this technology. We expect that this project will be the starting point to establish a strong research program on Solar Physics in Brazil. Our main aim is to progressively acquire the know-how to build state-of-art solar vector magnetograph and visible-light imagers for space-based platforms.",

            "abstract": "Predicted by geophysical modeling, the mineraolgic record of early Mars groundwater has only recently been discovered. First, rover exploration in sedimentary basins reveals diagenesis. At Meridiani, sandstone porosity is occluded by precipitation of secondary sulfates, hematite, and silica. Multiple alteration episodes are indicated by crystal vugs, disruption of preexisting textures by hematite concretions, and grain coatings (e.g. McLennan et al., 2005). At Gale crater, raised ridges in mudstones, interpreted to be early diagenetic features, are crossed by later-emplaced hydrated calcium sulfate veins (e.g. Grotzinger et al., 2014). Waters in Gale were likely circumneutral while jarosite mineralogy at Meridiani implies acidic waters. Second, systems of raised ridges at 100-m scale are observed from orbit in multiple Martian sedimentary rock units. An outstanding example is sulfate-bearing sediments exhumed at the northern margin of the Syrtis Major lavas (e.g. Quinn & Ehlmann, 2015). Polygonal and with no clearly preferred orientation, the ridges rise 5-30 m above the surrounding terrain. Parallel light-toned grooves with dark interiors (indicative of isopachous fills) and jarosite in ridge mineralogy point to mineralization by acidic waters. Third, some mineral assemblages observed from orbit represent the products of subsurface aqueous alteration at elevated temperatures (Ehlmann et al., 2011). These are globally distributed, exposed in scarps and by impact cratering. Mineral assemblages variously include (a) serpentine and carbonate; (b) prehnite and chlorite, and (c) zeolites. Collectively, these datasets indicate that groundwaters were spatially widespread on ancient Mars, contributing to the sustenance of lakes and to the alteration of bedrock to >1 km depths. While the Martian surface may have always been relatively inhospitable, a warmer, wetter subsurface provided a long-term potentially habitable environment. Key outstanding questions remaining include groundwater sources, their composition and compositional variability, and subsurface transport distances. Continued exploration of Mars, combined with studies of analogous bedrock mineralization on Earth, will advance understanding of environments with liquid water during Mars’ first billion years.",

            "abstract": "Saline fracture waters within the Precambrian Shield rocks of Canada and South Africa have been sequestered underground over geologic timescales up to 1.1-1.8 Ga [1, 2]. These fluids are rich in H2 derived from radiolysis and hydration of mafic and ultramafic rocks [1, 2, 3] and host a low-biomass, low-diversity microbial ecosystem at some sites [2]. The abiogenic or biogenic nature of geochemical processes has important implications for bioavailable carbon sources and the role played by abiotic organic synthesis in sustaining a chemosynthetic deep biosphere. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) are simple carboxylic acids that may support microbial communities in such environments, such as those found in terrestrial [4] and deep-sea [5] hot springs. We present abundance and δ13C analysis for VFAs in a spectrum of Canadian Shield fluids characterized by varying dissolved H2, CH4, and C2+ n-alkane compositions. Isotope mass balance indicates that microbially mediated fermentation of carbon-rich graphitic sulfides may produce the elevated levels of acetate (39-273 μM) found in Birchtree and Thompson mine. In contrast, thermodynamic considerations and isotopic signatures of the notably higher acetate (1.2-1.9 mM), as well as formate and propionate abundances (371-816 μM and 20-38 μM, respectively) found at Kidd Creek mine suggest a role for abiogenic production via reduction of dissolved inorganic carbon with H2 for formate, and oxidation of C2+ n-alkanes for acetate and propionate, along with possible microbial cycling. VFAs comprise the bulk of dissolved and total organic carbon in the mines surveyed, and as such represent a potential key substrate for life.\n[1] Holland et al. (2013) Nature 497: 367-360.

            "abstract": "The unique environment on Europa makes it an ideal target for astrobiological investigation. One such earth-based analogue to aid in this investigation is the sulfur-dominated glacial spring system found at Borup Fiord Pass (BFP), Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada. In this system, subsurface microbial sulfate reduction produces hydrogen sulfide, which is transported through the glacier along spring channels [1]. As the surface oxidation of H2S occurs, resultant deposition of elemental sulfur (S0) and other minerals becomes visible (attached image). The energy released from these reactions can support potential microbial metabolisms and may be a valuable representation of microbial processes occurring on Europa. The resulting sulfur minerals provide sensitive records of dynamic atmospheric, geological, hydrological, chemical, and biological processes on planetary surfaces. Moreover, we expect that the S0-rich deposits of this glacial spring system will serve as a mineralogical record for biological activity and will provide a valuable tool for recognizing potential sulfur-based life on Europa.\nDuring a recent collaborative expedition (2014) to BFP, samples were taken from the toe of the glacier in an area called the ‘Blister Crust’ (attached image). At this location, glacial channels reach the surface, representing an active interface between subsurface and surface processes. Initial geochemical characterization at the site revealed high amounts of aqueous sulfide (1.8 mM) and hydrogen (29 nM), which likely serve as the electron donation potential in the system. Furthermore, preliminary 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown a high abundance of the genus Sulfurimonas, which is a known sulfur metabolizer. Our research seeks to further characterize microbial communities found at this interface in order to elucidate information regarding in situ sulfur cycling and the potential to tie this into subsurface/surface processes on Europa. Continued work will provide guidance into potential astrobiological targets on the surface of Europa, predominantly in regions where subsurface fluids interact with surface icings.\n",

            "abstract": "The hydrogeology of rift lakes is complex due to the potential influence of faults and porous volcanic and volcanoclastic media on groundwater flow. We conducted a comprehensive study that integrated geological and hydrogeological data as well as the application of a linear decay model to estimate the groundwater flow between the two of the best-studied lake systems in East Africa, the adjacent Lakes Naivasha and Nakuru- Elmenteita in the Central Kenya Rift. Whereas both lake basins host relatively shallow lakes today, paleo-shorelines and sediments suggest >100 m deep lakes during a wetter climate during the Early Holocene during the so-called African Humid Period. Stable isotope data show variations form highly depleted to more enriched d18O waters. The linear-reservoir depletion model simulates the decline of the Early Holocene lakes in both basins to the modern levels. The altitude difference of ca. 100 m of both paleo-lake levels enables us to estimate the duration of the groundwater decline and the connectivity of the two basins via the Eburru/Gilgil barrier. The results suggest a decline of the groundwater levels during ca. 5 kyrs if there is no recharge, and between 2-2.7 kyrs based on the modern recharge of 0.52 m/yr as the end members of the delay time introduced by subsurface water flow to the hydrology of the lake system. The latter value suggests that ca. 40.95 cubic kilometres of water flowed from Lake Naivasha to Nakuru- Elmenteita at maximum lake level in the Early Holocene following the hydraulic gradient concurrent to the topographic slope. The unexpectedly large volume, more than half of the volume of the paleo-Lake Naivasha during the Early Holocene, emphasizes the importance of groundwater in hydrological modelling of paleo-lakes in rifts. Moreover, the subsurface connectivity of rift lakes also causes a significant lag time to the system introducing a nonlinear component to the system that has to be considered while interpreting paleo-lake records.",

            "abstract": "A lack of river ice data during spring break-up in Alaska creates many forecast challenges for National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters. Limited and infrequent ice conditions and flood observations are provided by river observers, community officials, and pilots. Although these observations are invaluable, there are extensive spatial and temporal data gaps across Alaska during spring break-up. The Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite imagery has proved to be an extremely beneficial situational awareness and decision support tool for NWS forecast operations. In particular, the VIIRS satellite imagery became highly effective in identifying extensive flooding of many Alaskan rivers due to ice jams during the 2013 spring breakup season. A devastating ice jam flood in the Yukon River community of Galena prompted the development of river ice and flood detection products derived from the VIIRS satellite imagery with the support of the Joint Polar Satellite System/Proving Ground and Risk Reduction (JPSS/PGRR) Program. The two new products from S-NPP/VIIRS imagery provided critical decision making information to NWS forecasters responsible for issuing flood warnings for the region.\nSince 2013, the NWS continues to evaluate the use of these products in an operational forecast setting, and has expanded the evaluation period to include summertime flooding. There are limitations of these products due to cloud cover, sun zenith angles, product validation, and other issues unique to Alaska. The NWS will continue to provide feedback to the JPSS/PGRR Program in order to further refine and improve the algorithms used to create the river ice and flood detection products. This presentation will demonstrate how these products have been integrated into the NWS forecast process for several types of flood events in Alaska.",

            "abstract": "Reliable assessment of the primary causes of urban heat island (UHI) and the efficiency of various heat mitigation strategies requires accurate prediction of urban temperatures and realistic representation of land surface physical characteristics in models. In this study, we expand the capabilities of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the Urban Canopy Model (UCM) by implementing high-resolution real-time satellite observations of green vegetation fraction (GVF), leaf area index (LAI), and albedo. We use MODIS-based GVF, LAI, and albedo to replace constant values that are assumed for urban pixels and climatological values that are used for non-urban pixels in the default WRF-UCM. Utilizing the improved model, summertime climate of Los Angeles is simulated over the span of three years (2010-2012). Next, thermal sensitivity of urban climate to anthropogenic land use/cover is assessed via replacing current urban cover with pre-development vegetation cover, consisting of shrubland and grassland. Surrounding undeveloped areas and inverse distance weighting method are utilized to estimate GVF and LAI of pre-development vegetation cover. Our analysis of diurnal and nocturnal surface and air temperatures shows cooling effects of urbanization in neighborhoods with high fractions of irrigated vegetation. However, urban warming is consistently detected over industrial/commercial and high-intensity residential areas. In addition to well-known mechanisms such as a shift in surface energy partitioning, high heat storage in urban material, and inefficiency of urban surfaces in transferring convective heat from the surface to the boundary layer, our results show decreased wind speed and sea breeze also contribute to the UHI intensity. We further evaluate the interactions between UHI and replacing irrigated and imported vegetation with non-irrigated native vegetation as a water conservation strategy in water-stressed Los Angeles metropolitan area.",

            "abstract": "Considering the differences in how individual models represent physical processes for runoff generation and streamflow routing, use of ensemble output is desirable in an operational streamflow estimation and flood forecasting framework. To enable the use of ensemble streamflow, comparison of multiple hydrologic models at finer spatial resolution over a large domain is yet to be explored. The objective of this work is to compare streamflow prediction skills from three different land surface/hydrologic modeling frameworks: NOAH-MP/RAPID, VIC/RAPID and SWAT, over the Ohio River Basin with a drainage area of 491,000 km2. For a uniform comparison, all the three modeling frameworks share the same setup with common weather inputs, spatial resolution, and gauge stations being employed in the calibration procedure. The runoff output from NOAH-MP and VIC land surface models is routed through a vector-based river routing model named RAPID, that is set up on the high resolution NHDPlus reaches and catchments. SWAT model is used with its default tightly coupled surface-subsurface hydrology and channel routing components to obtain streamflow for each NHDPlus reach. Model simulations are performed in two modes, including: (i) hindcasting/calibration mode in which the models are calibrated against USGS daily streamflow observations at multiple locations, and (ii) validation mode in which the calibrated models are executed at 3-hourly time interval for historical flood events. In order to have a relative assessment on the model-specific nature of biases during storm events as well as dry periods, time-series of surface runoff and baseflow components at the specific USGS gauging locations are extracted from corresponding observed/simulated streamflow data using a recursive digital filter. The multi-model comparison presented here provides insights toward future model improvements and also serves as the first step in implementing an operational ensemble flood forecasting framework for the entire Mississippi Basin.",

            "abstract": "During the early stages of planetary formation in the solar system, the interior temperature of a growing planetesimal can rise until it exceeds the melt temperature, leading to planetary differentiation, for instance into a rocky mantle and iron-rich core. This growth and differentiation process likely occurs within the first 10 million years of solar system history. At this early stage, decay of short-lived isotopes provide a significant energy source. Cooling to space is accomplished by radiative heat loss, but little is known about the interior heating and cooling history prior to differentiation. Most previously published models for the thermal history of small bodies assume that heat is transferred by conduction from the interior. In the interiors of sufficiently large planetary bodies, solid-state convection will be the primary mechanism of heat transfer from the interior. Convection more efficiently removes heat from the interior; in this presentation we therefore examine whether solid-state convection in an undifferentiated body can influence the timeline for heating, cooling, and attaining the melt temperature. The onset of convection in a self-gravitating sphere of radius r, heated from within at a rate H, and cooled from the outside, was discussed by Chandrasekhar in 1961 and further developed, for a different application, by Hsui et al. (1972), who note that convection occurs when the Rayleigh number for a self-gravitating sphere exceeds 5783 for a sphere with a fixed surface boundary. Depending on the assumed viscosity as the melt temperature is approached, solid-state convection may occur for objects of less than 1000 km radius. Heating and cooling are transient phenomena governed by competing timescales including radioactive decay and convection. Thermal histories for different scenarios are developed using a finite element model.",

            "abstract": "P.G. Saffman & G. Taylor (1958) studied the stability of the interface between two immiscible fluids of different densities and viscosities when one displaces the other inside a Hele-Shaw (HS) cell. They showed that with a horizontal cell and if the displaced fluid is the more viscous, the interface is unstable and leads to a viscous fingering which they nearly fully modeled [1]. The HS geometry was introduced as a geometry imposing the same flow behavior as the Darcy-scale flow in a two-dimensional (2D) porous medium, and therefore allowing an analogy between the two configurations. This is however not obvious, since capillary forces act at very different scales in the two. Later, researchers performing unstable displacement experiments in HS cells containing random 2D porous media also observed viscous fingering at large viscosity ratios, but with invasion patterns very different from those of Saffman and Taylor (ST) [2-3]. It was however considered that the two processes were both Laplacian growth processes, i.e., processes in which the invasion probability density is proportional to the pressure gradient. Ten years ago, we investigated viscously-unstable drainage in 2D porous media experimentally and measured the growth activity as well as occupation probability maps for the invasion process [4-5]. We concluded that in viscous fingering in 2D porous media, the activity was rather proportional to the square of the pressure gradient magnitude (a so-called DBM model of exponent 2), so that the universality class of the growth/invasion process was different from that of ST viscous fingering. We now strengthen our claim with new results based on the comparison of (i) pressure measurements with the pressure field around a finger such as described by the ST analytical model, and (ii) branching angles in the invasion patterns with those expected for DBMs of various exponents.\n[1] Saffman, P.

These coordinated response actions are typically undertaken by multiple jurisdictions, levels of government, functional agencies and other responsible entities. A successful response is highly dependent on the effectiveness and efficiency of each coordinated response action undertaken across a broad spectrum of organizations and activities.\nIn order to provide a unified framework for those responding to incidents or planned events, FEMA provides a common and flexible approach for managing incidents, regardless of cause, size, location or complexity, referred to as the National Incident Management System (NIMS). Integral to NIMS is the Incident Command System (ICS), which establishes a common, pre-defined organizational structure to ensure coordination and management of procedures, resources and communications, for efficient incident management. While being both efficient and rigorous, NIMS, and ICS to a lesser extent, is an inherently complex framework that requires significant amount of training for planners, responders and managers to master, especially considering the wide array of incident types that Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) must be prepared to respond to.\nThe existing Water-Wizard Decision Support System (DSS), developed to support water distribution system recovery operations for Decontamination (Decon), Operational Optimization (WDS), and Economic Consequence Assessment (Econ), is being evolved to integrate incident response functions. Water-Wizard runs on both mobile and desktop devices, and is being extended to utilize smartphone and mobile device specific data streams (e.g GPS location) to augment its fact-base in real-time for situational-aware DSS recommendations. In addition, the structured NIMS and ICS frameworks for incident management and response are being incorporated into the Water-Wizard knowledgebase, with a mid-term goal of integrating flood-specific emergency response domain knowledge to provide a real-time flood responder decision support.",

            "abstract": "Carbonyl sulfide (COS) and the oxygen isotope composition (δ18O) of CO2 are potential tools for differentiating the contributions of photosynthesis and respiration to the balance of global carbon cycling. These processes are coupled at the leaf level via the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), which hydrolyzes CO2 in the first biochemical step of the photosynthetic pathway (CO2 + H2O ⇌ HCO3- + H+) and correspondingly structural analogue COS (COS + H2O → CO2 + H2S). CA also accelerates the exchange of oxygen isotopes between CO2 and H2O leading to a distinct isotopic imprint [1]. The biogeochemical cycles of these tracers include significant, yet poorly characterized soil processes that challenge their utility for probing the carbon cycle. In soils, microbial CA also hydrolyze COS and accelerate O isotope exchange between CO2 and soil water. Soils have been observed to emit COS by undetermined processes. To account for these soil processes, measurements are needed to identify the key microbial, chemical, and physical factors.\nIn this study, we survey COS and δ18O exchange in twenty different soils spanning a variety of biomes and soil properties. By comparing COS fluxes and δ18O-CO2 values emitted from moist soils we investigate whether the same types of CA catalyze these two processes. Additionally, we seek to identify the potential chemical drivers of COS emissions by measuring COS fluxes in dry soils. These data are compared with soil physical (bulk density, volumetric water content, texture), chemical (pH, elemental analysis, sulfate, sulfur K-edge XANES), and microbial measurements (biomass and phylogeny). Furthermore, we determine the abundance and diversity of CA-encoding genes to directly link CA with measured soil function. This work will define the best predictors for COS fluxes and δ18O-CO2 values from our suite of biogeochemical measurements. The suitability of identified predictor variables can be tested in follow-up studies and applied for modeling purposes.\n",

We applied seismic interferometry to the ambient noise data for the purpose of validating three-dimensional S-wave velocity structure (deep sedimentary structure) models beneath the observation area (Hayashida and Yoshimi, 2012, 2015). We used 37-month ambient noise data (October 2011 - October 2014) to obtain nine component (RR, TT, ZZ, RT, TR, ZR, ZT, RZ, and TZ) cross-correlation functions between two stations (105 station pairs) for distances from 4.3 to 40.7 km, according to the signal processing technique by Bensen et al. (2007). Our results show that signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of cross-correlation functions increase logarithmically as the stacking number increase and the wave trains are clear especially for TT and ZZ correlations. Some station pairs show large SNRs even for RT and TR correlations, indicating complicated velocity structure beneath the area. To extract Rayleigh-wave Green’s functions efficiently, we applied body and surface wave separation technique by Takagi et al. (2014). We obtained clear dispersion curves of Rayleigh and Love waves in the frequency range between 0.1 and 1.0 Hz that correspond well to theoretical curves from existing velocity structure model of Sekiguchi et al. (2009). We found that maximum detectable wavelength of surface wave is nearly equivalent to station-to-station distance for near station pairs (< 20 km), whereas the maximum wavelength is about a half of station-to-station distance for further station pairs. We also investigated the effectiveness of uniform noise source distribution assumptions by comparing hourly stacked complex coherence functions of ambient noise between neighboring two stations and theoretical Bessel functions of the of first kind of zero order with the existing crustal (Takeda et al., 2012) and deep sedimentary structure models (Sekiguchi et al., 2009). The comparisons show good agreements in the frequency range between 0.05 and 0.3 Hz, indicating uniform noise source distribution in the observation period.\nAcknowledgements:\nContinuous observations until March 2014 were funded by Japan Nuclear Safety Organization (JNES).",

The magmatic zircon record for this period is dominated by Neoarchean U-Pb ages, with greatly diminishing abundance of older rocks and no known zircon bearing rocks much older than 4.0 Ga. A similar pattern exists for the ages of detrital zircons but with important addition of zircons as old as 4.4 Ga, mostly from the Jack Hills metaconglomerate. It has been suggested that this represents an artefact of preservation rather than the actual production rate of older crust, with the implication that large volumes of older crust have been destroyed by various recycling processes. This undoubtedly has happened to some extent, but there is considerable uncertainty as to how much has been destroyed and the nature of the early-formed crust. Here is where the long-lived radiogenic isotopic record, particularly Lu-Hf, can provide important information on the sources of the zircons by integrating age and tracer isotopic information in not only the same sample or zircon but even in the same domain of zircon. Using the most robust data from zircon and whole rock samples, excluding those with unconstrained ages and mixed-domain analyses, the most radiogenic Hf isotope compositions are characterized by ~ chondritic Hf isotopic compositions from 4.4 to ~ 3.8 Ga and a nearly linear evolution trend from epsilon Hf of 0 at 3.8 Ga to ~ epsilon Hf of +16 at present. There remains no evidence from the Hf isotope record for widespread mantle depletion prior to 3.8 Ga. Excluding the Jack Hills zircons, there is a conspicuous lack of pre 3.9 Ga zircons in even the oldest sediments1. This indicates that crust prior to 3.8 Ga was likely small in volume and/or effectively recycled back into the mantle on short time scales and did not result in significant depletion of the mantle. The onset of widespread mantle depletion at ~ 3.8 Ga likely coincided with the formation of stable continental crust (and cratons).\n[1]Nutman et al (2001). Precambrian Res, 105, 93-114.",

This kind of learning goes on outside of the classroom, notably in science centers and museums, where novel, experiential approaches can be piloted. A new exhibit, Climate Prisms: The Arctic, is being mounted by a team of artists and scientists at the Bradbury Science Museum of Los Alamos National Laboratory. It presents the pipeline from collecting soil samples in the Arctic to analyzing them in the labs to the statistical analysis of the findings and on to the input into the climate model, using prisms of art: visual art, poetry, scientific text, information graphics, field imagery and others. The presentation encourages users to view Arctic science through these different lenses. Each person plots their own path, moving through the content at the pace and level that best enables them to engage with the material. With the entry points through multiple artistic voices, learners hearts and feelings are directly reached, building primarily affective connections and then curiosity, rather than cognitive. The project itself is a large display screen driven by a touch interface designed for individual or small group viewing. Content paths are determined by an underlying system of tags, levels, content categories and related research areas. A screen shows a set of images. Each image can be accessed to provide image-specific information or can be a launching pad for a new set of related content and images that allows the user to continue on their exploration journey. Each person, each time they visit, creates a unique path through over 2000 pieces of content according to the unique set of learning assets and interests they bring with them at that visit. Embedded assessment will log basic demographics and each individual foray through the content. These assessments will be analyzed to explore trends of use and drive further content development.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires are a perennial issue for California, and the current record-breaking drought is exacerbating the potential problems for the state. Fires leave behind burn scars characterized by diminished vegetative cover and abundant bare soil, and these areas are especially susceptible to storm events that pose an elevated risk of debris flows and sediment-rich sheet wash. This study focused on the 2013 Rim Fire that devastated significant portions of Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park, and utilized readily available NASA JPL SRTM elevation data and AVIRIS spectral imaging data to construct a debris flow hazard map that assesses mass wasting risk for the Rim Fire burn scar. This study consisted entirely of remotely sensed data, which was processed in software programs such as ENVI, GRASS GIS, ArcMap, and Google Earth. Parameters that were taken into consideration when constructing this map include hill slope (greater than 30 percent rise), burn severity (assessed by calculating NDVI), and erodibility of the soil (by comparing spectral reflectance of AVIRIS images with the reference spectra of illite). By calculating percent of total burn area, 6% was classified as low risk, 55% as medium risk, and 39% as high risk. In addition, this study assessed the importance of the 2015-2016 El Niño, which is projected to be one of the strongest on record, by studying historic rainfall records and storm events of past El Niño's. Hydrological and infrastructural problems that could be caused by short-term convective or long-term synoptic storms and subsequent debris flows were explored as well.",

            "abstract": "What are the fragmentation processes in volcanic eruptions? At meetings like this sessions ask \"what can pyroclasts tell us?\" and the answer is mostly \"the properties of the magma at the point of solidification.\" The only place a pyroclast can preserve a fragmentation signature is at its surface, as the fracture or interface that made it a fragment. Commonly contrasted are \"phreatomagmatic\" and \"magmatic\" fragmentation in eruptions. Strictly, the latter means only fragmentation of magma without external water, but it often carries the connotation of disruption by bubbles of magmatic gas. Phreatomagmatic fragmentation implies a role for external water in fragmenting the magma, including vaporization and expansion of water as steam with rapid cooling/quenching of the magma. Magma is necessarily involved in phreatomagmatic fragmentation, and a common approach to assessing whether a pyroclast formed by magmatic or phreatomagmatic fragmentation is to make a stepwise assessment. This often uses particle vesicularity (high=magmatic), shape of particles (blocky=phreatomagmatic), degree of quenching (high=phreatomagmatic), or a glassy fluidal exterior film on particles (present=magmatic). It is widely known that no single one of these criteria is entirely diagnostic and other criteria are often considered, such as welding (=magmatic), particle aggregation (=phreatomagmatic), lithic-fragment abundance (high=phreatomagmatic), and proportion of fines (high=phreatomagmatic). Magmatic fragmentation varies, and even without water can yield anything from rhyolite pumice to obsidian to basaltic achneliths or carbonatitic globules. This makes direct argument for magmatic fragmentation difficult, and many papers have taken an alternative approach: they have \"tested\" for phreatomagmatism using the fingerprints listed above, and if the fingerprint is lacking a magmatic fragmentation process is considered to be \"proven\". In other words, absence of evidence for phreatomagmatic fragmentation is taken as evidence of its absence. We argue that this approach is fundamentally invalid, that the criteria used are typically incorrect or incorrectly applied, and that for many, perhaps most, deposits it may not be possible to determine the fragmentation process at all given our current state of knowledge.",

We present the key differences in platform design as well as operational differences required by the various target environments. The Venus implementation includes propulsive capability to reach higher altitudes during the day and achieves full buoyancy in the “habitable layers” of Venus’ atmosphere at night. Titan also offers an attractive operating environment, allowing LEAF designs that can target low, medium, or high altitude operations, also with propulsive capabilities to roam within each altitude regime. The Mars version is a glider that descends gradually, allowing targeted delivery of payloads to the surface. Finally, an Earth version could remain in orbit in a stowed state until activated, allowing rapid response type deployments to any region of the globe.",

ETCs have an impact on water supply and natural hazards (flooding caused because of high precipitation, storm surges, high winds, etc). The characterization of how ETC activity (both frequency and intensity) will change in the future under global warming scenarios is an important line of investigation.\nMethods\nIn this work, we apply the Toolkit for Extreme Climate Analytics (TECA) for extracting ETC patterns in massive climate archives. We implement a pattern detection procedure outlined by Wang, et al. that identifies local pressure minima with a threshold on pressure gradient. We have successfully scaled this code to process the entire CMIP-5 archive in one shot on 750,000 cores on the Mira, BG/Q system. We extract storm track counts, and track densities from the resulting analysis. The output of the climate model simulations is compared against observed extra-tropical cyclone behaviour using the multiple linear regression analysis commonly used in detection and attribution studies. Various metrics of frequency and location are analysed, both on global and ocean-basin scales.\nDatasets\nWe process all CMIP-5 models under the historicalNAT, historical and rcp8.5 scenarios.

            "abstract": "Metamorphosed continental margin sedimentary sequences, which comprise the dominant tectonostratigraphic assemblage exposed in orogenic hinterlands, are crucial to understanding the architecture and evolution of collisional mountain belts. This study explores the textural effect of anatexis in amphibolite-grade conditions and documents the mineral growth mechanisms that control nucleation and growth of K-feldspar, sillimanite and silicate melt. The constrained textural evolution follows four stages:\n1) Nucleation – K-feldspar is documented to nucleate epitaxially on isomorphic plagioclase in quartzofeldspathic (psammitic) domains, whereas sillimanite nucleates in the Al-rich (pelitic) domain, initially on [001] mica planes. The first melt forms at the site of muscovite breakdown.\n2) Chemically driven growth – In the quartzofeldspathic domain, K-feldspar progressively replaces plagioclase by a K+ - Na+ cation transfer reaction, driven by the freeing of muscovite-bound K+ during breakdown of the mica. Sillimanite forms intergrowths with the remaining hydrous melt components, contained initially in ovoid clots.\n3) Merge and coarsening - With an increase in pressure, melt and sillimanite migrate away from clots along grain boundaries. A melt threshold is reached once the grain-boundary network is wetted by melt, increasing the length-scale of diffusion, resulting in grain boundary migration and grain-size coarsening. The melt threshold denotes the transition to an open-system on the lithology scale, where melt is a transient phase.\n4) Residual melt crystallization – Residual melt crystallizes preferentially on existing peritectic grains as anatectic quartz, plagioclase, and K-feldspar. As the system cools and closes, grain growth forces melt into the intersections of grain-boundaries, recognized as irregular shaped melt films, or as intergrowths of the volatile-rich phases (i.e. Tur-Ms-Ap).\nIn the Himalayan metamorphic core these processes result in the formation of: pelitic K-feldspar augen gneiss, stockwork leucogranites, and an effective strengthening of the hinterland, as evidenced by a switch in tectonic deformation style, from thin-skinned cover sequence thrust imbrication and folding to out-of-sequence basement-involved thick-skinned thrusting and folding.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological functions of river basins are summarized as collection, storage and runoff generation, which can be characterized by the dynamics of hydrological variables including precipitation, evaporation, storage and runoff. The temporal patterns of each variable can be indicators of the functionality of a basin. In this paper we introduce a measure to quantify the degree of similarity in intra-annual variations at monthly scale at different years for the four main variables. We introduce this measure under the term of recurrence and define it as the degree to which a monthly hydrological variable returns to the same state in subsequent years. The degree of recurrence in runoff is important not only for the management of water resources but also for the understanding of hydrologic processes, especially in terms of how the other three variables determine the recurrence in runoff. The main objective of this paper is to propose a simple hydrologic classification framework based on the combinations of recurrence in the four variables using a monthly scale time series. We evaluate it with lagged autocorrelation (AC), fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and Colwell’s indices of variables. By setting a threshold to define high or low recurrence in the four variables, we classify each river basin into 16 possible classes. According to the river basin classification, 10 out of the 16 possible classes were present in the 35 largest river basins in the world. In the humid tropic region, the basins belong to a class with high recurrence in all the variables, while in the subtropical region many of the river basins have low recurrence. In the temperate region, the energy limited or water limited in summer characterizes the recurrence in storage, but runoff exhibits generally low recurrence due to the low recurrence in precipitation. Our proposed framework follows a simple methodology that can aid in grouping river basins with similar characteristics of water, energy and storage cycles. The framework is applicable at different scales with different data sets to provide useful insights into the understanding of hydrologic regimes based on the classification.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic, climate, and biotic changes across the Triassic-Jurassic transition appear to have resulted in a “carbonate gap” in the rock record of many shallow marine environments. Ecological state changes documented in near-shore settings in both Tethys and Panthassa show an earliest Jurassic switch to sponge-dominated biosiliceous sedimentation regimes. The Sunrise Formation exposed in the Gabbs Valley Range of Nevada (USA) records a peculiar juxtaposition of Hettangian carbonate-rich strata that contain demosponge spicules as the primary bioclast. It is unclear 1) why biocalcifiers were not recorded in higher abundance in this near-shore back-arc basin setting; 2) why carbonates formed following a biosiliceous regime; and 3) what the lithology indicates about post-extinction marine geochemical dynamics. Detailed sedimentological, paleontological, and geochemical analyses were applied to a 20-m thick sequence of limestone and chert in the Muller Canyon area, which is the Auxiliary Stratotype for the Triassic/Jurassic boundary. Concretion anatomy, bioclast microfacies, and oxygen and carbon isotopic signatures all indicate the Hettangian limestones are chiefly diagenetic concretions that all formed very shallowly, some essentially at the sediment-water interface. We infer that local bottom waters and/or pore waters were supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate and that this contributed to widespread concretion sedimentation independent of biomineralization. Ecological incumbency of the demosponge meadows may have been supported by concurrent augmentation of marine silica concentration and this apparently proved inhospitable to re-colonization of benthic biocalcifying macrofauna. Together the biotic and lithologic consequences of the extinction represent million-year scale ecological restructuring and highlight early diagenetic precipitation as a major sink in long-term regional carbonate cycling. Perhaps the widespread ‘carbonate gap’ is actually a gap in calcifying macrofauna and the ocean managed to dump alkalinity as diagenetic carbonate.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) deposition in tropical forests may increase substantially in coming decades, stimulating a concomitant increase of soil N gas emissions (dinitrogen (N2), nitrous (N2O) and nitric oxides). How N deposition might alter the relative emissions of these gases is unclear, and has ramifications for the global climate since N2O is a potent greenhouse gas. We used a small-scale fertilization study in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) of Puerto Rico to simulate the effects of N deposition on N gas emissions. Fertilizer was applied by placing mesh bags filled with ammonium saturated weak cation exchange resin directly on the mineral soil for two months. At that time, intact soil cores (0-10cm) were taken from below the bags. The cores were shipped to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, where they were incubated in a helium headspace with either 0 or 20% oxygen (O2), and analyzed for N2 and N2O emissions. N fertilization increased N2O emissions fourfold (p=0.03). N2O production was positively correlated with field soil moisture (r=0.45, p=0.002), and was higher under 20% than 0% atmospheric O2 (p=0.003). With the exception of a handful of samples, we detected no measureable N2 production from these soils, and fertilization did not influence N2 production. This may have been because our experiment occurred during a drought that reduced soil moisture in the field by ∼20%. We have found that N2 emissions correlate with soil moisture elsewhere in the LEF. While we conclude that N deposition may not influence the N2O:N2 of soil emissions under such conditions, it is still unclear whether this result would hold under higher rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Dense Media Radiative Transfer Theory (DMRT) for multi layered snowpack (Picard et al., 2012), a physically based numerical model for microwave emission from snow, is coupled to passive microwave brightness temperature (Tb) observations to retrieve snow depth and snow water equivalent. Passive microwave data obtained from space-based and airborne radiometry were coordinated with intense snow-survey campaigns in the sub-Arctic Eureka tundra snow cover region during April 2011. The airborne Tb observations were made across a 50 x 50 km grid using two sampling approaches: high altitude, low spatial resolution observations with footprint dimensions of ~550 x 850 m and low altitude, high spatial resolution observations at ~70 x 110m. The Tb observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), covering the study area in four pixels of 25 x 25 km, were also used to compare with the airborne observations.\nA preliminary step in retrieval via physical modeling is parameterizing model inputs in the forward mode to assure an inverse model will result an accurate measure of the unknown variable (snow depth). Measurements of snowpack stratigraphy from snow-pits and interpolated snow depth data from magna probe measurements are used to force the DMRT model. While the optical grain size (D0) is used in DMRT, observed grain diameter (Dmax) was measured in the field. In this study, a method based on a practical approach that classifies SSA for each type of snow layer is used and optical grain size is then calculated using reported field data. Furthermore, we report on simple approaches to parameterize stickiness factor and snowpack physical temperature. Using forward DMRT model simulations of snow from different field observations, the sensitivity of the DMRT model to snowpack properties is evaluated at two scales: airborne and spaceborne. For instance, results indicate that 1 K change in snowpack physical temperature of 265 K results in ~1 K change of Tb at 36GHz, and 100 mm change in grain size from 400 to 500 mm (in a 30 to 50 cm snowpack) causes ~8 K change in simulated Tb. The analysis explains how Tbs from the high resolution airborne measurements scale up to the satellite observation scale. It also provides insight into the appropriate retrieval scheme suitable for satellite-scale estimates.",

            "abstract": "Magneotospheric dynamics are primarily controlled by the solar wind and its interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Majority of the magnetospheric studies relied on observation of the solar wind frequently taken as far away as the L1 Lagrange point approximately 230 RE upstream. The quality of the empirical or theoretical modeling depends on how accurately the solar wind observation at L1 can be propagated to the magnetosphere and drives the magnetospheric dynamics.\nIt has been more than two decades that researchers seek to determine the structures and evolution of the solar wind observationally in order to characterize the propagated solar wind parcels that interact with the Earth. Russell et al. [1980] used solar wind data at the Earth and L1 without considering the type of solar wind structures and found that the Bz correlations varied from 0.0 to 1.0. Although the most probable correlation was 0.85, half of the time the correlation was less than 0.5. The scale of IMF correlations was reexamined by Collier et al. [1998] using data from Wind and IMP 8. It should be noted that Collier et al. [1998] examined data during solar minimum and Russell et al. [1980] examined data during solar maximum. The scales of solar wind plasma and magnetic field were further examined by Richardson and Paularena [2001]. The found that the transverse scale for a decrease in density correlation by 0.1 is 120 Re and for velocity about 70 Re. In contrast the transverse scales for the components of the IMF are about 50 Re. Using ISEE 2 and IMP8 from 1978 to 1985, Hsu and McPherron [2009] found that a small transvers IMF structure of about 15 Re can occur only about 5%~13% .\nMost of the recent studies examining Sun-Earth coupling using OMNI solar data which is propagated to the Earth-Sun line by a method based upon minimum variance analysis [Weimer et al., 2003; Bargatze et al., 2005]. The important question of how often a near-earth IMF structure is absent from the propagated solar wind and vice versa is critical for the magnetospheric studies. In this study we use the Themis solar wind observations in the year 2008 to compare with the OMNI solar wind data to examine how often the propagated solar wind is matched with the near-Earth solar wind observations and its implication for magnetospheric studies.",

            "abstract": "Paleomagnetic studies of the Indochina block, aiming to reconstruct the paleogeography, have been undertaken for several decades. Since the Indochina block is lack of reliable paleomagnetic data to constraint its paleo-positions during the Middle Permian to Upper Triassic, the paleogeography reconstruction is still in debate between different models reported. Here we present new paleomagnetic data of Middle Permian to Upper Triassic sediment rocks from the Indochina block in Thailand, and recalculate paleomagnetic data reported by different authors. We collected the Permian samples in 20 sites distributed in the central Thailand, and Triassic samples from the Huai Hin Lat and Nam Phong formations in 13 sites in the northern Thailand.The magnetic directions of the 11 sites of Permian limestones are not significantly clustered after tilt correction which implying a remagnetized result. Remarkably, in geographic coordinate, the 11 sites were distributed along a circle showing a similar inclination，which is 22.9° implying the paleolatitude to be about 12°. Totally, 13 sites from the Huai Hin Lat formation are included in the calculation of the formation mean direction Dg/Ig = 21.4°/38.1°, kg = 19.5, α95 = 9.6° before and Ds/Is = 43.0°/48.0°, ks = 47.4, α95 = 6.1°, N = 13 after bedding correction. A pre-folding characteristic magnetization is suggested by the positive fold test result derived from the Huai Hin Lat formation, and thus implies a primary remanence of the Norian Stage Upper Triassic rocks. A new Nam Phong formation mean direction derived from 11 sites is Dg/Ig = 36.5°/31.3°, kg = 14.7, α95 = 12.3°before and Ds/Is = 36.4°/37.8°, ks = 68.5, α95 = 5.6°, N = 11 after bedding correction. The two formation mean directions correspond to the magnetic pole positions , Plat./Plon=48.7°N/165.9°E, A95=7.2° and Plat./Plon=55.2°N/178.0°E, A95=5.9°, respectively. A remarkable tectonic movement (~8° southward) of the Indochina block from the age of the Huai Hin Lat formation to the Nam Phong formation is suggested in this study, indicating the Indochina block locates in the west of the South China block at the Norian Age Late Triassic and moved to a new position which is quite near the present at the Rhaetian Age of Late Triassic to Early Jurassic.",

            "abstract": "Unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) using hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has recently fostered an unprecedented acceleration in energy development. Regulations seek to protect environmental quality of areas surrounding UOGD, while maintaining economic benefits. One such regulation is a setback distance, which dictates the minimum proximity between an oil and gas well and an object such as a residential or commercial building, property line, or water source. In general, most setback regulations have been strongly politically motivated without a clear scientific basis for understanding the relationship between the setback distance and various performance outcomes. This presentation discusses a new decision support framework for setback regulations, as part of a large NSF-funded sustainability research network (SRN) on UOGD. The goal of the decision support framework is to integrate a wide array of scientific information from the SRN into a coherent framework that can help inform policy regarding UOGD. The decision support framework employs multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) optimization coupled with simulation models of air quality and other performance-based outcomes on UOGD. The result of the MOEA optimization runs are quantitative tradeoff curves among different objectives. For example, one such curve could demonstrate air pollution concentrations versus estimates of energy development profits, for different levels of setback distance. Our results will also inform policy-relevant discussions surrounding UOGD such as comparing single- and multi-well pads, as well as regulations on the density of well development over a spatial area.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Salls85100_AGUupload.pdf\nSoil loss constitutes a multi-faceted problem for agriculture: in addition to reducing soil fertility and crop yield, it compromises downstream water quality. Sediment itself is a major issue for aquatic ecosystems, but also serves as a vector for transporting nutrients, pesticides, and pathogens. Rangelands are thought to be a contributor to water quality degradation in California, particularly in the northern Coast Range. Though total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) have been imposed in some watersheds, and countless rangeland water quality outreach activities have been conducted, the connection between grazing intensity recommendations and changes in water quality is poorly understood at the state level. This disconnect gives rise to poorly informed regulations and discourages adoption of best management practices by ranchers. By applying the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) at a statewide scale, we highlighted areas most prone to erosion. We also investigated how two different grazing intensity scenarios affect modeled soil loss.\nGeospatial data layers representing the USLE parameters—rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, and cover—were overlaid to model annual soil loss. Monitored suspended sediment data from a small North Coast watershed with grazing as the predominant land use was used to validate the model. Modeled soil loss values were nearly one order of magnitude higher than monitored values; average soil loss feeding the downstream-most site was modeled at 0.329 t ha-1 yr-1, whereas storm-derived sediment passing the site over two years was calculated to be 0.037 t ha-1 yr-1. This discrepancy may stem from the fact that the USLE models detached sediment, whereas stream monitoring reflects sediment detached and subsequently transported to the waterway. Preliminary findings from the statewide map support the concern that the North Coast is particularly at risk given its combination of intense rain, erodible soils, and relatively steep terrain, though there is a fair degree of variability statewide.",

In this paper, we focus on the effect of the large-scale winter mean sea-ice circulation on the following September minimum sea-ice extent and, in particular, how coastal divergence in the western and eastern Arctic dictates the geographical pattern of retreat. We compare the Community Climate System Model 4 (CCSM4) and the Community Earth System Model 1 Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) with sea-ice motion vectors from NOAA/NSIDC for the past three decades. We find that the large-scale mean winter atmospheric circulation in CCSM4 is characterized by a positive Arctic Oscillation (AO) index with a broad Transpolar Drift Stream, sea-ice divergence in the western Arctic and a large negative bias in its Arctic mean sea-level pressure (around -7 mb). On the other hand, CESM-LE has a mean winter sea-ice circulation more similar to observations in its late 20th century climate and no bias in its mean sea-level pressure, although there are some spatial differences.\nWe use a Lagrangian ice trajectory model to quantify the amount of ice divergence along the Alaskan and Eurasian coastlines by backtracking the September sea-ice extent minimum ice edge to its position throughout the previous year. We find that the sea-ice retreat in CCSM4 occurs mostly on the Pacific side of the Arctic Ocean with more coastal divergence in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas – in line with the more positive AO. On the other hand, the sea-ice retreat is found to be more symmetric around the North Pole in CESM-LE. Given that a positive trend in the AO index is a robust feature of Global Climate Models participating in CMIP5, our results suggest that sea ice will continue to retreat preferentially from the Pacific sector, as has been observed in the last decade.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Kwon_AGU2015_final.pdf\nSoftware code developed for research is often used for a relatively short period of time before it is abandoned, lost, or becomes outdated. This unintentional abandonment of code is a valid problem in the 21st century scientific process, hindering widespread reusability and increasing the effort needed to develop research software. Potentially important assets, these legacy codes may be resurrected and documented digitally for long-term reuse, often with modest effort. Furthermore, the revived code may be openly accessible in a public repository for researchers to reuse or improve. For this study, the research team has begun to revive the codebase for Groundwater Decision Support System (GWDSS), originally developed for participatory decision making to aid urban planning and groundwater management, though it may serve multiple use cases beyond those originally envisioned. GWDSS was designed as a java-based wrapper with loosely federated commercial and open source components. If successfully revitalized, GWDSS will be useful for both practical applications as a teaching tool and case study for groundwater management, as well as informing theoretical research. Using the knowledge-sharing approaches documented by the NSF-funded Ontosoft project, digital documentation of GWDSS is underway, from conception to development, deployment, characterization, integration, composition, and dissemination through open source communities and geosciences modeling frameworks. Information assets, documentation, and examples are shared using open platforms for data sharing and assigned digital object identifiers. Two instances of GWDSS version 3.0 are being created: 1) a virtual machine instance for the original case study to serve as a live demonstration of the decision support tool, assuring the original version is usable, and 2) an open version of the codebase, executable installation files, and developer guide available via an open repository, assuring the source for the application is accessible with version control and potential for new branch developments. Finally, metadata about the software has been completed within the OntoSoft portal to provide descriptive curation, make GWDSS searchable, and complete documentation of the scientific software lifecycle.",

            "abstract": "Surface mass balance observations and models confirm that both the west Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets have undergone accelerating ice mass losses during the past decade. These losses enhance freshwater discharge to the ocean and have important implications for ocean circulation and sea level, but they can also impact marine ecosystems and carbon cycling. High-latitude primary productivity is limited by light or nutrients (or both), and phytoplankton access to these limiting factors can be altered by freshwater additions. Mechanisms for delivering meltwater to the ocean are complex and depend in part on whether the melt occurs at the ice-atmosphere or ice-ocean interface. Marine-terminus glaciers may generate buoyant plumes at depth, similar to upwelling whereas runoff from glacial termini on land will behave more like a riverine point source at the ocean surface. Here, we present preliminary results from two ongoing efforts to understand these impacts: one from the Amundsen Sea Polynya (ASP) in west Antarctica (NSF-funded INSPIRE), and another from NASA-IDS Ice Sheet Impact Study in coastal Greenland. Field observations from the Amundsen Sea Polynya International Research Expedition (ASPIRE) showed how the enormous phytoplankton bloom in the central ASP depends on an iron supply from the Dotson Ice Shelf (DIS). This outcome implied a three-dimensional pathway for iron, from the DIS cavity to the euphotic zone of the ASP bloom region located 20–100 km offshore. Such a pathway differs from the traditional one-dimensional view, where nutrients are injected into the euphotic zone by vertical mixing. Mesoscale structures and eddies may play a central role. A ROMS model is used to investigate key physical and biogeochemical processes in the ASP region. A similar effort is underway to investigate the fate of extreme melt from Greenland and its impact on primary productivity. In coastal Greenland, meltwater is modeled as surface runoff and the resulting shallower mixed layers can enhance light availability to coastal phytoplankton by 5-20 W m-2. Predictions from both models are tested against observations.",

            "abstract": "Like many watersheds in the North Cascades Mountain range, streamflow in the Nooksack River is strongly influenced by precipitation and snowmelt in the spring and glacial melt in the warmer summer months. With a maritime climate and a high relief basin with glacial ice (3400 hectares), the streamflow response in the Nooksack is sensitive to increases in temperature, thus forecasting the basins response to future climate is of vital importance for water resources planning purposes. The watershed (2000 km2) in the northwest of Washington, USA, is a valuable freshwater resource for regional municipalities, industry, and agriculture, and provides critical habitat for endangered salmon species. Due to a lack of spatially distributed long-term historical weather observations in the basin for downscaling purposes, we apply publically available statistically derived 1/16 degree gridded surface data along with the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM; Wigmosta et al., 1992) with newly developed coupled dynamic glacier model (Clarke et al., 2015) to simulate hydrologic processes in the Nooksack River basin. We calibrate and validate the DHSVM to observed glacial mass balance and glacial ice extent as well as to observed daily streamflow and SNOTEL data in the Nooksack basin. For the historical period, we model using a gridded meteorological forcing data set (1950-2010; Livneh et al., 2013). We simulate forecasted climate change impacts, including glacial recession on streamflow, using gridded daily statically downscaled data from global climate models of the CMIP5 with RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 forcing scenarios developed using the multivariate adaptive constructed analogs method (Abatzoglou and Brown, 2011). Simulation results project an increase in winter streamflows due to more rainfall rather than snow, and a decrease in summer flows with a general shift in peak spring flows toward earlier in the spring. Glacier melt contribution to streamflow initially increases throughout the first half of the 21st century and decreases in the latter half after glacier ice volume decreases substantially.",

Climate change impacts the water resources of nations as normal global weather patterns are altered during El Nino events. Agricultural curricula must incorporate awareness of ‘climate change’ in order to find novel ways to (1) assure global food security; (2) improve soil productivity and conservation; (3) improve crop yields and irrigation; (4) inexpensively develop site specific principles of crop management based on variable soil and associated hydrological properties; and (5) improve precision farming. In February 2015, Central State University (CSU), Ohio became an 1890 Land-Grant institution vital to the sustainability of Ohio’s agricultural sector. Besides agricultural extension, the agriculture curriculum at CSU integrates multidisciplinary courses in science, technology engineering, agriculture, and mathematics (STEAM). The agriculture program could benefit from a technology-driven, interdisciplinary soil science course that promotes climate change education and climate literacy while being offered in both a blended and collaborative learning environment. The course will focus on the dynamics of microscale to mesoscale processes occurring in farming systems, those of which impact climate change or could be impacted by climate change. Elements of this course will include: climate change webinars; soil-climate interactions; carbon cycling; the balance of carbon fluxes between soil storage and atmosphere; microorganisms and soil carbon storage; paleoclimate and soil forming processes; geophysical techniques used in the characterization of soil horizons; impact of climate change on soil fertility; experiments; and demonstrations.",

            "abstract": "Shallow permafrost distribution and characteristics are important for predicting ecosystem feedbacks to a changing climate over decadal to century timescales. These can drive active layer deepening and land surface deformation, which in turn can significantly affect hydrological and biogeochemical responses, including greenhouse gas dynamics. Investigating permafrost soil intrinsic properties generally involves time-consuming and expensive lab-based analysis of few soil cores over a large area and extrapolating between points to characterize spatial variations in soil properties. Geophysical techniques provide lower resolution data over a spatially large area and when coupled with high-resolution point data can potentially estimate with greater accuracy the spatial variation of investigated properties, thus limiting the difficulty of collecting many soil cores in remote areas.\nAs part of the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiment (NGEE-Arctic), we investigate multi-dimensional relationships between various permafrost intrinsic soil properties, and further linkages with geophysical parameters such as density from X-ray computed tomography (CT) and electrical conductivity from electrical resistance tomography (ERT) to evaluate how best to constrain estimation of properties as soil organic carbon content, ice content and saturation across low- to high-centered polygon features in the arctic tundra.\nResults of this study enable the quantification of the multi-dimensional relationships between intrinsic properties, which can be further used to constrain estimation of such properties from geophysical data and/or where limited core-based information is available. This study also enables the identification of the key controls on soil electrical resistivity and density at the investigated permafrost site, including salinity, porosity, water content, ice content, soil organic matter, and lithological properties. Overall, inferred multi-dimensional relationships and related uncertainty enable probabilistic mapping of key parameters (organic content, ice content, etc.) using density and soil structural information from CT and bulk electrical resistivity.",

            "abstract": "Various studies have reported differences between the characteristics of cloud-to-ground lightning return strokes occurring over land and ocean. Orville et al. [2011] used peak currents estimated by the NALDN for negative cloud-to-ground return strokes to report that their magnitudes are, on average, larger over the ocean than over land. This observation was confirmed by Hutchins et al. [2013] and Said et al. [2013]. However, this discrepancy in peak current magnitudes has not been found for positive return strokes over land and ocean [Cummins et al., 2005; Orville et al., 2011].\nNag and Rakov [2014] reported that, for positive return strokes and propagation over relatively long distances (ranging from about 10 to 160 km) over land, the peak electric field derivative (dE/dt) is considerably smaller and the dE/dt half-peak width is much longer than the values reported in the literature [Cooray et al., 2004] for the case of propagation over salt water. Interestingly, Nag and Rakov’s values are comparable to those reported by Heidler and Hopf [1998] for propagation over a few kilometers over land, for which propagation effects due to finitely conducting soil were expected to be relatively small. This implies that there may be a discrepancy between the values of peak electric field derivative and dE/dt half-peak width for positive return strokes occurring over land versus salt water related to the source, as opposed to propagation effects. On the other hand, Cummins et al. [2005] examined U.S. NLDN reported risetimes of both positive and negative first strokes and found them to be similar for lightning over land and ocean.\nIn this study, we examine magnetic field risetimes and estimated peak currents of return strokes measured by NLDN sensors located close to the coastline for lightning occurring over land and ocean. For “oceanic” return stroke magnetic fields propagating over ocean and several tens of kilometers over relatively high conductivity (>10 mS/m) soil, risetimes were found to be similar to those for land-based return stroke magnetic fields propagating several tens of kilometers over relatively high conductivity soil. We will discuss the significance of these results and examine (via modeling) possible reasons for apparent differences between the characteristics of cloud-to-ground lightning over land and ocean.",

            "abstract": "Soil in conjunction with underlying weathered bedrock make up what is referred to as regolith, which can be thought of as the substrate that actively contributes water and nutrients to above ground biomass. As a result, regolith thickness is an important regulating factor of forest health and drought tolerance in the Sierra Nevada. Our project examined the relationships between landscape position, regolith thickness, and tree productivity within a sub watershed of the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory. We hypothesized that tree productivity will increase with increasing regolith thickness. Data was collected in the summer of 2015 at sixty-five sites within a 522-ha watershed averaging 1180m in elevation with a MAP of 80cm and a MAT of 11C. Sites were randomly selected from a grid and then stratified in the field to capture representative samples from different landscape positions. Regolith was sampled using a hand auger with attachable extensions. At each site we augered to hard bedrock or a maximum depth of 7.56 m, which ever was shallower. Biomass measurements were made for all conifer species (DBH>20cm) within a 10m radius of the primary auger hole. Tree age was measured from a representative tree for all species in the plots. Preliminary findings suggest that there is a weak correlation between landscape position/slope and regolith thickness, likely due to differences in lithology. It also appears that terrain shape can result in conflicting outcomes: 1. It can focus water to promote physical and chemical weathering and thick regolith; or, 2. water focusing can result in landscape scouring, removing soil and weathered bedrock to create shallow regolith. Productivity appears to be a function of regolith thickness, effective precipitation and landscape position. Water collecting areas in the lower watershed are shallow to bedrock, but typically receive high amounts of effective precipitation resulting in greater tree productivity. Moreover, thick regolith in uplands also supports high productivity.  Future work will explore the application of terrain attributes computed from DEMs to characterize the contributions of terrain and effective precipitation. As climate change continues it will become increasingly important for land managers to evaluate forest health, productivity and drought tolerance.",

            "abstract": "Hydrometeorological research has shown that simulations of atmospheric processes benefit from sophisticated land surface formulations. Moisture and energy fluxes between the land surface and lower atmosphere are influenced strongly not only by atmospheric conditions, but by terrestrial hydrologic processes, soil moisture distribution in particular. By improving the representation of hydrologic processes, better predictive skill can be achieved in a fully-coupled weather forcasting model. Further improvements in the model can be realized by incorporating observed data values into the hydrologic model. This work applies the Ensemble Kalman Filter functionality included in the Data Assimilation Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), a collection of data assimilation tools maintained at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, to the ParFlow hydrologic model—the hydrologic component of the TerrSysMP fully coupled hydrologic – land surface – atmospheric model system. This generalized data assimilation tool allows observations of variables in the hydrologic component of the system to be incorporated into the overall error covariance matrix thus guiding the development of quantities that define the model state. Single dimension column tests, and a three-dimensional idealized catchment drainage and dry-out test were performed with the ParFlow-DART system to evaluate the effects of assimilating pressure head, soil moisture, and outflow observations on the development of the model through time. The data assimilation system was then applied to the hydrologic portion a fully-coupled (subsurface, land surface, and atmosphere) simulation over the North Rhine-Westphalia region in western Germany to demonstrate the utility of this system in a non-idealized and realistic forecasting situation. The success of these tests will allow the ParFlow-DART system to be developed into a complete data assimilation package for the TerrSysMP fully-coupled modeling system.",

            "abstract": "Lower and upper treelines jointly determine the distribution of forests in many mountainous regions. Although upper treelines across the world have received extensive scientific attention, generalizable studies of the climate controls of lower treelines are largely absent from ecological literature. Lower treelines are thought to be ultimately limited by plant water balance, and are expected to contract with predicted increases in water deficits. However, where the position of lower treeline is constrained by land use and disturbance rather than by water balance, the distribution of forests will likely be less sensitive to climate changes.\nIn this study, we investigated the relative importance of climate, land use, and disturbance for determining the position of lower treeline in the western US. We developed a moving window method to automate the mapping of lower treelines in the Intermountain West, an arid region encompassing gradients of precipitation (both magnitude and seasonality), growing season length, geology, disturbance history, and land use. We used classification and regression trees to identify climatic thresholds most related to lower treeline position and important effects of land use and disturbance.\nPreliminary results show that lower treeline is associated with the interaction of soils and seasonal water balance, although the strength of the relationship varies by forest type and region. Furthermore, land use (wood harvest, grazing, and infrastructure development) and disturbance (fire) often coincide with the lower treeline boundary, suggesting that the actual position of lower treeline is partially controlled by secondary constraints. Future work will compare the modeled climate potential of lower treeline to the actual distribution, distinguishing between treelines that are likely at their ecophysiological limit (and thus susceptible to contraction in a warming or drying climate) from those contrained above their climate potential (areas of potential down-slope expansion).",

            "abstract": "Although the East African Rift System (EARS) is often cited as a type example for “narrow” rifting (where strain is localized along the rift axis), the true extent of rift-related deformation remains largely unknown due to sparse geophysical observations outside of the main rift valley. Our study, which takes this large scale approach, investigates the distribution of deformation in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) and surrounding regions, including the Ethiopian Highlands to the west of the rift valley, Somali Platform to the east, and Afar Triple Junction. We first construct kinematic, self-consistent strain rate and velocity fields on a 1° by 1° grid using continuous spline interpolations of strain rate observations (earthquake and fault data, plate rotations, and GPS velocities). Next, we calculate the deviatoric stress field associated with gravitational potential energy (GPE) by integrating density as a function of depth using published crustal density structures (CRUST1.0) and newly obtained receiver functions. We then directly solve for the deviatoric stress field associated with the lateral density variations by assuming a minimum energy stress field (e.g. Flesch et al. [2001]). Finally, we look for symmetries and asymmetries in both the strain rate and GPE deviatoric stress fields to assess the source of observed, off-rift deformation. We compare our results to published global and regional models that include the East African Rift and Iceland. Results suggest that the MER is not an end-member, “narrow” type rift, and that heterogeneities in lithospheric strength likely play an important role in governing the kinematics of rifting in Ethiopia.",

This can be very interesting – it means that we might be able to know that some kind of life lived long ago even if it’s not living now. It might also mean that we can find marks of life far far away from our home, on other worlds. One day people will go to other worlds to look for life. We hope to find it or marks that it was once there.\nI am going to talk about two places I study. In one, rocks are forming in plain daylight, in water that is only as deep as your knee (or maybe less). They should not be there. It seems very possible that the tiny life helps them form there. I study these rocks and ways that tiny life might help the rocks form. Rocks usually last a lot longer than tiny life, so they are an example of a mark that could last for a long long time and be a sign that life was once around there, long after the tiny life died.\nI will also talk about tiny life that lives under ground in the dark in places big enough that you and I can walk to. By this I mean that there is a trail that leads under ground with enough space for people to enter and study. Of course, we need light to see there, so we bring man made light with us. This tiny life gets food to live from water and rock, not from the sun. The tiny life also makes new rocks, usually easy to see because they are different colors from the other rocks. Again, this is a mark of life, and I am interested in how the marks from tiny life are made, how long they might last, and how many different kinds of marks I can find.",

            "abstract": "The Eurekan Orogeny of northeastern Ellesmere Island in the Canadian arctic was formed as a result of mountain-building processes in the Paleogene. The orogen developed relatively distant from any active convergent plate boundaries making it a representation of a class of intraplate mountain-building. In this work we investigate the geodynamics of the Eurekan and in particular focus on the potential role of glacial erosion in modifying the orogenesis. The study is motivated by important recent research that has demonstrated a significant interaction between (climate-controlled) surface processes and solid Earth tectonics at collision. Glacial erosion is thought to have the capability of eroding at a rate which matches with that of rock uplift in active orogens, referred to as the “buzz saw” effect of glaciers. Using the geodynamic modelling code of SOPALE we developed forward 2D models of the idealized Ellesmerian lithospheric structure and imposed shortening to explore Eurekan-style orogenic deformation. In the numerical experiments, we modified the erosional algorithm in the model such to investigate various implementations of the glacial buzz saw. The model results show how the surface topography and internal lithospheric structure of the orogeny are modified by variable glacial erosion. In addition to illustrating how the Eurekan orogeny may have evolved, the results provide insight into how the generic orogenic zones may develop in a glacial environment.",

            "abstract": "The Engineering Risk Assessment (ERA) team at NASA Ames Research Center is developing a physics-based impact risk model for probabilistically assessing threats from potential asteroid impacts on Earth. The model integrates probabilistic sampling of asteroid parameter ranges with physics-based analyses of entry, breakup, and impact to estimate damage areas and casualties from various impact scenarios. Assessing these threats is a highly coupled, dynamic problem involving significant uncertainties in the range of expected asteroid characteristics, how those characteristics may affect the level of damage, and the fidelity of various modeling approaches and assumptions. The presented model is used to explore the sensitivity of impact risk estimates to these uncertainties in order to gain insight into what additional data or modeling refinements are most important for producing effective, meaningful risk assessments. In the extreme cases of very small or very large impacts, the results are generally insensitive to many of the characterization and modeling assumptions. However, the nature of the sensitivity can change across moderate-sized impacts. Results will focus on the value of additional information in this critical, mid-size range, and how this additional data can support more robust mitigation decisions.",

            "abstract": "Curiosity’s Mastcam and MAHLI instruments in Gale Crater (GC) imaged mm-sized circular rimmed hollow nodules (HNs) (Figure 1A), pitting the Sheepbed mudstone of Yellowknife Bay Formation [1,2]. HNs are significantly smaller than the solid nodules within the outcrop, with an external mean diameter of 1.2 mm and an interior one of 0.7 mm [2] Several formation mechanisms of HNs have been discussed, such as: (1) Diagenetic dissolution of soluble mineral phases; or, (2) Gas bubbles released shortly after sediment deposition [1-3].\nIn an ephemeral pond in Ubehebe Crater (Death Valley, CA) we observed the formation of hollow nodule sedimentary structures produced by gas bubbles (Figure 1C) preserved in smectite-rich mud that are strikingly similar to those imaged in GC (Figure 1A). This finding supports the gas bubble hypothesis [2].\n Ubehebe Crater (UC) surface sediment hollow nodules were sampled, imaged, and their internal diameter measured (200 hollow structures) showing similar shape, distribution, and composition to those imaged by Curiosity in GC.\nUC in-situ observations suggest the gas bubbles were generated within the slightly reducing ephemerally submerged mud. These intra-crater deposits remain otherwise extremely dry year round, i.e., Air_rH ~2-5%; ground H2O wt%: 1-2%; Summer air/ground T: 45-48ºC/67-70ºC [4-5].\n Data from the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), CheMin, and ChemCam instruments onboard the rover revealed that HNs-bearing mudstone are rich in smectite clay e.g., ~18-20% [6,7] deposited in a neutral to mildly alkaline environment, capturing a period when the surface was potentially habitable [1]. The UC HNs-hosting deposits are also rich in smectite clays (~30%) and occur in an ephemeral shallow freshwater setting [4-5].\nIf present, surface hollow nodules are easy to find in dry clay-rich mud in lacustrine sediments, so they could represent a new indicator of ephemeral but habitable/inhabited environments on both Earth and early Mars.\n",

            "abstract": "Meso- and global-scale IT remote sensing is accomplished via satellite imagers and ground-based instruments. On the ground, the approach is arrays providing extensive as possible coverage (the \"net\") and powerful observatories that drill deep to provide detailed information about small-scale processes (the \"drill\"). Always, there is a trade between cost, spatial resolution, coverage (extent), number of parameters, and more, such that in general the larger the network the sparser the coverage. Where are we now? There are important gaps. With THEMIS-ASI, we see processes that quickly evolve beyond the field of view of one observatory, but involve space/time scales not captured by existing meso- and large-scale arrays. Many forefront questions require observations at heretofore unexplored space and time scales, and comprehensive inter-hemispheric conjugate observations than are presently available. To address this, a new ground-based observing initiative is being developed in Canada. Called TREx, for Transition Region Explorer, this new facility will incorporate dedicated blueline, redline, and Near-Infrared All-Sky Imagers, together with an unprecedented network of ten imaging riometers, with a combined field of view spanning more than three hours of magnetic local time and from equatorward to poleward of typical auroral latitudes (spanning the ionospheric footprint of the “nightside transition region” that separates the highly stretched tail and the inner magnetosphere). The TREx field-of-view is covered by HF radars, and contains a dense network of magnetometers and VLF receivers, as well as other geospace and upper atmospheric remote sensors. Taken together, TREx and these co-located instruments represent a quantum leap forward in terms of imaging, in multiple parameters (precipitation, ionization, convection, and currents), ionospheric dynamics in the above-mentioned scale gap. This represents an exciting new opportunity for studying geospace at the system level, especially for using the aurora to remote sense magnetospheric plasma physics and dynamics, and comes with a set of Big Data challenges that are going to be exciting. One such challenge is the development of a fundamentally new type of data product, namely time series of multi-parameter, geospatially referenced ‘data cubes’.",

The rainband of a hurricane is a common area where tornadogenesis is found depending on the size, intensity, and orientation of the rain band when the storm makes landfall. As a hurricane approaches a coast line, land-surface roughness contributes to surface friction, which can contribute in tornadogenesis. The orientation of the rainband may play a part in the type of supercells that are formed in that rainband and the number and intensity of the tornadoes produced. This study will investigate if the orientation of the rainband leads to the direction in which the supercells rotate, whether clockwise or counter-clockwise, and the scale and intensity of the tornadoes produced.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Humphries_Robert_AGU2015_Poster_Shields2Annandale.pdf\nThe threshold between stasis and mobility, and the forms and processes associated with the interfacial instabilities it defines, is a fundamental component of most morphodynamic systems. Scientists and engineers who focus on the interface of the earth’s dynamic surface and the turbulent fluids of the atmosphere and hydrosphere, have approached this interface from a diversity of perspectives. In the field of sediment transport, Shield’s 1936 paper stands as a benchmark for the theoretical understanding of the threshold of incipient motion of non-cohesive granular transport. However, in processes such as the erosion of cohesive material or bedrock erosion, consensus has yet to be reached among researchers, as to which method most aptly encompasses these processes. The lack of consensus is reasonable, considering the diversity of the applications, and implications, of interface dynamics. When thresholds may depend on the sequence of antecedent conditions, as in cohesive sediment entrainment, or the time scale of perception ranges from many Hertz to geologic eras, as in the processes of rock scour, a diversity of conceptual models is to be anticipated. In Scour Technology (Annandale 2006), the Erodibility Index Method (EIM) is presented as a threshold paradigm that spans the breadth of all earth materials that may experiences erosion by fluid forces. The authors present a comparison of the modern expression of the benchmark theoretical understanding of the threshold of incipient motion of non-cohesive granular material with the EIM. Results illustrate that each threshold can provide insight into the other and that the Shields parameter can be expressed within the vocabulary of the EIM.",

            "abstract": "On Gofar transform fault on the East Pacific Rise (EPR), Mw ~6.0 earthquakes occur every ~5 years and repeatedly rupture the same asperity (rupture patch), while the intervening fault segments (rupture barriers to the largest events) only produce small earthquakes. In 2008, an ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) deployment successfully captured the end of a seismic cycle, including an extensive foreshock sequence localized within a 10 km rupture barrier, the Mw 6.0 mainshock and its aftershocks that occurred in a ~10 km rupture patch, and an earthquake swarm located in a second rupture barrier. Here we investigate whether the inferred variations in frictional behavior along strike affect the rupture processes of 3.0 < M < 4.5 earthquakes by determining source parameters for 100 earthquakes recorded during the OBS deployment.\nUsing waveforms with a 50 Hz sample rate from OBS accelerometers, we calculate stress drop using an omega-squared source model, where the weighted average corner frequency is derived from an empirical Green’s function (EGF) method. We obtain seismic moment by fitting the omega-squared source model to the low frequency amplitude of individual spectra and account for attenuation using Q obtained from a velocity model through the foreshock zone. To ensure well-constrained corner frequencies, we require that the Brune [1970] model provides a statistically better fit to each spectral ratio than a linear model and that the variance is low between the data and model. To further ensure that the fit to the corner frequency is not influenced by resonance of the OBSs, we require a low variance close to the modeled corner frequency. Error bars on corner frequency were obtained through a grid search method where variance is within 10% of the best-fit value. Without imposing restrictive selection criteria, slight variations in corner frequencies from rupture patches and rupture barriers are not discernable. Using well-constrained source parameters, we find an average stress drop of 5.7 MPa in the aftershock zone compared to values of 2.4 and 2.9 MPa in the foreshock and swarm zones respectively. The higher stress drops in the rupture patch compared to the rupture barriers reflect systematic differences in along strike fault zone properties on Gofar transform fault.",

In this paper, we proposed the improved LST estimation model based on the one-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE). The shadow and surface tilts effects were combined into the model. Using the Chang'E (CE-1) DEM data from the Laser Altimeter (LA), the topographic effect can be estimated with an improved effective solar irradiance (ESI) model. In Fig. 1, the highest LST of the global Moon has been estimated with the spatial resolution of 1 degree /pixel, applying the solar albedo data derived from Clementine UV-750nm in solving the PDE function. The topographic effect is significant in the LST map. It can be identified clearly the maria, highland, and craters. The maximum daytime LST presents at the regions with low albedo, i.g. mare Procellarum, mare Serenitatis and mare Imbrium. The results are consistent with the Diviner’s measurements of the LRO mission. Fig. 2 shows the temperature variations at the center of the disk in one year, assuming the Moon to be standard spherical. The seasonal variation of LST at the equator is about 10K. The highest LST occurs in early May. Fig.1. Estimated maximum surface temperatures of the global Moon in spatial resolution of 1 degree /pixel",

These standards include the Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions, the Data Access Protocol (DAP) and various Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards such as WMS and WCS. The UAF has also worked to create a unified access point for scientific data access through THREDDS and ERDDAP catalogs. A significant effort was made by the UAF project to build a catalog-crawling tool that was designed to crawl remote catalogs, analyze their content and then build a clean catalog that 1) represented only CF compliant data; 2) provided a uniform set of access services and 3) where possible, aggregated data in time. That catalog is available at\nhttp://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/geoide/geoIDECleanCatalog.html\n.\n\nAlthough this tool has proved immensely valuable in allowing the UAF project to create a high quality data catalog, the need for a catalog evaluation service or tool to operate on a more local level also exists. Many programs that generate data of interest to the public are recognizing the utility and power of using the THREDDS data server (TDS) to serve that data. However, for some groups that lack the resources to maintain dedicated IT personnel, it can be difficult to set up a properly configured TDS. \n\nThe TDS catalog evaluating service that is under development and will be discussed in this presentation is an effort, through the UAF project, to bridge that gap. Based upon the power of the original UAF catalog cleaner, the web evaluator will have the ability to scan and crawl a local TDS catalog, evaluate the contents for compliance with CF standards, analyze the services offered, and identify datasets where possible temporal aggregation would benefit data access. The results of the catalog evaluator will guide the configuration of the dataset in TDS to ensure that it meets the standards as promoted by the UAF framework.",

            "abstract": "The resistance to CO2 diffusion inside leaves (mesophyll resistance; rm) during photosynthesis is often comparable in magnitude to stomatal diffusion resistance, and varies among species and across environmental conditions. Consequently, photosynthesis is strongly limited by rm at low internal CO2 partial pressures, such that its variation may determine patterns of leaf water-use efficiency (WUE). Reduction in stomatal conductance with drought typically increases WUE, but also decreases photosynthesis. In theory, the decrease in photosynthesis could be countered by reduction in rm while maintaining high WUE. It is still uncertain how drought-related changes in rm affect short- and long-term WUE strategies of different tree species.\nWe conducted field observations of instantaneous WUE and 13C discrimination in two dominant conifer species (Pinus contorta and Picea engelmannii) in SE Wyoming over the seasonal dry-down period in the summer of 2015. rm was examined by on-line 13C discrimination using isotope laser spectroscopy. Controlled environment studies on three conifer species (P. contorta, P. engelmannii, and Abies lasiocarpa) and one angiosperm (Populus tremuloides) are in progress. We hypothesize that the plasticity of rm in response to drought accounts for significant adjustments in photosynthetic capacity and WUE. Needle leaf conifers are known to have relatively high rm, and we expect them to show greater improvements in photosynthesis and WUE when rm is decreased compared to angiosperm tree species.",

Analysis of the observations revealed that mountains had a significant effect on the vertical distribution of ozone. Ozone depletion events were observed when air that had spent significant time near to the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean reached Eureka. This air arrived at Eureka by flowing over the surrounding mountains. Surface level ozone depletion events were not observed during periods when mountains blocked the flow of air from over the sea ice. In the case of blocking there was an enhancement in the amount of ozone near the surface as air from the mid troposphere descended in the lee of the mountains. Three case studies will be presented.",

            "abstract": "It is never too early to bring in your own research into teaching. Considerable efforts have been made globally to introduce STEM research themes in K12 environments. These efforts a laudable as they help to create STEM identity in students and get students excited to pursue higher education. The task of a post-secondary educator is to build on that excitement and ensure that the students who enter higher education come out knowledgeable, skilled, and employable. At the University of Alaska Fairbanks we have structured our geospatial curricula to include place-based, independent research projects in several semester-long classes. These class-projects serve as mini capstone research experiences that take a student through the entire process of research including: identifying a problem or need; building a hypothesis; formulating the science question; searching, acquiring, and processing data; analyzing and interpreting the research results; and presenting the outcomes in written and oral format to a peer group. Over a decade of experience has shown that students tend to engage and perform well when the research addresses an authentic problem they can relate to and take ownership of. Over 150 student-lead class projects using a variety of freely available datasets have contributed not only to preparing the future workforce, but also to enhancing the research profile of UAF. We extended the same model to a summer internship program where graduate students who have gone through the experience of an in-class research project serve as mentors for undergraduate interns. Even the condensed time frame yields positive outcomes including joint publications between faculty, staff, graduate students and undergraduate students in the peer-reviewed literature.",

            "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an ancient enzyme widespread among bacteria, archaea, and eukarya that catalyzes the following reaction: CO2 + H2O ⇌ HCO3- + H+. Its functions are critical for key cellular processes such as concentrating CO2 for autotrophic growth, pH regulation, and pathogen survival in hosts. Currently, there are six known CA classes (α, β, γ, δ, η, ζ) arising from several distinct evolutionary lineages. CA are widespread in sequenced genomes, with many organisms containing multiple classes of CA or multiple CA of the same class. Soils host rich microbial communities with diverse and important ecological functions, but the diversity and abundance of CA in soils has not been explored. CA appears to play an important, but poorly understood, role in some biogeochemical cycles such as those of CO2 and its oxygen isotope composition and also carbonyl sulfide (COS), which are potential tracers in predictive carbon cycle models. Recognizing the prevalence and functional significance of CA in soils, we used a combined bioinformatics and molecular biology approach to address fundamental questions regarding the abundance, diversity, and function of CA in soils.\nTo characterize the abundance and diversity of the different CA classes in soils, we analyzed existing soil metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from the DOE Joint Genome Institute databases. Out of the six classes of CA, we only found the α, β, and γ classes to be present in soils, with the β class being the most abundant. We also looked at genomes of sequenced soil microorganisms to learn what combination of CA classes they contain, from which we can begin to predict the physiological role of CA. To characterize the functional roles of the different CA classes in soils, we collected soil samples from a variety of biomes with diverse chemical and physical properties and quantified the rate of two CA-mediated processes: soil uptake of COS and acceleration of the oxygen isotope exchange between CO2 and H2O. We employed PCR-based methods to quantify the abundance and diversity of CA encoding genes and their expression in our samples to link CA classes to the gas flux data. These studies provide the first survey of CA in soils, a step towards understanding CA’s potentially significant role in microbial survival and microbe-mediated biogeochemical cycles.",

            "abstract": "Gases from anthropogenic sources have the potential to have a profound impact on air quality. Emissions from large cattle feedlots and ONG (Oil and Natural Gas) sites are comprised of NH3 (ammonia) and C2H6 (ethane) as pollutants. C2H6 contributes to photochemical ozone (O3) production and oxidation production of HCHO (formaldehyde). NH3 is a major source for reactive nitrogen to form particulate matter 2.5, which negatively affects human health. NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), emitted during combustion, is considered a large-scale pollutant and contributes to the formation of O3. Deploying an innovative suite of remote sensing instruments in a mobile laboratory, a Multi Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometer (MAX-DOAS), a UV-Vis Spectrometer, and a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer, we obtain mobile column measurements at high spatial and temporal resolution, 2 seconds for the UV-Vis and IR spectrometers and 20 seconds for the MAX-DOAS. Within the scope of the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE) we measure total columns of HCHO, NO2, NH3, and C2H6 using the University of Colorado mobile laboratory. Emissions of urban areas, agriculture, and ONG sites were studied. For the measurement of total columns the solar occultation flux method has been applied. We measured significant variability in the columns. The measurement of total columns allows one to determine the emission flux and source strength when driving a closed box around or upwind and downwind of a source with the mobile laboratory. We present results from select research drives.",

            "abstract": "In-situ bioremediation is a commonly used remediation technology to clean up the subsurface of petroleum-contaminated sites. Forecasting remedial performance (in terms of flux and mass reduction) is a challenge due to uncertainties associated with source properties and the uncertainties associated with contribution and efficiency of concentration reducing mechanisms. In this study, predictive uncertainty analysis of bio-remediation system efficiency is carried out with the null-space Monte Carlo (NSMC) method which combines the calibration solution-space parameters with the ensemble of null-space parameters, creating sets of calibration-constrained parameters for input to follow-on remedial efficiency.\nThe first step in the NSMC methodology for uncertainty analysis is model calibration. The model calibration was conducted by matching simulated BTEX concentration to a total of 48 observations from historical data before implementation of treatment. Two different bio-remediation designs were then implemented in the calibrated model. The first consists in pumping/injection wells and the second in permeable barrier coupled with infiltration across slotted piping. The NSMC method was used to calculate 1000 calibration‐constrained parameter sets for the two different models. Several variants of the method were implemented to investigate their effect on the efficiency of the NSMC method. The first variant implementation of the NSMC is based on a single calibrated model. In the second variant, models were calibrated from different initial parameter sets. NSMC calibration-constrained parameter sets were sampled from these different calibrated models. We demonstrate that in context of nonlinear model, second variant avoids to underestimate parameter uncertainty which may lead to a poor quantification of predictive uncertainty.\nApplication of the proposed approach to manage bioremediation of groundwater in a real site shows that it is effective to provide support in management of the in-situ bioremediation systems. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the NSMC method provides a computationally efficient and practical methodology of utilizing model predictive uncertainty methods in environmental management.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_poster_coral_151211_upload.pdf\nGlobal climate models and instrumental datasets often disagree regarding sea surface temperature (SST) trends in the tropical Pacific. Coral Sr/Ca records with sub-seasonal resolution provide SST proxies that complement and extend limited instrumental records. We present a new partially replicated Sr/Ca-SST record from two Galápagos corals (Isla Wolf, at 1°24’N, 91°48’W), that spans 1937-2010. The record shows high SST variance in the region, which increases nearly twofold after the late 1970s. Similarly, there is little trend in the mean until 1976, after which SSTs warm during all seasons. Both the increase in variance and the trend are strongest during the warm season, leading to progressively more anomalous conditions during El Niño events. To investigate recent changes in the eastern equatorial Pacific since the 1976/1977 climate transition, we compare the Galápagos record to a published coral Sr/Ca-SST record from Clipperton Atoll (10°18’N, 109°13’W, spanning 1874-1993; Wu et al., 2014, Palaeogeogr. Palaeoclimatol. Palaeoecol.). As in the Galápagos, Clipperton corals show increasing SSTs in all seasons after 1976. The trend at Clipperton is greater than in the Galápagos, though the variance is smaller and does not change significantly throughout the record. Finally, the north-south temperature gradient between Clipperton and Galápagos has increased slightly over the interval in which the two records overlap (1937-1993). Gridded instrumental SST data generally agree with the coral Sr/Ca-SST results, though the gridded data suggest lower variance at both sites. In sum, we show that an increase in the mean and variance of SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific is associated with an enhanced meridional SST gradient over the twentieth century, and especially since 1976. These results contrast with recent suggestions that a weakened meridional SST gradient in the equatorial Pacific may be leading to stronger El Niño events. Our results support the consensus that the 1976/1977 climate transition was a key turning point in the state of the tropical Pacific.",

            "abstract": "On 25 April 2015, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal. Subsequently many large aftershocks shook the region, including one of magnitude 7.3. Much damage occurred and over 4000 landslides were triggered, but fortunately few earthquake effects on glacier lakes have been identified and no large glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) have been clearly attributed to the quakes. Why were the lakes largely unscathed? We will (1) review some cases around the world where earthquakes have apparently triggered responses among glaciers and glacier- or moraine-dammed lakes, and how these responses took place, (2) consider why earthquakes in general might not commonly have such large impacts on glacial lakes as widely expected; (3) show some case examples of glacial moraine-dammed lakes in Nepal and Tibet where few visible effects of the Gorkha earthquake (and aftershocks) were documented; and (4) consider why specifically the Gorkha earthquake (+ aftershocks) caused very few and mild effects.\nEarthquake shaking and steep slopes result in thousands of landslides when big earthquakes occur in mountains; furthermore, large mass movements into glacial lakes are a known trigger of many GLOFs. Worldwide there is little evidence, contrary to speculation, and now reinforced by the Gorkha quake, that earthquakes—even big ones happening near glacier lakes—are normally a major trigger of GLOFs. There may be several explanations. The Gorkha earthquake might have caused less shaking than its total released energy suggests, thus further sparing the Himalayan lakes from catastrophe.\nA possible further protective aspect is that glacial lakes mainly occur far up alpine valleys. It is known from other quakes that when there is shallow slip and rugged relief, surface wave modes tend to be absorbed and scattered as these waves propagate across mountain ranges, and body waves are focused into ridges, thus reducing the ground accelerations on valley floors (where lakes occur) and commonly increasing ground accelerations along some ridges. Extreme Himalayan relief may accentuate topographic control of wave scattering and amplitude diminution/enhancement known from other regions having less extreme relief. Although future big earthquakes occurring near glacial lakes remain a threat, climate change may contribute more to the threat of GLOFs.",

WRF-Chem captured the temporal and spatial variations of meteorological fields, trace gases, and aerosol loadings. Surface shortwave radiation changes due to the aerosol direct effect (ADE) were calculated and compared with data from six World Radiation Data Center (WRDC) stations. The comparison indicated that WRF-Chem can simulate the surface short wave radiation moderately well, with temporal correlations between 0.4 and 0.7, and high biases between 9 to 120 W/m2. Domain-wide, WRF-Chem showed a decrease of 22 W/m2 in surface SW radiation due to the aerosol direct effect, consistent with observational studies. The ADE demonstrates diverse influences on air quality in East Asian. For example, the surface concentration of PM2.5 increases in eastern China (~11.1%) due to ADE, but decreases in central China (-7.3%), western China (-8.8%), and Sichuan Basin (-4%). Surface 1-hour maximum ozone is reduced by 2.3%, owing to less radiation reaching the surface due to the ADE. Since PM2.5 pollution raises serious public concern in China, regulations that control the emissions of PM2.5 and its precursors have been implemented. We investigate the impact of reducing two different types of aerosols, sulfate (scattering) and black carbon (absorbing), by cutting 80% of SO2 and black carbon (BC) emissions in two sensitivity simulations. We found that reducing SO2 emissions results in the decline of PM2.5 as much as 16mg/m3 in eastern China, and 20mg/m3 in the Sichuan Basin. Reducing the BC emissions by the same percentage causes the PM2.5 to decrease as much as 40mg/m3 in eastern China, and 25mg/m3 in the Sichuan Basin. The monthly averaged surface 1-hour maximum ozone increases 3.1ppb in eastern China, and 4.3ppb in the Sichuan Basin with reduced BC emissions. However, there is minimal reduction of ozone with less SO2 emission.",

            "abstract": "WEC-Sim is an open source code to model wave energy converters performance in operational waves, developed by Sandia and NREL and funded by the US DOE. The code is a time-domain modeling tool developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using the multibody dynamics solver SimMechanics, and solves the WEC’s governing equations of motion using the Cummins time-domain impulse response formulation in 6 degrees of freedom.\nThe WEC-Sim code has undergone verification through code-to-code comparisons; however validation of the code has been limited to publicly available experimental data sets. While these data sets provide preliminary code validation, the experimental tests were not explicitly designed for code validation, and as a result are limited in their ability to validate the full functionality of the WEC-Sim code. Therefore, dedicated physical model tests for WEC-Sim validation have been performed.\nThis presentation provides an overview of the WEC-Sim validation experimental wave tank tests performed at the Oregon State University’s Directional Wave Basin at Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory. Phase 1 of experimental testing was focused on device characterization and completed in Fall 2015. Phase 2 is focused on WEC performance and scheduled for Winter 2015/2016. These experimental tests were designed explicitly to validate the performance of WEC-Sim code, and its new feature additions. Upon completion, the WEC-Sim validation data set will be made publicly available to the wave energy community.\nFor the physical model test, a controllable model of a floating wave energy converter has been designed and constructed. The instrumentation includes state-of-the-art devices to measure pressure fields, motions in 6 DOF, multi-axial load cells, torque transducers, position transducers, and encoders. The model also incorporates a fully programmable Power-Take-Off system which can be used to generate or absorb wave energy.\nNumerical simulations of the experiments using WEC-Sim will be presented. These simulations highlight the code features included in the latest release of WEC-Sim (v1.2), including: wave directionality, nonlinear hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, user-defined wave elevation time-series, state space radiation, and WEC-Sim compatibility with BEMIO (open source AQWA/WAMI/NEMOH coefficient parser).",

Halogen concentrations and its ratios in the glasses are important to understand the mantle metasomatism and volatile recycling.\n52 of the collected glasses are “primitive” (higher than 6 wt% MgO), while 3 of them have rather “evolved” composition (MgO wt% of 1.72, 2.95 and 4.15). K2O concentrations and Th/Sc ratios in the glasses show a negative correlation with its MgO concentration. Incompatible element ratios such as La/Sm are rather immobile during a magma differentiation so the ratios are important to understand mantle composition (Hofmann et al. 2003). La/Sm ratios in the glasses are 0.95 ~ 3.28 suggesting that the AAR basalts can be classified into T-MORB and E-MORB (Schilling et al., 1983). La/Sm ratios are well-correlated with incompatible elements such as U, Ba, Nb, and negatively correlated with compatible elements such as Sc, Eu2+, Mg.\nThe AAR glasses contain detectable halogen elements. The “KR1 mixing” glasses in halogen elements are more abundant than “in-axis” the glasses. Cl is the least variable element compared to the other halogens such as Br and I in the AAR. The “KR1 mixing” glasses have the largest variations of Br/Cl ratios compared to the “in-axis” glasses. The Cl/Br and Th/Sc ratios in the “in-axis” glasses and in the “KR1 mixing” glasses show positive and negative correlations, respectively. The Br-rich glasses in the “KR1 mixing” zone might be explained by a recycled Br-rich oceanic slab of paleo-subduction or by a hydrothermal alteration in the AAR. I composition in the glasses does not show a correlation other trace elements.\nThe K/Cl and K/Ti ratios in the AAR glasses are similar to the basalts from the Galapagos Spreading Center (Geldmacher et al., 2010) and Pacific MORB. The AAR region closely located with Balleny hotspot (Lanyon et al., 1993) and Pacific-Antarctic Ridge. K2O/Nb and Zr/Nb ratios are very low compared with near Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and Southeast Indian Ridge. The ratios are close to the Balleny hotspot.",

            "abstract": "A lot of effort have been put into recovering gas hydrate, methane induced carbonate, and associated sediments in order to develop the geologic model of gas hydrate accumulation and evaluate its possible environmental impact for the last glacial-interglacial cycles. Having investigated gas hydrate occurrences in the eastern margin of Japan Sea revealed wide distributions of chimney-shape gas hydrate concentrations beneath the seafloor, confirmed off Shimane and off Akita/Yamagata as well as off Joetsu (Niigata), which are quite different from the occurrences of pore space hydrate filling intergranular pore systems of sands recognized in Nankai Trough, Mallik and other sites.\nMany sediment samples have been obtained below from the Umitaka Spur, Joetsu Channel, Toyama Trough, Mogami Trough and Okushiri Ridge areas. Small amounts of sandy sediment have been retrieved as thin intercalations in Holocene and Pleistocene silty/muddy layers, where trace fossils and strong bioturbations are commonly observed. Sandy sediments consist of very fine- to fine-grained sand grains, and are sometimes tuffaceous. Pore-size distribution measurements and thin-section observations of these sands were carried out, which indicate that porosities of silty sediments are around 50 % but those of arenites range from 42 to 52 %, of which mean pore sizes and permeabilities are larger than those of silty sediments. These coarser sediments might have been transported approximately around 3 to 30 ka due to the tephra ages, where supplying sediments might be abundant due to sea level fluctuation during the Pleistocene ice age.\nSandy sediments contain not only detrital quartz and feldspar but mafic minerals (pyroxene, amphibole and mica), contents of which may indicate their provenances. Silty/muddy sediments usually contain diatom tests, foraminifers and framboidal pyrites, and, in particular, the shapes of diatom are usually various, dominantly fragmental and infrequently preserved. It is remarked that physical diagenesis proceeds first due to mechanical compaction, whereas chemical diagenesis advances very slowly in early diagenesis.\nThis study was performed as a part of the MH21 Research Consortium on methane hydrate in Japan and the METI project entitled “FY2014 promoting research and development on methane hydrate.”",

The instrument is deployed regularly onboard the NASA ER2 high-altitude aircraft, which is an ideal testbed for satellite remote sensing. Flying at 20 km altitude, AirMSPI’s pushbroom camera typically provides 11×11 km images at 10 m resolution. The target is observed from multiple along-track angles within ±67° using a gimbal mount. Eight spectral bands within 355-935 nm are recorded simultaneously in different detector rows, 3 of which also measure linear polarization: 470, 660 and 865 nm. Photoelastic modulators (PEMs) encode the polarized and total intensities in each polarimetric pixel as the amplitude and offset of a wavelike intensity pattern, such that the ratio of the two is insensitive to pixel-to-pixel differences. This enables an accuracy in the degree of linear polarization of ~0.001, as measured in the lab. To maintain this accuracy in-flight, an optical probe continuously monitors the PEMs’ retardances and controls their driving signals. Before and after observing a target, the instrument also observes a validator, which is an extended, polarized light source, located inside the instrument housing. These data are now incorporated in the data processing pipeline to further improve the calibration of the modulation functions. Highly polarized pixels in Earth data are utilized to transfer the validator results to meet the illumination in Earth scenes, as well as to make fine adjustments at higher temporal resolution. The reprocessed polarization products for the PODEX campaign show significant improvements when intercompared with the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP, Goddard Institute for Space Studies). We currently evaluate the impact of the on-board polarimetric calibration on aerosol retrievals, and compare against AERONET reference measurements.",

A two-phase, 1D hydrothermal model demonstrates the importance of groundwater flow in heat flux advection near the ice-bed interface. Typical, conservative vertical groundwater volume fluxes on the order of +/- 1-10 mm/yr can alter vertical heat flux by +/- 50-500 mW/m2 that could produce considerable volumes of meltwater depending on basin geometry and geothermal heat production. A 1D hydromechanical model demonstrates that during ice advance groundwater is mainly recharged into saturated sedimentary aquifers and during retreat groundwater discharges into the ice-bed interface, potentially contributing to subglacial water budgets on the order of 0.1-1 mm/yr during ice retreat. A map of most-likely elevated heat production provinces, estimated sedimentary basin depths, and radar-derived bed roughness are compared together to delineate areas of greatest potential to ice sheet instability in East Antarctica. Finally, a 2D numerical model of crustal fluid and heat flow typical to recently estimated sedimentary basins under the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is coupled to a 2.5D Full Stokes ice sheet model (with simple basal hydrology) to test for the sensitivity of hydrodynamic processes on ice sheet dynamics. Preliminary results show that the enhanced fluid flow can dramatically alter the basal heating of the ice and its temperature profile, as well as, the sliding rate, which heavily alter ice dynamics.",

High-resolution synchrotron X-ray microtomography was used to measure air-water interfacial area at multiple wetting-phase saturations for natural sand. Analysis of the raw and processed image data with advanced visualization tools revealed the presence of air-water interface associated with macroscopic features such as pits and crevices on the surfaces of the solids.

            "abstract": "Naturally-occurring isotopes are useful tracers of fluid mixing in complex natural systems, and have been applied towards evaluating the sources of elevated total dissolved solids in water produced from unconventional oil and gas operations. Prior investigations showed that elevated Li in saline waters co-produced with natural gas during Marcellus Shale development resulted from mixing of hydraulic fracturing fluid (HFF) and Li-rich formation water. However, specific contributions to the Li isotope signature from reactions between the HFF and shale remained unclear. This study focused on HFF-shale reactions that could affect the Li budget and isotope composition in Marcellus Shale produced water in a series of flow through experiments conducted at fixed temperature and pressure (66oC, 20MPa) comparable to formation conditions. Synthetic HFF was prepared by mixing either freshwater or a lab-derived saline water with chemical additives commonly used in hydraulic fracturing. Outcrop cores of Marcellus Shale were artificially fractured either parallel to or perpendicular to bedding prior to loading into the flow-through apparatus, and each experiment was performed with a unique HFF composition continuously pumped through a fresh core (15 cm in length, 3.8 cm in diameter). Initial fluid and cumulative effluents collected after 2 days and 7 days from the start of the experiment were measured for concentrations of cations and anions. Multi-collector ICP-MS was used to measure lithium isotope ratios (δ7Li).\nPreliminary results show that dissolution of carbonate minerals occurred in both replicate experiments with freshwater-based HFF (pH 2) as shown by a large decrease in Li/Ca from 0.8 (initial fluid) to 0.003 (effluents on day 2 and day 7) with no significant change in Li concentration. This is consistent with low Li in carbonate cement (<2%) and water soluble (<8%) and exchangeable (<2%) fractions of Marcellus Shale. Variation in δ7Li values is within analytical uncertainty (2SD=1‰) in comparison to an increase of at least 3‰ (from 1st day to >45 days after production) in produced water samples from the field. Results to date suggest that HFF-shale reactions have a minimal effect on the Li isotopic signature of Marcellus Shale produced waters.",

            "abstract": "There are thought to be three main rheological regimes exhibited within granular media in the presence of shear stress, each dependent on a dimensionless number, I, representing the relative values of collisional stress between grains and confining stress. At slow shear rates, when I<<1, the granular flow is in the quasi-static regime, and shear stress is supported elastically through multi-grain networks (force-chains). At high shear rates, when I>>1, the flow is in the grain-inertial regime, and shear stress is supported through the transfer of momentum occurring in grain-to-grain collisions.\nExperiments conducted using a torsional rheometer found that at intermediate shear velocities, where I approaches 1, force-chain collapse in angular sand samples produces sound waves capable of vibrating the shear zone enough to cause compaction (van der Elst et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2007). Whether or not a granular mixture exhibits this auto-acoustic compaction effect during flow has been observed to be dependent on angularity, grain size, sorting, and mineral strength: more angular grains produce more noise and compact more at intermediate shear velocities than spherical grains do, and smaller angular grains produce more noise and compact more than larger angular grains. We use the same experimental set up to explore the relative importance of the effects of angularity and grain size, comparing various grain sizes and sorting in both spherical and angular granular mixtures.\nAccurate assessment of the effect of angularity and grain size on rheology of granular flow will serve as a helpful predictive tool for modeling granular processes including landslides, rockslides, fault ruptures, and desert dune migrations. Grain size and shape can vary greatly system-to-system but are also often easy to observe in the field. We hope to be able to use these types of small scale grain observations to form predictions about the behavior of the larger scale process of which they are a part.",

            "abstract": "The Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) is one of the largest igneous provinces (LIPs) on Earth (e.g. Coffin and Eldholm, 1994), covering an area five times that of the Japanese Islands. Moreover, studies describing the OJP as “the single largest oceanic plateau” (Taylor, 2006) and “Ontong Java Nui” (Chandler et al, 2012) suggest a much larger “original” OJP. The formation of such a huge feature does not fit plate tectonic theory, and no formation model explains all existing observations from the OJP. Formation of the OJP affected not only the solid Earth, but also the Earth’s environment. To understand its formation and environmental impacts, investigation of the crustal structure of the OJP is important. To date, crustal thickness has been ambiguous because values varied according to survey method. For example, seismic (e.g. Furumoto et al., 1976) and gravity (e.g. Sandwell and Renkin, 1988) methods yielded thicknesses of 35-42 km and 25 km, respectively. A seismic experiment using a large volume seismic source and ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) yielded a Moho depth of 35 km for the southernmost OJP via traveltime forward modeling (Miura et al., 2004), and an inversion analysis (Korenaga, 2011) showed similar results. To better understand the central OJP, we conducted an active source seismic experiment in 2010 using a large volume airgun array and 100 OBSs spaced every 5 km (Miura et al., 2011). Preliminary results with first arrival traveltime tomography and forward modeling have been reported previously (Miura et al., 2013). Recently, we applied traveltime inversion analysis (Fujie et al., 2013), incorporating the uncertainty approach of Korenaga (2011), for velocity structure modeling, especially for the depth of the Moho beneath OJP. Our analysis shows the greatest Moho depth at the center of the OJP. We will report on our latest results and propose a mechanism for formation of the OJP.",

            "abstract": "JAMSTEC has developed temperature and pressure simulator for ocean-bottom and bore-hole observatories in 2010, which is mainly composed of temperature chamber and hydraulic pressure standard. We call this equipment “environment simulator”. Temperature chamber is capable to control its target temperature from -10 to 180 ℃, hence it is supposed for ocean-bottom to bore-hole environment. Pressure standard in which the dead weight is mounded on the piston-cylinder module produces the reference pressure up to 100 MPa (ca. 10,000 meters deep), which makes it possible to apply the constant pressure to the pressure sensors via the hydraulic pressure tube. Thus, our environment simulator can demonstrate ocean-bottom or bore-hole environment in the laboratory. The main purpose of the pressure simulator is to evaluate long-term pressure sensor’s stability, i.e., sensor’s drift by applying the constant pressure under the constant temperature. Here, we introduce two applications of our environment simulator.\nThe first application is to evaluate the initial behavior of pressure sensors to be used in the Dense Ocean-floor Network system for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) in the Nankai Trough, Japan. DONET pressure sensors have been deployed in order for detection of not only tsunami but also crustal deformation. We applied 20 MPa pressure under 2 ℃ temperature to the pressure sensors for one month before deploying into the deep-sea. As a result, the initial sensor drift of 5 hPa per month in maximum was measured. The second application is to provide the reference pressure to the mobile pressure sensor which is designed for the in-situ calibration for the pressure sensors being in operation. We have developed the in-situ pressure calibration tool equipped with the high precision pressure sensor. The concept is that we carry the reference pressure to the on-site to calibrate the pressure sensor. Before carrying it to the deep-sea, the reference pressure is given to the mobile pressure sensor by our environment simulator. Temperature dependencies have been also evaluated by changing the temperature under the constant pressure. Thus, our environment simulator has contributed to some applications in terms of pressure sensors for long-term monitoring of crustal deformation in the ocean.",

            "abstract": "Residual contamination of soils, sediments and groundwater by uranium milling operations presents a lingering problem at former mill sites throughout the upper Colorado River Basin in the western USA. Remedial strategies predicated upon natural flushing by low uranium recharge waters have frequently failed to achieve target concentrations set by national and state regulators. Flushing times of tens of years have often yielded negligible decreases in groundwater uranium concentrations, with extrapolated trends suggesting multiple decades or longer may be required to achieve regulatory goals. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Rifle, Colorado field site serves as a natural laboratory for investigating the underlying causes for uranium plume persistence, with recent studies there highlighting the important role that surface water-groundwater interactions play in sustaining uranium delivery to the aquifer. Annual snowmelt-driven increases in Colorado River discharge induce 1-2 m excursions in groundwater elevation at the Rifle site, which enables residual tailings-contaminated materials (so-called Supplemental Standards) to become hydrologically connected to the aquifer for short periods of time during peak discharge. The episodic contact between shallow groundwater and residual contamination leads to abrupt 20-fold increases in groundwater uranium concentration, which serve to seasonally replenish the plume given the location of the Supplemental Standards along the upgradient edge of the aquifer. Uranium isotope composition changes abruptly as uranium concentrations increase reflecting the contribution of a temporally distinct contaminant reservoir. The release of uranium serves to potentially replenish organic matter rich sediments located within the alluvial aquifer at downstream locations, which have been postulated to serve as a parallel contributor to plume persistence following the uptake, immobilization, and slow re-oxidation of uranium.",

However, whether the clay mineralogy could also reserve millennial-scale climatic change is still poorly understood, because clay minerals usually produced through the long-term chemical weathering are not sensitive to the fast environmental change. This study presents the high-resolution clay mineralogy of three high-quality sediment cores, which were retrieved from a transect on the continental slope of the northern South China Sea during the cruise of MD190 (2012). Our results show that time series changes of clay mineral assemblages display a clear occurrence of millennial-scale climatic change events, such as Younger Dryas, Bolling-Allerod, and Heinrich events 1-6. The reconstructed relative contributions of clay minerals from their source areas of Taiwan and Luzon are closely related to the millennial-scale climatic changes, while the clay mineral contribution from the source area of the Pearl River presents a relationship to the sea level change. Following the transect with increasing water depths, the Pearl River contribution decreases, whereas the Taiwan and Luzon contributions present more complex changes, and the millennial-scale climatic change signals are also gradually strengthened. The Luzon/Taiwan contribution ratio is used for the proxy of the millennial-scale paleoclimate evolution. The lower ratio presents colder events, while the high ratio indicates warmer periods. The distinct downslope strengthening millennial-scale climatic change indicates that deepwater sediments in the South China Sea could well reserve fast climatic change events that usually occurred in high latitudes.",

            "abstract": "For the last 30 years Villarrica volcano has shown persistent degassing and mild strombolian activity taking place at the lava lake located inside its crater. This activity exhibited changes in the magnitud of the strombolian explosions, levels of the lava lake, and gas emission rates. In February 2014, a six-component infrasound array was installed 8 km to the NW of the summit in order to acquire a long-term record of the acoustics associated with the explosive activity originated at Villarrica’s crater. Visual observations from the crater rim and acoustic data show that in 2014 the activity at Villarrica was relatively low and began to increase at the beginning of February 2015. Between January and early March of 2015 four complementary three-component infrasound arrays were deployed between 4 and 9 km from the crater. Villarrica volcano erupted on March 3rd, 2015, exhibiting a >1000 m high lava fountain, scoria flows, snow-ice avalanches and lahars, among other phenomena. The eruption was preceded by 25 minutes of strombolian explosions that gradually increased in magnitud and frequency until they turned into the lava fountain. The data collected with the infrasound arrays are used to identify changes in explosive activity as well as the flow of at least three lahars. Analysis of the amplitude, number of events, waveform and frequency content of the acoustic signal show small and/or short (hours to days) variations in the persistent explosive activity of Villarrica’s lava lake during 2014. The short (~27 days) increased level of activity and subsequent eruption may be interpreted as the result of a relatively gas-rich magma intruding into the upper plumbing system. ",

            "abstract": "Modern management needs, such as water supply, quality, and ecosystem protection place numerous demands on instream flows. Many regions are interested in developing numeric flow criteria as a way of ensuring maintenance of flow patterns that protect biological resources while meeting other demands. Developing flow criteria requires the capacity to generate reliable time series of the daily flow at any stream reach of interest and to relate flow patterns to biological indicators of stream health. Most stream reaches are not gaged, and it is impractical to develop detailed models for all reaches where flow alteration needs to be evaluated. We present a novel mechanistic approach to efficiently predict flows and flow alteration at all ungaged stream locations within a region of interest.\nWe used an “ensemble approach” whereby a series of regionally representative models were developed and calibrated. New sites of interest are assigned to one of the ensemble models based on similarity of catchment properties. For southern California, we selected 43 gaged sites representing the range of geomorphology, and watershed characteristics of streams in the region. For each gaged site, we developed a hydrologic model (HEC-HMS) to predict daily flows for a period representing dry, wet and normal precipitation. The final goal is to relate flow alterations to ecological responses, the models were calibrated to three separate performance metrics that reflect conditions important for instream biological communities- proportion of low flow days, flashiness and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency for overall model performance. We cross-validated the models using a “jack-knife” approach. Models were assigned to novel 840 bioassessment sites based on the results of a Random Forest model that identified catchment properties that most affected the runoff patterns. Daily flow data for existing and “reference conditions” was simulated for a 23-year period for current and reference (undeveloped) conditions. The resulting hydrologic changes will be analyzed relative to changes in instream biological community structure across a gradient of disturbance in order to develop recommended flow criteria. Ultimately, we will provide a tool that can be used to evaluate the ecological response of change in hydrology across any region of interest.",

In particular, roughness influences the distribution of the parameters conventionally used to describe fault slip in, for example, kinematic modeling of strong ground motion. We explore the effect of the fault roughness on earthquake source parameters through the statistical analysis of a large suite of 3D rupture simulations. We have built a database of more than 1000 simulated dynamic ruptures based on different rough fault profiles and relative-strength (S) ratios, and have quantitatively analyzed the correlation between earthquake source parameter pairs.. In the subshear propagation-speed regime, we find the following relationships: (1) Rise time, total slip and peak slip rate each decrease with increasing roughness. (2) Rupture velocity is weakly positively related to slip, and the relationship is stronger with increasing roughness. We also explore how peak slip rate, rise time and different pairs of source parameters correlations are affected by fault roughness. This work may give useful guidance for use in kinematic rupture-source generators and help improve methods for ground strong motion prediction.",

A commonly used approximation states that all ULF wave power can be assumed to be in a single mode number, usually m=1 or m=2. We use cross-spectrogram phase-differences between multiple pairs of satellites to get an estimate of m and we find that the distribution of power in the various mode numbers can be considerably different than this approximation at times; we also find a dependence of the m-distribution of power on geomagnetic conditions and on local time, with geomagnetically active times and midnight-side magnetosphere favoring higher mode numbers. We use these results in a particle tracing simulation that includes analytic expressions for the ULF waves, and we discuss their implications for radiation belt electrons.",

When a place has young ice, it means that it wasn't too long ago that ice could be made there.

            "abstract": "During its recent flyby of Pluto, New Horizons imaged an icy plains region (Sputnik Planum) whose surface is divided into polygonal blocks, ca. 20-30 km across, bordered by what appear to be shallow troughs. The lack of craters within these plains suggests they are relatively young, implying that the underlying material is recently active. The scale of these features argues against an origin by cooling and contraction. Here we investigate the alternative scenario that they are the surface manifestation of shallow convection in a thick layer of nitrogen ice. Typical Rayleigh-Bernard convective cells are approximately three times wider than the depth of the convecting layer, implying a layer depth of ca. 7-10 km.\nOur convection hypothesis requires that the Rayleigh number exceed a minimum of about 1000 in the nitrogen ice layer. We coupled a parameterized convection model with a temperature dependent rheology of nitrogen ice (Yamashita, 2008), finding a Rayleigh number 1500 to 7500 times critical for a plausible range of heat flows for Pluto’s interior. The computed range of heat flow (3.5-5.2 mW/m2) is consistent with the radiogenic heat generated by a carbonaceous chondrite (CC) core implied by Pluto’s bulk density. The minimum heat flow at the critical Rayleigh number is 0.13 mW/m2.\nOur model implies a core temperature of 44 K in the interior of the convecting layer. This is very close to the exothermic β-α phase transition in nitrogen ice at 35.6 K (for pure N2 ice; dissolved CO can increase this, depending on its concentration), suggesting that the warm cores of the rising convective cells may be β phase, whereas the cooler sinking limbs may be α phase. This transition may thus be observable due to the large difference in their spectral signature.\nFurther applying our model to Pluto’s putative water ice mantle, the heat flow from CC is consistent with convection in Pluto’s mantle and the activity observed on its surface.",

            "abstract": "In January 2015 NASA launched the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) spacecraft. SMAP’s mission was to create high-resolution soil moisture and freeze-thaw products using the combination of an L-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and an L-band radiometer. Two NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) were tasked with distribution of the SMAP data products. The Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) DAAC was tasked to archive and distribute the SMAP radar products. In order to best support distribution of SMAP swath radar products and SMAP users, the ASF DAAC enhanced the DAAC data system in a number of ways that will be detailed in this presentation.\nSMAP radar data are unique for SAR in that they are provided as half-orbit swaths over 1000km wide. This presentation will focus on two primary areas of DAAC support for SMAP. First, the ASF data discovery client, Vertex, has been updated to better support SMAP SAR data. This included enhancements to the user interface to better support swath visualizations as well as increased search capability. Utilizing NASA’s Common Metadata Repository (CMR), Vertex will allow users to download both the Level 1 SAR product as well as the higher-level products that it contributed to. In this way, the distributed nature of the data archives is better abstracted from the user experience and users have quick access to a greater variety of data. Beyond enabling data search, ASF DAAC is also supporting data utilization through the development of polar mosaics using the SAR data. SMAP is able to achieve nearly complete coverage of the Arctic north of 55 degrees every 24 hours. Based on the polarimetric SMAP data, Arctic mosaics are generated each day in geotiff format at a fixed grid spacing to allow for easy incorporation to existing workflows. Prototype ice motion products will also be shown that directly demonstrate the utility of these daily mosaics.",

            "abstract": "Since the discovery of a pervasive shearing till layer underlying Ice Stream B, the scientific community has categorized subglacial diamictons as either deformation till or lodgement till primarily based on shear strength. Deformation till is associated with streaming ice, formed through subglacial deformation of unconsolidated sediments. Lodgement till is believed to be deposited by the plastering of sediment entrained at the base of slow-flowing ice onto a rigid bed. Unfortunately, there has been a paucity of quantitative data on the spatial distribution of shear strength across the continental shelf. Cores collected from the Ross Sea on cruises NBP1502 and NBP9902 provide a rich dataset that can be used to interpret till shear strength variability.\nTill strengths are analyzed within the context of: (1) geologic substrate; (2) water content and other geotechnical properties; (3) ice sheet retreat history; and (4) geomorphic framework. Tills display a continuum of shear strengths rather than a bimodal distribution, suggesting that shear strength cannot be used to distinguish between lodgement and deformation till. Where the substrate below the LGM unconformity is comprised of older lithified deposits, till shear strengths are both highly variable within the till unit, as well as highly variable between cores. Conversely, where ice streams flowed across unconsolidated Plio-Pleistocene deposits, shear strengths are low and less variable within the unit and between cores. This suggests greater homogenization of cannibalized tills, and possibly a deeper pervasive shear layer. Coarser-grained tills are observed on banks and bank slopes, with finer tills in troughs. Highly variable and more poorly sorted tills are found in close proximity to sediment-based subglacial meltwater channels, attesting to a change in ice-bed interaction as subglacial water increases. Pellets (rounded sedimentary clasts of till matrix) are observed in Ross Sea cores, suggesting a history of deformation responsible for pellet formation. Till strength was measured in a variety of environments, including mega-scale lineations and grounding zone wedges; ongoing work focuses on evaluating till shear strengths within a geomorphic context. These analyses are used to re-evaluate till genesis, transport, and characterization.",

            "abstract": "Since 2013 the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) has been measuring spatial and temporal distribution of both snow water equivalent and snow albedo, the two most critical properties for understanding snowmelt runoff and timing, across key basins in the Western US. It is generally understood that net solar radiation (as controlled by variations in snow albedo and irradiance) provides the energy available for melt in almost all snow-covered environments. Until now, sparse measurements have restricted the ability to utilize measured net solar radiation in energy balance models, and current process simulations and model prediction of albedo evolution rely on oversimplifications of the processes. Data from ASO offers the unprecedented opportunity to utilize weekly measurements of spatially extensive spectral snow albedo to constrain and update snow albedo in a distributed snowmelt model for the first time. Here, we first investigate the sensitivity of the snow energy balance model SNOBAL to prescribed changes in snow albedo at two instrumented alpine catchments: at the point scale across 10 years at Senator Beck Basin Study Area in the San Juan Mountains, southwestern Colorado, and at the distributed scale across 25 years at Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho. We then compare distributed energy balance and snowmelt results across the ASO measurement record in the Tuolumne Basin in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, for model runs with and without integrated snow albedo from ASO.",

            "abstract": "The redox sensitivity of cerium (Ce) relative to other rare earth elements (REEs) and its uptake in marine carbonates makes the Ce anomaly (Ce/Ce*) a particularly useful proxy for capturing local redox conditions in the water column. However, although the Ce anomaly is known to be sensitive to detrital inputs, and carbonates are generally vulnerable to multiple styles of post-depositional diagenetic alteration, evaluations of proxy-challenging complications have mostly been limited to ancient carbonates, with few constraints from younger, well-characterized analog facies. Here, we report on analyses of REE concentrations in bulk samples from well-characterized modern marine carbonate samples from the Clino and Unda drill cores in the Bahamas1. These cores sample multiple alterations: 1) meteoric/mixing zone diagenesis, 2) marine burial diagenesis, and 3) dolomitization, which collectively control secondary carbonate mineral transformations. Ce/Ce* = Ce/Pr2/Nd, calcuated using shale-normalized (i.e., PAAS) Ce, Pr, and Nd concentrations, vary with depth in modern seawater, with a range of 0.3 to 0.8 within the top 200 m depth2 and average values of 0.5-0.6 in the upper 200 m. Our results show that the REE patterns in these carbonates are very similar to those of modern seawater, indicating they may reflect primary deposition from seawater. Consistent with this assertion, anomalies in meteorically altered carbonates from the Clino core display values ranging from 0.4 to 0.8. Anomalies in the marine burial zone show larger values with smaller variations (ranging from 0.6 to 0.8) compared to the meteoric zone. This relationship may indicate that the pore fluids in the marine burial zone are more reducing compared to meteoric fluids, or differences in Ce/Ce* can be caused by changes in depositional depth. In Unda core, we observe Ce anomaly variations from an average of 0.65 in the marine burial zone to 0.62 in partially dolomitized zone. Our results, particularly the general agreement with seawater, indicate that the Ce anomaly in shallow marine carbonates has the potential to preserve records of primary deposition even in bulk carbonates with muliple styles of post-depositional diagenetic alteration.\n",

            "abstract": "The difference between precipitation and stream discharge over annual periods provides an indication of the total water loss to evaporation and evapotranspiration. The response of evaporative water loss to land cover change affects groundwater recharge, stream flow, and lake levels. This study examined the watershed water balance for Augusta Creek, which drains a 95-km2 glacial landscape in southwestern Michigan covered by cropland, grassland, forest, and wetlands. The climate is humid and temperate; between 1964-2014 the water-year precipitation averaged 948 mm and ranged from 695-1386 mm with no temporal trend. Over the study period the percentage of land in agriculture has decreased to about a third of its original extent, with abandoned lands gradually transitioning from old fields to woody vegetation. Comparison of precipitation on the upland watershed to baseflow discharge (USGS data; baseflow estimation by WHAT model) across the 50-year record shows that total evaporative water loss averaged 563 + 103 mm and ranged from 385-897 mm, with no apparent trend over the record. The evaporative water loss accounts for a mean + s.d. of 59 + 6% of precipitation (range, 48-70%). Evaporative water loss was positively related to total precipitation (r2 = 0.74. These results are interpreted using a Budyko plot framework to facilitate comparison with other settings. This water balance approach to infer evaporative water loss compares well with direct measurements in the same watershed since 2009 using eddy covariance (grasslands and crops) and soil moisture monitoring by time-domain reflectometry (grasslands, crops, and forest). Thus the evaporative water loss, which is predominantly by evapotranspiration, has been remarkably similar across a period of changing land cover, leaving a relatively consistent proportion for groundwater recharge and streamflow.",

            "abstract": "Significant advancements have been made in hydrodynamic modeling for natural disasters such as floods; however, it is vital to better understand how to effectively communicate risk to promote hazard preparedness. In many poor communities throughout the world, individuals live in areas that are hazardous because of the conditions of both the natural environment and built environment. Furthermore, environmental risks from the natural environment can be exacerbated by human development. Planning, behavioral change, and strategic actions taken by community members can mitigate risk, however, it is critical to first understand the perspective of those who are most vulnerable to (1) better communicate risk and (2) improve hazardous conditions. Thus, the Flood Resilient Infrastructure and Sustainable Environments (FloodRISE) project conducted a household level survey of over 350 participants in Los Laureles Canyon, a colonia in Tijuana, Mexico that is vulnerable to flooding. Preliminary results from the study will be discussed, specifically addressing: (1) the relationship between compounding risk factors, such as flooding and erosion, and (2) data that speaks to next steps for engaging community in the co-generation of local knowledge about flood hazards, and other strategies that contribute to more flood resilient communities.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate reconstructions of different global climate modes over the last 1000 years provide the basis for testing the relative roles of forced and unforced variability climate system, which can help us improve projections of future climate change. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) has been characterized by a combination of persistent La Niña-like conditions, a positive North Atlantic Oscillation (+NAO), and increased Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The northern tropical Atlantic is sensitive to each of these climate patterns, but not all of them have the same regional fingerprint in the modern northern tropical Atlantic. The relative influence of different processes related to these climate patterns can help us better understand regional responses to climate change. The regional response of the northern tropical Atlantic is important because the tropical Atlantic Ocean is a large source of heat and moisture to the global climate system that can feedback onto global climate patterns.\nThis study presents new coral Sr/Ca and δ18O data from the northern tropical Atlantic (Anegada, British Virgin Islands). Comparison of the sub-fossil corals that grew during the 13th and 14th Centuries with modern coral geochemical data from this site indicates relatively cooler mean conditions with a decrease in the oxygen isotopic composition of the water consistent with lower salinities. Similar average annual cycles between modern and sub-fossil Sr/Ca indicate no change in seasonal temperature range, but a difference in the relative phasing of the δ18O seasonal cycles indicates that the fresher mean conditions may be due to a more northerly position of the regional salinity front. This localized response is consistent with some, but not all of the expected regional responses to a La Niña-like state, a +NAO state, and increased AMOC. Understanding these differences can provide insight into the relative importance of advection versus surface fluxes for heat and salt balances at the study site. Ultimately the data support the existing framework for understanding climate during the MCA and demonstrate the importance of regional processes in understanding historic and future climate patterns.",

Given the importance of ET, it is necessary to understand how ET changes under a warming climate. Towards this goal, the GFDL climate model (FLOR) is first used to understand the current-day ET climatology. The standard model and a flux-adjusted version of FLOR are both used to examine ET climatology. The operational cyclone phase space method is used to define the onset and completion times of ET. The ET climatology from the climate model is compared with those from two reanalysis data sets ranging from 1979 to 2012. Both models exhibit good skills at simulating the frequency map of phase space diagram. The flux-adjusted version shows much better skill in capturing the ET climatology in terms of ET track patterns, ET locations and monthly ET variations. The model is able to simulate the frequency ratio of reintensified tropical cyclones from all ET cases. Future work involves examining changes in the ET climatology under a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Alaskan arctic and boreal ecosystems are of global importance owing to their sensitivity and feedbacks to directional climate change. Wildfires are a primary driver of boreal carbon balance, and altered fire regimes may significantly impact global climate through the release of stored carbon and changes to surface albedo. Paleoecological records provide a window to how these systems respond to change by revealing climatic and disturbance variability throughout the Holocene. These long-term records highlight the sensitivity of fire regimes to climate and vegetation change, including responses to the relatively warm Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), and the relatively cool Little Ice Age (LIA). Over millennial timescales, boreal forests and arctic tundra have been resilient to climate change, but continued directional climate change may result in novel vegetation compositions and fire regimes, with potentially significant implications for global climate.\nHere we present a spatiotemporal synthesis of 22 published sediment-charcoal records from three Alaskan ecoregions. We add to this network eight records collected in June 2015 from an additional ecoregion. Variability in fire return intervals (FRIs) was quantified within and among ecoregions and climatic periods spanning the past 2 millennia, based on a peak analysis representing local fire events. Preliminary results suggest that fire regimes were responsive to centennial-scale climatic shifts, including the MCA and LIA, but the degree of sensitivity varies by ecoregion. Over the past 2000 years, FRIs were shortest during the MCA, indicating the potential for climate warming to promote high rates of burning. FRIs in tundra regions of northwestern Alaska and in interior boreal forests were 20% shorter during the MCA than during the LIA, and 25% shorter in boreal forest in the south-central Brooks Range. Burning was likely promoted during the warmer, drier MCA through lower fuel moisture. Quantifying fire-regime response to climate forcing across multiple ecoregions helps reveal the mechanisms that connect fire and climate in Alaskan ecosystems.",

Numerous factors may contribute as to why few URMs choose geoscience careers.\nTo address the underrepresentation of URMs in the geosciences 1992, the Cooperative Developmental Energy Program (CDEP) of Fort Valley State University (FVSU) and the College of Geosciences at the University of Oklahoma (OU) implemented a 3 + 2 dual degree program specifically in geology and geophysics. Since 1992, FVSU-CDEP has added the University of Texas at Austin (2004), Pennsylvania State University (2005), University of Arkansas (2010), and the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (2015) as partners to offer degrees in geology and geophysics. The dual degree programs consist of students majoring in chemistry or mathematics at FVSU for the first three years and transferring to one of the above partnering universities for years four and five to major in geology or geophysics. Upon completion of the program, students receive a BS degree in chemistry or mathematics from FVSU and a BS degree in geology or geophysics from a partnering university. \nCDEP has been responsible for recruiting 33 URMs who have earned BS degrees in geology or geophysics. Females constitute 50% of the graduates which is higher than the national average. Also, 56% of these graduates have earned the MS degree and 6% have earned the Ph.D. Currently, 60% of these graduates are employed with oil and gas companies; 20% work for academia; 12% work for governmental agencies; 6 % are professionals with environmental firms; and 2% of the graduate’s employment is unknown.\n ",

We will also compare the temporal structure of microburst episodes between events and between payloads at different geographic locations, specifically with respect to the region of the south atlantic anomaly. This will allow us to consider the effect of temporal dispersion due to particle drift for particles near but outside of the bounce loss cone and within the drift loss cone. We will investigate whether the common, soft, apparently non-bursty precipitation events observed by balloons might be drifted microburst precipitation, and therefore also generated by the same source as the very structured microbursts.",

            "abstract": "High-pressure and high-temperature in situ experiments have revealed behaviors of the earth and planetary constituents under extreme conditions, and contribute to progress our understandings about physical and chemical structure of planetary interiors. These in situ techniques have developed with the third-generation synchrotron radiation facilities such as APS, ESRF, and SPring-8 mainly using large volume presses and diamond anvil cells. In addition to the synchrotron light source, recently X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facilities have been developed as LCLS and SACLA. The brilliant and extremely short-pulsed XFELs make it possible to carry out femto-second time-resolve measurements, and to observe materials under dynamic/shock compression clearly. Techniques using high-power laser and XFEL are expected to be a next-generation experimental platform, and a pump-probe measurement system using high-power lasers and XFEL was installed at BL3EH5 in SPring-8/SACLA interoperable experimental facility. The system is composed of 45 TW <ns short-pulse laser, 2-dimentional <μm X-ray focusing system (KB mirrors), vacuumed sample chamber, and the MPCCD detector developed for the 10-fs ultra-short pulsed XFEL light source. The high-power laser enables us to generate up to 100 GPa for metal, simple oxide, and natural/synthesized mineral samples. Samples are mounted on sample holders and aligned at the center of the vacuum chamber using a 4-axis Goniometer head. In this presentation, we will overview the experimental setups and typical results of current pump-probe system using XFEL in SACLA.",

            "abstract": "In situuse of Raman spectroscopy on Mars is planned for three different instruments in the next decade. Although implementations differ, they share the potential to identify surface minerals and organics and inform Martian geology and geochemistry. Their success depends on the availability of appropriate databases and software for phase identification. For this project, we have consolidated all known publicly-accessible Raman data on minerals for which independent confirmation of phase identity is available, and added hundreds of additional spectra acquired using varying instruments and laser energies.\nUsing these data, we have developed software tools to improve mineral identification accuracy. For pure minerals, whole-spectrum matching algorithms far outperform existing tools based on diagnostic peaks in individual phases. Optimal matching accuracy does depend on subjective end-user choices for data processing (such as baseline removal, intensity normalization, and intensity squashing), as well as specific dataset characteristics. So, to make this tuning process amenable to automated optimization methods, we developed a machine learning-based generalization of these choices within a preprocessing and matching framework. Our novel method dramatically reduces the burden on the user and results in improved matching accuracy.\nMoving beyond identifying pure phases into quantification of relative abundances is a complex problem because relationships between peak intensity and mineral abundance are obscured by complicating factors: exciting laser frequency, the Raman cross section of the mineral, crystal orientation, and long-range chemical and structural ordering in the crystal lattices. Solving this un-mixing problem requires adaptation of our whole-spectrum algorithms and a large number of test spectra of minerals in known volume proportions, which we are creating for this project. Key to this effort is acquisition of spectra from mixtures of pure minerals paired with a standard reference (diamond); the ratios of their peak areas are independent of laser energy and normalization techniques and are analogous to molar absorptivities. With these test data and our advanced algorithms, quantitative estimates of mineral modes can be accurately derived from Raman spectra of mixtures.",

            "abstract": "Mitigating climate change requires increasing the amount of electricity that is generated from renewable energy technologies and while simultaneously reducing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that is emitted to the atmosphere from present energy and industrial facilities. We investigated the efficacy of generating electricity using renewable geothermal heat that is extracted by CO2 that is sequestered in sedimentary basins. To determine the efficacy of CO2-Geothermal power production in the United States, we conducted a geospatial resource assessment of the combination of subsurface CO2 storage capacity and heat flow in sedimentary basins and developed an integrated systems model that combines reservoir modeling with power plant modeling and economic costs. The geospatial resource assessment estimates the potential resource base for CO2-Geothermal power plants, and the integrated systems model estimates the physical (e.g., net power) and economic (e.g., levelized cost of electricity, capital cost) performance of an individual CO2-Geothermal power plant for a range of reservoir characteristics (permeability, depth, geothermal temperature gradient). Using coupled inverted five-spot injection patterns that are common in CO2-enhanced oil recovery operations, we determined the well pattern size that best leveraged physical and economic economies of scale for the integrated system. Our results indicate that CO2-Geothermal plants can be cost-effectively deployed in a much larger region of the United States than typical approaches to geothermal electricity production. These cost-effective CO2-Geothermal electricity facilities can also be capacity-competitive with many existing baseload and renewable energy technologies over a range of reservoir parameters. For example, our results suggest that, given the right combination of reservoir parameters, LCOEs can be as low as $25/MWh and capacities can be as high as a few hundred MW.",

            "abstract": "Icebergs form along coasts at the glacier ice-ocean interface through calving. It is critical that we understand the effects of Antarctic calving in a changing climate. One such effect is that of iceberg scouring: If icebergs are thick enough, they can run aground, leaving scours in the seabed. One recent study relied on radar altimetry to construct hypothetical Antarctic iceberg keel depths, linking them to three different types of parent ice. The purpose of this study is to determine the average water depths at which real scours—digitized from multibeam sonar bathymetry data—occur for several sections of the seafloor off of West Antarctica and compare the depths with those generated by the earlier study. Depth analyses for scours seaward of the Ross Ice Shelf, Getz Ice Shelf, and Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and in the northeast Bellingshausen Sea indicate a substantial difference from the projected radar altimetry results. All six areas register average depths greater than 450 meters. For five of the six areas examined, the observed scours occur at deeper water depths on average than would the scours projected by the radar altimetry study. This difference holds for four of those five areas even after the application of a 130-meter sea-level correction—an upper-bound estimate for the sea-level drop associated with the Last Glacial Maximum. This suggests a fundamental dissimilarity between the projected calving dimensions and those of the icebergs responsible for the scours examined here. As iceberg geometry is primarily controlled by parent ice mass thickness, we can also extend this difference to the source ice in each study. These results allow us to make inferences about iceberg life cycles, trajectories, and grounding patterns off of West Antarctica. They can help scientists better understand patterns of mass loss and freshwater input into the Southern Ocean, processes that ultimately lead to sea-level rise.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed Rayleigh and Love wave data from distant earthquakes recorded by 36 broadband stations that were operated in two years in the NE Tibetan Plateau. Phase velocity variations were determined in a period range of 20 to 91 s for Love wave and 20 to 100 s for Rayleigh wave using a two-plane-wave method, which can accounts for non-planar energy in the incoming wave field caused by structures outside the study area. 3-D shear wave velocity and radial anisotropy models were constructed from the obtained Rayleigh and Love wave dispersions. The mid-lower crust is characterized by strong positive anisotropy (VSH>VSV) beneath the Qilian-Qinling Orogen and relative weak radial anisotropy beneath the Kunlun Mountains. The mantle above 90 km is largely isotropic while positive anisotropy increases gradually with depth below 90 km, which probably marks the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). In contrast, shear wave velocity does not show an obvious reduction at 90 km and fails to detect the LAB. A low shear wave velocity anomaly and relatively negative radial anisotropy are imaged in the entire lithosphere under the Kunlun restraining bend, indicating a weak lithosphere under compressional deformation. The asthenosphere here is characterized by significantly lower velocity and stronger positive anisotropy than the surrounding region, suggesting a warmer and weaker asthenosphere block. Our observations are consistent with a geologic model in which the lithosphere under the restraining bend was thickened and subsequently delaminated, and the warm asthenosphere then filled up the space left by the delamination.",

The scatterometer wind data data have had major operational impact in:\na) determining wind warning areas for mid-latitude systems (gale, storm,hurricane force);\nb) determining tropical cyclone 34-knot and 50-knot wind radii.\nc) tracking the center location of tropical cyclones, including the initial identification of their formation.\nd) identifying and warning of extreme gap and jet wind events at all latitudes.\ne) identifying the current location of frontal systems and high and low pressure centers.\nf) improving coastal surf and swell forecasts\nMuch has been learned about the importance and utility of satellite OSVW data in operational weather forecasting and warning by exploiting OSVW research satellites in near real-time. Since December 1999 when first data from QuikSCAT scatterometer became available in near real time NOAA operations have been benefiting from ASCAT scatterometer observations on MetOp-A and B, Indian OSCAT scatterometer on OceanSat-3 and lately NASA’s RapidScat mission on International Space Station. With oceans comprising over 70 percent of the earth’s surface, the impacts of these data have been tremendous in serving society’s needs for weather and water information and in supporting the nation’s commerce with information for safe, efficient, and environmentally sound transportation and coastal preparedness. The satellite OSVW experience that has been gained over the past decade by users in the operational weather community allows for realistic operational OSVW requirements to be properly stated for future missions.\nSuccessful model of transitioning research data into operation implemented by Ocean Winds Team in NOAA’s NESDIS/STAR office and subsequent data impacts will be presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "An aquaplanet experiment is performed to explore how representation of equatorial precipitation activities in a GCM depends on its horizontal resolution. The numerical model utilized is AFES, an AGCM optimized for the Earth Simulator (Ohfuchi et al 2004). For the sake of simplicity, we adopt no cumulus parametarizetion scheme, although large scale condensation scheme is retained. We compare the results with increasing horizontal resolution from T39 to T319. Other setups follows those of the CONTROL case of the Aqua Planet Experiment (APE) Project (Neale and Hoskins, 2000; Blackburn and Hoskins, 2013). We can identify two kinds of resolution dependences; one is zonal and the other is meridional.\nZonally, at lower horizontal resolution, precipitation occurs as disturbances with the scale of a few gridpints, and propagate both eastward and westward. As the resolution increases, zonal scale of precipitation disturbances decreases, and there appears a hierarchical structure: grid scale disturbances move westward, while they are organized into eastward moving, Kelvin wave like envelopes. The westward motion of grid scale precipitation structure can be related to the advection of inhomogeniety of moisture by the zonal mean wind.\nAnother kind of large scale organization identified is the north-south \"zigzag\" structure of the distribution of grid scale precipitation disturbances, which has zonal wavenumber two and propagates westward. This structure appear only when the model can resolve the moist equatorial radius of deformation, and can be interpreted as moist mixed-Rossby gravity wave. The Mixed-Rossby gravity wave and the Kelvin wave like structure occur superposed to each other.\nFeatures similar to the above can also be noted in some of the AGCM runs with cumuls parameterizations in the APE (Blackburn et al, 2013; Williamson et al 2013; Nakajima et al 2013).\nAcknowledgement:\nNumerical experiments were performed at the Earth Simulator, JAMSTEC.",

            "abstract": "Several boulders located at the bases of the North and South Massifs were among the primary field targets of the Apollo 17 mission to the Taurus-Littrow Valley on the Moon [1]. Some boulders are polylithologic, including Boulder 1 at Station 2 and the boulders at Stations 6 and 7. These boulders were the subjects of consortium studies [2, 3] that included 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to determine the ages of distinct lithologies within each boulder [e.g., 4-6]. We report new 40Ar/39Ar data for the impact melt breccias 72255, 76315, 77075, and 77135 obtained using the UV laser ablation microprobe (UVLAMP) methods of [7]. For 72255, we obtained a preliminary isochron date ca. 3814 Ma from 22 melt analyses, which is younger than published plateau dates (e.g., 3951-3835 Ma [4, 8]). Fifteen melt analyses of 76315 yield a preliminary isochron date ca. 3850 Ma, younger than the 3900 ± 16 Ma date reported by [8]. Melt analyses of 77075 yield preliminary dates between ca. 3797-3584 Ma, possibly reflecting partial loss of 40Ar. In this case, the oldest date may provide a minimum age for the formation of melt in 77075. Finally, the UVLAMP dates for the 77135 melt range from 3810-3361 Ma and corresponding Ca/K ratios range from ca. 100-6. Electron microprobe analyses of small (ca. 10s of microns wide) pockets of K-rich materials show that both K-rich glass and K-feldspar are present. The UVLAMP dates for 77135 likely reflect spatially variable 40Ar loss, consistent with published step heating results [e.g., 6]. ",

            "abstract": "Many climate scientists and boundary organizations have accumulated years of experience providing decision support for climate adaptation related to landscape change. The Great Lakes Integrated Sciences + Assessments (GLISA) is one such organization that has developed a reputation for providing stakeholders with climate change decision support throughout the Great Lakes region of North America. After five years of applied outreach, GLISA climate scientists working with practitioners identified three common limitations across projects that were slowing down the use of information, describing them as mismatched terminology, unrealistic expectations, and disordered integration. Discussions with GLISA-affiliated social scientists revealed compelling parallels between these observations and the existing social science literature on the persistent “usability gap” in information use as well as opportunities to preemptively overcome these barriers. The discovery of these overlaps between the climate scientists’ experience of barriers and the social science literature as well as strategies to systematically address them demonstrate the potential for boundary organizations to act as incubators of more and more efficient co-production over time. To help illustrate these findings, this presentation also provides an example of decision-making for adaptation in the face of landscape change in which GLISA scientists assisted Isle Royale National Park with assessing the implications of future ecological transitions for current wildlife management efforts.",

            "abstract": "The Astrobiology Habitable Environments Database (AHED) is a central, high quality, long-term searchable repository for archiving and collaborative sharing of astrobiologically relevant data, including, morphological, textural and contextural images, chemical, biochemical, isotopic, sequencing, and mineralogical information. The aim of AHED is to foster long-term innovative research by supporting integration and analysis of diverse datasets in order to: 1) help understand and interpret planetary geology; 2) identify and characterize habitable environments and pre-biotic/biotic processes; 3) interpret returned data from present and past missions; 4) provide a citable database of NASA-funded published and unpublished data (after an agreed-upon embargo period). AHED uses the online open-source software “The Open Data Repository’s Data Publisher” (ODR -\nhttp://www.opendatarepository.org\n) [1], which provides a user-friendly interface that research teams or individual scientists can use to design, populate and manage their own database according to the characteristics of their data and the need to share data with collaborators or the broader scientific community. This platform can be also used as a laboratory notebook. The database will have the capability to import and export in a variety of standard formats. Advanced graphics will be implemented including 3D graphing, multi-axis graphs, error bars, and similar scientific data functions together with advanced online tools for data analysis (e. g. the statistical package, R). A permissions system will be put in place so that as data are being actively collected and interpreted, they will remain proprietary. A citation system will allow research data to be used and appropriately referenced by other researchers after the data are made public. This project is supported by the Science-Enabling Research Activity (SERA) and NASA NNX11AP82A, Mars Science Laboratory Investigations.\n[1] Nate et al. (2015) AGU, submitted.",
